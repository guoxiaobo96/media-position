{"original": "there's been ample coverage of how january's snowstorms led to widespread disruption of the nation's commercial aviation system, which airline tracking sites confirmed led to more than 12,000 canceled flights. we've seen the requisite video of empty airport terminals, and heard how vacations were disrupted and business trips were scrapped."}
{"original": "but while such disorder can be frustrating and expensive for adult travelers, consider how flight disruptions can affect unaccompanied minors as young as five years old. allowing your child to fly alone is a choice that ultimately is up to each family, so understanding all the policies, procedures and risks is critical."}
{"original": "what's more, there have been some changes made to the airlines' um programs in recent years, and of course there are new fees — and fee hikes — for those who want their kids to travel alone. in addition to the fare, there's now a charge of $300 round-trip on the big three carriers."}
{"original": "among u.s. scheduled passenger airlines, only allegiant doesn't accept unaccompanied minors, and prohibits travelers under 15 from flying alone. as for the 10 largest domestic carriers, there are key differences in ages, fees and other policies, so it's critical to review the airline's rules (see below)."}
{"original": "last month, united altered its um policy, so that it now covers children five to 15 rather than five to 12. united therefore matched american's and delta's age requirements, and the big three all charge the same fee of $150 each way."}
{"original": "in researching past policies, i found that about 15 years ago, all u.s. airlines cut off their um programs for kids who had reached 11, 12 or 14. cynics might be forgiven for concluding the trend toward expanding the upward age limits to 15 and 17 has coincided with the industry's ancillary fee revolution. that said, it should be noted there are considerable differences in such fees, ranging from a low of $25 on alaska to a high of the aforementioned $150 on american, delta and united."}
{"original": "consider the following comparison (all fees based on one-way travel, per child):"}
{"original": "hawaiian: $35 within hawaii; $100 to/from north america"}
{"original": "virgin america: $75 short-haul; $100 medium-haul/long-haul; $125 mexico"}
{"original": "in addition to differences in fees, there are differences in rules concerning check-in, seating and prohibitions."}
{"original": "every year there are media reports about ums who are misplaced in the system; last summer it was an 11-year-old boy lost at newark liberty airport and his family alleged united airlines failed to provide a required escort. most of these stories end with a safe return after anxious moments. there have been lawsuits and media accounts documenting alleged molestation incidents on flights, but these are extremely rare statistically."}
{"original": "the concern is that not every airplane always arrives when and where it is scheduled. as someone who worked in airline flight operations, i know the risk of a flight being canceled or diverted is statistically unlikely. consider the u.s. department of transportation's most recent domestic airline delay statistics, which reflect november: during that month, 16% of domestic flights were delayed, while 1% were canceled and .2% were diverted to other airports."}
{"original": "thankfully, the odds of a flight not operating to its destination are quite small, but those odds increase exponentially during irregular operations like last week's snowstorms or during summer thunderstorms. and unfortunately, most kids fly during the summer and winter breaks. what's more, for a variety of reasons, commercial aircraft are sometimes forced to divert en route, as we saw last week when an american airlines flight from miami to milan encountered severe turbulence and landed in newfoundland, or this week after an alleged altercation between flight attendants."}
{"original": "the question is, are all parents and caregivers aware of the risks of canceled and diverted flights? ultimately the decision to allow a child to travel as a um is a personal one, and can only be made on an individual basis. but considering all the risks should be a part of such equations."}
{"original": "for those who are considering a um program, here are some key suggestions."}
{"original": "• fly early in the day. the chances of not reaching a destination generally increase as the day grows longer, so early is best. in addition, some airlines — such as delta — prohibit ums on redeye flights between 9 p.m. and 5 a.m."}
{"original": "• be clear about the differences between non-stop, direct and connecting flights, and don't confuse non-stop and direct (which generally includes stops but no change of aircraft). always select non-stops if they're available, even if they're more expensive, but realize that some itineraries will require connections. some airlines only allow younger ums to fly on non-stops, but others permit it, so it could be up to you to choose the best flight options."}
{"original": "• according to the dot, regional airlines operating on behalf of larger domestic carriers have higher percentages of delayed, canceled and diverted flights."}
{"original": "• an adult is generally allowed to accompany the child to the departure gate. but make sure the flight is airborne and en route before leaving."}
{"original": "• adults at both the departure and arrival airports should use airline apps to track the flight's progress in real time."}
{"original": "• discuss whether the child should carry a cellphone."}
{"original": "• policies vary, so inquire about the specifics: who will accompany the child onto and off the aircraft? where will the child sit? will other passengers be called upon to assist the child? upon arrival, should the child remain seated while all other passengers depart?"}
{"original": "there is no shortage of online advice for speaking to your child about what to expect, as well as tips for how to dress, what to pack, etc. (with some airlines, snacks are included in the um fee.) the dot has created when kids fly alone, a lengthy guide to understanding um policies. airsafe.com also offers safety tips. and airlines for america, the industry lobbying group, offers travel tips for ums as well."}

{"original": "the justice department's antitrust division leader sent a letter to ncaa president mark emmert on friday that expresses strong concerns about the association's direction on rules regarding athletes' ability to transfer and to make money from the use of their names, images and likenesses."}
{"original": "proposed changes in both areas are scheduled to be on the agenda of monday's meeting of the division i council and thursday's meeting of the division i board of directors."}
{"original": "but in the letter — a copy of which was obtained by usa today sports — assistant attorney general makan delrahim says one part of the ncaa's prospective approach to regulating athletes' involvement in name, image and likeness deals may raise concerns under the antitrust laws."}
{"original": "more generally addressing other rules that will remain in place, he wrote: ultimately, the antitrust laws demand that college athletes, like everyone else in our free market economy, benefit appropriately from competition."}
{"original": "delrahim took the additional step of addressing the ncaa's desire for congressional intervention now that six states have passed various name, image and likeness laws. the ncaa would like federal legislation requiring changes in the association's name, image and likeness rules to include protection from legal challenges to the alterations it makes as a result."}
{"original": "vote delay:ncaa votes on landmark name, image and likeness rules changes could be delayed"}
{"original": "while the division expresses no views on the need for any such legislation, delrahim wrote, should congress deem such legislative immunity necessary we would anticipate it will be the narrowest possible immunity and one that would contemplate a collective representation of college athletes' rights as a condition of any such immunity."}
{"original": "in an interview with usa today sports, delrahim said that he wrote the letter to emmert in connection with the upcoming ncaa meetings, as well as conversations between justice department officials and the ncaa that cover several years."}
{"original": "because we understand that the ncaa is considering changes to their rules, delrahim said, we want them to benefit from the antitrust division's views as part of our ongoing dialogue, so as to avoid any misunderstanding on what the law requires."}
{"original": "delrahim's views on the ncaa are not new. he has expressed them in various forums as far back as 2018. he is an appointee who will be leaving the justice department just before the upcoming inauguration of president-elect joe biden. but his letter includes a closing reference to david lawrence, a career official in the department who is chief of the competition policy and advocacy section. in the interview, delrahim also expressed confidence in the likelihood of a continuity of approach to the ncaa by the biden administration."}
{"original": "the transfer rule change would address the five remaining division i sports in which athletes generally are prohibited from playing for one year if they change schools. under the proposal, athletes in bowl subdivision football, men's and women's basketball, baseball and men's ice hockey would no longer have to sit out the first time they change schools."}
{"original": "but the letter takes issue with other aspects of the transfer process that are set to remain in place, and delrahim, referencing prior interactions between the department and the ncaa, wrote:"}
{"original": "our expectation is that our engagement with the ncaa over its transfer rules will … result in the ncaa's removal of unnecessary anticompetitive barriers that stand in the way of college athletes transferring between schools. of course, the division stands ready to enforce the antitrust laws if necessary."}
{"original": "athletes must notify their current school of their intention to transfer before contacting, or being contacted by, another school. and once athletes provide notice of their intent to transfer, ncaa rules allow schools to reduce or cancel their financial aid at the end of the ongoing academic term — or immediately if notice is given between academic terms."}
{"original": "thus, delrahim wrote, college athletes must risk losing their current scholarship – not to mention alienating their coaches — in order even to explore the possibility of transferring to a new school. the ncaa ... should consider seriously whether these rules, taken together, unreasonably deter students from entering the transfer process and, as a result, leave college athletes without a competitive alternative to their current school."}
{"original": "delrahim's letter uses equally strong language in addressing not only the ncaa's proposed approach to name, image and likeness."}
{"original": "while the ncaa's proposed changes would give athletes new and significant abilities to make money from their name, image and likeness (nil) and other activities, they include various restrictions and would require athletes to disclose their name, image and likeness activities to what is described as an independent third-party administrator. while numerous details about this entity remain undefined, the ncaa's required statement of rationale for rules change says the disclosure requirements will ensure integrity of the recruiting process, and evaluate nil activities for possible malfeasance."}
{"original": "at issue is the prospect of athletes being offered deals that college athletics administrators say could be viewed as thinly veiled recruiting inducements."}
{"original": "delrahim wrote: pursuing a goal of promoting amateurism does not insulate the ncaa's rules from scrutiny under the antitrust laws. … the antitrust laws limit the ncaa's ability to restrict competition among college athletes, coaches, and schools. for example, if the ncaa adopted a rule that fixes the price at which students can license their nil, e.g., based on what the ncaa determines to be a 'fair' market value, such a rule may raise concerns under the antitrust laws."}
{"original": "in the interview, delrahim expanded on this idea in the more specific context of the proposed third-party administrator."}
{"original": "the devil will be in the details – who's on that board and who they answer to ... because who appoints them and what their points of view are can be outcome-determinative, he said. while we applaud efforts to increase integrity in the process, we must be very careful to ensure that a board does not operate as a backdoor way to limit competition. you know, athletic directors' and coaches' salaries are not subjected to such a process. we want to ensure that the ncaa imposes only the narrowest form of competitive restriction that is necessary."}

{"original": "low fares became southwest's calling card.with this emphasis, southwest eschewed first-class seating and maintained an egalitarian first-come, first-served seating policy that has persisted to today."}
{"original": "critics have labeled that boarding process as a cattle call, but southwest's fares won it many converts over its first three decades."}
{"original": "today in the sky:southwest airlines reveals five new routes as it extends schedule into fall"}
{"original": "southwest was known for aggressively pricing its cheapest seats, especially when it entered new markets. that forced incumbent carriers to match southwest's fares, sometimes running out established legacy rivals who couldn't turn a profit by matching southwest's fares."}
{"original": "it was a new phenomenon for the u.s. airline industry as it shifted from a time of heavy regulation into the modern era that resulted from 1978's airline deregulation act."}
{"original": "when southwest entered new markets, its presence was so pronounced that the u.s. transportation department coined the term the southwest effect in a 1993 report that looked at the effect expanding low-cost carriers were having on airfares."}
{"original": "today in the sky:southwest says 'southwest effect' still going strong"}
{"original": "southwest, aided by advantageous fuel-hedging contracts, continued to bill itself as the usa's low-fare leader into the current decade. but today it faces leaner competitors in american, delta and united, all of which have pared costs in bankruptcy filings since 1978. today, those carriers typically match or even undercut southwest's fares."}
{"original": "but southwest's low-fare approach has spawned a new wave of ultra low-cost carriers (ulccs). the airlines, which include u.s. carriers spirit, frontier and allegiant, are growing today using many of the tactics pioneered by southwest."}
{"original": "southwest's open-seating concept never caught among at its u.s. competitors, but several of its other low-fare selling points have."}
{"original": "southwest famously offered peanuts instead of full-service meals that were standard in decades past. southwest's insinuation was that customers booking its cheapest fares were essentially flying for peanuts – making the lack of meals worth the trade-off."}
{"original": "when southwest announced earlier this year that it would stop serving peanuts to help protect passengers who have severe peanut allergies, the move made national news since the carrier was nixing a snack that was been nearly synonymous with southwest itself."}
{"original": "even southwest's lack of first-class seating offered another no-frills template for modern low-cost carriers. a number of low-cost carriers have emulated southwest's coach-only approach, with european giant ryanair among the most prominent."}
{"original": "in pictures: 30 cool aviation photos (story continues below)"}
{"original": "kelleher's southwest capitalized on efficiency like few other airlines of its time."}
{"original": "for starters, southwest used only one type of aircraft: the boeing 737. by sticking to a single aircraft type, southwest has reduced complexity on everything from maintenance and training to route planning. southwest's boeing 737-only fleet plan has continued to today, though it briefly had boeing 717s in its fleet following its 2010 acquisition of airtran airways."}
{"original": "another southwest hallmark was the 10-minute turn, a reference to how long a plane would stay at a gate between flights. the quicker a plane could get back in the air, the more flights (and revenue) could be squeezed into southwest's schedule."}
{"original": "our planes pull into the jetways, board passengers and pull out again in 10 minutes or less, kelleher said in a 1982 commercial where he's walking toward a southwest flight only to have the cabin door close without him."}
{"original": "of course, the 10-minute-turn was an ambitious goal even decades ago. today, southwest's turn times have increased as it has grown and expanded into increasingly congested airports, but the airline still attempts some of the quickest turns in the industry."}
{"original": "southwest bucked another industry trend by using a point-to-point route network for its flights. that's instead of the more common hub-and-spoke method used by modern airlines where most passengers flying between mid-sized and small markets must fly to a big airline hub to connect to their final destination."}
{"original": "instead, southwest simply added flights between cities where it thought it could make money, often flying many flights throughout the day. that didn't mean southwest flyers didn't connect, but it wasn't over a hub."}
{"original": "by spreading its flight schedules over a national network southwest was able to spread its costs and resources more evenly. as southwest has grown, it does have some cities that essentially function as hubs. still, southwest refuses to call any of its busiest bases a hub – a holdover in thinking that persists from kelleher's days."}
{"original": "if your preferred airport is a so-called secondary airport, you can thank kelleher's southwest for bringing them into the mainstream."}
{"original": "those types of airports – think chicago midway instead of chicago o'hare or oakland instead of san francisco – were a staple of southwest's growth under kelleher."}
{"original": "in fact, southwest's history is inextricably tied to the secondary airport in its hometown: dallas love field. the airline initially began flying in 1971 with service between three cities within texas (dallas love, houston and san antonio), its status as an intra-texas airline shielding it from federal commercial airline restrictions that existed at the time."}
{"original": "in 1974, the new dallas/fort worth international (dfw) airport opened. it was intended to be a single major hub serving the metro area, but southwest resisted, figuring its business model based on short, frequent flights would be disrupted if dallas customers had to make a longer drive to dfw. this turned into a decades-long battle to expand access at love field."}
{"original": "beyond love field, however, secondary airports were key to southwest's growth strategy from its founding well into the 2000s. the less-congested airports typically did not suffer as many money-sucking delays as their bigger counterparts; some also offered lower operating costs."}
{"original": "instead of chicago o'hare, southwest picked midway when it expanded to chicago in 1985. when southwest first expanded into the northeast in the 1990s, it picked airports like baltimore (instead of washington reagan or dulles) and providence, rhode island, and manchester, new hampshire (instead of boston). even in the new york city area, southwest's 1999 debut came at long island's macarthur airport – a development that revitalized the then-sleepy airport located about 55 miles from midtown manhattan."}
{"original": "while southwest pioneered that trend in the u.s. under kelleher, the airline has moved away from that as it has become one of the world's biggest. southwest is still the dominant airline at chicago midway and houston hobby, but it is increasingly seeking out primary airports popular with business travelers. today, southwest flies from both san francisco and oakland. its presence at long island/macarthur has shrunk while it has expanded at new york laguardia and newark liberty. similarly, southwest's addition of boston in 2009 foretold eventual schedule reductions in nearby providence and manchester."}
{"original": "but southwest's secondary-airport strategy lives on in the u.s. budget carriers of today, as anyone who has flown spirit from niagara falls, new york (instead of buffalo), or allegiant from mesa, arizona (instead of phoenix), can attest."}

{"original": "when we moved from 75 yen up to 120, many executives were saying, 'i don't believe it's going to stay there. it will be back at 75 in no time.' so they weren't spending on capital expenditures and they weren't increasing wages, smith said. so it was very important for the bank of japan to say, 'no, this 120 yen is where it's going to be and where it's going to stay.'"}

{"original": "the gun industry is holding its biggest annual trade show this week just a few miles from the site where a gunman slaughtered 58 concertgoers outside his high-rise las vegas hotel room in october using a display case worth of weapons, many fitted with bump stocks that enabled them to mimic fully automatic fire."}
{"original": "gun control advocates, meanwhile, pointed to the irony of the location and planned a protest to renew calls for tighter gun sale regulations, including expanded background checks."}
{"original": "we're trying to show the connection between the industry that makes all the money and the damage that their products cause, lee goodman, an organizer with chicago-based peaceful communities, said tuesday. his organization advocates for a rewrite of the constitutional second amendment right to own guns."}
{"original": "what exactly will be among the thousands of products crammed into the exhibition spaces at the national shooting sports foundation's shot show convention, running tuesday through friday, will be a bit of a mystery, shielded from the public and, this year, members of the general-interest media."}
{"original": "one thing is known: slide fire, the leading manufacturer of bump stocks, a once-obscure product that attracted intense attention in the aftermath of the deadliest mass shooting in modern u.s. history, won't be among the exhibitors."}
{"original": "the texas-based company hasn't said why it's not on the roster of more than 1,700 exhibitors, although it was last year. it didn't return messages seeking comment. the company also isn't on the list of those attending this year's national rifle association annual meeting or other prominent gun trade shows."}
{"original": "in the aftermath of the las vegas massacre oct. 1, slide fire had so much trouble keeping up with demand it temporarily stopped taking orders for the product. it has since resumed."}
{"original": "from purely a public relations standpoint, it wouldn't be a surprise at all if bump stocks just sort of disappeared this year, said robert spitzer, chairman of political science at the state university of new york at cortland and an expert on firearms and the second amendment. that's a pr no-brainer."}
{"original": "still, the convention floor is likely to have plenty of other devices that gun-control advocates have taken aim at in recent years: accessories that make it easier to carry a firearm, shoot it or reduce the noise it makes."}
{"original": "on the list of products they oppose are trigger cranks, which, like bump stocks, make it easier to fire a long gun rapidly, and assault pistols, which look remarkably like short-barreled ar- and ak-style firearms but skirt certain federal restrictions because they aren't designed to be shot from the shoulder."}

{"original": "for a person from the general public, i think the thing that would startle them the most about the shot show … is just the sheer scope and the vastness of this show, said david chipman, a former agent with the federal agency that regulates firearms and now a senior policy adviser with the gun safety organization founded by former rep. gabby giffords, who was gravely wounded in a shooting in 2012."}
{"original": "shot show has been held for 40 years, half that time in las vegas, and this year's gathering was scheduled well before the bloodshed last fall. it will have some 13 miles of aisles featuring products from more than 1,700 companies. more than 65,000 visitors are expected at the gathering, a place where connections are made and deals worth millions are struck."}
{"original": "the general public is not allowed to roam the aisles; the only people who can attend are those with direct ties to the industry: manufacturers and dealers of firearms or associated products. although a few reporters from general-interest news organizations attended in recent years, nssf this year restricted access to about 2,500 journalists from trade publications and media."}

{"original": "we do almost nothing for victims, whose only fault in this case was to attend a concert, she said."}

{"original": "michael bazinet, nssf director of public affairs, said that while those attending are well aware of the tragedy that occurred nearby, they also know that legal gun ownership and the lawful commerce of arms is something quite removed from the act of an individual such as this. and that's not to diminish the tragedy at all. but people come to the show do make that distinction."}
{"original": "the show comes as the gun industry's fortunes have waned after nearly a decade of unprecedented sales. no longer concerned about the federal government restricting gun rights, americans have scaled back their firearm-buying sprees."}
{"original": "when shot show, which stands for shooting, hunting and outdoor trade, was launched, its emphasis was on hunting and the outdoors. over the decades, it has evolved and grown and now has huge sections devoted to the law enforcement and military community. no sales are allowed at the show, firing pins are removed from all guns on display, and there is no live ammunition."}

{"original": "pittsburgh (ap) — as a general philosophy, pittsburgh steelers coach mike tomlin treats each individual season as its own unique entity, with no direct through line from one to the next."}
{"original": "considering his quarterback's current state of mind, probably a good idea."}
{"original": "while tomlin believes the steelers have a championship caliber team a couple days removed from an ugly blowout loss to new england in the afc title game, his franchise's most important player isn't guaranteeing a return in 2017. roethlisberger said during his weekly appearance on 93.7 the fan that he needs time to reflect before coming back for a 14th season."}
{"original": "i'm going to take this offseason to evaluate, to consider all options, to consider health and family and things like that and just kind of take some time away to evaluate next season, if there's going to be a next season, all those things, roethlisberger said."}
{"original": "roethlisberger will turn 35 in march and is under contract through 2020. knee injuries have forced him to miss time in each of the last two seasons and while pittsburgh ripped off nine straight wins on its way to the afc north title and its first appearance in the nfl's final four in six years, roethlisberger wasn't terribly sharp. he threw 10 interceptions over pittsburgh's final seven games, though the two-time super bowl winner didn't receive much help on sunday against the patriots, as dropped passes, a groin injury to running back le'veon bell and occasionally questionable playcalling — not to mention tom brady at the peak of his powers — played significant factors in the worst postseason loss of his career."}
{"original": "while roethlisberger cautioned he's not by any means saying he's not coming back, the father of three considered it prudent to take a step back before deciding if he has the energy to make another push."}
{"original": "that's fine by tomlin, who wasn't alarmed by roethlisberger's admission mostly because they've had similar discussions in the past."}
{"original": "that's football, tomlin said. obviously i'm hopeful that he returns and the potential of his return or not returning will weigh heavily on our planning. that's life. he's the most significant component of what it is that we do. we'll plan and react accordingly."}
{"original": "roethlisberger is one of three steelers remaining from the team that beat seattle in the super bowl 11 years ago. the exodus includes tight end and roethlisberger's longtime friend heath miller, who retired last february at age 33."}
{"original": "it seems unlikely roethlisberger — who has three seasons left on the five-year, $100 million deal he signed in march 2015 — would walk away considering the steelers (13-6) figure to be in the mix again next season. wide receiver antonio brown is still under contract, bell will become a free agent but is expected to stick around and martavis bryant will be eligible for reinstatement after missing all of 2016 for violating the nfl's substance abuse policy. the offensive line that allowed roethlisberger to be sacked just 17 times in 14 games will remain intact."}
{"original": "there's plenty to be optimistic about. and the oddsmakers don't seem concerned about roethlisberger's intentions, making the steelers the early second choice (along with green bay) to reach next year's super bowl in minneapolis."}
{"original": "some other takeaways as tomlin put the finishing touches on a successful if not triumphant year."}
{"original": "battered bell: tomlin said bell had been dealing with the groin injury that limited him to just six carries against the patriots for some time but that the all-pro had found a way to manage it without missing practice. tomlin said he didn't feel the problem was significant enough to put bell on the nfl-mandated injury report, pointing out the entire team could be placed on the report due to various bumps and bruises associated with playing four-plus months."}
{"original": "brown needs to deliver: tomlin downplayed the notion that brown needs to become a more mature player even though tomlin publicly chastised brown's decision to livestream portions of the locker room celebration following a divisional round victory over kansas city. he's a dynamic player (and) there are responsibilities that come with being a dynamic player, said tomlin, who added outlining the responsibilities is normal operating business for all players."}
{"original": "see you in 2017?: linebacker james harrison will become a free agent in march and turns 39 in may but has already publicly talked about making another run."}
{"original": "second guessing: tomlin became the eighth coach to win 100 games in his first 10 seasons, remarkable in most places, but maybe not in pittsburgh. it's a standard tomlin embraces. my goal was to be world champs and we weren't that, tomlin said. you can describe that in whatever way you choose to. in that vein i've only been successful one time in 10 years and i'm ok with that."}

{"original": "some analysis, built on conventional market principles, sees the cause of this tension as ongoing conflict in the middle east — these analysts now await a strong reaction from russia to change trends. however, as the international energy agency (iea) notes, the explanation may be more unconventional."}
{"original": "since oil prices surpassed $70 per barrel on friday, much international analysis narrows the cause to tensions in the middle east — or more precisely, iraq's decision to join opec's agreement to rein in output and ongoing conflict. jabbar ali hussein al-luiebi, iraq's oil minister, announced his country's decision to join opec's agreement with other suppliers to rein in output until the end of 2018. the deal should continue, he said. the market now is stabilizing somehow, but it's not yet stable."}
{"original": "despite iranian oil minister bijan namdar zanganeh previously stating that members of opec are not keen on increased brent crude prices above $60 a barrel because of shale oil, so far no immediate policy shift came from opec on friday before markets closed. many analysts, putting the middle east at the heart of the cause, also projected that tension and the afrin operation might push prices up to $80 per barrel."}

{"original": "ed morse, citigroup's global head of commodities research, told bloomberg he doesn't know how opec will react, but he seemed confident regarding russia's reaction. he expects russia to call for a pause in the agreement during opec's summer meeting, as rising oil prices are endangering the ruble, and the russian central bank is already considering an intervention."}
{"original": "however, the iea's 2017 world energy outlook projected that china will overtake the united states as the world's largest oil consumer around 2030, as well as predicting the u.s. shale revolution will turn the country toward export, making the u.s. a net oil exporter by 2020. that said, the iea estimates prices for oil will remain in the $50–70/barrel range — suggesting that, even if the u.s. does become an energy exporter (as predicted), this will not be a game-changer for the u.s. economy."}
{"original": "based on that projection, in his bloomberg interview, iea executive director fatih birol drew attention to the fact that opec's decisions today have a different nature than they did before the shale revolution. this is the new game in town, he noted."}
{"original": "indeed, birol's comment is clear. growing u.s. shale production will push down oil prices over the long term. the countries who did not see this happening, such as russia, now face severe economic challenges. the time of blaming middle east conflicts for oil price fluctuations or passively expecting a russian reaction seems to be ending, and it's time to begin replacing traditional energy analyses with unconventional ones."}

{"original": "an american mob constructed a gallows outside the capitol, carried a confederate flag through the sacred halls of democracy and placed improvised explosive devices at the headquarters of the republican and democratic national committees. inside the capitol, windows were smashed and offices ransacked. one attacker brought 11 molotov cocktails and an assault rifle, another stalked the senate floor with a fistful of flex-cuffs. ultimately, a police officer was killed and dozens of other officers were hurt."}
{"original": "the hundreds of trump supporters who stormed into the capitol were a fraction of the thousands who had marched there after the president exhorted them to do so. but their actions, and the presence of white supremacists and anti-government extremists scattered among those who remained outside, made manifest the documented and dangerous threat these domestic extremists have posed for decades. the discussions they are having online suggest this attack was intended to be independence day and the beginning of a second civil war."}
{"original": "biden inaugural is not the finish line"}
{"original": "while images of the u.s. capitol being overrun are terrifying, we should not be too surprised. extremist groups have been discussing and planning audacious attacks for some time. most recently, in october, the fbi stopped a plot by white supremacist and anti-government extremists to kidnap the michigan and virginia governors."}
{"original": "these and other wicked ideas are increasingly pervasive in online forums. extremists participating in these virtual communities are gleeful over the capitol attack and are using it to recruit members in advance of violence on inauguration day."}
{"original": "as a country, however, we should not see the inauguration of president-elect joe biden as a finish line, after which the extremist threat might seem to stand down. there is no finish line in homeland security. even when every person who participated in the washington, d.c., attack is identified, arrested, charged and convicted in accordance with the exiting president's own executive order, extremists will remain."}
{"original": "while the u.s. capitol was invaded, ominous protests in state capitals revealed the scope of this extremism. in salt lake city, 400 people converged on the utah capitol and a photojournalist was attacked. in georgia, about 100 people, some of them armed, prompted the secretary of state and his staff to evacuate. in st. paul, 500 people descended on the minnesota capitol, where a protester characterized the day as 1776 — the start of the american revolution."}

{"original": "as a nation, we need a nuanced strategy for addressing each violent ideology, hybrid derivative and group. part of that effort will be shoring up trust in information sources, public leaders and our very democracy. people need to understand where opinion ends and extremist ideology begins, and right now that is a nebulous line for too many. some american leaders have progressively dumbed down a significant portion of the american public, mixing news spin with half-truths and half-baked conspiracies. when people have no interest in education, real news, conducting research and inviting discussions with people of opposing views, they become the sheep for the violent shepherds' extremism."}

{"original": "the florida republican was an original member of the gang of eight, the bipartisan group of senators that crafted the last comprehensive immigration bill in 2013. it passed the senate but died when the gop-controlled house refused to take it up."}
{"original": "but rubio has not been involved in the latest immigration overhaul effort which is now starting to take shape on capitol hill at the prodding of president trump."}
{"original": "five of the original gang of eight, and one new republican senator, are now the focus of attention on capitol hill and they announced thursday they have the framework of a deal. members of the group presented an outline to president trump thursday, who did not endorse the plan."}
{"original": "white house spokeswoman sarah sanders said there is no deal yet, but we still think we can get there. it is also not clear house republicans are interested in accepting the work of a bipartisan senate working group."}
{"original": "we have a proposal in principle that we're sharing with our colleagues and i think there's gonna be a lot of interest, said sen. lindsey graham, r-s.c., who went to the white house thursday. i think that will matter to the president."}
{"original": "rubio downplays his absence from the various groups working on the issue, pointing out he does not sit on the judiciary committee, which handles immigration legislation. and he's encouraged others are getting involved, in hopes that it forges a broader solution both parties can get behind."}
{"original": "i'm glad that there are some new voices involved in this, he told reporters wednesday, pointing to gop sens. james lankford of oklahoma and thom tillis of north carolina who had been in some negotiations, though are not part of the bipartisan group of six. that's a positive development."}
{"original": "what rubio didn't mention was the heat he took from tea party stalwarts for getting involved in a bill four years ago that would have provided a path to citizenship for millions of undocumented immigrants living in the u.s. the effort landed him on the cover of time magazine with the heading the republican savior, no doubt further rankling conservatives."}
{"original": "some of those conservative activists never forgave him even after he endorsed a border-security-first approach proposed in the house, saying his support of what they viewed as amnesty in the senate bill was a betrayal they wouldn't forget."}
{"original": "when he ran for president in 2016, they didn't. instead, many opted for texas sen. ted cruz and billionaire donald trump, according to exit polls in states such as alabama, idaho, michigan and mississippi among others."}
{"original": "there's a lot of grassroots conservatives that refuse to forgive him on the gang of eight stuff on the last go around, said david bozell, president of the conservative organization foramerica."}
{"original": "bozell said that the issue wasn't that rubio tried to come up with a solution, but rather that he failed to sell it to conservatives. and, bozell adds, his fellow republicans abandoned him."}
{"original": "some capitol hill republicans deciding how far to go on immigration now are looking back at rubio's experience as a cautionary tale."}
{"original": "sen. rubio's fall from political favor came from prioritizing getting an immigration deal passed over getting a deal that was good for american wage-earners and communities, said roy beck, president of numbersusa which is a group that advocates for reduction in legal immigration. others in a rush to pass another amnesty at almost any cost should be chastened by the rubio story. "}
{"original": "rubio still believes in finding a solution for those immigrants, especially the dreamers who were brought to the u.s. illegally by their parents and view this country as their only home."}
{"original": "the latest congressional effort to solve the immigration issue was prompted by president trump's september announcement that he would end the deferred action for childhood arrivals (daca) program in march and begin wholesale deportations. trump gave congress six months to find a legislative solution for immigrants covered by daca, which was an executive action by former president barack obama."}
{"original": "i've long supported doing something on that front, rubio said last month. and really the debate in the republican conference is not whether to do something about it. i think the debate is what to do about it, how to do it. that's a shift from where we might have been two, four, six years ago. and i think that's true of the white house too, generally."}

{"original": "in extraordinary public negotiation with congress, trump promises to sign daca bill"}
{"original": "on daca, republican sen. thom tillis wants to find middle-ground"}
{"original": "but the debate regarding what provisions should be included in an immigration bill has pitted immigration hawks against more moderate members, of both parties — the same division that doomed the gang of eight compromise in 2013."}
{"original": "in addition to graham, sens. dick durbin, d-ill., jeff flake, r-ariz., michael bennet, d-colo., bob menendez, d-n.j., are former gang of eight members of the bipartisan group that claims to have the framework of a deal. sen. cory gardner, r-colo., who is also moderate on immigration has also been involved, rounding the group to six."}
{"original": "durbin, the senate's second most powerful democrat, is one of the most vocal proponents of a deal to protect daca recipients. he's also a member of a separate bipartisan group which includes texas sen. john cornyn (the second ranking republican in the senate), house majority leader kevin mccarthy of california, a republican, and his democratic counterpart, steny hoyer, of maryland."}
{"original": "on wednesday a group of conservative house republicans released an immigration bill, known as securing america's future act, that included daca protections on a renewable three-year basis. in exchange, the bill included a lengthy list of both internal and external immigration enforcement provisions and reduced overall immigration levels by 25%."}
{"original": "a statement from the white house said the legislation would accomplish the president's core priorities for the american people."}
{"original": "but house speaker paul ryan, r-wis., would not commit to bringing that bill to the house floor for a vote. instead, he said it's a constructive effort."}
{"original": "it's important that we start putting ideas on the table, ryan added."}
{"original": "rep. raul labrador, r-idaho, one of the bill's co-sponsors and a hard-line conservative, told usa today that the securing america's future act would be the only way legislation that included daca protections would be able to pass the house of representatives."}
{"original": "unlike the senate, which requires bipartisan compromise to pass legislation with 60 votes, the house can pass all-republican legislation if most members stick together."}
{"original": "labrador dismissed the bipartisan talks with the former gang of eight members as doing the same thing over and over but expecting different results."}
{"original": "you do know what the definition of insanity is right? labrador said. we have a republican president in the white house who made his entire campaign about border security so to use the same process that they used under a democratic president … that would be just completely futile in the house."}
{"original": "fewer than four in 10 americans could handle an unexpected $1,000 expense such as a medical bill or car repair, according to bankrate.com. that comes after the federal government has seeded the economy with trillions in stimulus funding, ranging from stimulus payments to extra unemployment aid."}
{"original": "without that help, it's likely that u.s. households would be in worse shape. the share of americans who could handle an unexpected $1,000 expense is slightly down from the year before – 39% in the most recent survey compared with 41% a year earlier, the survey of more than 1,000 people in mid-december found."}
{"original": "americans in the spring and summer of 2020 were able to set aside money in their savings accounts and pay down debt thanks to the financial boost from the coronavirus aid, relief, and economic security act (or the cares act). but by the end of 2020, personal disposable income had fallen sharply from the boost given by the cares act, according to a new analysis of financial data from the brookings institution's hamilton project."}

{"original": "job losses:economy loses 140,000 jobs in december as unemployment holds at 6.7% amid covid-19 spikes"}
{"original": "that means millions of households entered the winter months with less financial flexibility, even as the pandemic rages across the u.s. and employers cut jobs in december."}
{"original": "despite prospects for a much brighter end to 2021 than the beginning because of vaccinations, we have to get from here to there first, said greg mcbride, the chief financial analyst at bankrate.com. there will be a lot of economic weakness and financial hardship before then."}
{"original": "already, there are signs of rising hardship among some households. about 90 million adults, or almost 4 in 10, reported it was somewhat or very difficult for their households to pay their usual expenses in the past seven days, according to a new center on budget and policy priorities analysis of census data from mid-december. that represents a rise of 13 million adults since late august, the think tank said."}
{"original": "it's clear households were beginning to run on fumes by the end of the fall, said wendy edelberg, director of the hamilton project. that's one of the reasons why economists like me were screaming and yelling for congress to do more."}
{"original": "to be sure, the bankrate.com and census data took the temperature of financial health before the latest stimulus was passed, a $900 billion relief bill that is now distributing $600 stimulus payments to eligible adults and children, as well as providing an extra $300 in weekly unemployment aid. but those benefits provide half of the cares act's $1,200 in stimulus checks and $600 in weekly extra jobless aid."}
{"original": "the economic crisis isn't hitting all households equally; edelberg noted that people of color, women, families with young children and low-income workers are bearing the brunt of the downturn."}
{"original": "millennials were less likely than older generations to say they could handle a $1,000 emergency expense, bankrate.com found. fewer than 1 in 3 millennials, those 24 to 39 years old, said they could pay for an unexpected bill of that size, compared with almost half of baby boomers and generation xers, its survey found."}
{"original": "despite the hardship many households are experiencing, it's important to sock away some emergency savings if possible, bankrate.com's mcbride said. about 4 in 10 people who couldn't cover a $1,000 emergency bill would need to borrow the money, with many saying they would turn to credit cards, the study found. but that could saddle those households with high-interest debt, mcbride said."}
{"original": "setting up an automatic deposit that puts part of your paycheck into a savings account can help seed an emergency fund, mcbride noted. he also recommends putting aside a portion of your stimulus check or 2020 tax refund into a savings account."}
{"original": "more stimulus help may be needed to ensure households can regain their footing, especially as the $300 in extra jobless aid expires in mid-march and vaccines aren't likely to be widely distributed until summer, analysts said."}
{"original": "what i'm really worried about is not just the current crisis, which is so acute, but what households' financial situation looks like when we are on the other side of the pandemic, said edelberg of the hamilton project. for millions of households, finances are going to be a lot weaker."}
{"original": "just days before the ncaa is scheduled to consider landmark legislation to allow college athletes to monetize their name, image and likeness, there have been conversations among college presidents, conference officials and athletic administrators about delaying the vote until there's more clarity about federal government action."}
{"original": "though the ncaa's board of governors created a mandate on oct. 29, 2019 to put new name, image and likeness rules in place no later than january 2021, there are three primary reasons why the ncaa might now punt on the issue until later this year according to nine people with knowledge of the discussions. six of those people spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to do so publicly."}
{"original": "the first reason would be the supreme court's decision last month to hear the ncaa's appeal of a 9th u.s. circuit court of appeals ruling that the ncaa cannot limit benefits related to education that college athletes can receive."}
{"original": "the second involves uncertainty about what kind of bill congress might vote on to regulate name, image and likeness issues, the scope of which could change given the results of the runoff elections in georgia on tuesday that will flip the senate from republican to democratic control this session."}
{"original": "and the third factor driving a potential delay is simply a lack of detail given to ncaa membership about how a third-party clearinghouse would function to vet name, image and likeness deals signed by athletes to ensure they are not de facto recruiting inducements."}
{"original": "several conferences are pushing back, one person with knowledge of the discussions said. not even sure presidents know if it will actually be voted on."}
{"original": "delaying the vote at next week's annual ncaa convention could create significant public backlash for the association and president mark emmert, who told the senate judiciary committee during a hearing in july that work is underway in each of our divisions to ensure a new nil (name, image and likeness) policy will be adopted in january 2021 and take effect for the 2021-22 academic year."}
{"original": "offseason ahead:coronavirus, vaccine, revenue remain college football concerns as rocky season comes to end"}
{"original": "the ncaa unveiled details of the proposed nil rules in november. while those changes would give athletes new and significant abilities to make money from their name, image and likeness and other activities, the proposals include restrictions that would conflict with versions of nil laws that have been passed by states including california and florida, which have created the most pressure for the ncaa."}
{"original": "california's law, signed by gov. gavin newsom in september 2019, was the first and would cover dozens of schools across multiple conference. florida's law is set to take effect july 1, which adds urgency to the situation."}
{"original": "but there's growing conviction among the ncaa membership that it might not make sense to ratify these changes before knowing how the supreme court will rule and seeing which of the four bills introduced during the last six months of the just-concluded session of congress will be reintroduced and which will gain traction with legislators and the incoming biden administration."}
{"original": "if we do pass legislation and now say, 'these kids can, you know, make money outside of their amateurism, is that going to affect what the supreme court does? kansas state athletics director gene taylor said. so i don't know if they're going to pass anything. if they do, i think it's going to be much more narrow even than what they have on the table potentially, or they may just come out with a resolution. there's just real concern that there's too many moving parts right now."}
{"original": "tom mcmillen — a former congressman who now serves as president and ceo of the lead1 association, a group representing football bowl subdivision athletics directors — said he did not know whether a vote on new nil proposals would be delayed, but he added: i would not be surprised if the ncaa delayed action."}
{"original": "i've raised the question with them: how can they pass legislation given the state, federal uncertainties? mcmillen said, referring to three other states that have passed nil laws and others, including texas, where legislators have filed or plan to file bills this year. you know, the only choice is to pass it and put the effective date way out there, but ... there may be some litigation risk there. it's a tricky issue. i just think they're kind of between a rock and a hard place because congress is not getting to this any time soon. i mean, the ramp-up of covid is just taking all the air out of the congress. ... i personally don't see it till later this year."}
{"original": "it is likely that the supreme court will hear arguments in the appeal in march or april and then rule by sometime in june."}
{"original": "the proposed changes to the ncaa's name, image and likeness rules are scheduled to be on the agenda for monday's meeting of the division i council and thursday's meeting of the division i board of directors. the council is a 40-member panel comprised mainly of athletics administrators, including conference commissioners and athletics directors. the board has 24 members, nearly all of whom are university presidents or chancellors."}
{"original": "any action taken by the council is not considered final until it also has been approved by the board."}
{"original": "but a decision by the council to delay action could essentially be overridden by the board."}
{"original": "the package of nil proposals includes one that would require athletes to disclose their nil activities to what is described as an independent third-party administrator. last september, the ncaa issued request for proposals from firms interested in serving in this capacity and initially said the contract would be awarded nov. 20. that award has not yet made."}
{"original": "how are you going to do this, so it doesn't become a recruiting inducement – that was the one thing that i haven't really gotten clarification on and i think is an important clarification, arkansas state ad terry mohajir said. who's the third party? what's the third party doing? how are they running it? what's their involvement? is it going to be housed in the ncaa? is it just going to be a third party? how are they going to decide whether it's a recruiting inducement or not?"}
{"original": "the trump administration slapped a 30% tax on imported solar panels monday in a move that critics say could slow down a fast-growing industry and kill tens of thousands of domestic manufacturing jobs."}
{"original": "the administration's decision followed a trade case brought by two u.s. solar manufacturers. they contended that cheap solar equipment from china and other countries hurt their businesses. trump had long promised to boost manufacturing jobs by cracking down on chinese imports."}
{"original": "the president's action makes clear again that the trump administration will always defend american workers, farmers, ranchers, and businesses, the u.s. trade representative, robert lighthizer, said in a statement announcing trump's decision."}
{"original": "but the vast majority of the u.s. solar industry opposed an import tax, saying it would raise the price of solar power and undercut an industry that employs more than 260,000 people, according to the nonprofit solar foundation — more people than work in coal or natural gas, two energy sources favored by trump. about half of u.s. solar jobs are in installation, with others in manufacturing, sales, product development and other sectors."}
{"original": "the solar energy industries association, a trade group, said monday that trump's decision will kill american manufacturing jobs, not create them. the trade group said that of the 38,000 solar manufacturing jobs in the u.s., only 2,000 involve making cells and panels, which are covered by trump's import tax. the other 36,000 manufacturing jobs involve other equipment used on large solar farms and rooftop solar installations."}
{"original": "the trade group estimated the import tariff would eliminate 23,000 jobs this year."}
{"original": "there's no doubt this decision will hurt u.s. manufacturing, not help it, bill vietas, president of rbi solar in cincinnati, said in a statement released by the trade group. government tariffs will increase the cost of solar and depress demand, which will reduce the orders we're getting and cost manufacturing workers their jobs."}
{"original": "the solar industry has been growing rapidly, fueled by dramatically falling costs and state and local policies to support clean energy. the u.s. installed nearly 15 gigawatts of solar power in 2016, according to the clean-tech consulting firm gtm research, up from 2 gigawatts five years before and a tenth of a gigawatt a decade earlier. huge solar farms have spread across the open desert in states like arizona, california and nevada, and rooftop solar systems have become increasingly popular for homes and businesses."}
{"original": "that growth was made possible by cheap imported solar panels, particularly from china."}
{"original": "the role that imports have played...has been absolutely massive, said ethan zindler, head of u.s. policy analysis at bloomberg new energy finance, a research firm. it has allowed solar to be cost competitive on an unsubsidized basis in many parts of the world, and it has allowed zero-carbon generation to come online and supplant higher-carbon sources of energy in literally thousands of places around the world."}
{"original": "zindler said trump's import tax is less extreme than the companies that brought the trade case asked for, and less extreme than some members of the u.s. international trade commission had recommended. imported solar cells and modules will be taxed at 30% at first, with the tariff dropping to 15% over the next few years. the initial 30% tariff will add about 10% to the costs of building a large solar farm, zindler said —- big enough hit to kill some projects, he predicted, but not others."}
{"original": "the trump administration also exempted the first 2.5 gigawatts of solar cell imports each year from the tax. on top of that, the arizona-based company first solar makes a type of panel that's not covered by the tariff. between the exemption, the first solar panels and projects already in the works, it's possible that in calendar year 2018, virtually none of the market would actually be affected by these tariffs, zindler said."}
{"original": "gtm research expects the tariffs to reduce solar installations by 10% to 15% through 2022, according to the firm's head of americas research, m.j. shiao. experts don't expect the rooftop solar market to take much of a hit, since rooftop installations are more expensive than large solar farms and panel prices make up a smaller portion of the cost."}
{"original": "while trump's solar decision is better than the worst-case scenario, it is directionally terrible, said adam browning, executive director of the advocacy group vote solar."}
{"original": "in the fight against climate change, solar's increasingly low cost is the one glimmer of hope that we have, that we might actually continue to live in the climate that our species evolved in, browning said. we should be jamming the accelerator, not the breaks."}
{"original": "solarworld americas, one of the two u.s. manufacturers who asked the trump administration for tariffs, was cautiously optimistic about monday's announcement."}
{"original": "we are still reviewing these remedies, and are hopeful they will be enough to address the import surge and to rebuild solar manufacturing in the united states, juergen stein, president of solarworld americas, said in a statement. we will work with the u.s. government to implement these remedies, including future negotiations, in the strongest way possible to benefit solar manufacturing and its thousands of american workers to ensure that u.s. solar manufacturing is world-class competitive for the long term."}
{"original": "trump's action to tax solar imports follows a push by energy secretary rick perry to subsidize coal-fired power plants, which are having trouble competing in an electricity marketplace dominated by cheap solar, wind and natural gas. perry's plan was rejected by federal energy regulators, but the trump administration has taken other steps to support fossil fuels, which climate scientists overwhelmingly agree are responsible for the warming of the planet's climate."}
{"original": "the interior department is working to open vast swaths of public lands and waters to oil and gas drilling, and the environmental protection agency is rolling back obama-era regulations designed to speed the replacement of fossil fuels with climate-friendly energy sources like solar and wind."}

{"original": "speaking at a rally on wednesday to supporters, some of whom would later break into the capitol building, trump demanded pence block votes for president-elect joe biden during the session. pence refused trump's request, saying he lacked the legal authority to discard electoral votes. some of the rioters who broke into the capitol made threats toward pence, who was whisked to an undisclosed location for his safety."}
{"original": "congressional democrats then called on pence to seek a cabinet vote for trump's removal under the 25th amendment to the u.s. constitution. pence refused that request, too. some republicans have called on trump to resign and democrats are queuing up another impeachment against trump this week."}

{"original": "sen. sheldon whitehouse, a senior democrat on the judiciary committee, called on the ethics committee to consider expulsion or other punishments for sens. ted cruz and josh hawley in connection to last week's attack on the u.s. capitol."}
{"original": "cruz and hawley led the charge in the senate to object to the count of president-elect joe biden's electoral college victory, feeding false claims of fraud in the 2020 presidential election. supporters of president donald trump stormed the capitol wednesday in an attempt to stop the count and overturn the election."}
{"original": "the senate ethics committee also must consider the expulsion, or censure and punishment, of senators cruz, hawley, and perhaps others, said whitehouse, who represents rhode island."}
{"original": "cruz and hawley's spokespeople did not immediate respond to a request for comment."}
{"original": "whitehouse also said cruz, hawley and sen. ron johnson, the top republican on the senate's homeland security committee, should be removed from key committees while the senate probes the capitol attack."}
{"original": "the senate will need to conduct security review of what happened and what went wrong, likely through its judiciary, homeland security and rules committees, whitehouse said."}
{"original": "because of massive potential conflict of interest, senators cruz, hawley, and johnson (at least) need to be off all relevant committees reviewing this matter until the investigation of their role is complete, he said."}
{"original": "rep. bennie thompson, d-miss., chairman of the house homeland security committee, also suggested cruz and hawley should face consequences for objecting to biden's legitimate win."}
{"original": "even a member of congress that commits a crime, you know, they expel from the body, thompson said in an interview monday on siriusxm's the joe madison show. there are ethics charges that can be brought against those individuals."}
{"original": "…what hawley did and what cruz did was horrible, he added."}
{"original": "rep. mo brooks, a republican who led the house gop's objection to biden's win, is also under fire from his democratic colleagues."}
{"original": "on monday, reps. tom malinowski of new jersey and debbie wasserman schultz of florida, both democrats, introduced a resolution to censure brooks for inciting violence against his fellow members of congress as part of last week's assault on the united states capitol."}
{"original": "they note that on the day of the assault, brooks addressed the pro-trump crowd that later tried to seize the capitol. in his remarks, denounced other lawmakers who were planning to recognize biden's electoral college win."}
{"original": "today is the day american patriots start taking down names and kicking ass, brooks told the crowd."}
{"original": "brooks has refused to apologize for his remarks in the days since the mob attacked the capitol, which left five people dead."}
{"original": "rep. brooks knew perfectly well what he was doing — and whom he was inciting —when he encouraged the mob set on storming the capitol to commit violence on wednesday, malinowski said. his actions endangered the lives of his fellow members of congress, the vice president, and the police officers who bravely tried to defend the capitol, and he deserves at the very least the formal condemnation of the house."}
{"original": "house democrats on monday introduced an article of impeachment against president donald trump, accusing him of inciting an insurrection in the violent capitol riots last week."}
{"original": "there may well be a vote on impeachment on wednesday, house majority leader steny hoyer, d-md., told reporters."}
{"original": "if passed by the democrat-controlled house, hoyer said the article should immediately be sent to the senate."}
{"original": "some democrats have suggested the article should be delayed to give the senate time to first consider president-elect joe biden's nominations and top policy priorities for holding an impeachment trial."}
{"original": "while the article has no republican cosponsors, rep. david cicilline, one of the authors of the article, said he's hopeful some will vote for it."}
{"original": "he incited insurrection against the government of the united states that resulted in the death of five individuals, dozens of people injured in violence here at the capitol, the rhode island democrat told reporters monday."}
{"original": "cicilline said he and other democrats would prefer that pence trigger the 25th amendment or that trump resign on his own."}
{"original": "days have passed, and it is clear that neither of those possibilities will be realized, cicilline wrote in an opinion piece in the new york times published monday. so it is congress's responsibility to act."}

{"original": "the trump administration on monday slapped sanctions on seven ukrainian officials for their role in a malign russian-backed campaign to undermine president-elect joe biden's candidacy in the 2020 election."}
{"original": "in its announcement, the state department did not name biden. but it said several of the ukrainian individuals sanctioned in monday's action worked with andrii derkach, a member of ukraine's parliament and an active russian intelligence agent, in the coordinated dissemination and promotion of fraudulent or unsubstantiated allegations involving a u.s. political candidate."}
{"original": "derkach was a key player in russia's efforts to tarnish biden with unsubstantiated allegations that while vice president, biden sought to have a ukrainian prosecutor fired so that he would not investigate his son, hunter biden. hunter biden was on the board of a ukrainian gas company, burisma, when his father was vice president. there is no evidence that biden did anything wrong."}
{"original": "the u.s. treasury department sanctioned derkach in september, calling him a longtime russian agent and saying the step was part of a broader effort to expose russian malign influence campaigns and protecting our upcoming elections from foreign interference."}
{"original": "the new announcement says seven individuals and four entities were part of a russia-linked foreign influence network associated with derkach. they include former ukrainian officials konstantin kulyk, oleksandr onyshchenko, and andriy telizhenko, as well as a current member of the ukrainian parliament, oleksandr dubinsky."}
{"original": "they have made repeated public statements advancing malicious narratives that u.s. government officials have engaged in corrupt dealings in ukraine, secretary of state mike pompeo said monday."}

{"original": "the association said it has received hundreds of complaints in recent weeks about giuliani and his unfounded efforts to cast doubt on the veracity of the 2020 presidential election. seeking to overturn the election, giuliani led trump lawsuits in several states – each rejected -- that alleged voter fraud without evidence."}

{"original": "if we're wrong, we will be made fools of, but if we're right a lot of them will go to jail, giuliani told the crowd. let's have trial by combat."}
{"original": "the bar association's bylaws state no person who advocates the overthrow of the government of the united states, or of any state, territory or possession thereof, or of any political subdivision therein, by force or other illegal means, shall be a member of the association."}
{"original": "mr. giuliani's words quite clearly were intended to encourage trump supporters unhappy with the election's outcome to take matters into their own hands, the bar association said in a statement. their subsequent attack on the capitol was nothing short of an attempted coup, intended to prevent the peaceful transition of power."}
{"original": "giuliani will be provided due process and have an opportunity to explain and defend his words and actions, according to the bar association. bar leaders did not provide a timeline on a decision."}
{"original": "giuliani has practiced law in new york for decades. he served as a federal prosecutor in the 1980s including as u.s. attorney for the southern district of new york before becoming mayor in 1994."}
{"original": "if his bar membership is revoked, giuliani could still practice law in new york. disbarring a lawyer for misconduct in the state must come from a grievance committee appointed by the appellate division of state supreme court."}

{"original": "social media was a critical part of organizing the protests. conservative activists and president donald trump had advertised the rally for weeks. far-right extremist groups had intimated they would engage in violence on message boards in the days before the attack, leading some senior officials to question why federal law enforcement was not better prepared, according to nbc news."}

{"original": "houston (ap) — while his atlanta falcons teammates are enjoying a little down time, ben garland is hard at work."}
{"original": "he's watching plays on his ipad and jotting down a few tips in a spiral notebook."}
{"original": "he'll have a lot to remember come sunday."}
{"original": "garland could be one of the rare players to play both sides in the super bowl, since he's a backup on atlanta's offensive and defensive lines, in addition to his special-team duties."}
{"original": "it's a lot of studying, a lot of homework, a lot of film work, garland said. but it's totally worth it."}
{"original": "the 28-year-old garland played defensive tackle during his college career at the air force and early in his nfl career, but he wound up being moved to the offensive line."}
{"original": "then, during training camp before this season, falcons coach dan quinn approached garland about working with both units."}
{"original": "the lineman jumped at the chance. after all, he's been released three times and spent a lot of time on the practice squad, so he was willing to do anything that might improve his chances of staying in the league."}
{"original": "i have multiple ipads, garland said. i've got to watch offense, defense, everything. but i'm glad the coach gave me the opportunity to do it."}
{"original": "this week in houston, garland has been getting extra work at center while pro bowler alex mack nurses an injured fibula."}
{"original": "mack is expected to start on sunday, but garland is the insurance policy. if not needed there, he could play some defense. already in the playoffs, he was credited with a safety when seattle quarterback russell wilson tripped in the end zone and garland landed on top of him, perhaps the biggest play in a career that has gone largely unnoticed."}
{"original": "that was awesome, he said. any time you get a sack or a safety, it's a great day, let alone in a game like that."}
{"original": "quinn certainly appreciates what garland means to the falcons."}
{"original": "he's been a real factor for us, the coach said. one of the terms that we use is guys that don't show up on the stat sheet but own their role, and ben exemplifies that on our team as well as anybody."}
{"original": "garland has to work around a schedule that doesn't always allow him to be in every meeting."}
{"original": "i've got to go back and talk to coaches and other players to get the information i missed, he said. but's that's the only drawback."}
{"original": "and for those who think it's no big deal to play offensive and defensive line, they are actually quite different."}
{"original": "on the offensive line, you're so balanced. a lot of the offensive positions are not natural. it's very compact, arched back, everything's trying to be balanced, garland explained. whereas on d-line, you can be a little bit more aggressive. you can be a little more athletic. ... so getting that relationship of being aggressive on defense yet being extremely balanced when you come back to offense is probably the hardest part."}
{"original": "i love them both, for different reasons, he said. on defense, you can just let it loose and fly around and get after somebody. but on offense, when you get all 11 guys working simultaneously and a play breaks, that's a cool feeling to have."}
{"original": "garland's work ethic is unquestioned, but that's to be expected from a player who had to delay his pro career while serving a two-year military commitment. he's now a captain in the colorado air national guard, serving out the rest of his stint between seasons."}
{"original": "he's a man of great character, quinn said. he's somebody that's going to be there early and he's going to stay late. often times he's the first guy onto the practice field working stuff at center. he wants to stay after, work extra things."}
{"original": "the only other drawback about being a two-way player?"}
{"original": "when he catches grief from opponents about turning up on the other side of the line."}
{"original": "they're like, 'what are you doing here?' garland said with a smile."}
{"original": "a small price to pay, that's for sure."}

{"original": "sen. christopher coons, d-del., said the report suggests there may have been more concerns that sparked the mueller investigation than were publicly known at the time. coons told reporters monday he will focus during on whether barr will stand up for the rule of law and the appropriate independence of the department of justice."}
{"original": "trump has repeatedly criticized the mueller probe as a witch hunt and denied colluding with russia to win the election."}
{"original": "i never worked for russia, trump said monday. not only did i never work for russia, i think it's a disgrace that you even asked that question because it's a whole big, fat hoax."}
{"original": "barr, who was attorney general from november 1991 to january 1993 and earlier served as deputy attorney general and headed the office of legal counsel, holds an expansive view of the president's executive power."}
{"original": "in the legal counsel job, barr wrote opinions that justified the fbi arresting fugitives overseas and the invasion of panama and arrest of dictator manuel noriega. as deputy attorney general, barr told former president george h.w. bush he had the authority to attack iraq without congressional approval."}
{"original": "barr could face an early test of executive authority if he is confirmed because trump has threatened to proclaim a national emergency to shift funding from other departments to build the wall along the southern border."}
{"original": "i think it's important to know what kind of judgment the attorney general nominee might provide for the president on the scope of his power, coons said."}
{"original": "sen. john kennedy, r-la., said he was sure barr would be asked about his opinion about the relationship between justice and the other parts of the executive branch, including but not limited to the office of the presidency."}
{"original": "the hearing comes amid significant turnover in trump's cabinet, with acting secretaries at the justice, defense, interior departments, along with white house chief of staff and head of the environmental protection agency."}
{"original": "the justice department has a role in developing administration policy over a variety of hot-button issues, including immigration and voting rights."}
{"original": "sen. ted cruz, r-texas, said several democrats on the senate judiciary committee are running for president and have demonstrated that they will treat almost anything like a political circus. cruz himself is a former 2016 presidential candidate."}
{"original": "coons said tensions linger from the confirmation hearing for supreme court justice brett kavanaugh, which he called one of the most divisive and charged hearings during his eight years in the senate. but barr helped himself by releasing a statement that answered questions and addressed concerns, coons said."}
{"original": "it is my hope that everyone will conduct themselves in appropriate, professional ways, coons said."}
{"original": "lawmakers are expected to press barr on a criminal-justice overhaul, which in part would give judges more discretion in sentencing. his predecessor, jeff sessions, had been an advocate of harsh punishment, directing prosecutors to seek the toughest charges possible."}
{"original": "sen. amy klobuchar, d-minn., said she wants to ask about department initiatives such as criminal-justice overhaul, immigration, human trafficking and opioids."}
{"original": "in his prepared testimony, barr said the crime rate has fallen substantially since he last last served as attorney general in 1992, when his priority was to target violent offenders and gangs. barr said the first step act, the name for the overhaul legislation, recognizes the progress made and he said he would diligently implement it."}
{"original": "i believe we must keep up the pressure on chronic, violent criminals, barr said. we cannot allow the progress we have made to be reversed."}
{"original": "barr will testify during a partial shutdown of the federal government – at more than three weeks, the longest in history. trump and congressional democrats are at a stalemate over immigration policy, with the president insisting on $5.7 billion for construction of a wall along the southern border."}
{"original": "barr said in his prepared testimony that immigration has been a huge benefit, but that the country couldn't accommodate many millions of people who would come from poorer countries if there were no restrictions."}
{"original": "in short, in order to ensure that our immigration system works properly, we must secure our nation's borders, and we must ensure that our laws allow us to process, hold and remove those who unlawfully enter, barr said."}
{"original": "barr could face questions about sagging morale at the department of justice, which has been a target of trump's criticism for the past two years."}
{"original": "trump fired his first attorney general, jeff sessions, the day after the midterm election in november after sharply criticizing him for recusing himself from the mueller investigation. trump has also blasted fbi repeatedly for corrupt and incompetent leadership and investigators."}
{"original": "barr said in his prepared remarks that he would protect the department's integrity."}
{"original": "above all else, if confirmed, i will work diligently to protect the professionalism and integrity of the department as an institution, and i will strive to leave it, and the nation, a stronger and better place, barr said."}

{"original": "one student at emerson college decided to list his dorm room on airbnb in january so folks could explore boston and perhaps take in sights like fenway park or the museum of fine arts."}
{"original": "now, he could face disciplinary action from the school, according to the boston globe."}
{"original": "worth told the globe that emerson saw the listing last week and told him to remove it. after the page was deleted, worth told the news organization that he was fined $150 by airbnb."}
{"original": "so, why did he list his dorm? there's a high level of interest of travel in this neighborhood because it's so centrally located. i saw this as a way to make some money, but also help some people out, worth told the news organization."}
{"original": "a change.org petition now has 278 supporters of worth as of tuesday. the petition said that the school is levying several charges of misconduct against him, which could result in disciplinary action as extreme as his dismissal."}
{"original": "although emerson would not comment directly on worth's case, the college said in a statement to boston.com that the residence hall policy and the housing contract that undergraduate residents sign prohibit students from subleasing or renting college housing units or beds to protect residents and the community from exposure to safety and security risks."}
{"original": "one student, ari howorth, wrote on the change.org petition page that there is nothing criminal with providing cheap housing to travelers. jack worth gave travelers from far and wide a taste of boston life and the emerson experience simply because he wanted to help those who otherwise wouldn't be able to afford to stay in the downtown area."}
{"original": "avi korbman, a commenter on the page, said, wherever i am, i stand with jack worth. #freejack worth."}
{"original": "others have taken to social media in reaction to the situation."}
{"original": "on the heels of her first loss, ufc strawweight cynthia calvillo has been dealt another blow."}
{"original": "calvillo (6-1 mma, 3-1 ufc) has been informed of a potential violation by the u.s. anti-doping agency stemming from a positive drug test for marijuana, the ufc announced late wednesday night."}
{"original": "the positive test stems from an in-competition sample collected in conjunction with ufc 219, which took place dec. 30 at t-mobile arena in las vegas. calvillo that night lost via unanimous decision to former champion carla esparza."}
{"original": "the 30-year-old calvillo, who's only fought professionally since 2016, was named mmajunkie's newcomer of the year for 2017. she fought her first four fights in the ufc last year, going 3-1."}
{"original": "below is the full statement from the ufc:"}
{"original": "the ufc organization was notified today that the u.s. anti-doping agency (usada) informed cynthia calvillo of a potential anti-doping policy violation involving carboxy-tetrahydrocannabinol (carboxy-thc) which is a metabolite of marijuana and/or hashish, above the decision limit of 180 ng/ml, stemming from an in-competition sample collected in conjunction with her recent bout in las vegas, nevada on december 30, 2017, ufc 219: cyborg vs. holm. usada, the independent administrator of the ufc anti-doping policy, will handle the results management and appropriate adjudication of this case involving calvillo, as it relates to the ufc anti-doping policy and future ufc participation. because the nevada athletic commission was the regulatory body overseeing the fight in las vegas and has licensing jurisdiction over calvillo, usada will work to ensure that the nevada athletic commission has the necessary information to determine its proper judgment of calvillo's potential anti-doping violation. additional information will be provided at the appropriate time as the process moves forward."}

{"original": "imagine this: kevin durant is out of bounds by an enormous margin, all three referees somehow miss the obvious infraction and golden state winds up getting a basket that it didn't deserve to take the lead with a few seconds remaining."}
{"original": "when such a scene played out last week in the houston-golden state overtime thriller, james harden kept a ton of egg from landing on the nba's face when he connected on a 3-pointer to give the rockets a win in a game they would have screamed bloody murder about otherwise. but what if he missed? or worse, if a call that big got missed in game 7 of the nba finals?"}
{"original": "how do you miss that? tnt analyst reggie miller mused while watching the durant replay."}
{"original": "an obvious question, with an obvious answer: it's time for a change."}
{"original": "everyone in the nba replay center in secaucus, new jersey that night surely saw durant standing out of bounds. but there is no mechanism for the replay crews to trigger a review of such a play — since, under nba rules as they're written now, they can only get involved if a call is made on the floor."}
{"original": "the league doesn't want a system where every call is challenged or reviewed because games would take forever. there are bang-bang plays in every game, and someone will always be mad when a block-charge call doesn't go their way. but the nba has been thinking about changes, such as adding a coaches' challenge option that they've tinkered with in the g league and at summer league."}
{"original": "give the referees sitting in secaucus that night the option of triggering a review late in games based on what they see. it would just make sense, because the nba insists the top priority in these situations is getting calls right. true, a call made in the first 2 minutes might have just as much effect on an outcome as one in the last 2 minutes, but people just seem more fixated upon the stuff at the end."}
{"original": "we're dealing with human beings, nba commissioner adam silver said last year. and people lose their cool under pressure at times."}
{"original": "cameras aren't affected by pressure. so use them."}
{"original": "to say that washington's bradley beal had high hopes entering this season is an understatement."}
{"original": "if you look at us on paper, we look absolutely amazing, beal said back at media day."}
{"original": "they look much different now. but they're still fighting."}
{"original": "john wall's season is over. dwight howard's season hasn't really gotten started. markieff morris' season won't resume for a few more weeks, at least. the wizards are 11th in the eastern conference, yet insist their resolve is still intact — as was evident in their win over oklahoma city on sunday night."}
{"original": "we're banged up and i haven't heard one player, nor coach, feel sorry for ourselves that we've got guys missing, wizards coach scott brooks said. it's just what we have to do. sure, we would love to have everybody here all season long, but that hasn't been the case and now we know guys are going to be out for the rest of the season and we've just got to tie the laces up and compete for one another."}
{"original": "the wizards started 2-9, then went 9-5 in their next 14 games and looked as though they were righting the ship."}
{"original": "it's been one bad break after another since, but they're still fighting to get back into the playoff hunt."}
{"original": "that's what we have to do, beal said. we have to step in for john, for keif, for dwight — those are key guys and we need everybody to be able to step up and fill in those roles in whatever way possible. whatever it looks like, as long as we get a win. that's something we continue to preach every day."}
{"original": "for the first time in five years, golden state will not have the best record in the nba at the midway mark — after 41 games."}
{"original": "this year, that distinction will go to milwaukee, toronto or denver."}
{"original": "few would have picked that to be the case three months ago."}
{"original": "the bucks, at 27-11 with three games left in the first half of their schedule, are in position for their best 41-game start since opening 30-11 during the 1980-81 season."}
{"original": "toronto matched a franchise best by opening 29-12 — tying what it did last year, even while dealing with the coaching change from dwane casey to nick nurse, the addition of kawhi leonard and danny green, the departure of demar derozan and injuries to jonas valanciunias and kyle lowry."}
{"original": "the nuggets, 26-11 so far, might end up with their best 41-game start ever. they were 29-12 in 1976-77."}
{"original": "golden state's stephen curry loves the 3, and san antonio coach gregg popovich has said he hates the 3."}
{"original": "fitting, then, that they're both approaching no. 3 on some nba all-time lists this week."}
{"original": "popovich enters the week with 1,220 regular-season wins, one shy of matching jerry sloan for third-most in nba history. when popovich passes sloan, only don nelson (1,335) and lenny wilkens (1,332) will be ahead of him on the list."}
{"original": "curry made 10 3-pointers on saturday night, moving him past utah's kyle korver for fourth on the nba career list from beyond the arc; curry has 2,277, while korver has 2,274 entering monday. both are about to pass jason terry, whose 2,282 career 3-pointers rank no. 3 in nba history — for a few more days."}
{"original": "ray allen leads the all-time list with 2,973, and reggie miller is second with 2,560. at his current pace, curry will catch miller in about a year and allen in about two years."}

{"original": "washington – as lawmakers call for his immediate removal – and plan a second impeachment – president donald trump is likely to defend himself tuesday with a speech in alamo, texas."}
{"original": "this alamo is a small town on the texas-mexico border where the outgoing president plans to promote his immigration policy and defend his presidential legacy – a legacy tarnished by last week's attack on the u.s. capitol by enraged trump supporters who the president had urged to fight like hell earlier in the day."}
{"original": "the white house has billed trump's visit as a chance to mark the completion of more than 400 miles of border wall – a promise made, promise kept – and his administration's efforts to reform our broken immigration system."}
{"original": "trump is leaving behind a washington, d.c., still gripped with fear over last week's insurrection, while the coronavirus pandemic and subsequent economic ramifications continue to batter the country. and there are concerns about even more violence, with the fbi on monday warning of events planned at statehouses in all 50 states."}
{"original": "jennifer mercieca, an associate professor of communication at texas a&m university, said the event serves as a chance for trump to try to shape the narrative around his final days in office."}
{"original": "trump has lost his agenda-setting power, and he's trying to force positive news stories about his presidency by doing a 'highlights reel' of events and photo-ops, said mercieca, who wrote the book demagogue for president: the rhetorical genius of donald trump."}
{"original": "deprived of his account by twitter, faced with defections from his staff and seeing his political ratings slide, trump has been largely silent for several days as democratic lawmakers prepare articles of impeachment."}

{"original": "politics updates: trump 'should not be in office,' biden says; trump job approval plummets"}
{"original": "some lawmakers, including rep. adam kinzinger, r-ill., as well as the democratic leaders of both chambers of congress, have called on vice president mike pence and the cabinet to invoke the 25th amendment to remove trump from office immediately, saying he is incapable of office after inciting last week's rioters. the trump cabinet is not likely to act on the suggestion."}
{"original": "the house impeached trump in 2019 over a phone call in which he pressured the government of ukraine to investigate biden and members of his family. the republican-led senate acquitted trump last year."}
{"original": "despite the calls for his ouster, trump is likely to stay in office until the legal termination of his presidency at noon jan. 20, a week from wednesday. he is preparing a series of farewell gestures, including pardons, executive orders and perhaps more public comments like the ones planned in texas on tuesday."}
{"original": "this is trump's first in-person speech since last wednesday, when he addressed a rally near the white house to protest the election of democratic president-elect joe biden. the remarks inspired members of the crowd to march down pennsylvania avenue to the u.s. capitol, where they broke in and threatened members of congress counting biden's electoral votes. five people, including a police officer, were killed."}
{"original": "you'll never take back our country with weakness, trump told his angry backers. you have to show strength, and you have to be strong."}
{"original": "as pence and lawmakers fled to safe places and tear gas fogged the capitol rotunda, trump took to social media to ask supporters to go home, though he expressed sympathy for the rioters' cause."}

{"original": "as a backdrop to trump's trip to alamo, texas, the house democratic majority plans an impeachment vote as soon as wednesday."}
{"original": "about 250 miles south of san antonio, the town of alamo is named for the 19th-century mission and fortress where a texas army was defeated by mexican troops in 1836. texans used the defeat at the alamo as a rallying cry during their fight for independence from mexico."}
{"original": "located in texas' rio grande valley, this portion of the u.s.-mexico border continues to be the busiest corridor for human smuggling among the agency's nine sectors located along the u.s.-mexico border. the rio grande valley also remains a major focus of border wall construction, especially in areas that previously did not have any barriers."}
{"original": "customs and border protection has not publicly disclosed how many miles of new wall have been built in areas of the border that previously did not have any barriers. however, at least the 17 miles that cbp said have been completed in the rio grande valley sector are in areas without any barriers in the past."}
{"original": "some political analysts said they would prefer to see trump give a resignation speech at this alamo, but they expect more defiance from the soon-to-be-ex-president."}
{"original": "tim miller, a former republican strategist who worked for 2016 presidential candidate jeb bush, said trump is fundamentally incapable of speaking without making our precarious situation worse and potentially inciting more violence."}
{"original": "how much last week's violence undercuts trump's political standing remains to be seen, said janine parry, professor of political science at the university of arkansas. pollsters for both parties are probably in field now trying to answer that question, she said."}
{"original": "early returns are not great for trump, according to a quinnipiac poll released monday."}
{"original": "a majority of americans hold president trump responsible for the chaos at the capitol, and a slight majority believe that he should be removed from office, said tim malloy, polling analyst at quinnipiac university."}
{"original": "trump's approval rating, quinnipiac reported, dipped to 33%, down 11 percentage points from his mark last month."}
{"original": "in texas, trump is likely to appeal to his remaining base of supporters, many of whom hail from rural areas such as alamo. it's no accident he selected this part of the country for remarks in this particular environment, parry said."}
{"original": "that could include his selection of a town named alamo. even though the town is not the hallowed location of battle, the very word – remember the alamo! – remains a potent symbol for many texans and americans."}
{"original": "instead of walking back the incendiary effect of his most recent public rally, he appears – with this choice – to be upping the ante, parry said. if americans know anything about the alamo, it's that it was a place to make a 'last stand' or even to go out in a 'blaze of glory.'"}

{"original": "there are alternatives to quitting, which i'll cover later. but first, i'll address your questions."}
{"original": "workplace romances are incredibly common – and why wouldn't they be? we spend one-third of our day at work. it's a natural and easy way to meet people, and work offers a common interest."}
{"original": "but office dating also can cause distractions, conflicts, preferential treatment and other issues. in some cases, a failed relationship can lead to a sexual-harassment lawsuit."}
{"original": "these adverse effects are why employers want to be aware of workplace romances and, in some cases, manage them. many employers have dating policies that set boundaries for romantic relationships in the workplace."}

{"original": "in most states, private companies have a right to impose policies that restrict employee dating. these policies commonly prohibit relationships between a supervisor and a direct report and between employees of a significant rank difference. this is partly to ensure that an employee isn't pressured into a relationship or doesn't stay in one to keep his or her job."}
{"original": "peer-to-peer relationships, in which the couple have different supervisors, are usually less of a concern to employers."}
{"original": "so, in your situation, do you need to quit? it depends on your employer's policy. check with your hr department to see what rules apply in your situation."}
{"original": "in supervisor-subordinate relationships like the one you are considering, one person might have to leave the organization. but who leaves is a decision made between the people in the relationship."}
{"original": "however, there are alternatives to quitting. some companies will help an employee transfer to another department or location or will assign an employee to a different supervisor."}
{"original": "but if you're in a position in which one of you must leave but neither of you wants to, then you may have to quit your relationship – not your job."}
{"original": "as for your question about discrimination, having a romance policy that requires one partner to leave the company is not a discriminatory practice on your employer's part. however, unfair and inconsistent application of a policy could be."}
{"original": "if you decide to resign on your own to pursue a relationship with your boss and it doesn't work out, it's unlikely to be perceived as a form of workplace discrimination. but if your boss fires you or pressures you to quit because she wants to have a relationship with you, that could be harassment."}

{"original": "johnny c. taylor, jr.: the short answer is yes, you can be fired."}
{"original": "many state and local laws prohibit discrimination based on gender identity or expression. but even if you are in a location where no such law exists, employees are at-will in most states and, therefore, can generally be fired for any reason that is not specifically illegal (based on their race, gender or age, for example), including for disrespectful conduct."}
{"original": "as a matter of professionalism, i recommend you make every attempt to call your supervisor by the pronoun she prefers."}
{"original": "but if you just can't get yourself to use a pronoun that conforms to your boss' identity, consider a practical approach – use her first name when addressing or referring to her."}

{"original": "that's when ryan fitzpatrick threw six interceptions in an ugly loss, and brandon marshall and sheldon richardson began feuding in what was the first sign of locker room strife."}
{"original": "throw in injuries to key players in subsequent weeks, stars underachieving, tardiness issues and blowout defeats and it all snowballed into a 5-11 record."}
{"original": "we made a lot of mistakes: coaches, players, plays, all of the above, coach todd bowles said. we fought hard, but we didn't fight smart. we have to do a better job coaching it better, and they have to do a better job playing — accountability for everyone."}
{"original": "bowles will be back for a third season , as will general manager mike maccagnan, as they try to fix the problems. and there sure are plenty."}
{"original": "this could be an offseason of wholesale changes on the roster, as well as the coaching staff. offensive coordinator chan gailey retired two days after the season ended, and the team announced that quarterbacks coach kevin patullo, running backs coach marcel shipp, defensive line coach pepper johnson, outside linebackers coach mark collins and defensive backs coach joe danna will not be back."}
{"original": "bowles, 15-17 in his two seasons in new york, also knows he needs to improve in a hurry."}

{"original": "marshall tried to step up as a vocal leader, but his delivery rubbed some the wrong way, and created some tension. wide receiver quincy enunwa, who had a breakout season with 58 catches, said the locker room issues really hindered our play."}
{"original": "i think it can be fixed, he added. we know what we need to do. it's going to be a lot of changes, and i think it's going to be for the better."}
{"original": "here are some of the issues bowles and the jets face as they enter an offseason of uncertainty:"}
{"original": "qb or no qb?: it all starts at quarterback, and new york has no clear answer on who'll be under center."}
{"original": "fitzpatrick and geno smith are scheduled to be free agents and likely won't be back. bryce petty is facing surgery on his non-throwing shoulder. christian hackenberg was a second-round pick , but never played a snap and he's unlikely to be the starter in 2017."}
{"original": "i haven't even started looking for a franchise quarterback yet, bowles said."}
{"original": "well, he might want to have maccagnan get on that, via free agency or trade — or with the no. 6 overall pick in the draft. otherwise, they both could be looking for new jobs at this time next year."}
{"original": "revis island relocated: the jets face an interesting dilemma with revis, who was a shell of his shutdown self at cornerback."}
{"original": "he blamed injuries and age for the decline , but the fact it happened so quickly was alarming. revis, 31, is willing to move to safety; he and bowles have had preliminary discussions about it."}
{"original": "this offseason, there will be a lot of thinking what my future is and what i can do to best help the team win games, revis said. if that means changing my position to help the team win games, that's fine."}
{"original": "but revis is due to make $15 million next season, and could be a salary-cap casualty if the team asks him to take a pay cut and he doesn't accept."}
{"original": "big-name vets: revis isn't the only one facing an uncertain future with the jets."}
{"original": "marshall is due $7.5 million next season, a total new york would save in its entirety by cutting him. the 32-year-old wide receiver said he plans to play until he's 38 or 39 , and indicated he'd be willing to take a pay cut."}
{"original": "other big names who could be shown the door: center nick mangold (he has a $9.075 million cap hit), left tackle ryan clady ($10.5 million), linebacker david harris ($6.5 million), right tackle breno giacomini ($5.125 million) and cornerback buster skrine ($8.5 million cap hit)."}

{"original": "new york – the holiday performances always gave it away."}
{"original": "every december, as students at public school 9 in brooklyn stood to sing holiday songs while their parents looked on, one class would be made up of a lot of white students, followed by another class of almost all black students."}
{"original": "from the outside, the racial divide might seem curious as ps 9 is one of the most diverse elementary schools in brooklyn: out of about 940 students, 40% are black, 31% are white, 17% are hispanic and 9% are asian. but inside, many students spend their days learning in separate groups. the gifted and talented classes are attended by mostly white and asian kids; the general education classes, mostly black students."}
{"original": "it wasn't obvious until you sat in the audience and watched everyone, said afiya lahens, a black parent whose daughter is in the general education track."}
{"original": "then something remarkable happened. after years of discussion and community meetings, a mixed-race committee of parents and teachers voted to phase out the gifted and talented track for future students at ps 9, specifically to decrease racial and economic segregation."}
{"original": "new york city's education department agreed to follow the decision: starting this fall, there will be no gifted track for the school's incoming kindergartners. instead, ps 9 will offer enrichment opportunities to more students based on their individual strengths and interests."}
{"original": "the move put ps 9 at the forefront of controversy surrounding racial integration in the nation's largest school system – and one of its most segregated. it's raised questions about whether school systems can have both excellence and equity and whether integration efforts should come from parents or official intervention."}
{"original": "the controversies have been particularly acute in brooklyn, where white and affluent families populate neighborhoods historically inhabited by black and latino residents. gentrification has displaced people of color by driving up rents and intensified racial stratification in classrooms."}
{"original": "segregation:it's getting worse in schools, gao says"}
{"original": "phasing out gifted and talented programs at ps 9 will test a controversial recommendation from a school diversity panel appointed by mayor bill de blasio to end such programs at all elementary schools in the city. the panel's rationale: gifted programs are biased and serve to segregate children along lines of race and class, in large part because admission to most programs is based on a screening exam parents can register their children to take, starting at age 4."}
{"original": "wealthy new york families often spend thousands of dollars on test prep for their preschoolers because the number of gifted and talented seats is limited. in a system of about 1.1 million children, about 16,000 seats are available in city-run elementary schools. as a result, gifted programs tend to isolate affluent children, and the power and resources that follow them can result in fewer resources for the general population."}
{"original": "across the country, schools are locked in intense debates about what to do about gifted and talented programs, largely because of racial disparities. some districts have stopped tracking gifted students. others move to diversify gifted programs by ensuring more disadvantaged students have a chance to be tested."}
{"original": "in new york city, radically overhauling gifted and talented programs has long been a political third rail, largely because the programs are popular with affluent parents whose children are enrolled. that's the demographic new york sought to court in the 1970s and '80s with gifted programs in the first place, lest those families, often with more involved parents and higher incomes for tax purposes, move to the suburbs in search of better schools, education researchers said."}
{"original": "we got a lot of pushback on the overhaul, said ps 9 parent kirsten cole, who is white. i feel naive in saying this: it was more than i expected."}
{"original": "new york city schools chancellor richard carranza has championed school integration since de blasio appointed him in 2018. that energized advocates for diversity, but many grow impatient that neither leader has adopted the most radical recommendations to help all schools to reflect the diversity of the city. the chancellor and the mayor declined to phase out all gifted and talented programs or to prohibit schools from using achievement measures to screen children for admission."}
{"original": "department of education officials indicate they're more interested in supporting efforts that bubble up from individual communities. a spokeswoman told usa today integration initiatives are not a one-size-fits-all model."}
{"original": "the city has been under pressure to do something since a major report in 2014 spelled out how new york schools had become the most racially segregated in the country."}
{"original": "de blasio floated scrapping admissions tests to the most elite high schools – often seen as the destination for gifted and talented students – where black and hispanic students are underrepresented. that idea faced major opposition, especially from some asian lawmakers and certain alumni. it's unlikely to go forward because it would require action from the state legislature."}
{"original": "then there's the troubling fact that the move to eliminate gifted programs is opposed by some black and latino parents, whose kids it's supposed to help. some of those parents see elementary school gifted programs, as well as elite high schools, as the only way for their children to work hard and get ahead."}
{"original": "the whole thing is a red herring, said ayanna behin, a brooklyn parent and president of the parent advisory group in the district that includes ps 9. behin is black, and her children attend a different brooklyn school that pursued another path to maintain integration: it changed its admissions policies to set aside more seats for low-income students."}
{"original": "students in the gifted and talented program make up a tiny percentage of the system, and yet talk about eliminating that program generates a huge amount of controversy, behin said. what we really need to be focusing on is fixing the system for everybody."}
{"original": "gifted programs: roots in segregation, debatable benefits"}
{"original": "some say fixing the system for everyone must start with how children are classified and expected to learn, which goes to the heart of the debate around gifted education."}
{"original": "in new york city, children who score in the top tier of the gifted and talented exam can compete for slots at citywide gifted schools and programs at traditional elementary schools."}
{"original": "in 2019, more than 32,000 students in kindergarten through third grade took the exam, and almost 8,000 scored high enough to qualify for a gifted program. that doesn't guarantee them a seat. schools offer the limited number of seats in order of students' scores on the exam."}
{"original": "the odds are low for black and latino students. they make up close to 70% of the district's enrollment, but far fewer of them take the gifted test. of all kindergartners in 2017-18 who passed the test and received an offer for gifted and talented, just 10% were latino and 8% were black."}
{"original": "in contrast, 17% of new york kindergartners are white, but they made up 39% of kindergartners who received 2017-18 offers for gifted and talented seats. eighteen percent of kindergartners are asian, but they made up 42% of the gifted seats."}
{"original": "those divides are not due to cognitive differences between races, but a function of access, resources and systemic bias against blacks and latinos, education experts said."}
{"original": "studies show nonblack teachers are less likely to recommend black students for gifted and talented programs. another study showed that when parents and teachers nominated children, they missed many qualified students. when the large urban district in that study, broward county public schools in florida, switched to screening all children in second grade, more low-income and minority students were placed in gifted programs."}
{"original": "because there's no federal standard for identifying giftedness, states and districts come up with their own definitions – which is one reason researchers don't have a clear answer on the benefits of gifted education."}
{"original": "some say highly talented children can reach their full potential only if they're educated alongside other high-achieving students. some studies show pulling gifted kids out of regular classes to work together for part of the day increased the children's achievement, critical thinking and creativity."}
{"original": "it's good for kids to be with their intellectual peers, said david lubinski, a psychology professor at vanderbilt university and longtime expert on gifted education."}
{"original": "other academics say the stratification caused by ambiguously defined talent produces damaging levels of segregation. when students of varying abilities work together, lower-performing students do better, research shows, without slowing the progress of average and high-achieving students."}
{"original": "if you think that public schools should be leveling the playing field for all kids, then identifying children and ranking their potential based on who signed them up to take a test tends to reinforce the inequalities we see in society, said allison roda, an assistant professor of education at molloy college in new york, who wrote a book about gifted education and segregation in new york city."}
{"original": "the first major studies of gifted kids in america started in the 1920s and '30s when urban centers experienced an influx of immigrants, roda said. schools intentionally created different tracks to separate students by race, class and linguistic ability, she said."}
{"original": "in 1957, after the launch of the soviet union's sputnik satellite, the united states ramped up math and science programs for talented students who could help the country compete in the space race. when schools navigated the civil rights movement in the '60s and '70s, gifted education remained a path where mostly white and wealthy students could be educated separately from their peers of color, roda said."}
{"original": "for her book, roda interviewed new york parents whose children tested into gifted programs."}
{"original": "they admit that the admissions system is flawed, but they still kind of work it to their advantage, she said."}
{"original": "'the same things white people want for their children'"}
{"original": "on a saturday morning in bedford-stuyvesant, a historically black but rapidly gentrifying neighborhood in central brooklyn, children climbed to the third floor of a baptist church. they took their seats, snack bags in hand, winter coats still on, waiting for studies in english and mathematics that would last for the next four hours."}
{"original": "the students, all of whom were black, attend cas prep, a tutoring and test-prep business run by educator sam adewumi. he started the program expecting that black students could better compete on the high-stakes exam for elite high school admissions – which is separate from the gifted and talented exam for elementary schools – if they had access to the same tutoring wealthy families pursue."}
{"original": "he charges parents about $250 for a six-week session of saturday classes. by comparison, the test-prep company kaplan charges at least $1,000 for eight tutoring sessions for the specialized high school admissions test."}
{"original": "cas prep tutors about 150 students in first to eighth grades. adewumi said many students are so far behind, they don't have a realistic shot at passing the exam. after the first year or two of the business, adewumi said, three students passed and got into elite high schools. these days, about 10 to 12 cas prep students each year qualify for top schools."}
{"original": "it's well-documented that few black students have a shot at those seats. new york city made headlines last spring after reports showed only seven slots at the highly competitive stuyvesant high school went to black students. that was out of 895 seats in the freshman class."}
{"original": "adewumi – and many of his clients – are in favor of the high school admissions test, along with gifted programs at the elementary level, because they offer black students a shot at the elite education that can propel them into successful careers, he said."}
{"original": "desiree griffith, a black mother whose 13-year-old daughter attends cas prep, agreed. her daughter took the high school exam in october but won't find out her score until march."}
{"original": "the minority children who are smart need something to challenge them, griffith said as her daughter worked through algebra problems with a cluster of four students."}
{"original": "griffith said her daughter took the gifted and talented test in elementary school but didn't qualify. she attends a charter school in bedford-stuyvesant, but she's not challenged enough, griffith said. griffith said the best way to integrate schools is to make sure students have the same opportunities in all buildings. she'd like to see a well-funded gifted and talented program in every school."}

{"original": "i had one tool within that broken system to try to level the playing field, cornegy said. and now you're trying to remove it."}
{"original": "in brooklyn, steps toward integration spark pushback"}
{"original": "a number of grassroots efforts in new york attracted attention for tackling integration. one of the most high-profile last year: a brooklyn district where all the middle schools agreed to eliminate selective admissions criteria for incoming students. students rank their schools, and an algorithm matches them to buildings while offering preference for children who are low-income, learning english or homeless. the move helped to better integrate eight of the district's 11 middle schools. a similar admissions policy experiment took place in a manhattan district."}
{"original": "the department said about 100 schools across the city – there are about 1,800 in all – individually try to diversify their admissions. five districtsreceived $200,000 grantsto develop community-driven diversity processes."}
{"original": "parents who push for major change often find themselves in bruising battles."}
{"original": "such as the one at ps 9 in brooklyn."}
{"original": "the elementary school hosted at least four different tracks for children: gifted and talented, general education, a dual-language spanish-english track and a track for traditionally developing students to learn alongside students with special needs. over the years, it became clear the gifted and talented track had become the whitest, said cole, the parent who co-chaired the school's equity, diversity and inclusion committee."}
{"original": "we could see pretty clearly that the existence of the g&t track was producing segregation in our school, cole said."}
{"original": "teachers at ps 9, cole said, told the committee gifted classes covered most of the same content as the general education classes, just a little faster. teachers talked about the unequal distribution of resources to classrooms that seemed to result from the tracking."}
{"original": "there was a small number of vocal critics, including white and asian parents. after multiple public roundtable sessions, a competing proposal emerged to keep and diversify gifted and talented at ps 9."}
{"original": "the diversity committee ultimately decided to phase out the track, though that action had to pass through several levels of approval."}
{"original": "supporters of gifted and talented programs said there are ways to keep them and make them more inclusive. the co-founders of testingmom.com, an online preschool test-prep company, said many black and latino families don't know the gifted and talented test is an option for them. they said the city should administer the gifted exam to all children in its pre-kindergarten programs, unless parents opt out."}
{"original": "why would you get rid of the best educational program the city could offer? said karen quinn, who founded the company with michael mccurdy, who runs a blog about gifted and talented programs in new york."}

{"original": "a shift toward enrichment for all, without labels"}
{"original": "ps 9 students in gifted classes will continue through graduation. subsequent classes will experience schoolwide enrichment, in which teachers will offer individual students challenging material based on their interests or talents."}
{"original": "schools in washington, d.c., have taken a similar approach. the district no longer labels students gifted and talented. instead, parents can choose from among 13 elementary and middle schools that host in-school enrichment for students who show strengths in specific areas, from science to photography to social action. the schools are not magnets or test-in programs, but it's easier for children to get seats if they live within a school's boundary. a full-time teacher or committee at the schools coordinate the extra activities."}
{"original": "studies show the model can encourage more independent investigations, more self-selected work and more creative presentations from students. some studies showed it could also lead to higher scores in reading fluency and comprehension."}
{"original": "with schoolwide enrichment, ayani wallace, 9, a student in the general education track at ps 9, might have been given more opportunities in school to develop her love of fashion and design. to nurture it, her mother took her to a class on how to write a business plan. then they both entered a business-pitching competition for their idea: an online athleisure clothing company for adolescent girls."}
{"original": "ayani and her mom won $1,000 in seed money, and they're developing relationships with manufacturers and raising money to produce a first round of clothes."}
{"original": "recently, ayani started noticing differences between classes at her school – just like her mother, afiya lahens, had during those annual holiday performances. she asked why she couldn't be in gifted and talented classes."}

{"original": "sign-up for today's talker newsletter here"}
{"original": "there's no requirement that networks air this or any other presidential address. and prime time is expensive real estate. but, typically, if it's something of national importance, they will air a presidential address."}
{"original": "though not always. they didn't broadcast president barack obama's immigration speech in 2014, so there's precedent for not doing so."}
{"original": "the argument for not airing the speech runs something like this: trump has repeatedly lied about immigration, about the shutdown, about the causes and effects. plus, he has a history of trashing the news media. so why give him free air time to keep it up, particularly when you can't challenge misstatements and lies in real time? why let him mislead even more people on a bigger stage?"}
{"original": "the argument for airing it seems simpler: he's the president. but it's really more complex than that. again, there's no guarantee of free air time — the government doesn't run the networks. but this president has been different from the start. the regular rules don't apply, no matter what the issue."}
{"original": "but even if you believe trump won't be truthful or forthcoming, you can argue that it's important to get him on the record, in front of the nation, taking about immigration. then you have the facts of what he said (although for his supporters, that hasn't mattered so far)."}
{"original": "plus, there's a news hook to this address that others have lacked: the shutdown. there are no signs of an agreement any time soon, and it's affecting hundreds of thousands of federal employees. people want answers, and they want responsibility. an address aired on broadcast networks could — could — help provide that."}
{"original": "of course, there are no guarantees. but if trump does lie, the networks must point it out as it happens. at this point, it's hard to imagine a win-win situation with any of this, but that might be the best option, at least."}

{"original": "washington – irs tax examiner lori mclaurin is used to hearing from people in a financial bind who are looking for help."}
{"original": "but the single mother now finds herself among their ranks thanks to the partial government shutdown that's left her furloughed and without a paycheck."}
{"original": "i hear a lot of stories, mclaurin said, at one point choking back tears. i don't know how they got into their situation. but this one right here, it wasn't my doing."}
{"original": "for mclaurin and thousands of other federal employees across the country, friday is the day when the partial federal government shutdown officially hits their pocketbooks."}
{"original": "it was supposed to be payday. but paychecks are on hold for some 800,000 federal employees forced to go on unpaid leave or work without pay since dec. 22 because of the government shutdown."}
{"original": "it's the first time during the 21-day shutdown – which on saturday will become the longest in u.s. history – that workers will have missed a paycheck. though the standoff is nearing its fourth week, most federal employees were paid on dec. 28 for the final two-week pay period of 2018."}
{"original": "now, with no paycheck coming in the foreseeable future, many are wondering how they will make ends meet."}
{"original": "when they say, 'one paycheck away from homeless,' i'm not there, but i'm real close. and it's disturbing, said mclaurin, a 28-year irs veteran who works out of the agency's philadelphia office."}
{"original": "the uncertainty caused by the shutdown has left many workers anxious, confused and frustrated, said ryan baugh, a furloughed statistician in the office of immigration statistics in the department of homeland security and a steward for the american federation of government employees union."}
{"original": "we just don't know when it will be over, so we don't know how to plan, baugh said. should we cut back? should we start looking for other jobs? should we apply for unemployment?"}
{"original": "steve reaves, a furloughed fire safety official for the federal emergency management agency, said his wife works as a sales manager in the private sector and started taking on extra hours in early december so they could pay their mortgage in the event of a shutdown."}
{"original": "she didn't get to spend as much time with the family during the holidays, said reaves, who lives in arlington, texas, and is president of afge local 4060."}
{"original": "because fema is part of the department of homeland security, furloughed employees can't get moonlighting jobs without approval from their supervisors, reaves said."}
{"original": "the problem is the managers have been furloughed, he said. it's like a catch-22. you can't go out and get a new job to make ends meet."}
{"original": "mclaurin, too, is worried about making the next mortgage payment on the house she shares with her college-aged daughter."}
{"original": "on thursday, she boarded a bus with nearly 100 employees out of the philadelphia irs office and traveled to washington to rally near the white house with other displaced federal workers represented by the national treasury employees union."}
{"original": "on the same bus was horatio fenton, a contact representative for the irs who lives in lumberton, n.j. after decades of paying his bills on time, fenton is worried about making his utility and mortgage payments as well. soon he'll be filing for unemployment for the first time since he joined the federal government 25 years ago."}
{"original": "we've had furloughs before, but i've never had to file for unemployment because it was always assumed it would be short term and you'd be back to work, fenton said. but this one's a little different. both sides are dug in, and we're paying the cost for that. i'm not sure if there's an end to this."}
{"original": "in washington, democrats and republicans profess empathy with the impacted workers."}
{"original": "these families, many of them veterans, are not able to meet their mortgage payment, their rent payment, their car payment, harming their own credit ratings, said house speaker nancy pelosi, d-calif., placing the blame on trump for triggering the shutdown with his demand for funding to build a wall on the u.s.-mexico border."}
{"original": "trump's insistence on $5.7 billion in border wall funding has been the main sticking point in a budget standoff that led to the government shutdown."}
{"original": "the president doesn't appreciate the role of public policy in the lives of the american people, pelosi said."}
{"original": "for his part, trump said earlier this week that he can relate to the pain of federal workers who can't pay their bills. but, i'm sure that people that are on the receiving end will make adjustments, he said. they always do."}
{"original": "the billionaire president's words ring hollow to mclaurin and other federal employees."}
{"original": "he says a lot of things, but he doesn't have real accountability for what he says, she said. how can you relate when you've been born with so much?"}
{"original": "fbi agents added their voices to the thousands of federal employees thursday calling for an end to the government shutdown, asserting that the bureau's diminished resources put national security and investigative operations at risk."}
{"original": "an estimated 5,000 of the bureau's 35,000 agents, analysts, lawyers and other personnel have been furloughed, limiting support for some surveillance and laboratory operations, said thomas o'connor, president of the fbi agents association."}
{"original": "with the agency and the rest of the federal government facing the prospect of missing a paycheck friday, o'connor said the burden could weigh most heavily on agents who are required to meet their financial obligations to maintain security clearances necessary for their work."}
{"original": "financial security is national security, o'connor told reporters, adding that the ongoing shutdown was entering uncharted territory as the longest suspension of government operations in history."}
{"original": "in a petition to lawmakers and other government leaders, the agents' group said the personal financial disruption could even disqualify agents from continuing to serve in some cases because of the potential damage to their clearance status."}
{"original": "fema workers also are freaked out that their security clearances could be in jeopardy, reaves said."}
{"original": "they are afraid that because they are not able to pay their bills in a timely manner, it will affect their (security) clearance investigation, he said. and if it affects their clearance investigation and they can't get a clearance, they lose their jobs. i can't appeal that. i can't take that to court."}
{"original": "other employees who continue to work without pay include thousands of air-traffic controllers at the federal aviation administration and tens of thousands of checkpoint screeners at the transportation security administration."}
{"original": "even before the shutdown, the number of air-controllers had dropped from a peak of 11,753 in 2012 to 10,483 in september 2018, according to the national air traffic controllers association, a union representing the workers."}
{"original": "overtime in the form of six-day weeks and 10-hour days is common at many of the nation's busiest and most short-staffed facilities, including radar facilities in new york, chicago, atlanta, and dallas, said paul rinaldi, an air-traffic controller who is president of the union."}
{"original": "and none of the controllers forced to work during this shutdown will see pay for their hard work to keep travelers safe until the shutdown ends, rinaldi said. this shutdown must end now."}
{"original": "two unions representing federal workers – afge and the national treasury employees union – have filed suit, arguing that the government is violating federal law by forcing some employees to work without pay during the shutdown."}
{"original": "the affected workers could eventually get back pay once the shutdown is over, but that's not guaranteed since it would require an act of congress."}
{"original": "people feel like they are caught between a rock and a hard place, baugh said, adding that many believe they are being used as leverage in a political battle that has nothing to do with their jobs."}
{"original": "there's a real sense of disbelief, he said. people never thought this would go on this long."}

{"original": "on most flights, there are few certainties. some domestic airlines — such as american and united — don't offer packaged nuts but still may serve warmed nuts or include nuts and/or peanut oils in meals, so risks remain. delta says it will refrain from serving nuts if notified in advance and will allow pre-boarding to clean the seating area; still, no guarantees. and other passengers, of course, may bring nuts onboard."}

{"original": "usa today columnist steven petrow offers advice about living in the digital age."}
{"original": "we post nothing about our daughter online, screams a slate headline that has gone viral numerous times. its author, amy webb, claims that a zero-posting policy for her child is the only way to defend her against facial recognition, facebook profiling, and corporate data mining. webb writes in near panic mode that myriad applications, websites, even our smart watches are relying on facial recognition and bio-identification."}
{"original": "with the new year at hand, it's time to make some resolutions about protecting our kids' digital privacy and legacies, especially when three-quarters of teens said they are very or somewhat concerned about their online privacy, according to a study by the family online safety institute."}
{"original": "along with many others, meagan fouty, the mother of two, shared webb's essay on her facebook page last week. her post caught my eye."}
{"original": "there are very few photos of our little ones online (and even fewer over time). not because our kids aren't as cute or as clever as yours, but because we don't want to be the reason they can't walk into a conference room without people being able to look up pics of their naked tushes...we'll let them do that on their own (we're watching you, future teenagers!)"}
{"original": "but there's a big difference between no photos and very few (as well as a distinction between cute kids and naked ones). i asked linda murray, babycenter's global editor-in-chief, and mother of a teenage daughter, for her advice. murray clearly disagreed with webb's zero tolerance when it comes to pictures. the best way to approach posting photos of little ones online is to choose the best photo from your day, or party, or outing, she said. there's no need to post the 25 pictures you took just to get it right."}
{"original": "as for those naked tushes, murray offers this simple guideline: before you post anything, remember that someday your child may grow up to be a judge or a ceo (or president!), and the last thing he or she will want living on the internet are bathtub photos."}
{"original": "make no mistake, you can protect your children from embarrassment or exploitation without banishing them from social media altogether. here's how:"}
{"original": "— use common sense when deciding which photos to post and share. don't post bathtub or potty pictures, no matter how cute."}
{"original": "— check your privacy settings on all your social media counts regularly — including now, at the beginning of a new year. log out to see what is visible to the public."}
{"original": "— set up family only accounts on facebook and instagram and have other family members commit to not sharing your photos."}
{"original": "— once your child is a pre-teen or teen, ask permission before you post. that's a good way to model smart, sage behavior when it comes to their own photo posts."}
{"original": "— never post photos of other people's kids without getting permission first. if you do and you're asked to take them down, just do it without complaint."}
{"original": "finally, fouty reminded me of this perhaps forgotten truth: it wasn't that long ago when people got a chance to be 'surprised at how much you've grown' after an absence. right? right, indeed. and it was always a lovely surprise."}

{"original": "collins, miss. — a man walked into a nursing home for military veterans two days before christmas, picked up jerry holliman's legs and left."}
{"original": "holliman, 69, had hopes of moving back to his home in hattiesburg and returning to an independent lifestyle with his new prosthetic legs."}
{"original": "the u.s. department of veterans affairs wouldn't pay for his prosthetic legs, holliman said, and medicare wanted him on the hook for co-pays. as holliman tried to navigate what felt like a maze of paperwork, it felt like his country was forgetting him."}
{"original": "medicare did not send me to vietnam, holliman said. i was sent there by my country... with the understanding that if something bad happened to me, that it would be covered by the va."}
{"original": "holliman served active duty in the u.s. army twice — as an 18-year-old specialist who volunteered to fight in vietnam and as a 53-year-old master sergeant in iraq. he earned bronze stars in both wars, according to his discharge papers. between active duty and the u.s army national guard, holliman said he served 40 years in the military."}
{"original": "while in vietnam, holliman said he was exposed to agent orange, a chemical the american military used to kill vegetation. the chemical also caused diseases to vietnamese and u.s. service members, including cancers and diabetes."}
{"original": "holliman said he's survived three forms of cancer, but in recent years, diabetes began affecting his legs."}
{"original": "the u.s. department of veterans affairs paid for a motorized wheelchair for holliman a few years ago, he said. it helped get him into the kitchen of his hattiesburg home using a ramp in his garage, but the rest of his house is not wheelchair accessible."}
{"original": "at the time, holliman could still walk a bit, and he never expected he would lose his legs entirely."}
{"original": "then they got worse. gangrene set in, which meant emergency surgery."}
{"original": "doctors amputated his right leg in november 2018, and the left leg in april. holliman came to the veterans home in collins for what he thought would be a temporary stay — just until he got his mobility back."}
{"original": "holliman said he got a pair of prosthetic legs in august from a company called hanger, which has offices in hattiesburg."}
{"original": "he held onto paperwork, including handwritten notes on how to use and clean his prosthetic legs. he started going through rehab at the nursing home."}
{"original": "after a few sessions with the hanger staff, holliman said he was told the u.s. department of veterans affairs would not pay for his prosthetic legs."}
{"original": "he tried to raise the alarm with staff at the veterans home in collins, a state-run facility, but holliman said he knows the ultimate decision to pay for his prosthetic legs lies with the va — an entity he compared to goliath."}
{"original": "susan varcie, a spokeswoman at the va medical center in jackson, said she could not comment on holliman's case due to privacy laws."}
{"original": "hanger declined to say how much a typical prosthetic leg costs, but a 2013 report from abc news said the cost for a single leg can range from $5,000 to $50,000 for adults."}
{"original": "holliman said he was encouraged to use medicare to pay for the prosthetic legs, but he was never shown a total cost, and the forms indicated he would have to pay a co-pay."}
{"original": "so he refused, never expecting what would come next."}
{"original": "on dec. 23, an employee from hanger came to the veterans home to see holliman. holliman said the man was adjusting his prosthetic legs, then asked himto sign some paperwork for medicare."}
{"original": "holliman said he declined because the u.s. department of veterans affairs should pay for the legs in full."}
{"original": "this is their responsibility, holliman said."}
{"original": "the man responded by taking the legs and leaving."}
{"original": "the only evidence that remained were the papers holliman held onto and a pair of new black gym shoes sitting underneath a table in his room he had to buy for the prosthetic legs."}
{"original": "their only purpose now seemed to be a reminder of what he had lost."}
{"original": "holliman's son, jerald, said he was shocked to learn his father's legs had been taken."}
{"original": "he was always under the impression, 'these were my legs,' jerald said. ...what he's done for his community, his country ... for them to have taken these legs is an insult."}
{"original": "with his legs gone, holliman felt like he was falling through the cracks of the american health care system. he called the clarion ledger, part of the usa today network, which in turn reached out to hanger prosthetics about the case."}
{"original": "a reporter and photographer from the clarion ledger went to the veterans home in collins to meet with holliman on jan 2. hours after they left, a man came to holliman's room."}
{"original": "holliman said it was the same employee from hanger who took his legs. this time, he was bringing them back. he asked holliman about his bronze star awards."}
{"original": "he didn't know that i received those things, holliman said."}
{"original": "there was a problem with the legs, though. no adjustments had been made to them, holliman said, and he can't walk without one leg folding in on him."}
{"original": "'you can have 'em,' holliman recalled the man saying, but they're not going to do anything to them until the va pays them."}
{"original": "when the clarion ledger initially reached out to hanger, spokeswoman meghan williams did not deny holliman's account of having his prosthetic legs taken. she said she could not confirm or deny it because federal privacy laws prevented hanger from speaking about individual clients."}
{"original": "she said hanger could comment on the case if holliman had signed a waiver of his privacy rights, but holliman said he received no communication from hanger asking for him to waive those rights."}
{"original": "hanger clinic does not take back prosthetic devices after final delivery to a patient has been made, williams said in a statement."}
{"original": "however, williams said final delivery is only complete when a patient has signed a verification of receipt that allows a claim for payment to be submitted to the applicable insurance payer."}
{"original": "because holliman didn't sign the medicare paperwork, it appears that holliman had possession of the prosthetic legs, while hanger simultaneously considered those legs undelivered."}
{"original": "now, holliman has the legs back, but it's unclear why. holliman thinks it's because he contacted the media."}
{"original": "when the clarion ledger reached out to hanger about the return of the legs, williams reiterated that federal privacy law prevents hanger from talking about holliman's case."}
{"original": "we understand how critical the devices we build are for our patients' rehabilitation, she said in a statement. it is our policy, in accordance with regulatory guidelines, to follow up with every patient we see and make necessary device adjustments through delivery and for at least 90 days afterwards. we are committed to empowering human potential, and want to see our patients regain their mobility and independence."}
{"original": "that's not what holliman said he was told."}
{"original": "the legs are basically useless if hanger won't make any more adjustments, holliman said, and without those adjustments, he's stuck at the veterans home. depression and anxiety are setting in, he said."}
{"original": "at 69, holliman said he's one of the youngest residents at the home. he said his roommate died last month."}
{"original": "i was here for one thing — to get my prosthetic legs, learn how to walk in 'em, and go home, holliman said. ...i've been here over a year. i wanna go home. this place is not for me. it's a dignified place for these guys to die, that's what it is... it's probably every other month somebody dies here. and you know what they do? put a flag over them, and play 'taps' and take them outta here."}
{"original": "when asked about his future, holliman said he wants to live another 20 or 30 years, enjoy his retirement and go fishing."}
{"original": "i'm like a cat. i got nine lives. i think i'm on the last one, though, holliman said. after a pause, he added: it's not my time. you know, we go through a lot. some of us can go out there and slip on a piece of bubble gum, and we die. but it's not meant for me to go yet."}

{"original": "iran now presents donald trump with the first real-time crisis of his presidency, illustrated in stark terms tuesday when iran launched ballistic missiles at two iraqi bases hosting u.s. and iraqi troops. and not surprisingly, he is handling it in a way that embodies all the worst elements of his management of national security issues. unfortunately, trump also seems to have abandoned one of the more positive aspects of his approach to foreign policy: a reluctance to get into new and unwinnable conflicts in the middle east."}
{"original": "a major war with iran is by no means inevitable. but the killing of gen. qasem soleimani is a roll of the dice that just might take us there."}
{"original": "the external signs of crisis mismanagement are already apparent. the president's threats against iran have inflamed an iranian public already at fever pitch against the united states. his promise — twice — to attack iran's cultural sites should it respond violently against the united states was not only a provocation, it was also a potential war crime. trump belatedly recognized that, but no statement did as much to undermine the american narrative that it's at war with the iranian regime, not the iranian people."}
{"original": "trump has fared no better with the iraqi government by threatening sanctions if it moves to force u.s. troops out of iraq. u.s.-iraqi relations are at an all-time low, with additional confusion over the leak of a defense department letter that appears to set the stage for repositioning american forces in anticipation of withdrawal. that's even though many iraqis, primarily among sunnis and kurdish constituencies, want them to stay."}
{"original": "trump has also alienated america's most important ally on iraq — britain. prime minister boris johnson is unhappy that the united states did not coordinate with him before targeting soleimani."}
{"original": "but behind these headlines, the dysfunction in u.s. policy reflects trend lines that have been clear since trump took office. first, the killing of soleimani is emblematic of trump's tendency to come up with solutions to problems america didn't necessarily have. he did this by withdrawing from the paris climate accord; recognizing jerusalem as the capital of israel; withdrawing u.s. forces from syria; and exiting a flawed but still highly functional iran nuclear accord — arguably the reason we are now in this crisis with iran."}
{"original": "taking soleimani off the battlefield may have been morally justified and a tactical success. but it has created any number of second-order consequences that have weakened rather than strengthened u.s. influence in region. americans are less secure, not more; iran's regional influence, especially in iraq, has been boosted, not weakened; and u.s. influence is at its lowest ebb in a decade and a half."}
{"original": "nor is there real certainty that we can control events in the wake of an iranian retaliation. killing soleimani may have been a tactical success, but so far it appears to be a strategic failure."}
{"original": "killing soleimani also highlights yet another trump tendency — taking actions that are untethered from any broader strategic goal. one example is recognizing jerusalem as israel's capital, with no apparent correlation to promoting serious negotiations or selling the administration's own middle east peace plan."}
{"original": "and this sort of haphazard approach driven by trump's moods, ego or domestic politics doubly pertains to the way his iran policy has played out. his maximum pressure campaign of sanctions against iran has been effective in squeezing iran's economy. but it has never been clear what the goal is: to fracture the regime, weaken it and lay the basis for regime change? or to pressure iran into returning to the negotiating table to reach a new deal more favorable to washington?"}
{"original": "when you don't know where you're going, the old saw opines, then any road will get you there. and right now it looks as if the administration really has no idea where it's going or what it wants to achieve with iran."}
{"original": "decisions tied to moods and cable tv"}
{"original": "then there's the matter of trump's decision-making — a style that seems free of any methodical or consistent process of weighing options in a deliberative manner and thinking through the implications and consequences before actions are undertaken. instead, the decisions seem tied to trump's likes, dislikes, moods, personal views and what he watches on cable news."}
{"original": "the decision to target soleimani was reportedly taken after trump had decided on a more moderate response. but after watching the images of the u.s. embassy in baghdad under attack, trump changed his mind and stunned his advisers with the decision to kill soleimani."}
{"original": "editorial board:iran crisis demands donald trump spell out endgame after killing gen. qassem soleimani"}
{"original": "other reports suggest that secretary of state mike pompeo has been pushing to hit soleimani for months and took advantage of trump's moment of risk-readiness to argue for the more extreme option."}
{"original": "there's no way of knowing what motivated the president. the administration has still not released the intelligence that purported to show the imminent nature of the attacks soleimani was planning."}
{"original": "either way, we are seeing an administration taking a dramatic course of action that was not well thought through either on the front end (why soleimani was killed) or on the back end (how would this impact u.s. interests in a volatile region). and a president driven by any number of motives that are still opaque — from anger over pictures on cable news, to frustration with impeachment, to a desire to appear tough and bold in the wake of iran's rocket attacks that killed an american contractor and wounded u.s. servicemen."}
{"original": "us interests devastated:attack on us embassy in iraq shows trump is failing. he walked into iran's trap."}
{"original": "finally, above all it suggests drift in u.s. policy and an administration that doesn't know its own mind or the region. like some modern day gulliver, trump is wandering around in the middle east tied up by small and larger powers whose interests are not his own, and by his own illusions sliding toward a confrontation with iran. his is an administration inhabited by regime changers, sanctions imposers, chicken hawks and real ones who are looking for a fight with iran."}

{"original": "while it's difficult to pick a region that represents the average cost of living in america, minnesota comes pretty close. the state ranked right in the middle of gobankingrates' cost-of-living survey covering all 50 states plus washington, d.c. minnesota has five different metropolitan areas, and st. cloud sits near the midpoint in terms of living wage -- the amount required to support an individual and any dependents -- according to data provided by mit."}
{"original": "that means st. cloud provides a reasonable example of how far $11 an hour will go for an american with a typical cost of living. all calculations assume a person works 40 hours per week, 52 weeks per year. at $11 an hour, that comes out to $22,880 a year."}

{"original": "as you can see from the data above, an $11-per-hour minimum wage does count as a living wage for a single adult in the st. cloud area. add in even a single child, however, and $11 is less than half of what is needed to get by. and even with two working adults who have only one child, you can see that $11 an hour leaves the family short by about $8,700 a year."}
{"original": "this is just one example that falls roughly in the middle. if you live in a cheaper market, $11 an hour goes further, and it may be enough to qualify as a living wage. of course, in pricier locales, a person earning $11 an hour will be even further behind."}
{"original": "what this shows is that even though companies like wal-mart and target have taken a step in the right direction, they still don't pay workers at the bottom enough to get by in many markets. perhaps more notable is that the federal minimum wage is woefully inadequate, and even states that have set a higher bar have not pushed numbers high enough for many people to make ends meet."}

{"original": "hack our election once, shame on you. hack our election twice, shame on us."}
{"original": "the first step in preventing a repeat of the 2016 hacking is for every candidate — regardless of party — to prioritize cybersecurity on the same tier as fundraising, advertising and debate preparation. this begins with hiring a chief information security officer, a high-level official who can set and implement strategy to secure every bit of confidential information, and ensure that the systems are not disrupted by attacks. this official should have deep experience and be of the same tier that you would expect from a top security executive at a fortune 500 company."}
{"original": "hiring a single executive, however, will not be sufficient. that official must have the budget to hire a team of experienced cybersecurity staffers to develop and implement policies and install technical safeguards, such as multifactor authentication, end-to-end encryption, regular vulnerability testing, and monitoring for insider threats. the cybersecurity staff should ensure that users only have access to the data that they need to perform their job."}
{"original": "campaigns cannot rely exclusively on their cybersecurity teams to prevent hacking. every member of the campaign — from the part-time volunteer to the campaign manager to the candidate — must adhere to the campaign's security policy and use the protection that the cybersecurity team provides. easier said than done, particularly in the frenzy of campaign season. but every person with an email account is a potential vulnerability. before it provides account credentials to a new staffer or volunteer, the campaign must require the person to undergo cybersecurity training."}
{"original": "don't redirect cybersecurity money to tv ads"}
{"original": "the campaign must develop its cybersecurity team and strategy from the very start. if it holds off on cybersecurity in favor of other priorities, it likely will be too late. staffers will have account credentials and devices scattered across the country. by that point, any changes in policies, procedures or technology would be difficult, if not impossible, to enact."}

{"original": "but after trump's surprise victory, the new president spoke often with adelson and embraced his hardline views on the middle east. he cut funding for palestinian refugees and withdrew from the obama administration's nuclear nonproliferation deal with iran. he moved the u.s. embassy to jerusalem even though earlier administrations – democratic and republican – avoided doing do because it directly challenged the palestinian view that the ancient city should be part of any peace agreement."}
{"original": "adelson, in turn, aided trump financially, including $5 million for his inauguration, and supported him through his media holdings. late in 2015, adelson secretly purchased the las vegas review-journal – the paper's own reporters revealed he was the new owner – and soon raised concerns he was imposing his own views. some longtime staffers left in protest."}

{"original": "adelson, who contributed more than $100 million to the 2018 off-year elections, held extraordinary power among republicans even though he didn't always agree with them. in a 2012 interview with the wall street journal, he called himself basically a social liberal, pro-choice on abortion and supportive of immigrant rights. he cited taxes and differences over israel as major reasons for leaving the democratic party."}
{"original": "in nevada, his influence was such that even the state's most prominent democrat, sen. harry reid, hesitated to take him on. in a 2014 interview with msnbc, the then-senate majority leader differentiated between adelson and fellow gop billionaire donors charles and david koch. reid had sharply criticized the koch brothers as callous and greedy, while saying that he respected adelson because he was not in it to make money, a widely challenged opinion."}
{"original": "he had previously told msnbc's rachel maddow that he remained friends with adelson despite their political differences."}
{"original": "sheldon adelson and i still meet and have conversations. he has a problem, i try to help him, reid said."}
{"original": "adelson was married twice. he and his first wife, sandra, were divorced in 1988. three years later, he married miriam farbstein-ochshorn, an israeli-born doctor he met on a blind date and whom many believe helped deepen his involvement with israel. their honeymoon trip to venice inspired adelson to raze the historic sands hotel-casino, once a favorite hangout for frank sinatra among others, and replace them with a pair of massive complexes: the venetian and the palazzo, one of the city's tallest buildings."}
{"original": "sheldon adelson adopted his first wife's three children and had two children with his second wife. among numerous philanthropic projects, he and miriam adelson were especially committed to the research and treatment of substance abuse, a personal cause for sheldon adelson. his son mitchell, from his first marriage, died of an overdose in 2005. (sheldon adelson would spend millions opposing state efforts to legalize marijuana)."}
{"original": "sheldon garry adelson was born in 1933, in the dorchester neighborhood of boston. his father was a taxi driver, his mother the manager of a knitting store. a natural entrepreneur, he was selling newspapers by age 12 and running a vending machine business at 16. after dropping out of city college of new york and serving in the army, he attempted to start dozens of businesses, from toiletries to de-icing windshields."}
{"original": "adelson, who said he disdained email, began to amass his fortune with a technology trade show, starting computer convention comdex in 1979 with partners before selling his stake in 1995 for more than $800 million."}
{"original": "when he bought the sands hotel in 1989, he was thinking convention space, not just gambling, would make money. it did. he built a convention hall to keep his hotel rooms full on weekdays and others soon followed the business model. meanwhile, his effort to replicate the strip in macau, the only chinese province to allow gambling, made his wealth grow exponentially."}
{"original": "when faced with water and marsh land, adelson directed his company to build land where there wasn't any, piling sand up to create the cotai peninsula. soon his macau revenue outstripped that of his las vegas holdings. he later expanded his business to singapore, where his marina bay sands hotel and its infinity pool were featured in the hit film crazy rich asians, and had been pressing to open a casino in japan."}
{"original": "his macau business also spawned a long-running wrongful termination lawsuit brought by a former chief of sands china ltd. who accused adelson and the company of firing him for exposing a host of misdeeds. adelson often clashed with attorneys while appearing on a clark county courtroom's witness stand."}
{"original": "the sands china lawsuit was among dozens involving adelson, whose cases included his suing a wall street journal reporter for calling him foul-mouthed (the parties settled, the words remained) to being sued by his sons from his first marriage for cheating them out of money (he won)."}
{"original": "a long-running feud with fellow casino tycoon steve wynn turned to friendship when wynn joined adelson's effort to end online gambling. critics said adelson was trying to stifle competition. adelson countered that there was no way to ensure children and teenagers wouldn't gamble and said he was not in favor of it exploiting the world's most vulnerable people."}
{"original": "trump's election would again prove useful to adelson. during the obama administration, the justice department said online gambling that does not involve sporting events would not violate the wire act, a 1961 federal statute. in a legal opinion that became public early in 2019, the department reversed itself and decided the statute applies to any form of gambling."}
{"original": "the company has named robert g. goldstein – las vegas sands' president and chief operating officer – as acting chairman while adelson is on medical leave."}
{"original": "trump has delivered – both in policy and at the podium – on an issue very important to the adelsons: israel."}
{"original": "they like a place called israel very much, trump said of the couple at a las vegas event in february. would you say that's correct? maybe i have to use the word 'love' a place called israel, right?"}
{"original": "in a column last year published in the las vegas review-journal, a newspaper the adelsons own, miriam made a case to expand the bible with a book named after the 45th president of the united states:"}

{"original": "washington – house lawyers told a federal appeals court friday that president donald trump faces the prospect of new articles of impeachment as they asked judges to give them access to secret testimony gathered during the russia investigation and to force former white house counsel donald mcgahn to testify before congress."}
{"original": "the justice department, which appealed rulings by two district courts, vehemently argued against both efforts. but their challenges were met with deep skepticism from some members of the two judicial panels."}
{"original": "has there ever been an instance of such a broad scale of defiance of congress? judge thomas griffith asked justice department lawyer hashim mooppan, referring to the trump administration's refusal to cooperate with the house impeachment inquiry. has that ever happened?"}
{"original": "mooppan acknowledged there may be no precedent, yet he pressed to block mcgahn's testimony by arguing the courts have no authority to intervene in a largely political dispute."}
{"original": "the blunt exchange was part of a morning-long clash in back-to-back hearings in which house lawyers said the impeachment inquiry against trump remains open. new charges could be brought, they said, if mcgahn testifies and if the house reviews grand jury testimony behind the conclusions of special counsel robert mueller's investigation into russia's interference in the 2016 election."}
{"original": "last month, the house approved two articles of impeachment against the president. one article accuses trump of abusing his power by withholding military aid in order to pressure ukraine to announce investigations into a political rival. the other accuses him of obstructing congress by stonewalling most of its subpoenas for documents and testimony."}
{"original": "megan barbero, house associate general counsel, told the panel in the mcgahn case that his testimony could bolster the obstruction charge, which deals with trump's alleged efforts to have ukraine interfere in the 2020 election. and it could lead to additional articles of impeachment regarding russian interference in the 2016 election, she said."}
{"original": "it is the pattern of misconduct that would be relevant, barbero said."}
{"original": "asked later whether the grand jury information gathered during the russia inquiry could prompt new impeachment charges, house general counsel douglas letter said, that is on the table; there is no doubt."}
{"original": "mueller's report describedmultiple instances in which trump sought to thwart the investigation, which included ordering mcgahn to remove mueller. the special counsel did not make a decision on bringing criminal charges against trump, largely because justice department policy says a sitting president cannot be charged with a crime."}
{"original": "the house judiciary committee subpoenaed mcgahn in april, but he refused to appear."}
{"original": "the battle over his testimony could redefine relations between the executive and legislative branches of government, with the trump administration arguing congress cannot force any trump aide to testify."}
{"original": "judges spent most of the 80-minute hearing in the mcgahn case questioning whether they should decide the matter at all."}
{"original": "mooppan, the deputy assistant attorney general at the justice department, argued the court should avoid the political food fight between the other two branches and let them resolve the dispute over mcgahn's testimony."}
{"original": "but barbero said the judges must enforce the house's subpoena in order to guard against the trump administration's unprecedented defiance of congress' oversight."}
{"original": "judge karen henderson pointedly asked the justice department lawyer whether the administration believes the house could never ask the courts to enforce a subpoena against the executive branch."}
{"original": "that is our position, your honor, mooppan said."}
{"original": "judge judith rogers said judges were wrestling with whether and how to mediate in a period of noncooperation between the branches of government, when either they have to duke it out or nothing happens."}
{"original": "that's what we're struggling with here, rogers said."}
{"original": "other potential witnesses in the impeachment inquiry, such as acting white house chief of staff mick mulvaney and former national security adviser john bolton, have said they wanted clarification from the courts about whether they could be forced to testify."}
{"original": "since the beginning of the impeachment inquiry, however, mcgahn has been a central figure because of his proximity to the president."}
{"original": "u.s. district judge ketanji brown jackson sided with the judiciary committee when it sued to enforce the mcgahn subpoena. she rejected the white house's claims of absolute immunity, writing that the president does not have the power to prevent his aides from responding to congressional subpoenas."}
{"original": "stated simply, the primary takeaway from the past 250 years of recorded american history is that presidents are not kings, jackson wrote."}
{"original": "the justice department appealed her ruling, urging the appeals court to dismiss the lawsuit for having no standing in federal court. the department argued there was no urgency to making a decision because a quick decision could influence the pending senate trial."}
{"original": "barbero argued that the trump administration has directed aides and executive branch agencies to defy house subpoenas for documents and testimony. if the court doesn't step in, she said, that could hurt the legislative branch's ability to provide a check on the administration's power."}
{"original": "the trump administration has argued that top officials such as mcgahn enjoy absolute immunity from being compelled to testify, which is necessary for them to offer confidential advice to the president."}
{"original": "barbero said absolute immunity was unfounded in the law."}
{"original": "if the court were to force mcgahn to testify, he could still refuse to answer specific questions by claiming executive privilege, which also aims to protect confidential advice to the president. but that could lead to more lawsuits."}
{"original": "this court should not be refereeing who is right or wrong about whether the president is acting totally unusually or congress is acting totally unusually, mooppan said. that is exactly why this court should stay out of that."}
{"original": "but barbero said defiance of subpoenas could thwart all congressional investigations, including those that could lead to legislation to prevent foreign contributions from influencing elections."}
{"original": "there is also a diminution of power of our branch of government, she said."}
{"original": "mooppan argued that the house has no authority to enforce its subpoena and should have relied on the justice department for that. he said the court shouldn't decide the case because congress has other remedies when facing a defiant administration, such as withholding spending for presidential priorities, refusing to confirm nominees or pursuing impeachment."}
{"original": "it's not that there aren't any remedies – it's that they are political, mooppan said."}

{"original": "we're seeing a pretty substantial increase in the number of cases in miami-dade county, florida international university epidemiologist mary jo trepka told usa today sports on friday. the last three days we've had over 3,000 cases a day, and we're over 10% positivity. there is a lot of covid-19 in the community, not just miami-dade but florida in general. so if anyone is making a decision to come and travel, they need to know about that and they really need to think carefully about that, because there's just an awful lot of covid-19 right now."}

{"original": "alabama arrived in the area saturday morning and ohio state's flight landed saturday evening. the teams are following the coronavirus protocols they have all year, per their individual conference rules."}
{"original": "the stadium had been a covid-19 testing site for months and was announced as a vaccination site wednesday by florida gov. ron desantis. demand for the vaccine soon outpaced supply, forcing the county vaccination hotline to tell callers to call back later to schedule an appointment."}
{"original": "it's not clear how the game will affect vaccination appointments at the stadium site."}
{"original": "i don't think it means you need to shut it down, desantis said wednesday. maybe it'll close a little early, but i think you can still do it, even on that day."}
{"original": "desantis has employed a policy of keeping the state open for business despite the pandemic, in contrast to other states such as california, which has not allowed fans at stadiums for months."}
{"original": "families of the teams understandably don't want to miss an event like this in person."}

{"original": "even if attendance is limited and fans wear masks in an outdoor stadium, such events still tend to promote tourism and attract gatherings at restaurants, hotels and homes. trepka, the professor at fiu, recommends avoiding social gatherings."}
{"original": "in a large arena, there's still an element of risk with a large number of people, trepka said. i don't think anybody has been able to fully investigate the transmission (possibilities) for many things because the whole system has been so overwhelmed since march that we don't really know a lot about all the different possibilities for transmission. i think we can feel comfortable that being outdoors is safer than being indoors, but i can't tell you to what extent."}

{"original": "i keep telling people we are in the midst of a surge and we have very high levels, trepka said. we are actually kind of similar in terms of our case numbers compared to what we had in the summer, which was a very difficult time period. … so i tell people they should not be going to large gatherings. i know some people will make that decision, but they need to understand that they are potentially putting themselves at risk and potentially putting other people at risk including their family members when they return."}

{"original": "fifa investigators said joseph lamptey of ghana had a history of being suspended for poor performances before being banned for life and typically awarded more penalties than other african referees of his grade."}
{"original": "a common match-fixing tactic is for referees to award penalty kicks after non-existent fouls or handball incidents to help betting syndicates cash in bets on the number of goals scored."}

{"original": "duterte backs off claim he tossed man from helicopter — sort of"}
{"original": "similar scenes have played out here and in other cities under president rodrigo duterte's controversial drug war. the total body count of suspected drug dealers or users tops 6,000. more than 2,000 were killed in police operations, and the other 4,000 died in vigilante or extrajudicial killings."}
{"original": "duterte has made the drug war his signature issue. after taking office june 30, he vowed to clean up the problem in six months. he recently told a local news station that he had miscalculated and that the problem was larger than he realized. he vowed to continue the drug war until the last pusher is out in the streets, until the last drug lord is killed."}
{"original": "the spate of killings has drawn condemnation from human rights groups that contend many of the deaths amount to illegal executions."}
{"original": "duterte — who boasted to the bbc in december that he personally killed three suspects while mayor of the southern city of davao — has remained defiant. he called the united nations high commissioner for human rights zeid ra'ad al hussein an idiot for suggesting the president be investigated for murder after that admission."}
{"original": "as nightly images on television show bodies lying in the streets, public support for duterte's approach is strong. a poll in december by philippine research group social weather stations found 85% of filipinos were satisfied with the anti-drug operations."}
{"original": "but 78% of respondents said they feared that they or someone they know would be killed in the wave of extrajudicial killings. there have been numerous news accounts of bystanders killed in shootouts or unrelated killings taking place under the cover of duterte's drug war."}
{"original": "one widely publicized example was the killing of mark anthony culata, 27, in october in the town of tanza in cavite. culata's body was found mutilated, taped up and bearing a sign that read, i am a pusher."}
{"original": "culata had no record of drug use and was scheduled to head back to saudi arabia, where he worked. a surveillance video showed him being picked up by police, and many in his family are convinced his death was connected to a jealous policeman who was dating culata's ex-girlfriend."}
{"original": "eva culata, the slain man's mother, said the family didn't want his name to be forgotten. we want to seek justice for mark, she said. he does not deserve to die like this."}
{"original": "the national bureau of investigation, the philippine's fbi, is looking into the incident, and four policemen from the town were suspended in september."}
{"original": "police and criminal violence predates duterte's presidency, according to philippine sen. richard gordon, who led a judicial committee that cleared duterte of culpability for the extrajudicial killings in december. gordon said the president's rhetoric inflames the violence, but its roots run deeper."}
{"original": "i think people have missed the point that our system is rotten, gordon said. the whole prosecution system is rotten. the whole investigation system is rotten. there's not enough money for more investigators. there's not enough money for crime laboratories. there's too many passes being issued to people who do crime, and that's what gives them impunity."}
{"original": "the public's distrust and frustration with the system allows duterte's message to resonate, said john gershman, a professor of public service at new york university and an expert on the philippines."}
{"original": "i think he's effectively tapped into this dissatisfaction with the criminal justice system, gershman said."}
{"original": "perhaps the biggest question looming over duterte's drug war is whether he will win it. duterte claims the country of 102 million has 4 million drug users and is in danger of turning into a narco-state. many drug policy experts say that without a public health approach to addiction, drugs and crime will not go away."}
{"original": "you can't kill your way out of this problem or jail your way out of this problem, said sanho tree, director of the drug policy program at the institute for policy studies, a think tank in washington. you can temporarily drive down the market or suppress it, but the moment you let up the pressure — because you haven't treated these people — it's going to cause a huge backlash."}
{"original": "a comparison can be drawn to nearby thailand, which launched a crackdown on drugs in 2003, killing 2,800 people during the first three months of a campaign by then-prime minister thaksin shinawatra. the campaign initially reduced drug consumption, but the prison population soared, and methamphetamine use rose again."}
{"original": "thai justice minister paiboon koomchaya recently proposed that meth be taken off the list of dangerous narcotics, saying measures to suppress drug use have failed."}
{"original": "once duterte has driven away or killed a lot of these gang members, he's creating turf wars that eventually will come back to haunt him and haunt philippine society in my opinion, tree said."}

{"original": "baby boomers should be hanging it up and kicking back."}
{"original": "instead, they're still driving u.s. job growth."}
{"original": "americans 55 and over made up about half of all employment gains in 2018, according to an analysis of labor department data by the liscio report, a research publication for investors. that's an eye-popping share considering that demographic made up only a quarter of last year's labor force -- which includes people working and looking for jobs."}
{"original": "of the 2.9 million new jobs recorded by labor's survey of households last year, 1.4 million were taken by people 55 and over. and in december, 39.2 percent of americans in that age group were working, the largest portion since 1961, according to the monthly employment report labor released on friday."}
{"original": "among the factors behind the numbers: older people want to work longer. the low, 3.9 percent unemployment rate provides them more opportunities as businesses struggle to find qualified job candidates. and lots of workers are simply aging into the 55-and-older bracket while many prime age-americans remain sidelined."}
{"original": "you have an aging workforce, says economist sophia koropeckyj of moody's analytics."}
{"original": "it's not that baby boomers aren't also retiring in droves. an estimated 10,000 a day are calling it quits. it's just that the group is so large that enough are staying in, or returning to, the workforce to provide a welcome labor supply in a tight market."}
{"original": "after being on social security disability for five years, janene evans, 55, of bozeman, montana, decided to get a part-time job as a walmart cashier in 2018 to earn some extra money. although her disability paycheck rose 2.9 percent last year, she also faced a higher health insurance premium."}
{"original": "bozeman area employers are having difficulty finding employees, evans says, adding that walmart managers were disappointed that she couldn't work full-time. help-wanted signs are up everywhere."}

{"original": "overall, older workers are changing the dynamics of the american workplace. while their knowledge and skills make many more productive, others may be less adaptable and savvy about new technology, koropeckyj says."}
{"original": "aarp vice president susan weinstock says older workers bring soft skills gained over a lifetime of work, like calm under the pressure, ability to solve complex problems, ability to listen and be empathetic. these are uniquely human skills that a computer or a robot can't replace."}
{"original": "why older americans are accounting for so many job gains:"}
{"original": "about a third of middle-aged americans plan to work part-time and another 4 percent intend to work full-time after age 65, according to an ipsos/usa today survey in 2017."}
{"original": "many baby boomers can do so because they're healthier and better-educated than their predecessors, allowing them to continue working in white-collar jobs that don't take a big physical toll, koropeckyj says."}
{"original": "and since they're living longer, they'll need a bigger nest egg to fund their retirements, especially since the number of employers providing pensions has been steadily shrinking, says jennifer schramm, senior strategic policy advisor for aarp public policy institute. the great recession compounded the problem by hammering the retirement savings of many older workers, schramm says."}
{"original": "the 2007-09 downturn also left many boomers unemployed. when they finally did get jobs, many had to accept lower-level positions for less pay."}
{"original": "many seniors are having a hard time making ends meet and find they have to work when they had not planned to, says dean baker, cofounder of the center for economic and policy research."}
{"original": "that wasn't the issue for gregory siegelman, 61, who was laid off from his job as a marketing vice president in 2014. although he couldn't land another marketing position, he realized he had lost his passion for the field and could afford to retire. but he was bored."}
{"original": "how much golf can you play? siegelman asks. how many trips can you take?"}
{"original": "i knew i had more juice left in me, he says, and so he sought a job teaching marketing at area colleges. he was repeatedly turned down until he finally snared a full-time job teaching marketing at western kentucky university that began in fall 2017."}
{"original": "while the position pays about a third of his former salary, it allows him to avoid tapping his retirement savings and delay going on social security, a strategy that will increase his monthly social security payments."}
{"original": "i love helping the kids, he says. i enjoy being up on stage. i enjoy sharing my knowledge."}
{"original": "employers are struggling to find workers"}
{"original": "with unemployment at 3.9 percent, it has gotten harder for employers to find qualified workers. in october, there were a near-record 7.1 million job openings but just 6 million unemployed workers, labor figures show. as a result, more employers are willing to hire and accommodate older americans by letting them work from home, for example."}
{"original": "that has drawn in more older workers. the share of 55-to-64 year-olds in the workforce increased to 65.5 percent in december from 64.5 percent a year earlier, koropeckyj notes. and the portion of 65-and-older americans in the labor force averaged 19.6 percent last year, the highest in decades, according to aarp and labor."}
{"original": "the increasing presence of older americans in the job market can at least partly be explained by the sheer size of the boomer generation. there are about 73 million boomers and many of the youngest ones recently entered the 55-plus bracket. that age group accounted for about half of the total 2.6 million increase in the u.s. labor force last year, according moody's and labor."}
{"original": "meanwhile, many americans in their prime working years, age 25 to 54, were laid off during the great recession and went on disability or succumbed to the opioid crisis, koropeckyj says. the share of prime-age americans in the labor force has edged higher in recent years but remains below prerecession levels."}
{"original": "at least part of the surge in older workers last year seems to be related to strong seasonal hiring for temporary jobs in november and december. employment for those 55 and over increased by 342,000 in that period, the largest two-month total since last spring."}

{"original": "president-elect joe biden filled out he last of his big four cabinet positions by choosing judge merrick garland as his attorney general. judge garland has spent the last 25 years on the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia, the most important appellate court in the country, where he established a reputation for careful, thoughtful and centrist jurisprudence. before that, garland spent a few years at the justice department, where he helped supervise several high-profile domestic terrorism investigations and prosecutions, including the cases of the reclusive, terrifying unabomber and the oklahoma city bombing that killed 168 people in 1995. all this gives him a solid background for an attorney general."}
{"original": "most federal appellate judges aren't well-known by the general public. but garland's name is familiar because in 2016, president barack obama named him to fill justice antonin scalia's seat on the supreme court — only to have his nomination languish for 293 days and eventually expire. obama viewed garland as distinguished enough and centrist enough to satisfy republican senators who controlled the senate and were still mourning the loss of scalia, an intellectual powerhouse of judicial conservatism."}
{"original": "one of biden team's toughest jobs"}
{"original": "that didn't work out as planned, but obama was right about garland being no wild-eyed radical. he's a moderate and more inclined to fix things than to break them. and there's a lot to fix. in one sense he's been handed one of the toughest jobs in the biden administration. no department suffered more norm-bending and institutional stress than the justice department under president donald trump."}
{"original": "in another sense, garland's job is easy. to be successful, he need only surpass a very low barr. he could spend his entire tenure in his office playing words with friends and still be counted as a wise and visionary leader by comparison with former attorney general william barr. as biden said thursday at a press conference with garland, you won't work for me. you are not the president or the vice-president's lawyer."}
{"original": "but restoring and safeguarding justice department independence does require creating new mechanisms to ensure that independence, and this will require a great deal of thoughtful, detailed effort. traditionally, we've relied on appropriate restraint by the president and the integrity of justice department lawyers to shield our justice system from political interference. that combination is no longer reliable."}
{"original": "straight talk:trump is an enemy of democracy and his capitol enablers are co-conspirators"}
{"original": "while justice department lawyers were usually able to hold the line, the constant assaults by a president determined to turn the justice department into a tool for his personal political interests has taken a real toll. it will fall to the new attorney general to come up with new mechanisms and procedures that protect the justice department from improper interference while complying with the constitution. it's a complicated balance and not as easy as you might think."}
{"original": "it is also a task at which judge garland should excel. his writings show him to be careful and thoughtful. his 25 years on the d.c. court of appeals, which handles cases involving congress and many government agencies, have given him deep experience with the constitutional nuts and bolts of our system of government. and there is no question that he understands both the problem and the stakes."}
{"original": "garland, calling his return to the department of justice a kind of homecoming, read off a to-do list of basic hygiene — guaranteeing the independence of the department from partisan influence in law enforcement investigations, regulating communications with the white house, establishing guidelines for fbi investigations, ensuring respect for the professionalism of doj's lawyers and agents and setting out principles to guide the exercise of prosecutorial discretion."}
{"original": "assault on democracy:donald trump and his supporters are trying to burn down america. but they won't win."}
{"original": "of course, biden will want his new attorney general to have a hand in criminal justice reform, climate change, immigration and a whole host of other important issues. but it's clear that the biden administration has a lot of pick and shovel work ahead of it clearing away the rubble left behind by trump and rebuilding the foundations of our democracy before we can spend a lot of effort on building policy castles in the air."}
{"original": "this seemed to be on biden's mind when he announced garland's nomination and named committing ourselves to the rule of law and invigorating our domestic and democratic institutions as two of his administration's top priorities. biden also reminded everyone that the justice department was originally founded to fight domestic terrorism after the civil war. after a pro-trump mob's attack wednesday on the capitol, it looks like judge garland's experience prosecuting domestic terrorism will come in handy."}

{"original": "you probably don't need me to tell you that the travel industry is always looking for creative ways to persuade you to pay extra for your flights, hotels and rental cars. but you, like voss, probably thought the best rate guarantee was a reliable safeguard. it turns out there are few ways to ensure you've paid the lowest price, and the best-rate guarantee isn't one one of them."}
{"original": "after he submitted a claim, a marriott representative turned down voss' request for a refund. he'd dotted every i, and crossed every t, even taking screen shots of the hotels.com site to prove it was offering a lower rate."}
{"original": "they said they couldn't verify the hotels.com price, says voss, a retired air traffic controller from chicago. of course they couldn't."}
{"original": "a marriott representative said its rate guarantee is legit, but comes with a few restrictions. special rates don't qualify and it must be able to independently verify the price. in his case, voss booked a special aaa rate on the marriott site, and the hotel couldn't confirm the hotels.com price."}

{"original": "another site that can help is yapta.com (accessible via kayak at my.yapta.com/airline-refunds). the service tracks your flight or hotel rate after you've booked, and lets you know if there's a lower price. for example, alaska airlines will offer a refund if any of its prices drop after you've booked, and jetblue and virgin america will offer a refund if there's a price drop of $75 or more."}
{"original": "but can you actually automate the search for the lowest prices, in the same way travel companies harness entire server farms to do their bidding? kind of. invisiblehand (getinvisiblehand.com) is an app that runs on your desktop and searches for the lowest prices on hotels, flights, rental cars and other products, such as electronics. true to its name, invisiblehand doesn't pop up until it finds something, and even then, it displays the results discreetly at the top of your browser."}

{"original": "frustrated by what they see as the trump administration's decision to de-emphasize the danger posed by climate change, local government officials, nonprofit leaders and university researchers are busily forging ahead with limited resources in a piecemeal approach they say is better than nothing. they're hardening buildings, digging bigger storm drains and changing zoning laws to keep homes from being built in low-lying areas prone to flooding."}
{"original": "while many cities and states are also trying to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases to slow global warming, these more concrete efforts are aimed at mitigating the actual impacts of climate change, which many elected officials say is politically easier to tackle."}
{"original": "climate change is real and it's impacting our city right now, said walsh. we just can't back down from the threat regardless of what's happening in washington, d.c. i would love to have a strong federal partner. we don't have that right now. but that doesn't mean we stop."}
{"original": "an exhaustive federal report issued last month warned that climate change could, under a worst-case scenario, deliver a 10 percent hit to the nation's gdp by the end of the century. the 1,600-page national climate assessment details the climate and economic impacts u.s. residents will see if drastic action is not taken to address climate change."}

{"original": "i've seen it. i've read some of it. it's fine, trump told reporters at the time. speaking about the potential economic impacts, trump said, i don't believe it."}
{"original": "broad scientific consensus says the earth's climate is warming, and that humans are accelerating that process though the burning of fossil fuels. climate change threatens the health and well-being of the american people by causing increasing extreme weather, changes to air quality, the spread of new diseases by insects and pests, and changes to the availability of food and water, the nca researchers said."}
{"original": "the report says the changing climate poses a cascading series of linked risks, like storms destroying aging bridges and roads, which will then make it harder to move food and fuel around the country, and droughts making it harder for power plants across the west to safely generate electricity due to a lack of required cooling water. meanwhile, larger insect populations in northern areas could bring more lyme, west nile and zika infections to areas that were once free of them."}
{"original": "earth's climate is now changing faster than at any point in the history of modern civilization, primarily as a result of human activities, the report concluded."}
{"original": "experts say the devastating and unusually powerful hurricanes that have struck the east coast over the past decade have done more than any politician could to raise awareness of just how much risk the nation faces. heavy flooding in texas, warming ocean waters in the pacific northwest and new england, and eroding islands in alaska are adding even more weight. scientists for years have been warning that ocean levels are rising, and that storms will become more violent."}
{"original": "the number of people having that conversation is larger today than it ever has been in the past, said mark misczak, who a longtime emergency manager who spent the bulk of his career as a federal emergency management agency leader under multiple presidents. the disasters, as terrible as it sounds, provide an opportunity to re-envision how things function and to consider that resiliency."}
{"original": "across the country, communities large and small are drawing on university experts and nonprofit scientists to help chart their course, which they say must be laid down to prepare for future climate-related disasters."}
{"original": "some of the efforts are small, like denver's decision to create a list of air-conditioned facilities where residents can take refuge during heat waves. others are more ambitious: in alaska, officials are preparing to relocate several native villages in danger of being washed away by seas that no longer freeze solid for months at a time. many more fall into the middle, like the decision by florida keys officials to raise up portions of their low-lying roads to serve as flood barriers, or efforts by austin, texas, to reduce water consumption in anticipation of droughts in."}
{"original": "it's really simple: this isn't a political issue. the changes we are seeing firsthand are affecting our communities, our economies, affecting ways of life that have existed for millennia, said michael levine of the nonprofit ocean conservancy, which has worked on climate change issues in alaska. we simply don't have a choice. it is incumbent on us as alaskans to work together. we are past the point of fighting about who did what, who caused what, or what the political consequences might be. our way of life depends on adapting to the changes that are happening."}
{"original": "for many, dealing with climate change is inherently a political issue. a december report issued by the state of texas about the need to future-proof the state from worsening natural disasters never directly mentions climate change, or the role that humans have played in emitting heat-trapping carbon dioxide by burning the oil and gas texas has long been known for."}
{"original": "republican gov. greg abbott, in releasing the report, said it was impossible for him to say whether climate change is causing the worsening disasters hitting texas."}
{"original": "we need to stop making the old mistakes in local development that expose homes and businesses to risks that only become apparent when disaster strikes, according to the report. to paraphrase the old saying, an ounce of preparation is worth a pound of cure."}
{"original": "while climate change has largely broken down along partisan lines at the state and federal level, the nation's mayors have overwhelmingly put aside political parties to address the issue. a survey of mayors this year found that 57 percent of cities are planning to take climate-related actions in 2019. and dozens of the country's largest cities have committed to meeting the terms of the 2025 paris agreement on climate change, which trump is withdrawing from on a national level."}
{"original": "i think every mayor in the country would say it's their responsibility to do something, said james brainard, the longtime mayor of carmel, indiana. our mayors are not sitting back. the mayors are the closest elected officials to the people and the mayors can make this happen regardless of what the federal government does."}
{"original": "brainard, a republican, said he doesn't consider climate change a political issue, but he acknowledged he sometimes has to tailor his message for different audiences. liberal groups, for instance, love that the city replaced it's streetlights with leds, reducing electricity consumption and therefore the emission of greenhouse gasses. conservative groups, he said, are usually more interested in the fact that the switch saves the city 20 percent on its electricity bill annually."}
{"original": "now, carmel is installing solar panels to generate its own electricity, which will save taxpayers money and ensure the lights are more likely to stay on if a disaster knocks out major power lines outside city boundaries."}
{"original": "everybody sees local government as the pothole in front of their house, the zoning down the street. they don't think about these global issues, brainard said. and i think it's the job of local leaders to explain why it's important and to lead on it."}
{"original": "many local officials say the federal government should play a stronger role in increasing a cohesive strategy to combat the effects of climate change, but find themselves frustrated by trump's apparent willingness to dismiss scientific concerns. in absence of that leadership, they're forging ahead."}
{"original": "there's a sense from cities and states across the country that we want to be part of the solution, and that just because the federal government isn't doing it doesn't mean the united states isn't, said sally jewell, a former interior secretary in the obama administration. we're not going to stop and wait for that (trump administration) priority to change."}
{"original": "jewell is now working at the university of washington as a distinguished fellow with the college of the environment and as chair of the advisory council for earthlab, the university's new institute dedicated to connecting researchers with people on the front lines of climate change and environmental challenges."}
{"original": "earthlab offers solutions both large and small, including helping washington state's oyster farmers deal with more acidic oceans by showing them how to adjust the ph level of the water surrounding young oysters, known as spats."}
{"original": "misczak said local governments often find success when they tie climate-resiliency efforts to impacts on local businesses. and he said that while the federal government can provide leadership, it's usually a series of seemingly small decisions made at the local level that can truly make a difference: can homes be built in floodplains? how tough is the building code? are local emergency services designed to operate in an actual emergency? are emergency generators sitting in basements that could get flooded, or installed atop parking garages, where they'll be better protected?"}
{"original": "we're getting better. but we're not doing enough yet. we're making progress. and the more we can showcase the solutions that have been effective, the more communities will consider building things that way from the start, said misczak, who is now senior managing director at witt o'brien's, an international crisis and emergency response consulting company."}
{"original": "back in boston, walsh is trying to figure out how to get funding for the city's climate resiliency plan. taxpayers will contribute 10 percent of all new capital funding in the city toward resilience, but the mayor knows he needs more help from businesses, and the state and federal government."}
{"original": "the city has already installed an approximately $100,000, 7-foot-high barrier in order to block floodwaters from the homes of 4,300 residents and at least 70 businesses in the east boston neighborhood. the barrier across the east boston greenway normally lays flat across the path but can be raised during storms. boston used to be more protected from storms and high tides by the tidal flats that surrounded the city, but those areas have either been developed on or dredged away to deepen the harbor."}
{"original": "bigger solutions come with bigger price tags: just fully protecting east boston, home to boston logan international airport, could cost the city up to $200 million. but city officials say that would ultimately prevent more than $443 million in estimated damage from a large storm. researchers expect sea levels to rise 36 inches by 2070, leaving boston with the likelihood of being flooded every month during the highest tide."}
{"original": "the city's overall climate resiliency plan has no official price tag, but boston officials say it would pale in comparison to the damage done by a major hurricane: 2012's superstorm sandy did at least $32 billion in damage to new york city's streets, subway tunnels, homes and businesses, and killed at least 43 people. and that was just a single storm."}
{"original": "we're not just planning for the next storm we'll face, we're planning for the storms the next generation will face, walsh said. whatever the federal policy is, it's still going to be incumbent on local leaders to carry out these plans. there's no question that our environment is in trouble, and humans are responsible."}

{"original": "four other house republicans – rodney davis of illinois, peter king of new york, christopher smith of new jersey and steve stivers of ohio – voted for some of the outstanding spending bills."}
{"original": "here's a look at the eight who joined democrats on all three bills:"}
{"original": "fitzpatrick, a former fbi special agent and federal prosecutor representing a swing district in the southeast corner of pennsylvania, was first elected in 2016 on a promise of bipartisanship."}
{"original": "in his first term, he sided with democrats on about one-quarter of the votes that split the two parties, including opposing republicans' obamacare alternative. fitzpatrick's re-election bid, which he won with 51 percent of the vote, was endorsed by the afl-cio and former democratic rep. gabby giffords, who advocates for gun control."}
{"original": "shutdowns are costly and unnecessary, and i will work with both sides to find a solution, fitzpatrick said last week."}
{"original": "herrera beutler's 52.7 percent victorylast fall was the fifth-term representative'sclosest race in her southwest washington state district."}
{"original": "she's called the shutdown showdown ludicrous."}
{"original": "there's a solution at hand, if politicians grow up, stop worrying about which side is 'winning' the political fight (spoiler alert: they're both losing), and deliver results, she recently wrote."}
{"original": "herrera beutler, the daughter of a mexican-american and the great-granddaughter of immigrants, was one of a few republicans in 2016 to back a democratic effort to encourage the defense department to welcome the service of some illegal immigrants who were brought into the country as children."}
{"original": "in the 2016 presidential election, herrera beutler voted for paul ryan instead of trump. she announced her decision after the release of the 2005 access hollywood videotape in which trump bragged about groping women by their genitals."}
{"original": "hurd has squeaked by in his three elections in a district dominated by mexican-americans. after opposing the border wall, hurd won re-election in november by fewer than 1,000 votes."}
{"original": "hurd, whose texas district encompasses nearly half of the border with mexico, has called a wall the most expensive, least effective way to do border security."}
{"original": "the thing that i've been hearing is they need technology, they need additional manpower, hurd, a former undercover cia agent, told npr thursday."}
{"original": "katko was re-elected to a third term with 53 percent, his closest race yet in a predominately rural, swing district in new york that hillary clinton won in 2016."}
{"original": "katko crosses party lines more often than most members of the house and is unafraid to do so on big issues. in addition to opposing the gop health care bill in 2017, he took the rare step last week of voting for democrats' rules for governing the house. katko did so because democrats included changes to make it easier to advance bills with broad bipartisan support."}
{"original": "katko said his votes to fund the shuttered government agencies are consistent with a promise he made when he first ran for office that i would never vote to shut down the government or to continue a government shutdown."}
{"original": "i am in favor of securing our borders, katko tweeted, but shutting down the government is never the answer."}
{"original": "kinzinger was first elected to congress from illinois in the tea party-fueled election wave of 2010 that helped republicans win the house. but he's accused tea party republicans of making it harder for others to win competitive districts."}
{"original": "kinzinger belongs to groups aimed at bringing together lawmakers from both sides of the aisle to forge bipartisan compromises. in 2015, he joined with democrats to fund the department of homeland security without including a gop amendment to undo president barack obama's protections for young undocumented immigrants. the amendment would have kept the funding bill from passing the senate."}
{"original": "i think shutdowns are stupid, kinzinger recently told cnn. i think it's the dumbest way to do government in the world."}
{"original": "willing to take party to task"}
{"original": "stefanik quickly became a rising star in the republican party when, at age 30, she became the then-youngest woman ever elected to congress."}
{"original": "in november, stefanik was re-elected to a third term in her upstate new york district with 56 percent of the vote, after including a shot of trump campaigning with her in one of her campaign ads. she was also in charge ofrecruiting candidates for house republicans for last year's midterms. but after the election, stefanik took her party to task for not doing enough to help elect women and minorities."}
{"original": "stefanik said she's backed bills to fund shuttered government agencies because i oppose government shutdowns and in congress have consistently voted to keep the government open."}
{"original": "taking the 'poison out of politics'"}
{"original": "upton's re-election bid for a 17th term was his closest ever, winning with just about half the votes in his southwestern corner of michigan."}
{"original": "although upton helped organize a tuesday lunch bunch for republicans to discuss a centrist agenda, his voting record has been mostly conservative, according to congressional quarterly."}
{"original": "but after his close re-election, upton called for looking beyond the labels of democrat and republican to take this poison out of politics."}
{"original": "on the government shutdown, upton said he will continue to work with others to both fully fund the government and secure the border."}
{"original": "walden is the only republican in congress from oregon, representing a district that trump won by 19 percentage points. although his bid for a 12th term wasn't close, his 57 percent win was his smallest general election victory."}
{"original": "walden led the campaign arm of house republicans in the 2014 and 2016 elections and votes with republicans more than 90 percent of the time. but as the new congress convened last week, walden said he looked forward to reaching across the aisle to find bipartisan solutions."}
{"original": "of his votes to reopen parts of the government, walden said he has empathy for federal workers and their families caught up in the impasse."}

{"original": "most u.s. investors don't think much about currency exposure. but foreign exchange plays a major role in global commerce, and as shareholders in multinationals based in the u.s. can attest, fluctuations in the value of the u.s. dollar can have a huge impact on stock prices."}
{"original": "to help people hedge foreign exchange risk, currency etfs offer investors direct exposure to changes in currency values. 2017 was a generally weak year for the u.s. dollar, and the performance of some key currency etfs shows the crosscurrents around the world for the greenback."}

{"original": "how these currency etfs gave investors foreign exchange exposure"}
{"original": "the way currency etfs generally work is fairly simple. the underlying fund opens positions in the underlying foreign currency, either through direct short-term investments or by using futures contracts. the value of the positions moves up or down in line with the appreciation or depreciation of the specified foreign currency, less any expenses that the fund bears. for the currencyshares funds above, one share of a currency etf is equivalent to a fixed amount of currency, although that amount has fallen over time because of the need for the funds to pay expenses from their own resources. low interest rates have meant that the income that these funds produce internally is insufficient to cover expenses in some cases."}
{"original": "why the dollar sank in 2017"}
{"original": "a look at returns for these etfs shows the prevailing trends across the global economy. the euro surged in 2017, largely due to stronger economic growth for the eurozone than most analysts had anticipated coming into the year. brexit-related concerns that elections in key countries like france and germany would potentially bring in anti-euro leaders proved unwarranted, and geopolitical pressures combined with less accommodative interest rate policy in the u.s. has made the european currency more attractive by comparison."}
{"original": "many of the same factors helped lift the british pound as well. manufacturing activity in the u.k. has been relatively strong, and the fact that the brexit decision hasn't led to widespread economic disruptions as initially feared has lent greater stability to the market."}
{"original": "meanwhile, recoveries in commodity prices have helped strengthen economies that rely heavily on natural resources. currency prices in brazil, australia, and canada had all suffered when prices of oil and various precious and industrial metals had fallen in past years, but the recovery in crude and the boom in many base metals have helped lead to a recovery for the three currencies."}
{"original": "on the pacific rim, initial projections had expected dollar weakening against currencies in japan and china as well, but the damage was not nearly as substantial as some had feared. gains in economic strength haven't been as substantial in asia as they have been in europe, and so cross-currency trading between the euro and the major asian currencies has helped keep exchange rate gains in u.s. dollar terms somewhat in check. the same impact helped hold the swiss franc down, with efforts to prevent its appreciation against the euro in past years finally leading to a shift back down toward the relative levels that had prevailed before 2015."}
{"original": "keep your eyes on currency in 2018"}
{"original": "relatively few investors buy shares of currency etfs, and the risks involved aren't so strong as to make hedging investments required for ordinary investors. knowing what's happening in foreign exchange markets is nevertheless helpful to understand the impacts on many key players in the global economy."}

{"original": "even among their own supporters, sanders and warren struggle on this measure: 61% of sanders' supporters say his ability to lead the military is a strength, and 23% call it a weakness; for warren, 58% of supporters say her ability to lead the military is a strength, and 29% call it a weakness."}

{"original": "let us sit back, just for a moment, and absorb the reality of the revelations of the past few days."}
{"original": "for apparently the first time in history, the president of the united states himself was the subject of a counterintelligence investigation. this means that his ties to a hostile power were significant enough to overcome the high bar the fbi would have to clear to investigate any american for possibly being influenced or compromised by another country — much less its own chief executive."}
{"original": "we have also learned that the president has gone to extraordinary lengths to conceal his discussions with an enemy foreign leader not only from intelligence and foreign policy figures in his own administration, but even from the senior officials of his own oval office. it should go without saying that he has tried, in this area as in so many others, to wall himself off from congressional oversight."}
{"original": "the president himself is always a reliable barometer of the importance of such revelations, and his panicky tweeting and a subsequent bizarre interview on fox news (where else?) suggest that these reports are indeed bombshells."}
{"original": "the president's enablers are dismissing all of this as just more of a deep state conspiracy set in motion by an fbi aggrieved by the firing of james comey. the enraged trump opponents who call themselves the resistance are convinced that this is evidence not only of russian influence, but of a manchurian candidate who is now the red president."}
{"original": "trump clearly has something to hide"}
{"original": "the deep state story is nonsense. the mole in the oval image, meanwhile, is too extreme — but not as crazy a theory as it was a year or two ago. the president clearly has something to hide. as i have written many times over the past two years, it is highly unlikely that there is any innocent explanation for the remarkable frequency and depth of the trump coterie's interactions with russia for some 30 years, and especially during the campaign."}
{"original": "while trump is not an agent of the russian federation (too many people use this kind of language without knowing what it means to counterintelligence officials), it seems at this point beyond argument that the president personally fears russian president vladimir putin for reasons that can only suggest the existence of compromising information."}

{"original": "first, the existence of the counterintelligence investigation is not a scandal. indeed, it would be scandal if we had found out today that the fbi had not launched an investigation."}
{"original": "trump's behavior regarding russia has always presented a serious security concern. but when trump fires the director of the fbi, and then brags about it to actual russians, only the most stupid or craven law enforcement agency would decline to investigate what to any counterintelligence officer would be the brightest of dozens of flashing red lights. the white house communications shop can throw invective at james comey and other justice department officials, but the fbi had no choice. it was doing the job americans count on it to do."}
{"original": "second, the president's attempts to hide the content of his conversations with putin are not only abnormal but also deeply suspect. the intelligence community, members of congress and the public should always be anxious whenever any american official talks to a top russian leader and then tries to seize the notes. this kind of behavior violates practices of sensible diplomacy and intelligence analysis, and no one acts this way for innocent reasons."}
{"original": "nor are conversations between the president and putin merely some personal matter. such discussions might in fact need to be confidential; sensitive diplomacy often requires a close hold on the informal back-and-forth between top leaders. but their content should be known at the very least to the administration's own top intelligence and foreign policy advisers."}

{"original": "finally, it is exhausting but nonetheless necessary to point out again the titanic hypocrisy of the republican party and of trump's apologists in the conservative media. if president barack obama had shredded his notes of a meeting with the iranian president, or if hillary clinton's campaign manager were sitting in jail for lying about meeting a chinese business associate — and alleged intelligence officer — to share polling data, that alone would have been enough for the gop to impeach everyone from the president to the white house chef."}

{"original": "what happens next is unknowable. but for the president's supporters to double down in the face of mounting evidence that the president himself is, in some way, compromised by our most dedicated enemy, while making excuses for his secretive behavior by attacking the men and women of the fbi, is a road so dark that perhaps even joseph mccarthy would not have dared walk it."}

{"original": "but more importantly, property along the rail lines, and especially near the stations, becomes more valuable in most cases. developers are thus encouraged to cough up big consideration (sometimes actual bribes, sometimes bribes disguised as political support) to politicians to get the stations put where they want. and one reason they're willing to pay big is that, once the rails are laid and the stations are built, the politicians can't go back on their word. a development along a bus line isn't worth as much because you have only a politician's unsupported promise not to move it, and nobody much trusts a politician's unsupported promises. as bloomberg view's megan mcardle observes: so, ironically, the very fact that it is a big, risky investment may help everyone agree to rapidly develop a streetcar route, generating tax revenue for a city, cash for developers, and votes and campaign contributions for the politicians who install the thing. it's hideously inefficient, of course ... but that's politics for you."}
{"original": "want to know why voters are so mad? mia love has the answer: glenn reynolds"}
{"original": "this analysis goes far beyond buses. the explanation for why politicians don't do all sorts of reasonable-sounding things usually boils down to insufficient opportunities for graft. and, conversely, the reason why politicians choose to do many of the things that they do is ... you guessed it, sufficient opportunities for graft."}
{"original": "that graft may come in the form of bags of cash, or shady real-estate deals, or consulting gigs for a brother-in-law or child, but it may also come in broader terms of political support and even in opportunities for politicians to feel superior or to humiliate their enemies. what all these things have in common, though, is that they're not about making life better for voters. they're about making life better for politicians."}
{"original": "this doesn't sound much like the traditional view of politics, as embodied in, say, the schoolhouse rock i'm just a bill video. but it's a view of politics that explains an awful lot."}
{"original": "and there's a whole field of economics based on this view, called public choice economics. nobel prize winning economist james buchanan referred to public choice economics as politics without romance. instead of being selfless civil servants motivated solely by the public good, public choice economics assumes that politicians are, like other human beings, heavily influenced by self-interest."}

{"original": "how do they get away with this? first, most voters are rationally ignorant. that is, they realize that their vote isn't likely to make much of a difference, so it's not rational to learn all the ins and outs of policy or of what political leaders are doing. second, the entire system is designed — by politicians, naturally — to make it harder for voters to keep track of what politicians are doing. the people who have a bigger stake in things — the real estate developers or construction unions — have an incentive to keep track of things, and to influence them, that ordinary voters don't."}
{"original": "can we eliminate this problem? nope. but we can make it worse, or better. the more the government does and the more decisions that are relegated to bureaucrats, guidance and other forms of decisionmaking that are far from the public eye, the more freedom politicians have to pursue their own interest at the expense of the public — all while, of course, claiming to do just the opposite. meanwhile, if we do the opposite — give the government less power and demand more accountability — politicians can get away with less. but they'll always get away with as much as they can."}

{"original": "washington – a powerful federal appeals court in the nation's capital sided with the trump administration friday on its military transgender ban, but other courts' blockades of the policy remain in effect."}
{"original": "a three-judge panel of the u.s. court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit ruled that the partial ban announced by the pentagon, but never implemented, should not have been blocked by a district court while it was being challenged."}
{"original": "the three judges on the panel were appointed by presidents ronald reagan, george w. bush and barack obama."}
{"original": "in reversing one of four federal courts to have blocked the policy, the panel reasoned that it was not a blanket ban and had been fine-tuned by pentagon officials over a period of months. considerable deference is owed the executive branch on military decisions, it said."}
{"original": "the government took substantial steps to cure the procedural deficiencies the court identified in the enjoined 2017 presidential memorandum, the panel said."}
{"original": "the partial ban plausibly relies upon the 'considered professional judgment' of 'appropriate military officials,' and appears to permit some transgender individuals to serve in the military, it said."}
{"original": "the policy, which reversed one allowing transgender service under the obama administration, was announced by trump in a tweet july 2017. he said transgender troops were no longer welcome in the military, and the military would no longer pay for their surgeries."}
{"original": "pentagon leaders under defense secretary jim mattis responded by reassuring transgender troops that they would not be kicked out and that their medical care would not be interrupted until a new policy was created. the formal plan was announced last spring and included exceptions for those already serving and others who are not transitioning to the opposite sex."}

{"original": "tehran, iran - former iranian president akbar hashemi rafsanjani, a wily political survivor and multimillionaire mogul who remained among the ruling elite despite moderate views, died sunday, state tv reported. he was 82."}
{"original": "iranian media reported earlier sunday that he was taken to a hospital north of tehran because of a heart condition. state television broke into programming to announce his death, the female newscaster's voice quivering as she read the news."}
{"original": "she said rafsanjani, after a life full of restless efforts in the path of islam and revolution, had departed for lofty heaven."}
{"original": "rafsanjani's mix of sly wit and reputation for cunning moves — both in politics and business — earned him a host of nicknames such as akbar shah, or great king, during a life that touched every major event in iranian affairs since before the 1979 islamic revolution."}
{"original": "his presence — whether directly or through back channels — was felt in many forms. he was a steady leader in the turbulent years following the overthrow of the u.s.-backed shah, a veteran warrior in the country's internal political battles and a covert go-between in intrigue such as the iran-contra arms deals in the 1980s."}
{"original": "he also was handed an unexpected political resurgence in his later years."}
{"original": "the surprise presidential election in 2013 of rafsanjani's political soul mate, hassan rouhani, gave the former president an insider role in reform-minded efforts that included rouhani's push for direct nuclear talks with washington."}
{"original": "rouhani's victory was also another example of rafsanjani's remarkable political luck. rafsanjani was blocked from the ballot by iran's election overseers — presumably worried about boosting his already wide-ranging influence. but, in the end, many moderates turned to rouhani as an indirect vote for rafsanjani."}
{"original": "it came after years of dwindling influence. another presidential comeback bid was snuffed out by mahmoud ahmadinejad's surprise victory in 2005 elections."}
{"original": "rafsanjani was a close aide of ayatollah ruhollah khomeini, the leader of the 1979 islamic revolution, and went on to serve as president from 1989 to 1997 during a period of significant changes in iran. at the time, the country was struggling to rebuild its economy after a devastating 1980-88 war with iraq, while also cautiously allowing some wider freedoms, as seen in iran's highly regarded film and media industry."}
{"original": "he also oversaw key developments in iran's nuclear program by negotiating deals with russia to build an energy-producing reactor in bushehr, which finally went into service in 2011 after long delays. behind the scenes, he directed the secret purchase of technology and equipment from pakistan and elsewhere."}
{"original": "rafsanjani managed to remain within the ruling theocracy after leaving office, but any dreams of taking on a higher-profile elder statesman role collapsed with ahmadinejad's disputed re-election in 2009 and the intense crackdown that followed. rafsanjani's harsh criticism of ahmadinejad branded him as a dissenter in the eyes of many conservatives."}
{"original": "in a sign of his waning powers, rafsanjani's stance cost him his position as one of the friday prayer leaders at tehran university, a highly influential position that often is the forum for significant policy statements."}
{"original": "but some analysts believe that rafsanjani was kept within the ruling fold as a potential mediator with america and its allies in the standoff over iran's nuclear program. his past stature as a trusted khomeini ally also offered him political protection. rafsanjani was a top commander in the war with iraq and played a key role in convincing khomeini to accept a cease-fire as it became clear that extending the stalemate could pose a crippling drain on iran's economy."}
{"original": "nearly 25 years later, rafsanjani tried to revive his credentials among a new generation of reformers by recounting proposals he made to khomeini in the late 1980s to consider outreach to the united states, still seen by hard-liners as the great satan."}
{"original": "his image, however, also had darker undertones. he was named by prosecutors in argentina among iranian officials suspected of links to a 1994 bombing of a jewish center in buenos aires that left 85 people dead. some iranian reformers accused him of involvement in the slaying of liberals and dissidents during his presidency — charges that were never pursued by iranian authorities."}
{"original": "the title of islamic republic is not just a formality, he said in 2009 in the chaos after ahmadinejad's re-election."}
{"original": "rest assured, if one of those two aspects is damaged we will lose our revolution. if it loses its islamic aspect, we will go astray. if it loses its republican aspect, (the islamic republic) will not be realized. based on the reasons that i have offered, without people and their vote there would be no islamic system."}

{"original": "washington — vice president pence repeatedly made headlines during a four-day trip to the middle east taken weeks after the trump administration recognized jerusalem as the capital of israel —– a move that sparked protests throughout the region after trump's december announcement."}
{"original": "here are highlights from the trip, which ended tuesday with a visit to the yad vashem holocaust memorial and to the western wall."}
{"original": "addressing the israeli parliament monday, pence announced the u.s. embassy will move from tel aviv to jerusalem in 2019. that's a faster timetable than administration officials had projected after trump announced in december that the united states would recognize jerusalem as israel's capital. while the announcement was applauded by christian conservatives in the unites states — a strong base of support for the trump administration with close ties to pence — christian leaders in the middle east canceled meetings with pence that had been on the original schedule before the trip got pushed into january. palestinian authority president mahmoud abbas also called off a planned meeting with pence in bethlehem after the december announcement."}
{"original": "arab lawmakers interrupted the start of pence's speech with protest signs proclaiming that jerusalem is the capital of palestine. they were pushed out of the chamber by knesset security officers as other lawmakers loudly applauded. continuing his opening remarks, pence called it deeply humbling for me to stand before this vibrant democracy. pence received a lengthy standing ovation after his speech. but the chief negotiator for the palestinians tweeted that the messianic discourse of pence is a gift to extremists & has proven that the us administration is part of the problem rather than the solution."}
{"original": "the criticism pence faced from palestinians was offset by the love he got from israelis. israeli president reuven rivlin summed up his effusive praise of pence, as someone who stands very firm behind your words, by saying there is only one word to describe him: a mensch. that's the highest of jewish compliments,the jerusalem post reported."}
{"original": "prime minister benjamin netanyahu told pence that the day i met you, i knew you were a true friend. netanyahu also said he was touched to learn from pence that he has a photo of their 2009 meeting in the vice president's residence, in washington."}

{"original": "while pence insisted that recognizing jerusalem as the capital of israel makes a peace agreement more possible, not less, an administration official told reporters there has been no contact with the palestinian leadership since the announcement. pence told reuters the white house is working with partners in the region to develop a framework for a peace agreement. but, pence said, it all just depends now on when the palestinians are going to come back to the table."}
{"original": "in an interview with the associated press in jerusalem, pence offered his first response to reports that trump referred to haiti and african nations as shithole countries, and that trump had an affair with an adult film actress in 2005, shortly after melania trump gave birth to his youngest son. although the wall street journal reported that trump's lawyer paid the actress to not talk to reporters before the 2016 election, pence called the allegations baseless. trump has also denied making the shithole countries comments, reportedly made during discussions about whether to include immigrants from el salvador, haiti and african countries in an immigration bill. pence told the associated press that he knows the president's heart and trump wants a merit-based system that doesn't consider an immigrant's race or creed."}
{"original": "while other parts of the federal government prepared for a shutdown, the white house said pence's trip would proceed as scheduled because it was integral to america's national security & diplomatic objectives. but pence took the unusual step of giving reporters internet access during his departure flight friday night so reporters traveling with him could send out a statement from pence blaming democrats for the showdown that has dangerous consequences for our national defense. pence repeated his criticism of democrats while visiting a military facility near the syrian border. bill kristol, who was the top aide to vice president dan quayle and is a critic of the trump administration, tweeted that it was depressing for the vice president to use american troops as props for a partisan political message."}

{"original": "information received since the federal open market committee met in december suggests that labor market conditions improved further even as economic growth slowed late last year. household spending and business fixed investment have been increasing at moderate rates in recent months, and the housing sector has improved further; however, net exports have been soft and inventory investment slowed. a range of recent labor market indicators, including strong job gains, points to some additional decline in underutilization of labor resources. inflation has continued to run below the committee's 2 percent longer-run objective, partly reflecting declines in energy prices and in prices of non-energy imports. market-based measures of inflation compensation declined further; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed, on balance, in recent months."}
{"original": "fed: rates steady, no retreat from march hike � yet"}
{"original": "consistent with its statutory mandate, the committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability. the committee currently expects that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace and labor market indicators will continue to strengthen. inflation is expected to remain low in the near term, in part because of the further declines in energy prices, but to rise to 2 percent over the medium term as the transitory effects of declines in energy and import prices dissipate and the labor market strengthens further. the committee is closely monitoring global economic and financial developments and is assessing their implications for the labor market and inflation, and for the balance of risks to the outlook."}
{"original": "given the economic outlook, the committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 1/4 to 1/2 percent. the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative, thereby supporting further improvement in labor market conditions and a return to 2 percent inflation."}
{"original": "in determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation. this assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments. in light of the current shortfall of inflation from 2 percent, the committee will carefully monitor actual and expected progress toward its inflation goal. the committee expects that economic conditions will evolve in a manner that will warrant only gradual increases in the federal funds rate; the federal funds rate is likely to remain, for some time, below levels that are expected to prevail in the longer run. however, the actual path of the federal funds rate will depend on the economic outlook as informed by incoming data."}
{"original": "the committee is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over maturing treasury securities at auction, and it anticipates doing so until normalization of the level of the federal funds rate is well under way. this policy, by keeping the committee's holdings of longer-term securities at sizable levels, should help maintain accommodative financial conditions."}

{"original": "yes, a new study indicates that those saving for retirement will need to increase dramatically the percent they save for retirement if they want to fund their desired standard of living in retirement."}
{"original": "consider: americans presently save on average 5.5% and 401(k) plan participants deferred, on average, 6.8% of their salaries into retirement plans in 2015. but those savings rates are far below what's needed to fund retirement given today's markets, according to the researchers, david blanchett, head of retirement research at morningstar investment management, michael finke, dean and chief academic officer at the american college of financial services, and wade pfau, a professor of retirement income at the american college of financial services."}
{"original": "indeed, the researchers showed that a 35-year-old couple with household income of $50,000 would need to save pre-tax about 11.1% to 13.1% to maintain their standard of living while the same couple with household income of $100,000 would need to save 13.4% to 16.8%."}
{"original": "what gives? several factors are to blame."}
{"original": "valuations on risky assets (stocks) are high and yields on safe assets (bonds) are low. and that, the researchers say, portends an era of lower expected returns in the future. what's more, the researchers say high asset prices and expected lower returns affect the relative cost of funding financial goals."}
{"original": "for example, assume a household earns $50,000 at age 25, expects a 3% annual growth rate in income, and wants $1 million in purchasing power after age 65, the researchers wrote in their report, required retirement savings rates today. if they expect a 5% real return on investments, they will save 10% of their income each year. if they expect 2%, they will need to save 18% of their income each year to reach their $1 million goal."}
{"original": "the researchers also note that a persistently low-return environment not only increases the percentage of income a person needs to save to meet a retirement goal but it also reduces the income a person can expect to receive once that goal is reached."}
{"original": "for instance, a 35-year-old who earns $50,000 and who will experience real wage growth of 1% per year for a 30-year career, followed by a 30-year retirement could drawdown, assuming a real return of 0%, just $28,988 per year compared to $46,938 with a 6% expected rate of return."}
{"original": "for savers, lower returns mean less spending across the life cycle, said finke, a co-author of the report they spend less during their working years because they need to save more. during retirement, their goal should be to spend about the same as they did during their working years. even though they'll be spending less, they need an even higher nest egg when investment returns are low. there's really nothing good about low returns if you're a saver. if you're a borrower, it's great news."}
{"original": "longevity makes retirement more expensive, too"}
{"original": "that life expectancies for older americans has increased over the last 100 years and are projected to continue increasing isn't helping those saving for retirement either."}
{"original": "today's workers who expect to retire at the same age as retirees in previous generations will face an even greater cost of funding retirement because of increases in longevity after the age of 65, the researchers wrote. retirement is significantly more expensive in a low-return environment, but it is even more expensive if a person lives longer."}
{"original": "in fact, the researchers calculated that the price of a dollar of safe income for a person retiring today is nearly 100% higher (or twice as high today) than it was for a person retiring in the year 2000 because of increases in longevity and declines in real bond interest rates."}
{"original": "not only are investors getting less return on their safe bond investments, notes finke. they're also living longer, so they need to fund more years of spending. the bottom line is that retirement is just more expensive today than it was in the past."}
{"original": "the researchers also note that trying to create a sum of money to pass down, to bequest, to loved ones and others on top of funding a desired lifestyle in retirement is also quite expensive in a high asset price/low expected returns world."}
{"original": "for those who want to leave $500,000 to their heirs, they'll simply need to save more, says finke. low rates also increase the cost of buying a life insurance policy to fund a legacy."}
{"original": "so, what are savers to do in this low-return, long-longevity world?"}
{"original": "use lower expected rates of return when calculating how much you need to save for retirement and how much income you'll be able to draw down once in retirement"}
{"original": "consider increasing sharply the amount you save now (that means lowering your current standard of living) to fund your desired standard of living in retirement."}
{"original": "consider using an income annuity instead of using a bond ladder for your safe assets? why so? the researchers suggest that annuitization becomes a relatively more attractive option when interest rates are low. this is because the increase in the cost of building a bond ladder is greater than the increase in the cost of buying an income annuity in a low-rate environment, the researchers wrote. with a bond ladder, retirees spend principal and interest. with an income annuity, retirees spend principal, interest, and mortality credits, which are the subsidies from the short-lived to the long-lived. with interest low in both situations, the mortality credits become more important."}
{"original": "high earners need to save even more than low earners to fund their desired standard of living. for instance, a single 40-year-old person earning $50,000 would need to save 19.4% in a low-return world to fund a desired lifestyle in retirement while that same person earning $100,000 would need to save 25.6%."}
{"original": "retiring later, at age 70, lowers the percent you need to save. for instance, a single 35-year-old person with household income of $50,000 who wants to retire at 60 needs to save 19.1% per year to fund their desired lifestyle in retirement, or 15.8% if they want to retire at 65, or 10.6% if they want to retire at 70."}

{"original": "the data show china's communist leaders have some extra wiggle room as they strive to wean the economy away from reliance on wasteful and polluting industries and exports in favor of slower but more sustainable consumer spending. the rebalancing has been complicated by beijing's repeated infusions of credit to prevent activity from slowing too much, which has pushed up debt that analysts say is the biggest threat to economic stability."}

{"original": "supporters say the two-state solution would end hostility between israel and palestinians as well as arab neighbors, and produce stability in the chaos-prone middle east."}
{"original": "getting there, however, has proven exceedingly difficult because of what appear to be several intractable disputes. foremost is israel's demand that the palestinians and other arab neighbors recognize the jewish state's right to exist and end terror attacks."}
{"original": "in addition, the two sides are far apart on the borders of a new palestinian state: both claim jerusalem as their capital, and israel has expanded settlements on land that the palestinians also say is theirs."}
{"original": "another contentious dispute involves the right of return claimed by millions of palestinians — or their descendants — who were evicted from their land when the jewish state was created. the palestinians say it is a basic right to reclaim their property, while israel says the issue should be decided by political negotiations."}
{"original": "the one-state solution has gained support of late amid the failure of progress toward creation of an independent palestinian nation."}
{"original": "this approach calls for israel to annex the west bank, which it captured from jordan in their 1967 war, and grant some form of citizenship to palestinians. the idea has appeal to small factions of both israelis and palestinians frustrated by the current standoff and perpetual hostility."}

{"original": "►russian president vladimir putin exulted at news of trump's initial decision. moscow's growing influence in the middle east, bolstered by an expanded russian military in syria to support assad's crackdown on rebellion, was offset only by the u.s.-led coalition controlling northeastern syria and airspace above it."}
{"original": "►a quick pullout from syria serves iran's interests. tehran built an army of shiite foreign fighters in syria to support assad, assisted by the iranian-backed hezbollah, an enemy of israel that's on the u.s. foreign terror list. syrian territory controlled by u.s.-led forces was a block to this aggression, and withdrawal would open a land bridge through northern iraq for iran to more easily and cheaply arm and multiply its forces."}

{"original": "tyler crowe: a common investing belief is that gold is a good hedge against inflation. that means anytime there's a period of rising interest rates, investors should allocate capital to gold."}
{"original": "if you dig into the data, though, that investment hasn't gone as well as one might expect. authors robert johnson and luis garcia-feijoo of the book invest with the fed went through the returns of stocks and gold in various interest rate environments from 1972, when the u.s. dollar was taken off the gold standard, to 2013. here's what they found:"}

{"original": "sure, the expected returns from stocks in a period of rising interest rates are considerably lower than times when rates are flat or falling, but that doesn't necessarily mean that gold is a more attractive investment than stocks when it happens. the only argument that this could still be the case is that this is only 40 years of data, and it could be too small of a sample size for this investment theory to show up."}

{"original": "reuben gregg brewer: most precious-metals miners don't have particularly enticing dividend histories. that's driven by the mining business model, which produce huge profits when gold and silver prices are high, but can lead to big losses when the prices of these often-volatile commodities plunge. the costs of mining simply can't adjust quickly enough to falling prices, leading to weak margins."}
{"original": "but that's not the case with streaming companies like royal gold (nasdaq: rgld). streamers provide cash upfront to miners for the right to buy gold and silver at reduced rates in the future. that locks in wide margins in both good times and bad. as an example, royal gold has a deal with mining giant barrick gold (nyse: abx) at the pueblo viejo mine that allows it to buy gold and silver at 30% of the spot price until certain production targets are met, and 60% thereafter. its costs will never go above the spot price."}
{"original": "that backdrop helps explain how royal gold has managed to increase its dividend every single year for 17 consecutive years. the average annual growth rate of the last decade was roughly 15% a year. that's an incredible record for any company, let alone one that operates in the precious-metals industry."}

{"original": "all of it will come to the forefront as lawmakers return to floor and committee debates via zoom due to the covid-19 pandemic. the virtual meetings will be live-streamed and broadcast to state residents who were, until last year, used to having very little access to their state's legislative process unless they could carve out an afternoon to travel to the statehouse in dover. for mcbride, it will mean starting a new job remotely, and all the stresses that come with it."}
{"original": "she's joining a body of state lawmakers who will likely be under more scrutiny than ever before in their careers. after 10 months of virus-related restrictions, economic turmoil and increased urgency for a vaccine, people are perhaps now more invested in their state government than ever before in modern american history."}

{"original": "the federal aviation administration has adopted a stricter unruly flyer policy the week after a riot by supporters of president donald trump on jan. 6 at the u.s. capitol and incidents on multiple airlines on the way to and from washington."}
{"original": "the faa shared the news in a tweet wednesday."}
{"original": "faa administrator steve dickson signed an order directing the agency to take strong action against any passenger who disrupts or threatens the safety of a flight, with penalties ranging from fines to jail time. no warnings! the faa wrote, linking to the announcement."}
{"original": "in the statement, the faa shared that it has seen a disturbing increase in incidents in which passengers have disrupted flights with violent behavior or threats of violent behavior. these incidents have stemmed both from passengers' refusals to wear masks and from recent violence at the u.s. capitol, the faa specified in the statement."}
{"original": "flying is the safest mode of transportation and i signed this order to keep it that way, dickson said in the statement wednesday."}
{"original": "the most notable part of the new order? no warnings."}
{"original": "in the past, the faa has addressed incidents including unruly passengers with different methods including warnings and counseling, sometimes issuing civil penalties."}
{"original": "effective immediately, however, the faa will not address these cases with warnings or counseling, the faa said. the agency will pursue legal enforcement action against any passenger who assaults, threatens, intimidates, or interferes with airline crew members. this policy will be in effect through march 30, 2021."}
{"original": "federal law prohibits an individual from physically assaulting or threatening to physically assault the crew or anyone else on an aircraft, the faa reminded its followers in a tweet over the weekend. passengers could be subject to fines of up to $35,000 or imprisonment should they conduct themselves in that manner."}

{"original": "alaska airlines spokesman ray lane said a number of passengers on thursday's nearly-full flight 1085 from washington dulles international following the riot at the capitol were non-mask-compliant, rowdy, argumentative and harassed our crew members'' on the five-hour flight to seattle. as a result, 14 of them are banned from flying alaska as long as its pandemic mask policy is in place."}
{"original": "alaska wasn't the only airline with issues on flights out of washington after the riot. delta air lines removed two unruly'' passengers flying from ronald reagan washington national airport to minneapolis on friday afternoon, spokesman morgan durrant told usa today."}

{"original": "congressman: put capitol rioters on federal no-fly list"}
{"original": "if rep. bennie g. thompson, d-miss., has his way, capitol riot participants might face a bigger problem than being removed from a flight or banned by one particular airline."}
{"original": "one day after the attack on the u.s. capitol, the chair of the house homeland security committee urged the transportation security administration and the fbi to put participants of the capitol riot on the federal no-fly list."}
{"original": "given the heinous domestic terrorist attack on the u.s. capitol yesterday, i am urging the transportation security administration and the federal bureau of investigation to use their authorities to add the names of all identified individuals involved in the attack to the federal no fly list and keep them off planes, he said. this should include all individuals identified as having entered the capitol building – an intrusion which threatened the safety of members of congress and staff and served as an attack on our nation."}
{"original": "thompson continued, we already saw reports of 'unruly mobs' in air on the way to washington, d.c. it does not take much imagination to envision how they might act out on their way out of d.c. if allowed to fly unfettered. this is an action that tsa and the fbi, by law, are able to take but, to my knowledge, have not yet taken. alleged perpetrators of a domestic terrorist attack who have been identified by the fbi should be held accountable."}
{"original": "the fbi decides whom to place on the federal no fly list, and the tsa enforces it by denying boarding passes to banned individuals. according to the department of homeland security website, individuals on the no fly list are prevented from boarding an aircraft when flying within, to, from and over the united states."}
{"original": "tsa is always on high alert, tsa spokesperson lisa farbstein told usa today. we prepare for all contingencies."}
{"original": "however, citing national security reasons, she declined to go into detail on tsa's plans for handling in-flight and airport incidents relating to the capitol riots."}
{"original": "there are always multiple layers of security in place and that travelers may notice additional law enforcement and canine presence, especially when events justify an increased security posture, she said. as it relates to the no fly list, we will accommodate fbi requests and congressional authorizations related to no-fly lists."}
{"original": "usa today has reached out to the fbi for comment on its plans for handling participants of the capitol riots."}
{"original": "last year, rep. justin amash, d-mich., introduced a bill that would have actually made it harder to put americans on the no-fly list by requiring that they be convicted of a federal terrorism crime first. however, he has since left congress."}
{"original": "in a statement issued the day of the capitol attack, the president of the association of flight attendants-cwa called for revoking the flight privileges of those involved in the riot as well as in-flight incidents to and from washington."}
{"original": "acts against our democracy, our government and the freedom we claim as americans must disqualify these individuals from the freedom of flight, sara nelson said. we in aviation have a serious role to play in national security. airlines, in coordination with tsa, dhs, faa, dot and law enforcement must take all steps to ensure the safety and security of passengers and crew by leaving all problems on the ground."}

{"original": "artist troy cole, who also goes by the name kickasso and runs a business called kickasso kustoms, painted the pink cleats. he said beckham was trying to think of a unique way to recognize national breast cancer awareness month, and when cole mentioned kirby, the wide receiver loved the idea. though, as cole noted, he risked a fine for wearing them from the nfl for violating its uniform policy."}

{"original": "while it may be funny to think of a superstar athlete on a multi-million dollar contract catching footballs with a cute pink videogame character on his shoes, distinctive cleat art is more popular in the nfl now than ever before."}
{"original": "although players sometimes get hefty fines for breaking the nfl's uniform policy, the custom cleats business is booming. to get around the uniform rules, some players only wear their stylish shoes during warmups."}
{"original": "the league took notice and created the my cause my cleats campaign for week 13 this year, in which players were encouraged to wear cleats designed to represent a charity of their choice (as long as it was approved by the league first)."}
{"original": "back in november, super bowl mvp von miller told for the win that he really liked the idea of the charity cleats week and wished the nfl would have more weeks that allow players to express themselves. when asked what he likes about customized shoes, miller said:"}
{"original": "it creates a different feeling when you have the only pair of these cleats out. it's just a great feeling just to be different, even if it is for cleats."}
{"original": "behind the cleats exists a growing community of artists. eric dorsey ii, of the custom sneaker business called illustrative cre8ions, has noticed the boom since he started his business in august of 2015. dorsey said that he saw it really start with the artist who made the all-gold cleats for marshawn lynch - the ones nfl refused to let lynch wear in the playoffs - and since then, he estimates there are about 12 designers working now, spread across the u.s."}
{"original": "other artists who have been in the business for well over a year credit the boom to social media and word of mouth. if a player sees amazing cleats on instagram, he might hit up a local artist and ask if he can get a unique pair for himself. it has even become an off-the-field competition as the business has gotten bigger."}
{"original": "they're in a league where they're wearing helmets and can't show their faces, so they need some sort of way to get their personality out there, said dan gamache of mache custom kicks. you'll see guys with the pregame cleats with spikes or god knows what else. it's a really cool way for them to express themselves, and also be competitive with each other. i know i've gotten a request from a player and they're like, 'make mine better than his.' that's the fun part of it for sure."}
{"original": "while there's growth and word is spreading, obviously, not everyone is cut out to be a sneaker artist. the three artists who talked to for the win made certain aspects sound easy when asked about their creative process and their art backgrounds (the process, they said, is fairly instantaneous with little planning involved, and none of them had any formal art training), but it takes more than that to turn it into a full-time gig."}

{"original": "what does it take to be a great cleat artist?"}
{"original": "dorsey: creativity and originality. that's one of the things i always speak about. i try to differentiate from the different artists is that we're all artists, we're all unique, we all have our own thing, so just be yourself. do you."}
{"original": "as far as cleats, i say the whole creativity part, that's where the illustrated creation comes in. we are creating a shoe. everything that i do, i want to be able to make something that you won't see on the sneaker shelves. when you go to your local store or you want to look online, you won't find anything else like this, and i think i've done a really good job of just sticking to that, and being different and unique."}
{"original": "cole: i would just say consistency and a good communication with your client is the main thing. of course you have to be a good artist, but i think that goes without saying. but the other things are what gives you longevity in the business for sure."}
{"original": "gamache: i think the best thing is really to be able to channel the person's themes or idea and easily translate it and also make it something that, my whole thing is to make it look like something that makes it look like it came on the shoe. i'm very big on trying to stick with the aesthetics of the shoe, so i'll use lines that are on the shoe."}
{"original": "the other part is just something being wearable. everyone can paint on a shoe, but if you don't do the proper preparations to make the paint adhere, it can easily crack and peel when they wear them. when i started doing the cleats, it was a learning process to figure out what's the best way to make it happen and now it's like a science. it's like painting a car, pretty much. you can have the best paint job in the world, but if it's not prepped properly, then it's kind of a waste."}
{"original": "dorsey: wow, honestly, it's the reaction i receive from the athlete afterwards. they're like kids on christmas. they know they're getting this - they know what's happening - and then when they actually get it, they open up that box, they pull the paper back, and they see, 'oh wow, wooooow,' they pick up the shoe, they want to take pictures with it, they tag me in photos."}
{"original": "i love the fact that i can bring joy to someone just by creating something, because you never know what they're going through or what's going on in their minds, whether it's a confidence booster, whether it's something they want to have as a commemorative item. i am excited that i'm able to do that for them and also be able to see that as well on a daily basis."}
{"original": "cole: just getting to meet all the new people that shoes have brought into my life is my favorite part, just meeting new people and really creating cool things that haven't been created before."}
{"original": "gamache: it's still the art. at the end of the day i was always an art guy. i played baseball most of my life and i did art, so a mix of the two things that i always was into as a little kid is great. i can get up every day and do something that i love. it sounds so cliche because everyone always dreams of doing what they love, but it still doesn't feel like work. very seldom do i dread going into the studio to go work."}
{"original": "how tough was it to get started?"}
{"original": "dorsey: it was kind of tough to get started because it's not like, say you go work at mcdonald's or something like that, you wear the uniform - there is no uniform for this. no one tells you what to do. it's research, trial and error. so when i first started, my first couple pair of cleats that i had done just for fellas that i knew locally that played sports, they failed because i was using the wrong paint."}
{"original": "then, once i found out what the right paint was, i realized i need this particular airgun because i had just done everything by hand. but now, in terms of the amount of money that i put into it, yes, i'm sitting here in my workshop right now, and yeah, there's a lot of stuff in here that was not here when i initially started."}
{"original": "cole: finding out the correct process, i think, was the most difficult part where people would be happy with their shoes once they got them and were able to wear them. as far as the paint and everything and the equipment, it's not like crazy, there's a lot more involved in painting a car than there is in painting a shoe."}
{"original": "odell beckham jr.'s craig sager tribute cleats (photo courtesy of kickasso kustoms)"}
{"original": "gamache: oh yeah, when i started there was no youtube on how to do this. i was just going to the local art store and getting regular acrylic paint which had no business being on a shoe. as time went on you learn, and i found out other people were doing what i was doing, so it was kind of like a network of what things work, what things don't work and we (artists in an online forum) would kind of trade secrets and tips and things like that and a lot of constructive criticism. that's how we grew. there wasn't a wealth of knowledge like there is now for these newer guys where they can just go on youtube and learn how to paint cleats, so i just did a lot of shoes to figure out what did and what didn't work."}
{"original": "how did you build your client list?"}
{"original": "dorsey: danny lansanah, at the time, he was playing for the tampa bay buccaneers, and he gave me my first opportunity to do cleats for him, and that was a great experience. then, i just continued to reach out to different athletes that my players may have known (dorsey is a former semipro and pro indoor football league coach) or that they're familiar with. they'd let me know, 'hey, i got a guy,' or via social media, you may just post pictures, and if you put the right hashtags, players will see them. they're on there all the time, so they'll notice it."}
{"original": "cole: he (arian foster, first nfl client) linked up with me through instagram. that's pretty much how everything got started: just word of mouth and instagram and things like that."}
{"original": "gamache: it's been pretty organic. any co-signs that i've had or any referrals have been really word of mouth. i've never placed an ad or anything like that. i ended up befriending a lot of these athletes. i think they feel comfortable with me getting their vision out through shoes."}
{"original": "college football is bringing its national championship game to new orleans on monday for the fifth time, cementing its status as america's preeminent venue for big sporting events. in the modern era, no city has hosted more super bowls, more bcs/college football playoff title games or more final fours."}
{"original": "but as we enter the 2020s, america's sports host of the future could be up for grabs because of las vegas, which suddenly has two major professional teams, more than $2 billion worth of new facilities and a strong desire to attract the same events that regularly come through new orleans. the only question is, will the final four or the cfp championship game get there first?"}
{"original": "i'll be in shock if they don't come to las vegas, said jim livengood, the longtime former athletics director at arizona and unlv, who has spent significant time in his retirement lobbying for big college sports events to come to las vegas. it has to be the right event for the right site for the right time of year, and it doesn't fit for every sport. but for five or six it works really well."}
{"original": "last may, the ncaa finally rescinded its policy that banned championship events from being played in states that offered sports gambling, which previously only applied to nevada but was suddenly going to eliminate more than 10 states that immediately legalized it in the wake of the supreme court's landmark 2018 decision."}
{"original": "of course, the ncaa rule never made sense in the first place. beyond college programs coming to play at unlv and nevada for decades, las vegas has hosted a bowl game since 1992, the mountain west basketball tournament since 2000 and the pac-12 tournament since 2013. moreover, with online and offshore sports gambling becoming prevalent over the last decade, the stigma of college games being played in close proximity to casinos and sports books is no longer tethered to reality."}

{"original": "still, it'll be a big moment for college sports when the ncaa or the cfp eventually bring their championship events to las vegas. but when's it going to happen, and once it does, will sin city become as much a part of the regular rotation that hosts these things as new orleans, atlanta, phoenix, dallas and indianapolis?"}
{"original": "we know that las vegas is an attractive destination for championships and we fully believe we are becoming the epicenter of sports, unlv athletics director desiree reed-francois said. in conjunction with our community partners, we're being aggressive in trying to host championship events."}
{"original": "the biggest issue, at least in the near-term, is availability. though the ncaa men's basketball committee met and toured venues in las vegas last summer and has a delegation visiting again in the coming weeks, final four sites are booked through 2026, though las vegas could bid on ncaa tournament regional sites as early as 2023."}
{"original": "as an independent organization, the cfp is not bound by whatever decision the ncaa makes with respect to las vegas and the basketball tournament but only has two unawarded championship games in 2025 and 2026, which marks the end of the playoff's current 12-year contract with espn. the bidding process for those games is yet to begin, but las vegas has already indicated it will make a strong run at holding one of them in the new $1.8 billion allegiant stadium, which sits just across interstate 15 from the south end of the strip."}
{"original": "bill hancock, the cfp's executive director, wrote in an email that he expects a number of cities to be interested hosting for 2026 and 2026 and noted that it has been good for college football that they've awarded the game around to 10 different places for the first 10 years of the event."}
{"original": "it wouldn't be right for me to speculate about any potential host, hancock said. i don't want to handicap the field, except to say it will be a fascinating race."}
{"original": "las vegas should be a no-brainer for one of those two slots, though, and the cfp should be positioning itself to get there before the super bowl (2025 is the nfl's next open slot) and the final four, as there could be significant cachet that comes along with being first."}
{"original": "but there are a couple potential complications."}
{"original": "the cfp is going to miami in 2021, indianapolis in 2022, the new los angeles stadium in 2023 and houston in 2024. would going back out to the pacific time zone in 2025 be too soon after l.a.? also, the consumer electronics show, which brings 170,000 people to vegas annually, often takes place in a similar window to the cfp championship game around that weekend after new year's. the ces has not posted dates for 2025 and 2026 yet, but that could be a potential complication to keep in mind."}
{"original": "if that hurdle could be worked out, though, vegas could very well establish itself as the absolute best venue for the game period. as fans have discovered over the first six years of the cfp, it is not a bowl week type of event. fans typically come in at some point the weekend before the monday night game and leave the next day. also, because the travel plans for the winning semifinal teams are made on somewhat short notice, availability of affordable flights and hotel rooms is paramount."}
{"original": "from that standpoint, places like dallas and atlanta work exceedingly well. for entertainment options and good weather, cities like new orleans and miami come to the front of the pack. but it's hard to imagine anywhere combining ease of travel with logistics like las vegas."}
{"original": "there's so many similarities to new orleans, livengood said. everything is so darn close. the stadium, there isn't anything you can't do just by walking to it. it checks every single box. and the big thing is vegas wants it. vegas has really stepped up in terms of realizing this can be a market for athletics."}
{"original": "this weekend in new orleans, tens of thousands of lsu and clemson fans will be taking over the french quarter prior to the national championship on monday night, a tradition that dates back decades for college sports fans. hopefully, it will continue for decades more."}
{"original": "but the momentum is there now for vegas to provide the same kind of platform for the biggest events in the coming years. hopefully it won't take college athletics much longer to embrace it."}
{"original": "washington – having taken control of the house on thursday, democrats will move to immediately set a different direction through new rules."}
{"original": "the package of changes ranges from those encouraging diversity – such as allowing religious head scarves to be worn on the house floor – to tougher ethics rules and tweaked legislative procedures that will make it easier to raise taxes."}
{"original": "rep. nancy pelosi, d-calif., who was elected speaker, helped secure the votes she needed by agreeing to changes sought by moderates aimed at easing the passage of bills with broad bipartisan support. that provision even earned the package the support of one republican, rep. tom reed of new york, who said wednesday he will take the rare step of crossing party lines to vote for it."}
{"original": "the changes face opposition from some liberal members who argued new budget rules would make it harder to expand social programs."}
{"original": "because most republicans – who set their own rules when they were in charge – are likely to oppose the changes, democrats probably can't lose more than 18 votes to enact the package."}
{"original": "here's a look at some of the proposed changes:"}
{"original": "making it easier to raise taxes but still hard to increase spending"}
{"original": "democrats want to end a gop rule that required supermajority support from three-fifths of house members to raise taxes. they want to reinstate a pay as you go – or paygo – rule requiring tax cuts or new spending programs be offset with new taxes or spending cuts. (republicans required that only new spending to be offset.) a few democrats said they will vote against the entire package, arguing paygo would keep democrats from expanding health care coverage and making other critical investments in education and infrastructure."}
{"original": "paygo isn't only bad economics ... it's also a dark political maneuver designed to hamstring progress on healthcare+other leg, tweeted rep. alexandria ocasio-cortez, d-n.y."}
{"original": "marc goldwein, senior vice president and senior policy director at the committee for a responsible federal budget, said that if democrats want to pay for such programs by raising taxes on the rich or on corporations, as some have suggested, paygo would help them do that."}
{"original": "goldwein called the budget rule changes sensible but said they will matter only if lawmakers follow them. they can waive them at any point, he said."}
{"original": "combating climate change was a campaign issue for democrats in 2018, and pelosi responded by relaunching a special house panel to shine a light on the issue."}
{"original": "the 15-member bipartisan panel, to be headed by rep. kathy castor, d-fla., will have at least six republicans and have until march 31, 2020, to issue policy recommendations."}
{"original": "the panel has limitations. it won't have the power to subpoena documents or depose witnesses. it could get caught up in a turf war with some of the standing congressional committees that oversee the environment. and it will have to submit its recommendations to those congressional committees, which will decide whether to act on them."}
{"original": "the democratic house proposal would toughen some rules governing the conduct of members – and may lead to further tightening down the line."}
{"original": "major provisions include a requirement that house members reimburse taxpayers for any settlements that are the result of discrimination by that member based on race, religion, sex, national origin or disability, among others. the change is in reaction to revelations in recent years that taxpayers paid out hundreds of thousands of dollars to settle such claims."}
{"original": "all house members would be required to go through annual ethics training, under another provision. previously, only new members were required to take the training."}
{"original": "lawmakers would be banned from serving as an officer or director at a public company. craig holman, with the good government group public citizen, said this provision is the result of the indictment of rep. chris collins, r-n.y., for alleged insider trading involving a pharmaceutical company on whose board he sat. no other members serve on the boards of public companies, holman said, but about 190 house members hold other positions involving public or private firms."}
{"original": "the same provision calls for the house ethics committee to develop regulations by the end of 2019 to address other involvement by members in companies that could pose a conflict of interest. holman said he would like to see a ban on members trading stock in companies that do business that falls under the oversight of their committees."}
{"original": "the changes allow democrats to get involved in the pending challenge to the affordable care act after a federal judge in texas ruled the landmark health care law unconstitutional. the trump administration is not defending parts of the law, including its popular protections for people with pre-existing conditions. a group of democratic states and congressional democrats plans to appeal the ruling, which will head to the 5th circuit."}
{"original": "after house republicans failed last year to enact an expansion of work requirements for food stamp recipients, the trump administration announced in december plans to tighten rules on its own. democrats' rule package directs the house to explore ways to respond to the administration's proposed changes."}
{"original": "the rules ban discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity. an office of diversity and inclusion would be created to increase diversity in the congressional workforce. the joint center for political and economic studies, a nonprofit group that attempts to improve the socioeconomic status and civic engagement of african-americans, issued a series of reports highlighting the lack of diversity among congressional staffs."}
{"original": "one issued last fall that looked at the staff makeup of the congressional delegations in six states found, for example, that none of the senators had a top black staffer. in december, the group launched an online tool to track newly hired top staff of new and returning members."}
{"original": "democrats want to honor our commitment to workers by putting labor back in the committee on education and labor. the republicans called the panel the committee on education and the workforce."}
{"original": "the word government would be dropped from the name of the committee on oversight and government reform. the change is intended to emphasize that the investigative panel's jurisdiction covers both government and the private sector. rep. elijah cummings, d-md., who will chair the committee, said he plans to examine the opioid crisis and the cost of prescription drugs and to investigate the trump administration."}
{"original": "washington – turkey's president is fuming. israeli leaders are nervous. syrian kurds are terrified."}

{"original": "secretary of state mike pompeo and trump national security adviser john bolton are now on separate swings through the middle east, where they're both trying to calm jittery u.s. allies – and to walk back the president's statements."}
{"original": "there's been a lot of noise about this withdrawal from syria, and we want to make sure they understand completely what that means, pompeo told cnbc in an interview monday before leaving for the diplomatic blitz."}
{"original": "that noise started on dec. 19, when trump abruptly announced a decision to withdraw all u.s. troops from syria, where they have been fighting isis. trump declared three weeks ago the 2,000 american troops in syria are all coming back, and they're coming back now and that that isis had been vanquished – an assertion experts say is inaccurate."}
{"original": "bolton contradicted the president during a stop in israel on sunday – saying u.s. troops would only leave syria once isis is completely eradicated and the u.s. had secured assurances from turkey that it would not attack kurdish fighters allied with the u.s. the syrian kurds have been america's most important ally in the fight against isis."}
{"original": "there are objectives that we want to accomplish that condition the withdrawal, bolton told reporters in jerusalem."}
{"original": "bolton then went to ankara to ask turkey not to slaughter the kurds, as pompeo put it last week. turkish president recep tayyip erdogan responded angrily to bolton's entreaty, noting that turkey views the kurdish fighters as a terrorist group."}
{"original": "it is not possible to accept or swallow the message given by bolton, erdogan told lawmakers in turkey's parliament on tuesday."}
{"original": "pompeo may get a similarly chilly reception on his eight-country tour of the middle east, which started tuesday in jordan and will include stops in egypt, saudi arabia and kuwait. trump's chief diplomat said his main goal is to reassure america's arab allies that the u.s. is not abandoning the middle east – specifically its efforts to curb iran's influence in the region."}
{"original": "our mission set in the region remains unchanged, pompeo told reporters traveling with him on the trip. he declined to say what timetable, if any, the trump administration has set for america's withdraw from syria. and he insisted there was no difference between trump's call for a speedy withdraw and bolton's conditional timeline."}
{"original": "but middle east experts say bolton's conditions will be difficult to meet and could mean that u.s. troops remain in syria indefinitely. but trump has undermined pompeo and bolton, with allies unsure of who or what to believe, they argued."}
{"original": "in addition to the troop withdraw in syria, trump said last week that iran can do whatever they want in syria. that was particularly unsettling to israeli leaders, who fear that iran is trying to get a military foothold in syria."}
{"original": "natan sachs, director of the center for middle east policy at the brookings institution, a liberal think tank, said trump showed his true colors when he announced the syria withdrawal."}

{"original": "a similar $1.7 trillion dollar bond purchase program in 2009 was credited with preventing the economy from spiraling into a deeper recession or even depression after lending channels froze. but with long-term interest rates already low, fed officials fretted that another move to push down rates further eventually would stoke excessive inflation without stimulating more borrowing by consumers and businesses."}
{"original": "i remain opposed to 'shock and awe' approaches to monetary policy, st. louis fed chief james bullard said. the fed is capable of a lot of things, but is not capable, in my view, of moving the dial tremendously on economic growth from here."}
{"original": "dallas fed president richard fisher noted that by printing more money and lowering treasury yields, the fed would open itself to further criticism that it's encouraging more u.s. borrowing and a wider federal deficit. we would be waving a red flag in the face of those who are our most volatile critics, he said."}
{"original": "by the fall of 2010, job growth remained meager, the unemployment rate was about 9.5% and inflation was feeble. supporters of another stimulus believed it at least would weaken the dollar, bolstering exports, and drive investments to higher-yielding stocks, making consumers feel wealthier so they'll spend more."}
{"original": "pumping more money into the banking system and economy also could push up low inflation, which threatened a further downturn if consumers put off purchases on the expectation that prices would remain flat or could even fall."}
{"original": "fed chairman ben bernanke expressed concerns about a deflationary trap, as well as the risk that the sluggish recovery could leave permanent effects on the economy. bond purchases, he noted, could nudge up consumer prices by changing the public's inflation expectations."}
{"original": "the point here is only that, if the economy slows considerably more, the possibility that will get into a bad spiral of declining confidence, spending and income is something to be worried about, he said. and given the lack of tools that we do have, our ability to address that situation would be limited."}
{"original": "anticipation that the fed would buy more bonds already had driven up stock prices and pushed down long-term interest rates in the months leading up to the meeting, perhaps spurring more borrowing, at least on the margins."}
{"original": "in the end, the fed's then incoming vice chair and current chair, janet yellen, coalesced the views of most fed policymakers."}
{"original": "the outlook for employment and inflation are dismal, she said. she added that bond purchases are not a panacea, but they can make a meaningful difference."}
{"original": "at the meeting, the fed weighed whether to buy $1 trillion in treasury bonds, as some economists and investors anticipated, $600 billion, or doing nothing."}
{"original": "yellen argued for the middle ground of $600 billion, noting the fed could expand the program if necessary, so we can see how economic conditions are evolving once the program gets underway. the fed bought $75 billion a month in treasury bonds, ending the program in june 2011."}

{"original": "as the nation's chief law enforcement officer, barr oversaw high-profile investigations into the savings and loan scandal, manuel noriega – the corrupt former dictator of panama convicted in 1992 of racketeering – and the 1988 bombing of pan am flight 103."}
{"original": "barr advocated stronger federal sentencing to combat violent crime and he was opposed to criminal justice reform legislation like the bill trump recently signed."}
{"original": "during barr's time as attorney general, robert mueller headed the justice department's criminal division and the two worked closely on those important cases."}
{"original": "perhaps the most controversial aspect of barr's tenure involved another special counsel investigation: lawrence walsh's probe into the iran-contra affair, where reagan administration officials approved the sale of arms to iran to help fund anti-communist rebels in nicaragua."}
{"original": "according to the washington post's bob woodward, barr said he long had an itchy finger to fire walsh and that almost came to a head after the special counsel indicted president ronald reagan's defense secretary, caspar weinberger, four days before the 1992 election."}
{"original": "instead bush pardoned weinberger and five other reagan-era officials involved in the affair. barr was a strong advocate of the pardons."}

{"original": "this story was published in partnership with the 19th, a nonprofit, nonpartisan newsroom reporting on gender, politics and policy."}
{"original": "misogyny is the lifeblood of racist movements — or that's one takeaway from sociologist kathleen blee's research into the women of the ku klux klan (wkkk), a hate group that formed in the 1920s independent of the men's klan."}
{"original": "the wkkk formed on the heels of the women's suffrage movement, itself rife with racism. blee, a dean and sociology professor at the university of pittsburgh who researches extremist right-wing and racist social movements, authored the book women of the klan: racism and gender in the 1920s — published in 1991 and again in 2009, with a new preface. in it, she argues that the very expansion of white women's access to the franchise laid the foundation for a hate group that was by women, for women and of women. some high-ranking wkkk leaders had also chaired local campaigns for suffrage, and as women's political opportunities expanded, many felt their role in the klan should too."}
{"original": "the early 1900s were dotted with white symbolism and supremacy. white suffragist suits were not only designed for starkness, but to emphasize femininity that many labeled suffragists as devoid of, undercutting them as mannish and ugly. the color white, unmistakably, is also a symbol of purity. as blee points out, klan propaganda has a throughline of protecting the purity of the race, but more explicitly, that of white women, who were baselessly depicted as at-risk of assault, as more black men were freed from the binds of slavery."}
{"original": "chartered officially in june 1923, the wkkk embraced ideas of racial and religious privilege but rejected the messages of white female vulnerability, blee wrote. where klansmen saw women as homemakers, wkkk engaged around emphasizing the labor involved in raising children and maintaining a home and also how to best use their newly bestowed access to the franchise. according to blee, 250,000 white women joined the wkkk in its first four months, by the organization's own claims."}
{"original": "the women's klan of the 1920s was not only a way to promote racist, intolerant, and xenophobic policies but also a social setting in which to enjoy their own racial and religious privileges, blee writes. these women recall their membership in one of u.s. history's most vicious campaigns of prejudice and hatred primarily as a time of friendship and solidarity among like-minded women."}
{"original": "a lot has changed since blee's book published, but she still makes the case that many aspects of the klan's ideology, although distant in time, are frighteningly close in spirit to the pervasive strands of racism and unacknowledged privilege that exist among dominant groups in the united states today."}
{"original": "in the centennial year of the 19th amendment, blee's research connecting suffrage with white women's rise in the notorious hate group presents a nuanced understanding of the voting milestone that hardly expanded voting rights for non-white women. in interviews with indiana klanswomen nearing the end of their lives, blee was surprised to learn that many did not feel remorseful for their role in the wkkk."}
{"original": "blee spoke to the 19th, which has been covering the centennial of the amendment, about how a voting rights movement facilitated an extremist one, the role gender plays in extremism today, and what she wishes she could ask klanswomen now."}
{"original": "this interview has been edited for length and clarity."}
{"original": "the 19th: this year marks 100 years since the 19th amendment was passed. this is also roughly the centennial marker of when the wkkk was established. so can you talk a little bit about how that 19th amendment milestone made the wkkk possible?"}
{"original": "kathleen blee: the women's suffrage movement existed for decades before the passage of the 19th amendment. so a lot of people, clearly the majority of women and some men who were involved in it, were interested in suffrage for women. they believed in equality and bringing more people into public life and having women's interests and the interests of children better represented in politics."}
{"original": "but, that wasn't everybody. there were women — primarily in the south, but not exclusively — who wanted to ensure votes for women, and really they're thinking of white women here, because they wanted white women's votes to counteract the votes that had earlier been given to black men. there was always within the suffrage movement a pretty openly racist segment. the fact that, actually, very few black men actually got to exercise their vote was not relevant to their topic."}
{"original": "so the other thing that is relevant here in terms of the ku klux klan of the 1920s, is that the women's suffrage movement was an opportunity for a very large number of women to develop political skills that they hadn't had before. in trying to pass the suffrage amendment and working at a local level, the state level or the national level, women essentially started to become political agents themselves. they developed their own political networks. they traveled. they made connections with other women. they understood the mechanisms of political power and elections and so forth. and that was true for women who were trying to push a progressive agenda, but it was also true for women who are trying to move a much more reactionary and racist agenda."}
{"original": "right after the 19th amendment was passed, the male klan started saying positive things about women's suffrage. they started encouraging women to come in, and women did. some of the leaders of the klan in the 1920s were women who had been women's suffrage leaders themselves. eventually they pulled away from the men's klan and became antagonistic toward the men's klan, primarily because they didn't want to share dues money and there's conflicts and lawsuits and even physical brawls between the men's and women's klans."}
{"original": "the women brought into their klan horrible anti-semitic, anti-catholic, terribly racist views and agendas, but they also brought in this idea of women's rights. but they only meant the rights of white native-born protestant women, just women's rights for people like them. within that, they argued in favor of an eight-hour day for mothers, pay for housewives, and all these kinds of agenda that are similar to what progressive women are arguing for in the 1920s, but in the case of the women's klan, a very racially defined set of rights."}
{"original": "it's an interesting story, but it's also a terrible story. it shows the ability of extremist, racist groups to co-opt and build upon even progressive agendas like women's suffrage, and how easily and completely it could be harnessed to one of the worst and certainly one of the largest racist movements in the country's history. they had horrible success by demonizing people by their country of origin and imprinting anti-semitism and racism really deeply into the body politic, ripping it out of just being a southern phenomenon and making it a national phenomenon. sadly, women had a really significant part in that."}
{"original": "one of the things you grapple with in the book is the tendency to frame extremist groups as fringe and on the margins, their members as brainwashed, even as lower-class and uneducated. similarly, there becomes this very sexist rhetoric about women in the klan only being there because of pressure from the men in their lives. can you talk about what your research says about the importance of understanding recruitment tactics that brought in church leaders and politicians and women organizing for suffrage into the klan?"}
{"original": "blee: when we think about how women fit into these kinds of politics, it's often the case that people look at women in extremism through the blinders that we have about what those kinds of women are like. people looked at women in the 1920s klan, and they'll say, oh, she's married to or with some man who's also in the klan or in the movement, therefore she must have followed him there. but in my research on the 1920s klan, and in my research on current far-right extremism in the united states, it's often the case that the woman and the man independently went into those organizations and met each other there. a lot of what we assume about women and their motivations are based on really gender stereotypes, not the reality of women in those groups."}
{"original": "another thing that people often think is that women have no role in those groups. but that actually isn't true. so let's take the 1920s klan. historians knew for many, many decades that there were women's klans all over the country. but nobody ever studied them because the historians that looked at the klan thought only the men were really political actors. if there were women's klans, they just denoted them as auxiliaries. if you actually look at what was going on in the 1920s, and i did a deep case study of indiana, where the klan was extremely strong, is that in a lot of ways, the women were more effective at the horrible agenda of the klan than the men."}
{"original": "in the 1920s, the men's klan was different than klans before and after because it was not very involved in physical violence; they were mostly interested in trying to get people to run for office and collecting dues. the women's klan, however, was much more effective in carrying out the racist politics of the klan because these women created networks among themselves and established what they called whispering campaigns that would target someone they suspected of being catholic or jewish and started spreading gossip about them. they were really effective at collapsing the stores of jewish owners and getting catholic school teachers run out of communities and targeting african americans in white communities and getting them pushed out."}
{"original": "obviously keeping in mind that women of the ku klux klan were perpetuating hate, you also write about the sexism they dealt with from klansmen but also from outsiders. you write about a newspaper editor who was critical of the klan and described the women as coarse-featured and having abandoned their husband and children. what can be gleaned from this sexism and misogyny at large?"}
{"original": "blee: misogynist society permeates into these racist groups, very clearly. racist groups from the 1920s, when you have a lot of women, and then today when you have a certain number of women in racist groups, there is a double speak about women. on the one hand, women can be racial warriors — that would be language people use today — women are valued allies to men and racist movements. on the other hand, these are movements that are deeply based on inequality and discrimination and hierarchy and masculinity and misogyny. that is the lifeblood of racist movements; they're racist but they're also just deeply misogynistic despite any kind of rhetoric they have about enlisting our sisters in the struggle."}
{"original": "so women in the 1920s klan, or women in racist groups now, face the same kind of situation. they come in with expectations about their value and the respect they'll have in the racist movement that white women don't get in the larger society. then they confront groups whose men are deeply misogynist, and so these women tend to be quite disillusioned and angry. and interestingly enough from the 1920s klan to today, conflicts around gender are one of the most splintering things that happens in right-wing extremist groups. flash-points for groups to dissolve tend to be over either money and gender — those are explosive issues, in right-wing extremist groups. interesting that it still continues to today."}
{"original": "so, women are involved in the '20s, then for a long time there's no women in racist groups to speak of. and david duke, whom you may have heard of, is the person who opened the racist movement to women again. duke brought in both women and catholics into organized racism in the late '70s, and women have been there ever since. and you notice that those are both times in which there's a women's movement in the larger society. so women come into hate on the heels of the suffrage movement, then they're pushed out. women return into hate on the heels of the second feminist movement in the '70s. but, you know, just like in the larger society, there's an opening to women, politically, in hate, but it's accompanied by a deep misogyny."}
{"original": "your book was originally published in 1991, and the version i have includes a preface from 2009. in that preface, you mention that in interviewing aging klanswomen, there were questions you didn't get to ask or that you were too timid to pose. i'm wondering if you've reflected on that or have been able to work through it in some of your subsequent and continued research on extremism?"}
{"original": "blee: i interviewed these people literally at the last possible moment to interview them. many of them died very quickly after. i asked the questions that were on my mind then, and i knew very little. in fact, nobody knew very much about (them) then. and so i kind of asked the most obvious questions, and i was shocked by their answers in a way that wouldn't shock me now. people just had no regrets; i really expected them to be confessional, regretful or embarrassed, or any of those kinds of things. and they really weren't."}
{"original": "one of my regrets is how thin my foundation of knowledge was going into that. women and those movements were really unexplored. if i could interview these women now, i think i could ask much more interesting questions. how did they get pulled into this? what did they tell their kids? why did they hide this from their kids?"}
{"original": "i think there's some interesting things to think about when a whirlwind of extremism takes over an entire state or parts of the country, and how people think about what they're swept up in. then they're just dumped out in the end when the whole thing turns out to be kind of a fraud — sex scandals, financial scandals and the whole thing blows up. i was too timid, i should have pushed them a lot more about that. what did you think when your whole world exploded? everybody that seemed like a great leader was exposed as this big fraud. i do think about that now."}
{"original": "what a difference eight years makes."}
{"original": "around this time in 2008, hillary clinton and barack obama were engaged in an epic and fierce primary battle with debates that were often marked by acrimonious exchanges. now, there's no greater defender on a democratic debate stage of obama than clinton."}
{"original": "taking on wall street is one of bernie sanders' trademark issues, and in sunday night's democratic debate he promised again to break up big banks. and in a not-too-subtle jab at clinton, he also said: i don't get personal speaking fees from goldman sachs."}

{"original": "sanders tried to minimize his differences with obama."}
{"original": "he and i are friends, sanders said, adding that they at times had differences of opinion."}
{"original": "your profusion of comments about your feelings toward president obama are a little strange given what you said about him in 2011, she said."}
{"original": "clinton wasn't done, though, in embracing the obama mantle. later, in a discussion of obama's policy toward syria."}
{"original": "she was asked by nbc's andrea mitchell whether the president should've enforced his red line with syrian president bashar al-assad when it came to assad's use of chemical weapons."}
{"original": "i think that the president's decision to go after the chemical weapons once there was a potential opportunity to build on when the russians opened that door resulted in a very positive outcome, she said."}
{"original": "it should be noted that the site of sunday's debate was charleston, s.c., the state where obama beat clinton by nearly 30 points in the 2008 primaries."}

{"original": "washington – president donald trump was a picture of calm as he strolled onto the red carpet for a new year's eve party at his florida resort this week. after threatening iran in a series of tweets hours earlier, trump seemed eager to lower tensions."}
{"original": "i want to have peace. i like peace, trump, clad in a tuxedo, told reporters when asked if an attack on the u.s. embassy in baghdad would lead to war with iran. i don't see that happening."}
{"original": "but the president's allies described a more tense picture behind the scenes as he shuttled between his mar-a-lago estate and meetings at his nearby golf course where he huddled with advisers to craft a response to the violent protests at the u.s. compound that reverberated around the globe."}
{"original": "that response, americans would learn days later, would include a move widely seen as escalating aggression in the region rather than alleviating it: a u.s. drone strike targeting iranian major general qasem soleimani, the second most powerful leader in iran and commander of the quds force of the islamic revolutionary guard corps. his death near baghdad international airport triggered vows of reprisal from iran and threatened to reshape a presidency that has rested on a promise to withdraw from overseas conflicts rather than pursue them."}
{"original": "thursday's airstrike, while at odds with the president's long-stated desire to pull troops out of the middle east, was the culmination of a growing proxy battle between iran and washington after trump withdrew the u.s. last year from a multilateral agreement intended to curb tehran's nuclear weapons program. the trump administration has since blamed iran for attacking tankers near the strait of hormuz, downing a u.s. drone in june and a rocket barrage friday that killed a u.s. defense contractor at a compound in northern iraq."}
{"original": "after the strike on soleimani, the pentagon announced the deployment of about 3,000 more troops to the middle east."}
{"original": "trump told reporters in florida friday he was ready and prepared to take whatever action is necessary to deal with iranian aggression. he said he had already fully identified potential military targets should iran act."}
{"original": "if trump's message of seeking peace appears at odds with ordering missile strikes, selecting targets and expanding the nation's military footprint, it may be explained in part by the contradictory promises he has made to his supporters, experts said."}
{"original": "he's promised the base that he's going to pull us out of middle east conflicts, and he's also promised the base that he is going to push back on iranian efforts to threaten the united states, israel and our allies, said thomas warrick, a former counterterrorism official at the department of homeland security and an atlantic council senior fellow."}

{"original": "soleimani has long been watched by u.s. intelligence but officials said trump authorized the strike on him shortly after the military base attack near kirkuk on dec. 27 that left an american contractor dead."}
{"original": "the decision played out over several days as the escalation between washington and tehran unfolded."}
{"original": "the president was kept apprised on an ongoing basis, white house national security adviser robert o'brien told reporters."}
{"original": "secretary of state mike pompeo, secretary of defense mark esper and mark milley, chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, appeared at mar-a-lago on sunday evening to brief reporters about the first round of airstrikes. esper presaged the possibility of other military action in the region, noting he had discussed with trump other options that are available."}
{"original": "trump traveled between mar-a-lago to nearby trump international golf club, where he stayed for less than an hour rather than the several hours he has taken to golf on most days since christmas."}
{"original": "trump was then suddenly shuttled back to mar-a-lago. he fired off a barbed tweet complaining about criticism that he went golfing when, he said, he had actually been holding meeting(s) in various locations, while closely monitoring the u.s. embassy situation in iraq. it was not clear why trump held those meetings at the golf course rather than at mar-a-lago, and neither trump nor his aides have explained it."}
{"original": "among the people who joined trump at the golf club was sen. lindsey graham, r-s.c., a close ally of the president and an outspoken hawk on iran. graham told fox news he had been briefed about the potential operation during his visit to florida. i appreciate being brought into the orbit, he said."}
{"original": "house minority leader kevin mccarthy also spent time with trump at mar-a-lago."}
{"original": "white house officials and trump monitored the embassy attack from florida. images documented the extent of the damage: a burned-out reception area, broken windows and rooms that appeared to be completely destroyed."}
{"original": "on new year's eve, when trump emerged on the red carpet to join his guests at a party, he played down the prospect of war."}
{"original": "i don't think that would be a good idea for iran. it wouldn't last very long, trump said. no, i don't think iran would want that to happen. it would go very quickly."}
{"original": "u.s. intelligence had been tracking soleimani's movements throughout the region, officials said, and the strike depended on his appearance at the airport. otherwise, it would have been called off. soleimani was a potential target for a long time – dating back to prior presidential administrations – and it appears the trump administration may have began laying the legal groundwork for the strike as early as april. that's when the state department designated the revolutionary guard as a foreign terrorist organization."}
{"original": "ever since soleimani (was) approved as a foreign terrorist, the authority to hit him has been on the table, said kirsten fontenrose, former trump national security adviser who is now at the atlantic council. what would have been the game changer in terms of allowing it to happen will have been the strikes on the kirkuk base."}
{"original": "experts say trump set the stage for the rising u.s.-iran tensions by fulfilling a campaign promise to abandon former president barack obama's landmark nuclear deal with tehran in may 2018. he reimposed sanctions against tehran and its trade partners, further isolating the u.s. from european allies who were signatories to the accord and setting in motion ripple effects that led to deeper regional tensions across the middle east."}
{"original": "what followed was a series of provocations, which included trump abruptly calling off airstrikes on iran in june 2019 after the downing of a u.s. drone. he revealed strikes had been planned for three locations but decided against the action after considering the potential death toll. but the u.s. has continued to strengthen its forces there, sending an aircraft carrier strike group and b-52 bombers to the region last year, while pompeo and other administration officials have accused iran of attacks in syria and saudi arabia."}
{"original": "trump and his top advisers have repeatedly touted their maximum pressure policy, a sanctions-driven campaign designed to isolate tehran diplomatically and cripple the country economically. but increased aggression by iran has raised questions about how effective that approach has been."}
{"original": "the president's tough talk on iran has been at odds with his promise to withdraw u.s. military from the middle east and his constant criticism of predecessors for engaging the troops in iraq and afghanistan. trump faced bipartisan backlash last year for withdrawing from the syria-turkey border, virtually clearing the way for turkey to invade its neighbor to the south. in a series of tweets at the time, trump said that fighting between various groups that has been going on for hundreds of years. usa should never have been in middle east."}
{"original": "he added: the stupid endless wars, for us, are ending!"}
{"original": "precisely what caused trump to risk getting involved in a war with iran is not clear, but trump said friday that the decision to take out soleimani was about preventing an impending attack on americans."}
{"original": "neither the white house nor the pentagon have detailed the plot."}

{"original": "when lsu head coach ed orgeron gave his senior linebacker the green light to wear that purple and gold no. 45 one final time, a myriad of things rushed through his head."}
{"original": "at the top of the list: i was ready to go."}
{"original": "divinity, a former star at john ehret high school in the new orleans area, was suspended for the tigers' last six games for violating the athletic department's drug testing policy for marijuana. lsu's drug testing policy says an athlete who tests positive four or more times must miss at least half the season."}

{"original": "we'll see what fits best, but he's definitely going to play for us. we'll use him in the best situation we can, orgeron said. mike is one of our best pass rushers. so, i think he immediately goes back to starting in our dime (pass defense) package."}
{"original": "despite the suspension, divinity was able to practice with the team and participate in all team activities. physically, divinity says he hasn't missed a beat. his absence on the field on saturdays produced a different problem."}
{"original": "the mental part was the most challenging, said divinity, who credits his parents and his grandmother for helping him maintain a positive attitude through the suspension. it was very hard. i was tweeting — trying to coach and be there for the guys. i love the game so much i can't stop being around it. i'm so proud of them."}
{"original": "divinity's penalty offered a little extra time to spend with his daughter, and in the film room. he continued to hang out with his teammates and, as unusual as it may sound, maintains he was able to remain a leader."}
{"original": "monday, divinity's college career will end in the same spot as his high school career – the most iconic venue in the state."}
{"original": "my last high school game was in the superdome, said divinity, whose patriots fell to zachary 46-12 in the 2015 class 5a state championship game. it's going to be wonderful. i'm hoping for a different result."}
{"original": "clemson co-offensive coordinator tony elliott believes divinity could make a different despite the long absence."}
{"original": "with his age and his experience, you would think he'd add some leadership, elliott said. i would imagine he gives them more depth. they've had to play (linebackers, patrick) queen and (jacob) phillips a lot — even when the game was out of hand."}
{"original": "in terms of xs and os, divinity could be a key in third-down situations."}
{"original": "he provides a different element, elliott said. he's a big enough guy, fast enough guy. (lsu's) philosophy on third down seems to be to get some of the bigger two-gap guys off the field and get some speed guys in to create some matchup problems for your offensive line."}
{"original": "unlike the past six games, divinity isn't going to waste the chance of a lifetime monday night."}

{"original": "though crying as president used to be considered a sign of weakness, now it's considered a sign of humanity. which means there's probably a consultant somewhere calculating the best moment for candidates to well up, shed exactly 2.7 tears, and bask in the resulting poll boost."}

{"original": "anyway, after the conference was over, presidential candidates basically repeated their previous talking points: republicans waved their arms, touted their love for the second amendment and promised to annul everything if elected, while democrats praised obama for taking the crucial step, as hillary clinton called it, and vowed to do more if elected."}

{"original": "free e-filing of federal tax returns has been around for years. the companies that offered the service generated revenue by charging extra for more complex forms and state tax filings. innovations were slow as tax prep companies enjoyed hefty profit margins on consumers willing to pay $40 or more for their annual tax obligation."}

{"original": "bangui, central african republic — the united nations became embroiled in one of its worst scandals in 2014 when shocking allegations surfaced that u.n. peacekeepers were raping women and children in this impoverished, war-battered nation."}
{"original": "today, blue-helmeted soldiers and u.n. staff still rape with impunity despite pledges by u.n. leaders to end the abuses, victims allege."}
{"original": "i am ashamed of the so-called international community, a tearful marie-blanche marboua said as she described how a u.n. soldier raped her 10-year-old son a year ago in bouar, 300 miles from this capital city. my son is still traumatized."}
{"original": "i have realized that nothing must be expected from these white people, she added. now, i put everything in the hands of god."}
{"original": "the u.n.'s international peacekeeping forces were sent to central african republic to stabilize the country after more than a decade of civil war. while there, soldiers sexually abused hundreds of boys, girls and women, according to child rights organizations and the u.n.'s own records."}
{"original": "u.n. secretary-general antónio guterres acknowledged the exploitation and pledged when he took office a year ago to crack down. in august, he appointed a victims' rights advocate."}
{"original": "sexual exploitation and abuse have no place in our world, guterres said in september. it is a global menace, and it must end."}
{"original": "last year, u.n. officials vowed to improve funding and staffing for sex abuse cases. atul khare, under-secretary general, said those efforts have led to a 50% drop in assaults on children by peacekeepers across the globe during the first 11 months of 2017 compared to the same period in 2016."}
{"original": "we believe our new strategy is bearing some initial fruit, said khare, who conceded that even one allegation is one too many."}
{"original": "uwolowulakana ikavi-gbetanou, a spokeswoman for u.n. peacekeeping forces in bangui, said abuse cases have declined in this country because of new steps, such as more training of personnel and aggressive investigations of allegations. she said the u.n. also is increasing outreach to local communities to help them report abuses and provide immediate assistance."}
{"original": "even so, the u.n.'s own watchdog said in a june report that while progress has been made, much improvement is needed, including recording complaints and following up on accusations."}
{"original": "human rights groups dispute claims of fewer assaults, saying the u.n. still does not have an accurate account of abuse victims."}
{"original": "the u.n. is claiming things are getting better, but it is in complete control over the assessments of people coming forward, said paula donovan, a former u.n. official who is co-director of aids-free world, which tracks peacekeeper abuses. they are police, judge and jury."}
{"original": "the number of victims is far higher than the u.n. reports, said remy djamouss, president of the center for the promotion and defense of the rights of children in bangui. his group takes the testimonies of children abused by peacekeepers."}
{"original": "some victims and their families fail to report assaults because they don't know how to file a claim, believe there won't be an impartial investigation or fear reprisals. so people are not coming forward, donovan said."}
{"original": "one 17-year-old girl said she did not report being raped at gunpoint in june by two peacekeepers in the city of bria because sexual assault by u.n. soldiers is so common. she said many friends and neighbors ended up having children as a result of being raped by peacekeepers."}
{"original": "i did not tell people that i was raped by the peacekeepers because they would make fun of me, said merveille, whose last name is being withheld to protect her privacy as a sexual assault victim under usa today's policy."}
{"original": "another young victim is still waiting for justice. the 13-year-old girl said she was attacked two years ago at camp m'poko near bangui's international airport."}
{"original": "three white soldiers told me to come get candies and cookies, recalled joanna, whose last name also is being withheld. one of them covered my mouth with his hand and then the two raped me. i want these people to be punished."}
{"original": "peacekeeping soldiers, who come from dozens of countries, usually are sent home when they face sexual abuse allegations, as required under u.n. rules. that policy has become a shield for alleged abusers, according to child advocates."}
{"original": "for example, after france withdrew its troops from a non-u.n. peacekeeping mission here in 2016, french prosecutors declined to file charges against soldiers accused of raping six children, ages 9 to 13, in 2013-14."}
{"original": "the victims come to tell us how a white soldier did this, another did that, said claudia toussonekeya, an attorney with the central african women lawyers association, which records dozens of complaints of sexual abuse by soldiers and other foreigners in the country."}
{"original": "we tell them that we can do nothing, and that even (central african republic's) justice system cannot do anything. they take it badly, but we cannot do otherwise, she said."}
{"original": "in fact, several peacekeepers have been punished, according to nick birnback, chief of public affairs at the u.n. peacekeeping unit."}
{"original": "he said u.n. records show six soldiers serving here were jailed for abuse or sexual exploitation and one was dismissed by his government from 2015 through 2017."}
{"original": "yet during the same period, according to the u.n.'s own records, there were 255 alleged victims of abuse, 141 of them children."}
{"original": "birnback said abuse charges against peacekeepers across the globe are handled more aggressively now, with 92% of participating countries looking into allegations, up from 42% five years ago. the average time it takes a country to appoint an investigator has fallen from 79 days in 2012 to eight days currently, he said."}
{"original": "in addition, the u.n. has set aside $1.7 million to compensate victims. we are witnessing a change in the mindset of both the member states and the u.n. itself, birnback said."}
{"original": "while soldiers who are accused are sent home, u.n. staff members can be tried locally because most don't have diplomatic immunity. still, the u.n. doesn't deal with them harshly enough, complained aids activist donovan."}
{"original": "if you rape a child, you might get investigated, but that is an investigation that will lead to demotion or getting fired, not jail, she said. they don't want their people spending time in a jail in central african republic."}
{"original": "u.n. figures for 2015-17 show that one civilian working for the mission here was sanctioned with a contract termination because of abusive behavior."}
{"original": "aids-free world and other groups are pushing for an independent court modeled after the international criminal court in the hague to handle these cases instead of the u.n. that's because the u.n. often hides information and pretends investigations have already been carried out when they haven't been, children's advocate djamouss charged."}
{"original": "the local groups want to name and shame accused rapists by publicizing their identities and possibly deter other soldiers from committing assaults. but the u.n. won't reveal identities because it says alleged perpetrators have a right to a presumption of innocence, djamouss said. to date, not a single convicted rapist has been publicly identified in central african republic, according to djamouss."}
{"original": "local officials remain silent because they are embarrassed about the scandal and view the peacekeeping mission as a powerful force that provides desperately needed foreign currency for a barely functioning economy, said pierre marie kporon, a researcher at bangui university who specializes in child rights violations."}
{"original": "when you touch the international community that pays the salaries of civil servants, you risk having problems even with the government, kporon said."}
{"original": "as allegations of rape persist, many people here feel betrayed by an organization that sent troops to make life better for the country's citizens."}
{"original": "we were told that (the peacekeepers) came to protect us, said beatrice mokoyo, 45, a farmer and mother of seven in biabo, near bangui. instead, we see that it is the (peacekeepers) who cause the rapes. it makes me sick."}

{"original": "the state has a long history of forcing prisoners—especially black men—to work. after slavery was abolished, mississippi leased a soaring number of prisoners to private industry. public outcry over deaths and mistreatment forced the state to end that program in 1890. mississippi then founded the state penitentiary known as parchman farm, which was modeled after a slave plantation. it still houses over 3,000 of the state's 21,000 prisoners."}
{"original": "the restitution-center program has unfortunate parallels with mississippi's past, said alex lichtenstein, a historian who has written a book on convict leasing in the south. it's a form of penal labor, there's no question about it."}

{"original": "some judges say the program helps those sentenced to it. charles webster, a circuit judge in clarksdale, said that the program teaches them about responsibility by requiring them to show up for work and meet financial obligations. he had sentenced two of the people in the centers in january 2019."}

{"original": "but the judge allowed her to serve five years of probation instead as long as she paid $50 a month to the corrections department for monitoring her, plus $200 a month toward her fines, fees and restitution."}
{"original": "over the years, she struggled to keep up with the payments as she worked at mostly low-paying housekeeping jobs at hotels and cared for her husband until he died in 2009. she said her probation officers threatened her: 'next time you come in and you don't have any money, you're going to jail.'"}
{"original": "fearing she would be thrown in prison for nonpayment, she stopped reporting."}
{"original": "this led to a cycle of probation violations that landed husband in jail for weeks and on house arrest in 2011. in 2015, she was back in court again. when she explained her fears of being imprisoned for failing to pay, the judge replied, that's no excuse for not reporting to your probation officer where they can keep up with you."}
{"original": "judge roger t. clark told husband she had to attend and successfully complete the restitution center program at flowood, according to the hearing transcript. but the court order he signed spelled out something more: she had to stay until she paid her $12,685.50 balance — restitution, fines and fees — with the court."}

{"original": "as an inmate makes money, the corrections department takes the first cut in room and board, then usually holds the remaining earnings until there's enough to pay the entire debt. when someone leaves the program, the corrections department sends their earnings to the court to cover its costs. it distributes the rest to victims, then to pay criminal fines."}

{"original": "lee said that though he was not happy to first learn of the purported plot on television, the problem there is not with the president."}
{"original": "the problem is with those who were briefing us, he said. lee believed the briefers would have done a different job under the light of day had television cameras been there than they did in private where their boss couldn't see what they were saying."}

{"original": "i understand the frustration of the broader members of congress who could not see the full intelligence behind the decision to kill soleimani, esper said, but making it available to everyone would jeopardize sources and methods."}
{"original": "lee said the real target of his ire was congress."}
{"original": "look, my grievance here is not with the president of the united states. he's exercised his power with great restraint and respect for the constitution, lee said. it's not even really as much with the briefers, even though i didn't love the briefing the other day, as it is with congress. congress is the problem."}

{"original": "we have to remember that this isn't just about this president or this war. this is about the future question of what any president can do to get us into any war, lee said. over many decades, congresses and white houses of every conceivable partisan combination have put us down this path where it's very easy for members of congress to wash their hands of it."}
{"original": "we have created this problem, he said."}
{"original": "like lee, sen. rand paul, r-ky., is from the gop's libertarian wing and was unsatisfied with last week's intelligence briefing. paul also plans to vote for kaine's war powers resolution."}

{"original": "candidates have touched on a range of foreign policy issues in previous debates and have largely shied away from attacking one another on the issues. given the urgency of the situation in iran, tuesday's debate will give them the chance to tout their foreign policy credentials, said dave peterson, professor of political science at iowa state university."}
{"original": "biden has long emphasized his decades of foreign policy experience, which include his time as vice president under president barack obama and as chair of the u.s. senate foreign relations committee. but rivals will likely criticize his 2002 vote to authorize military force against iraq. biden has expressed regret over the vote, but he's also given conflicting narratives about the timeline of his disapproval. his answers have been inaccurate and unsatisfying, peterson said."}

{"original": "after soleimani's death, warren answered questions from the media on the general's killing but was not asked about the issue by caucusgoers at recent iowa campaign events. biden and sanders, on the other hand, incorporated remarks on iran into their stump speeches."}

{"original": "because it's the last debate before the caucuses, caufield said she expects all the candidates to focus on why they're the best person to defeat trump. iowans have made beating trump a top priority in choosing a candidate, iowa polls have found."}
{"original": "caufield predicted klobuchar will tout her midwestern roots and her record of winning in counties that voted for trump; warren will highlight her plans for anti-corruption and changing the system; sanders will stick to his populist message; buttigieg will highlight his faith and perspective as a washington outsider; and biden will remind voters that obama handpicked him to be second-in-command."}
{"original": "steyer, who qualified to join the debate stage thursday evening, has blanketed iowa airwaves with ads promoting his ability as a successful businessman to take on trump over stewardship of the economy."}
{"original": "in such a close race among the top candidates, warren will need to remind voters why they fell in love with her in the first place, peterson said. warren has seen ups and downs in early-state polls, riding to the top of september's iowa poll, then dropping a few points."}
{"original": "warren will also likely highlight her recent endorsement from julián castro, the former secretary of housing and urban development who was running for president until just a few days ago, peterson said."}
{"original": "i think this could allow the warren campaign to generate some excitement among her supporters, kedrowski said. it's not just the same old 'i've got a plan for that.'"}

{"original": "buttigieg will need to come prepared to defend his lack of washington experience and, as in previous debates, his high-dollar fundraisers."}
{"original": "if i were him, i would hope that everybody focuses on bernie and biden, peterson said."}
{"original": "sanders, on the other hand, may need to bring fresh ideas to the debate stage to win over new caucusgoers. he's maintained a steady core of supporters, some of whom have been ardent fans for years, but he hasn't expanded his support much beyond that base."}

{"original": "iowans want candidates to address more than health care"}

{"original": "meanwhile, 48% of women think they have to work twice as hard as a man to take home half the pay, and just 42% believe their opportunities on the job are the same as their male colleagues. that's compared to 58% of men who believe that the playing field is fair."}
{"original": "still, at a time when a national conversation is taking place about sexual harassment, sallie krawcheck, ellevest's ceo, believes society may finally be poised to focus on another disparity fracturing the workplace — unequal pay."}
{"original": "the gender pay gap is alive and well,'' says krawcheck, who co-founded ellevest in nov. 2014. but i hope this is the beginning of a first step for companies to really open their eyes, women to work together and for us to work to close it.''"}
{"original": "in 2015, women were on average paid 80 cents for every dollar earned by men, according to the non-profit institute for women's policy research. the numbers were even worse for women of color, with black women earning 68% of what was paid to white men and hispanic women's pay amounting to just 62% of their white male peers, according to the iwpr."}
{"original": "but just as dozens of sexual misconduct allegations against hollywood producer harvey weinstein triggered an examination of such behavior and led to the downfall of numerous prominent media figures, including former today anchor matt lauer and actor kevin spacey, high-profile cases are now turning a spotlight on the gender wage gap."}

{"original": "while the country fitfully moves toward paying women on par with their male peers, krawcheck says that in the meantime, women need to be investing what they can. currently, they are leaving hundreds of thousands of dollars on the table because they are not investing at the same rate as their male counterparts."}
{"original": "i say to them, look if you had a hole in your pocketbook ... and a hundred bucks fell out, how many days would it take you to fix your pocketbook?'' krawcheck says. you shouldn't wait. just because you have a gender pay gap doesn't mean 'oh gosh. never mind.' that's like saying 'i broke my arm and i broke my leg. doctor, you may not fix my arm until my leg is fixed.' we all need to do what we can do to get ourselves financially stable.''"}

{"original": "after a year of peace and prosperity, more people are likely to believe that such outlandish predictions tell us less about the president and more about the temperament of his critics."}
{"original": "so what did trump accomplish? for one thing, he appointed an all-star cabinet that has been quietly and dutifully implementing the president's agenda even as their boss runs interference for them, taking the slings and arrows of a hostile media. he has appointed more judges to the federal bench in his first year than any president ever, including neil gorsuch to the supreme court. and they are constitutionalists. this alone will represents a signal triumph that will resound for the next few generations."}

{"original": "financial markets were jolted wednesday by a report that china — the biggest foreign holder of u.s. government bonds — could curtail its purchases, a shift that has spooked investors already leery of a rise in interest rates at the start of 2018."}
{"original": "bloomberg news, citing unnamed people close to the matter, said chinese officials are considering slowing — or even stopping — its purchases of u.s. government debt. the report suggests that china feels u.s. debt is becoming less attractive when compared to other types of investments. trade tensions between the world's two largest economies was also cited as a possible reason why china is thinking about reducing its u.s. holdings, according to bloomberg."}
{"original": "if the reports turn out to be true and china no longer sees treasuries as an attractive option, the repercussions could be significant, says craig erlam, senior market strategist at oanda, a currency trading firm with offices in new york. a significant change in policy could put considerable upside pressure on u.s. yields."}
{"original": "low interest rates, of course, have been a big driver of the stock market rally the past nine years and has also provided a lift to the economy, as middle-class americans have benefited from lower borrowing costs."}

{"original": "the fear is that, at a time when the federal reserve has started reducing its holdings of u.s. debt (coupled with news that japan is reducing its treasury purchases and china might follow suit), there will be less demand for u.s. debt. and that fewer buyers will result in higher interest rates and borrowing costs in the u.s."}

{"original": "interest rates had already been rising to start 2018, as investors begin to price in prospects for faster u.s. growth, more interest rate hikes from the federal reserve and rising inflation pressures, in part due to rising wages as the job market tightens further."}
{"original": "you already had this backdrop of rising rates and people are getting nervous, says boris rjavinski, senior interest rate strategist at wells fargo securities in new york. and when you get another story like china, a major holder of u.s. treasuries possibly stepping back from the market, it adds to the overall bearish trend in the treasury market."}
{"original": "jim paulsen, chief investment strategist at the leuthhold group, a money-management firm in minneapolis, says china is more likely eyeing sales of u.s. bonds for the same reason investors in the u.s. and elsewhere are: fear that inflation is on the rise and will erode the value of fixed-income investments."}
{"original": "this happens every time rates go up, paulsen explains. everyone (that owns u.s. treasuries) is worried that they will get killed if (prices fall and rates rise), so they lighten up on their exposure to these bonds,"}

{"original": "temperatures soared to over 100 degrees, and that's a lot cooler than the furnace it would feel like on court with the sun beating directly down on the cement."}
{"original": "broiling – or rather playing – for 2 hours, 45 minutes in the thick of the day was the fate of 14th-seeded novak djokovic and gael monfils. both struggled through the conditions, feeling at times as if they were wilting and might not have more to give."}
{"original": "but in the end, they were both still standing to walk off the court after djokovic managed to edge past monfils 4-6, 6-3, 6-1, 6-3 to move onto the third round."}
{"original": "the 39th-ranked monfils, who won the doha title two weeks ago, categorized thursday's conditions as tough to breathe and the hardest i have [experienced]."}
{"original": "for sure, you know, we took a risk, said monfils, who had a trainer and doctor out on the court ahead of the third set. it's a little bit hot, maybe a little bit too hot."}
{"original": "i got super dizzy, he added. i think i have a small heat stroke for 40 minutes. couldn't feel like fresh."}
{"original": "djokovic, who has conquered the australian summer to win the tournament six times in the past, concurred it was a day more suited to indoor past-times and air conditioning than outdoor activities."}
{"original": "the conditions were brutal, that's for sure, the former no. 1 said. we both struggled. maybe he struggled a bit more, end of the second, entire third set. that's where i managed to get on top of him, get even on sets, obviously start off well in the third."}
{"original": "needless to say, many wondered why the tournament didn't just push the button and close the convertible top roofs they have on three of their stadiums. well, there's a rule about this kind of decision and it's called the extreme heat policy, or ehp for short."}
{"original": "to simplify, the ultimate decision is at the referee's discretion, but the guideline is the ambient temperature needs to exceed 104 degrees fahrenheit (40 degrees celsius), plus a wet bulb globe temperature – it registers humidity – needs to exceed 90 degrees fahrenheit. expectations are those levels could be reached on friday, which is expected to be even hotter."}
{"original": "the rule also states that if there is a closure of the roofs because of heat all matches being played on courts without roofs must be suspended until conditions are deemed playable again."}
{"original": "djokovic, who likely was told by a teacher somewhere in his life to remember to respond to questions with complete answers, offered an entire typed page opinion on the subject of the safety to play or not to play in unbearable heat."}
{"original": "it was right at the limit, said djokovic, offering his assessment of whether it reached critical conditions on thursday."}
{"original": "i think there are certain days where you have to, as a tournament supervisor, recognize that you might need to give players few extra hours until it [the temperatures] comes down, he added. i understand there is a factor of tickets. if you don't play matches, people will be unhappy. you have to take into consideration different angles before making a big call like that….people might say, 'well, at this level you have to be as a professional player fit…but i think there is a limit, and that is a level of, i guess, tolerance between being fit and being, i think, in danger in terms of health."}
{"original": "despite at one point receiving a time violation for taking more than the 25-second rule between points, djokovic went out of his way to compliment australian umpire john blom for how he handled the match considering the extenuating circumstances."}
{"original": "chair umpire was doing a good job today, i think, he said. he was really trying to participate in the game and understand what's happening."}
{"original": "the weather conversation became something of a moot point in terms of play carrying on, and the win provided djokovic with further proof he's ready to be back on tour following six months sidelined with a right elbow injury."}
{"original": "it was a big challenge for both of us to be on the court, to be able to finish the match, djokovic said. i'm just glad that i managed to come out on top."}
{"original": "djokovic's victory extended his winning streak against monfils to 15-0, and it's not just against monfils that he's experienced good luck when facing french players."}
{"original": "clearly, french opponents is a motivational factor for djokovic as he's only lost to one frenchman in his last 59 matches played against someone from that country. the player who had the audacity to interfere with his having a perfect winning streak against french competitors was jo-wilfried tsonga, who won their third round match at the 2014 toronto tournament."}
{"original": "djokovic's win over monfils extends his winning streak over french players at the grand slams to 25 and counting. overall at the majors, djokovic has a 34-2 winning record over frenchmen, only losing to sebastien grosjean at 2005 wimbledon and tsonga at melbourne park in 2010."}

{"original": "george keays is not a rogue kind of a man. a colorado real estate agent and grandfather of three, the 65-year-old practices yoga and meditates regularly. but the u.s. government, he says, has left him no choice but to break the law. if, that is, he intends to stay alive."}
{"original": "keays has stage 4 lung cancer. as his treatment options appeared to be dwindling this fall, he went to cuba for a vaccine treatment despite a federal law that prohibits americans from going there for health care. now, with president trump's recent tightening of the regulations governing travel to cuba, it has become much harder to travel there. but keays needs more of the vaccine. this spring, he's going back."}
{"original": "i am not looking to break the law. but i am not looking to die, either, keays declared. people with stage 4 cancer, like me, should be allowed to try whatever they want to stay alive, whatever they think will work. the last thing they need is the government on your neck over some archaic regulation saying just take what is available here and die."}
{"original": "keays has abundant company. in the two years since relations between the u.s. and cuba were normalized under president barack obama, a growing number of lung cancer patients traveled to cuba for a vaccine called cimavax, and more recently, a newer vaccine, vaxira. these patients are an elusive group. none of those who went apparently provided their real reason for going to cuba when applying for a visa, nor did many of them declare to u.s. customs officials that they were bringing multiple vials of the vaccine into the u.s. on their return. few even tell their doctors they are taking the injections for fear they will refuse to treat them further."}
{"original": "i can only see it as compromising him because now he has a patient on a drug that is not approved by the fda, said a patient in florida named larry, who asked that his last name not be used. larry has gone to cuba twice for the vaccine — both times without telling his doctor because, he might be afraid he would be sued, or he might stop treating me."}
{"original": "just how effective are the vaccines they're smuggling into the country in their small refrigerated lunch boxes is unclear. neither of the vaccines prevents cancer; rather, they are a kind of immunotherapy that prompts the body's immune system to battle the disease in patients with non-small cell lung cancer. in january, the roswell park comprehensive cancer center in buffalo, n.y., launched a clinical trial of cimavax with cuba's center of molecular immunology, which developed the vaccine. it is the first such joint venture between the two countries since the cuban revolution."}
{"original": "roswell is now doing research to determine if they want to do a similar trial with vaxira. it will take years for either of the drugs to receive any final approval."}
{"original": "for many patients, including some who were not accepted into the roswell trial, travel to cuba has become a much-talked-about option. so popular has the practice become that patients on internet support groups routinely trade anecdotes and travel tips about their cuban journeys. until, that is, trump threw a wrench into the process."}
{"original": "major changes for patients going to cuba"}
{"original": "the change in regulations governing travel to cuba that went into effect in november altered one of the most popular categories of travel to cuba initiated by obama, known as people-to-people, which allowed travelers to go to cuba on their own. that's how many americans have been quietly going to the island for medical care, even though doing so is prohibited under the u.s. embargo against cuba. now, people in this category must travel with an organization and have a guide present."}
{"original": "americans can continue to travel on their own to cuba for the purpose of professional research or to provide support for the cuban people. but given that travelers in those categories are required to maintain a full schedule of activities, it's likely that neither will be a good option for cancer patients."}
{"original": "at the la pradera international health center in havana, where most american cancer patients go for treatment, dr. anabely estévez garcía felt the impact of the new regulations in her inbox as soon as trump announced back in june that the changes were in the works. american patients began canceling their plans in a flood."}
{"original": "we can not go at this time, a texas man emailed garcía on the day of trump's announcement. president trump changed everything today. it is not possible to go directly from here. keep us in touch."}
{"original": "a patient in new york on the brink of travel wrote that she had decided to wait a little longer. now, it will be harder to get there as our president has made it impossible to travel alone."}
{"original": "nancy kelly, 71, a california patient who traveled to cuba for vaxira this past spring, emailed that she was worried about the new regulations, too. how would she replenish her vaccine supply when it ran out in october? she decided not to go herself but sent a friend to cuba to pick up more for her."}
{"original": "it was important to get back to cuba before trump's restrictions went into effect, sighed kelly. with the new restrictions, i would need to go through a third country. the problem is that the vaccine has to be refrigerated, so, if you were on a long flight, that was going to be a problem."}
{"original": "the tighter regulations are only part of what is keeping patients from going. another factor is the state department advisory issued this past september warning american citizens not to go to cuba due to alleged assaults against american embassy staff. investigators have yet to determine exactly who or what was behind the assaults, and the staff in havana has been significantly reduced. for some travelers, it's all just too much."}
{"original": "since relations between the u.s. and cuba were normalized at the end of 2014, the number of patients going to the plush la pradera clinic at the city's edge had risen steadily. in 2016, 50 americans came for treatment. last year, the number of inquiries about the vaccines tripled over the previous year, while 47 patients had already made the journey to cuba in the first eight months of 2017, according to garcía. now, the numbers have plateaued."}
{"original": "there are many patients who are suitable for treatment but who do not come for political reasons, said garcía, seated in a treatment room at la pradera this fall. as a physician, i feel very bad because i believe our vaccine is a good treatment that can extend these people's lives."}
{"original": "because their own doctors are often not involved, patients wanting to go to cuba must make arrangements themselves. first, they get in touch with la pradera either through email or one of a number of medical tourism agencies in the u.s. or in canada. they then send their medical records for evaluation by la pradera physicians who determine if they are eligible for one of the vaccines, and if so, which one."}
{"original": "under the obama-era regulations, accepted patients usually informed the airlines issuing their visas that they were going for educational purposes or under the general people-to-people category. questions were rarely asked and most flew directly to cuba."}
{"original": "patients stay at the la pradera clinic, a resort-like facility with a swimming pool and fountains, for four days, during which they receive their first of several doses of the vaccine. each dose consists of four injections — two to the arms and two to the buttocks. one dose costs about $860, so the total cost of the trip, including airfare, lodging and a supply of the medication to take back home, can run well over $10,000."}
{"original": "at p&g travel in ontario, long one of the more popular agencies among americans for booking travel to cuba, the numbers are both up and down. since trump announced in june that he would be reversing aspects of the obama administration's overtures to cuba, the number of americans booking travel directly from the u.s. to cuba through the agency has plummeted by 60%. instead, they're now going through third countries just like they used to do before obama's normalization of relations. since june, the number of bookings by americans going to the island from countries other than the u.s. has increased by 30%, according to tathiana gonzalez, the agency's cuba travel specialist."}
{"original": "you're either going to go or not go, said gonzalez. when you're given a month to live, you go. it's kind of basic."}
{"original": "what they are going for is part of the new wave of immunotherapy treatment that works by triggering a patient's immune system to fight cancer. cimavax, for example, stimulates the immune system to make antibodies that bind to a protein called epidermal growth factor, or egf, that cancer cells need to grow, effectively starving the cancer. vaxira is somewhat different; it triggers an immune response against a molecule specific to several cancers and is intended to ultimately block the cancer's growth. only patients who have already received chemotherapy are eligible for the vaccines."}
{"original": "cubans research a lung cancer vaccine"}
{"original": "while cuba is often recognized for its pristine beaches and throbbing rumbas, it is also home to a burgeoning biotechnology industry. prompted by the country's high rate of lung cancer, researchers began work on a lung cancer vaccine back in the mid-1990s. in the most recent of several cuban trials, patients receiving cimavax lived about three to five months longer than those who did not. available to cubans for free since 2011, it has been given to more than 5,000 patients worldwide."}
{"original": "cimavax is currently available in cuba, colombia, peru, bosnia-herzegovina and paraguay. vaxira, which one cuban clinical trial indicates can extend life by up to two months, is currently undergoing more testing in argentina. it is available in that country and in cuba."}
{"original": "roswell scientists began collaborating with havana's center of molecular immunology, which developed the vaccines, in 2011, and scientists from both countries have worked in one another's laboratories frequently over the years. in the roswell trial, cimavax is being combined with a checkpoint inhibitor, which blocks proteins on cancer cells, called opdivo."}
{"original": "while talk of cimavax has circulated in american medical circles for years, much less is known about vaxira. roswell researchers are currently doing preclinical studies of vaxira in animals to determine if the vaccine merits a possible human trial. dr. igor puzanov, director of the early phase clinical trials program at roswell, said that it could take up to a year before a decision can be made on whether to proceed."}
{"original": "we know what the vaccine is supposed to do, he said. it's just too early to say if it does it."}
{"original": "meanwhile, at the center of molecular immunology, scientists are now focused on taking cimavax to a next step. they are working to extend patients' survival rate by identifying markers in those who are responsive to the vaccine. patients with high concentrations of the egf protein, for example, have been shown to be more responsive to the vaccine than those who do not. camilo rodriguez, a clinical researcher at the center who has worked on cimavax for 15 years, says he believes that eventually, the vaccine might be used on a host of cancers."}
{"original": "we feel that the vaccine could be very effective against prostate cancer, for example, because those patients often have a high degree of egf and that is related to the spread of cancer, said rodriguez, seated in his laboratory. eventually, we feel this could be useful in all kinds of cancer affecting the head, neck, bladder and prostate."}
{"original": "american doctors are not so sure. while some are cautiously optimistic about cimavax and await the outcome of the roswell trial with interest, others complain that the vaccine has been oversold and is in sore need of further study. dr. robert doebele, associate professor of medical oncology at the university of colorado- denver and a senior editor of the american association for cancer research's journal clinical cancer research, recalls sitting in a meeting with a dozen other oncologists discussing the best way to market a drug. someone in the room called out, do whatever cimavax does!"}
{"original": "we all let out a collective groan, said doebele, who is george keays' oncologist. it was hilarious. the fact is that i spend several hours a month answering questions from my patients about this. it's very prominent on the internet and patients are understandably desperate to learn about it. but the fact is that we just don't know if this works yet."}
{"original": "dr. roy s. herbst, chief of medical oncology at yale university and a nationally recognized expert in the treatment of lung cancer, shares those reservations. herbst says that without seeing new stats, it's not that impressive. for the moment, he added, i am not too worried about people not being able to go to cuba."}
{"original": "like several other doctors of the patients interviewed for this story, doebele advised keays not to go to cuba for the vaccine. one reason for that is that keays is currently taking tagrisso, a standard therapy for non-small cell lung cancer. doebele is concerned that if keays shows improvement while taking that and one of the cuban vaccines, it will be impossible to tell which medication was responsible. but doebele has other worries."}
{"original": "my biggest concern is safety because of the lack of oversight and regulation. i can't control what he does; i don't even know where he's getting it. was it even a legitimate clinic where he got it? said doebele. i thought i'd talked him out of it."}
{"original": "but he hadn't. keays did apply to participate in the roswell trial, as doebele suggested, but he was put on the waiting list. he became frustrated that he might wind up in the placebo group in the study, and so he decided to go right to the front of the line. cuba."}
{"original": "keays arrived at the la pradera clinic in october and was advised that the vaccine most suited to his cancer was vaxira. after consulting with his family doctor, boulder internist william l. blanchet, who was traveling with him, keays received his first dose."}
{"original": "twenty minutes after i received it, i felt a little tired, but that was it, said keays. the next day, i went for an hour run. i felt great."}
{"original": "if keays was impressed by the professionalism of the doctors, blanchet was even more so."}
{"original": "on paper, this looks very promising, blanchet said of the vaccine. it resonates as being medically sound and potentially a major addition. it's too soon to recommend it to patients, but i would make them aware of it and let them make the decision. if i was diagnosed with stage 4 cancer, i would definitely go down and have this be part of my therapy."}
{"original": "one of the other patients at la pradera when keays was there was eduardo sanchez, of spain, a lean man with graying hair. diagnosed with advanced stage 4 lung cancer, sanchez said he, too, had exhausted most of the treatments available to him. like most american patients, he learned much of what he knew of the cuban vaccines on the internet."}
{"original": "unfortunately, in spain, there is no information about the cimavax or the vaxira, he said. it's too early for me to say, but i am very hopeful."}
{"original": "questions on how to bring back the vaccine"}
{"original": "for advanced stage cancer patients like sanchez and keays, going to cuba can be difficult in itself. the trip is tiring and can be daunting for those for whom the treatment may be viewed as something of a last resort. now, american patients face an even higher hurdle in the new and somewhat confusing regulations. the question many patients are wrestling with is how to get in and out of the country without getting caught, given the likelihood of greater scrutiny."}
{"original": "over the past two years, it appears that no one has been apprehended. the u.s. food and drug administration's personal importation policy allows some unapproved medications to be brought into the country, provided there is not an adequate alternative available in the u.s. and the amount does not exceed a three-month supply. but spokesmen for both the fda and u.s. customs and border protection say there is no record of either of the cuban vaccines having been brought into the country or seized at the border."}
{"original": "just how to bring the vaccine into the u.s. is a hot topic on the online health care social network, inspire, which supports a lung cancer group of about 53,000 members. judy ingels, 74, is one of them. diagnosed with stage 4 lung cancer in 2015, ingels went on tarceva and her tumor shrunk somewhat. after she saw a cnn report on cimavax at the end of 2016, she decided to go to cuba while she was relatively well and still able to do so. last spring, she and her family traveled from their home in santa rosa, calif., to havana, where she received her first treatment of the vaccine. all told, the trip cost about $16,000. that she was breaking the law did not trouble her in the slightest."}
{"original": "i just didn't get hung up on it, said ingels. my husband said, 'when they ask what your purpose is, just don't mention anything about medicine.'"}
{"original": "ingels had no trouble carrying an eight-month supply of cimavax back into the u.s. in a hand-held refrigerated lunch bag. when she told the transportation security administration agent in florida that she was carrying a vaccine, he opened her bag and poked around but asked no questions."}
{"original": "in the months that followed, ingels's tumor shrunk perceptibly, a fact that she attributes to cimavax. now, however, her supply has run out and she wants more. presuming that she cannot travel with a guided group, given her purpose, she is considering hiring one of several professional mules who will fly to cuba to get the vaccine for a fee. two of them contacted by pri declined to be interviewed."}
{"original": "we're weighing the options, said ingels. we might travel ourselves through the bahamas. but i have also talked to an individual who has offered to do this."}
{"original": "nancy kelly, who had a friend travel to cuba on her behalf, was considering a return trip. but when a scan last fall showed that her tumor is growing, she changed her plans — at least for the moment. the change in her circumstance has not dimmed the retired administrative judge's anger at the government's imposition of limitations on american patients' ability to seek the treatment they want."}
{"original": "i think it's absolutely outrageous. what trump has done makes it so much more difficult to go, said kelly. the restrictions that do not permit doctors in different countries to corroborate to help save lives is absolutely terrible."}
{"original": "keays is running into a similar problem since a recent scan showed that a mass on his liver is growing. doebele, his oncologist, believes that means that neither the vaxira nor the tagrisso is working. doebele has suggested keays go off the vaxira, in part, so that he might qualify for other treatments, but keays continues to have faith. he's planning on returning to havana in the spring for more of the vaccine. keays intends to apply for a visa under the category of professional research arguing that he is a guinea pig for the vaxira vaccine. he has become, after all, something of an expert on the subject. over the past two years, he's tried a wide variety of treatments: two targeted therapies, multiple forms of radiation and a lot of meditation. he's been on vaxira now for two months."}
{"original": "in between doctor's appointments, keays has been working on a letter to the chairman of the u.s. senate committee on foreign relations, hoping he might intervene on patients' behalf. he's getting other patients to write, too."}
{"original": "i intend to do whatever i can to expose how these restrictions steal the hope, and possibly, the life, from patients suffering with terminal cancer, as well as other sicknesses that might benefit from cuba's advances in medicine, declared keays. the ignorance in this new policy is astounding."}
{"original": "in the meantime, for patients disheartened by an american government and doctors who seem to offer them only discouragement regarding cuba, there is one source of potential support: travel agents like tathiana gonzalez in ontario."}
{"original": "unaffected by the u.s. regulations, gonzalez routinely forwards dozens of american patients' medical records to la pradera, on their behalf, to see if they qualify for one of the vaccines. it's the only instance in which she gets involved in her clients' medical needs because, she says, the process is so stressful. she's the first to admit that she's no medical researcher, but she notices that some of the cancer patients that she's helped get to cuba have lived for years. like her clients, she waits anxiously for a response from the cuban doctors: are they accepted to go, or not?"}
{"original": "it's such an emotional roller coaster, exclaimed gonzalez. if they're not accepted, i cry because their cancer is so advanced. if they are accepted, i rejoice! i say, 'you're going! you are going to cuba!'"}

{"original": "washington – president donald trump played down rhetorical attacks from kim jong un as the end-of-the-year holidays passed wednesday without any new nuclear tests in north korea – but with threats of future ones."}
{"original": "if the u.s. persists in its hostile policy toward the dprk (north korea), there will never be the denuclearization on the korean peninsula, the korean central news agency said, quoting kim as he announced he no longer feels bound by a self-imposed moratorium on nuclear testing."}
{"original": "trump, speaking with reporters at his annual new year's eve party at his mar-a-lago estate in palm beach, florida, said he still has a very good relationship with kim, with whom he has met three times."}
{"original": "he likes me, i like him, we get along, trump said, adding: he did sign an agreement talking about denuclearization. ... i think he's a man of his word, so we're going to find out."}
{"original": "in announcing that his moratorium on nuclear testing is no longer operative, kim also told a meeting of ruling party officials in north korea he would unveil a new strategic weapon in the near future, the state news agency said. kim had given the united states an end-of-the-year deadline to reduce economic sanctions on his country or face the prospect of new nuclear tests."}
{"original": "the dprk will steadily develop necessary and prerequisite strategic weapons for the security of the state until the u.s. rolls back its hostile policy, the korean central news agency reported kim as saying."}
{"original": "trump administration officials had feared such a test during the holiday – a north korea official had threatened a christmas gift to the u.s. – but nothing had happened as midnight passed in north korea."}
{"original": "in speaking with reporters, trump joked that he hoped kim's christmas present was a beautiful vase ... as opposed to something else."}
{"original": "trump remains hopeful of a denuclearization agreement with north korea, though critics say kim's government has continued to develop nuclear programs even after the two leaders signed a document at their first summit in june of 2018. the two men also met in 2019 in vietnam and at the north korea-south korea border."}
{"original": "while trump often cites the singapore agreement as a hopeful sign, critics pointed out that it was nonspecific and nonbinding when it came to north korea giving up nuclear weapons."}
{"original": "kim signed nothing binding regarding nukes or missiles. no kim ever has, tweeted robert e. kelly, professor of political science at pusan national university in south korea."}
{"original": "he added: and republicans used to know that the kims shouldn't be trusted. but now the gop's a cult of personality, right? so if the great leader says it's true, it must be so."}
{"original": "washington – john bolton, president donald trump's former national security adviser, said monday that he is prepared to testify in a senate impeachment trial – if he's subpoenaed by the republican-controlled chamber."}
{"original": "i have concluded that, if the senate issues a subpoena for my testimony, i am prepared to testify, bolton said in a statement monday."}
{"original": "bolton's unexpected statement – coming after he's played coy for weeks about what he knows and whether he would dish on trump – plays into the hands of house speaker nancy pelosi, d-calif., and senate democrats."}
{"original": "if senate republicans now refuse to subpoena bolton and other witnesses, they would make absolutely clear they are participating in a cover-up, senate democratic leader chuck schumer, d-n.y., said shortly after bolton issued his statement."}
{"original": "democrats want bolton to testify, hoping he would be a bombshell witness in their case against trump, which accuses the president of soliciting interference from ukraine in the 2020 presidential election."}
{"original": "bolton has hinted that he could offer new details about the ukraine pressure campaign."}
{"original": "he was personally involved in many of the events, meetings, and conversations about which you have already received testimony, his lawyer said in a november letter to house democrats, as well as many relevant meetings and conversations that have not yet been discussed in the testimonies thus far."}
{"original": "on monday, bolton said he's tried to balance his obligations as a citizen and as former national security adviser, portraying himself as torn between a presidential directive not to testify and a desire to comply with a congressional request for information."}
{"original": "but skeptics questioned the sincerity of bolton's offer, saying the republican-run senate is unlikely to call any witnesses."}
{"original": "the house impeached trump for abuse of power and obstructing congress in a historic vote on dec. 18. pelosi has not yet sent the two articles of impeachment to the senate for a trial; she's holding them back as leverage in her effort to pressure republicans to call new witnesses during a senate trial."}
{"original": "in november, bolton defied a request from democrats leading the house impeachment inquiry to testify. at the time, bolton's lawyer told lawmakers he would take the impeachment committee to court if it subpoenaed him."}
{"original": "house democrats decided not to subpoena bolton during their probe, arguing it would delay their investigation with a protracted court battle; instead, they labeled bolton's refusal to appear as evidence of obstruction."}
{"original": "since the house vote, schumer has pushed for summoning four witnesses who did not testify during the house inquiry, including bolton and acting white house chief of staff mick mulvaney."}
{"original": "senate majority leader mitch mcconnell, r-ky., has balked at calling any witnesses, pushing for a quick trial that would lead to trump's acquittal. republicans have criticized pelosi for refusing to transmit the articles of impeachment to the senate, saying they have not yet been able to organize the trial."}
{"original": "mcconnell did not mention bolton by name during a senate floor speech on monday, but said he wants the house impeachment prosecutors and trump's defense attorneys to present their cases before the senate decides whether to call witnesses."}
{"original": "there's no question bolton, who clashed with trump repeatedly and left the white house on acrimonious terms, could provide an insider's account of trump's effort to pressure ukraine's president, volodymyr zelensky, for political favors."}
{"original": "according to fiona hill, one of bolton's former deputies, bolton was alarmed by the ukraine pressure campaign, particularly the role of rudy giuliani, trump's personal lawyer, played in carrying out that shadow foreign policy agenda. hill said bolton called giuliani a hand grenade and referred to the ukraine effort as a drug deal that would backfire on the white house."}
{"original": "impeachment supporters welcomed the prospect of bolton's testimony, saying he can shed light on the president's decision to temporarily block aid to ukraine as he and others pressing zelensky to open two investigations that would benefit trump in his 2020 reelection campaign."}
{"original": "good for you @ambjohnbolton, tweeted neal katyal, former acting solicitor general and author of a book on impeachment. we are all americans, united in our pursuit of the truth."}
{"original": "katyal added; i hope your white house colleagues, including president trump, follow your lead and testify as well. the american people deserve no less."}
{"original": "but barb mcquade, a former federal prosecutor, described bolton's new statement as a pr move designed to help the former national security adviser sell copies of his forthcoming book."}
{"original": "he is currently in a bad spot because he looks like he was willing to tell his story only for money, not for country, said mcquade, a law professor at the university of michigan. he is gambling that the senate will not demand his testimony."}
{"original": "if mcconnell does subpoena him, bolton could always change his mind, citing executive privilege, mcquade said."}
{"original": "others said that, depending on how the senate trial's rules are written, a simple majority of senators could approve a subpoena – and a few gop senators may want to hear from bolton and others."}
{"original": "everyone saying 'yeah but the senate won't subpoena bolton' ... just chill for a moment, tweeted national security lawyer bradley p. moss. let the president stew with this new cycle for a few hours."}
{"original": "moss told usa today that all eyes would now be trained first on trump, to see how he reacts to bolton's statement, and then on a handful of moderate gop senators who could potentially break with mcconnell to demand testimony from bolton and other witnesses."}
{"original": "schumer said sunday it would take only four republican senators to join democrats in the push for witnesses, and possibly new documents."}
{"original": "we have the ability to require votes on the four witnesses we've asked for, whether there's agreement or not, schumer said on abc's this week. we have the ability to ask for the documents and i hope, pray, and believe there's a decent chance that four republicans will join us."}
{"original": "the white house declined to comment on bolton's statement."}
{"original": "as she nears a decision on whether to seek the presidency, sen. kamala harris is taking on what could be a hurdle in a democratic primary: her past as a prosecutor."}
{"original": "in her memoir published tuesday, the california democrat describes herself as a progressive prosecutor and says it's a false choice to decide between supporting the police and advocating for greater scrutiny of law enforcement. the argument is aimed at liberal critics of her record who argue she was sometimes too quick to side with the police and too slow to adopt sentencing reforms."}
{"original": "i know that most police officers deserve to be proud of their public service and commended for the way they do their jobs, harris writes in the truths we hold. ''i know how difficult and dangerous the job is, day in and day out, and i know how hard it is for the officers' families, who have to wonder if the person they love will be coming home at the end of each shift."}
{"original": "but, she continues, i also know this: it is a false choice to suggest you must either be for the police or for police accountability. i am for both. most people i know are for both. let's speak some truth about that, too."}
{"original": "after high-profile fatal shootings involving police officers and unarmed people of color, the criminal justice system's treatment of minorities is a top issue among democratic voters. the passage suggests harris is aware that her seven years as the district attorney in san francisco, followed by six years as california's attorney general, is something she will have to explain and signals how she may frame her law enforcement career if she decides to run for the white house."}
{"original": "it's a presidential campaign, and every aspect of a candidate's record is going to be scrutinized and they're going to have to answer for it, said mo elleithee, a longtime democratic operative who leads georgetown university's institute of politics and public service. she knows that this is something that's heading her way and a good candidate is one who doesn't wait for it to hit them. a good candidate is someone who addresses it proactively, and she appears to be doing that."}
{"original": "beyond the book, harris supported legislation that passed the senate late last year and overhauls the criminal justice system, especially when it comes to sentencing rules."}
{"original": "in the book, harris recounts an instance when she was an intern at the alameda county district attorney's office and an innocent bystander was one of many people arrested during a drug raid. harris said she begged and pleaded on a late friday afternoon for a judge to hear the case so the woman could avoid spending the weekend in jail."}
{"original": "kate chatfield, the policy director of the california-based criminal justice reform group re:store justice, said harris did do some good when she was in law enforcement, but that it was incumbent on the public to hold her accountable for the ways in which she either didn't do enough or actually did some harm."}
{"original": "when the conversation shifts, one should be expected to be questioned about those choices, chatfield said, noting among other issues harris's advocacy for tougher truancy laws."}
{"original": "by addressing policing in the book, harris is taking on an issue that confronted democrats and some republicans in 2016. democrat hillary clinton was criticized for her husband's role in passing the 1994 violent crime control and law enforcement act, which created stricter penalties for drug offenders and funneled billions of dollars toward more police and new prisons."}
{"original": "the issue is likely to be the subject of fierce debate in 2020 as well and could expose divisions among the wide field of candidates — presenting hurdles for some and opportunity for others."}
{"original": "former vice president joe biden was the head of the senate's judiciary committee when the 1994 crime bill — which is now criticized as having helped create an era of mass incarceration — was passed and signed into law, which could be an obstacle for him. new jersey sen. cory booker was central to the passage of the senate's criminal justice overhaul package and is certain to tout it if he decides to launch a presidential campaign. meanwhile, minnesota sen. amy klobuchar, who is also considering a 2020 bid, often refers to her own prosecutorial past."}
{"original": "the memoir — and the publicity surrounding it — will shift the 2020 campaign spotlight to harris this week after much of the focus has been on her senate colleague elizabeth warren. last week, the massachusetts democrat became the most prominent person yet to take steps toward a presidential run by forming an exploratory committee. her weekend trip to the leadoff caucus state of iowa also generated largely flattering headlines."}
{"original": "some criminal justice advocates said they were happy the issue would get more attention in 2020."}
{"original": "when we had the 2016 elections, it was at the height of ferguson and baltimore, and we still didn't have serious engagement with criminal justice reform, said phillip goff, the president of the center for policing equity, referring to the protests that followed the deaths of black men at the hands of police officers in missouri and maryland. my hope is that we require candidates to demonstrate that they know more than the catchphrases of the activists in their bases."}
{"original": "surveys underscore the potency of criminal justice issues among democrats. a february 2018 poll conducted by the associated press-norc center for public affairs research found that majorities of democrats — but far fewer republicans — think there's been little progress for african-americans on criminal justice or policing issues over the past 50 years. the poll showed that 45 percent of americans, including 62 percent of democrats and 19 percent of republicans, thought there had been little to no progress on fair treatment for black americans by the criminal justice system. similarly, 46 percent of americans, including 63 percent of democrats and 23 percent of republicans, said there's been little to no progress for african-americans on fair treatment by police."}
{"original": "while it's not yet clear how harris' prosecutorial background could affect her primary bid, it could help her if she faces president donald trump in the 2020 general election."}
{"original": "he ran as the law-and-order president, elleithee said of trump. being able to go toe-to-toe with him on law and order in a smarter way, i think, is going to be important. should she win the nomination and does it by navigating this topic well, then i think she would be a strong voice and a force to be reckoned with when it comes to issues of law and order, criminal justice and civil rights as they collide in a general election."}

{"original": "stylish and vivid, violent and colorful, the newest installment of fx's american crime story anthology series (wednesday, 10 et/pt, ★★★½ out of four) is not a courtroom drama like 2016's the people v. o.j. simpson. nor is it really the story of the death of gianni versace, the famed fashion designer who was shot dead on the steps of his miami beach villa in 1997."}
{"original": "instead, the nine-episode series, from executive producers ryan murphy and tom rob smith, based on the book vulgar favors by maureen orth, is the story of spree killer andrew cunanan, who claimed versace as his fifth and final victim. the series spins backward in time, peeling back the layers of one of america's most enigmatic killers, brought to life with disturbing energy and commitment by darren criss, who has decidedly left his wholesome glee character in the dust."}

{"original": "soon, the series leaves the versaces behind to focus on cunanan, occasionally weaving in flashbacks to versace's childhood and ascent to fashion stardom. whether it's responsible to give a killer a starring role is never quite examined, at least not in the first eight episodes. each takes a step backward in cunanan's life, including his murders of lee miglin (mike farrell), david madson (cody fern), jeff trail (finn wittrock) and william reese (gregg lawrence). and eventually the series travels back to cunanan's troubled childhood to decode the man."}
{"original": "cunanan is a grotesquely fascinating figure, but versace's weakness, especially compared to people v. o.j., is that his life (and death) wasn't eventful enough to to devote nine episodes. cunanan's tale is simpler, with fewer points of view than the o.j. saga. the series' reverse chronology is captivating, but it occasionally confuses the events in the killer's life."}

{"original": "however, the series' strengths lie in its spectacle. murphy has a knack for grandiosity, and, as with american horror story, versace marries the extravagant with the violent. even when the series stretches its plot too thin, bold direction mostly makes up for it, ensuring that there is always something to look at, either beautiful or repulsive."}
{"original": "the series is grounded by sublime performances from its cast, led by criss (and we're guessing the emmys will notice); martin, the singer whose deft and subtle acting skills may surprise viewers who missed him in spanish-language tv; and cruz, whose portrayal of donatella never borders on cartoonish."}
{"original": "versace will inevitably be compared to people v. o.j., so it's better that it stands apart from the earlier emmy-winning chapter. what it does well, it does extremely well, and its mix of beauty and horror will stick with you long after its episodes conclude."}

{"original": "new york businessman donald trump, retired pediatric neurosurgeon ben carson and california businesswoman carly fiorina never held public office, but all, at various points and to varying degrees, were tearing up the polls as voters craved something different than the usual political suspects in 2016 gop presidential race."}
{"original": "carson held the coveted top spot in polls for a few days in october and november. fiorina, buoyed by two stellar debate performances in august and september, even occupied second place in the polls for a minute in early fall."}
{"original": "but only trump has been able to maintain a hold on the top spot, while carson and fiorina have become the forgotten outsiders. a major campaign staff shake-up for carson earlier this month didn't even merit a mention on sunday morning television news programs while fiorina has been polling so low in the single digits that she's often not even mentioned anymore in stories about the gop horserace."}
{"original": "according to the realclearpolitics rolling average of polls, carson is running a distant fourth in iowa and nationally and is even further back in new hampshire. fiorina, meanwhile, barely cracks the top 10 in iowa and is in the low single digits nationwide and in new hampshire. perhaps most damaging, her flagging poll numbers meant she failed to qualify for thursday's prime-time debate stage."}

{"original": "indeed, carson's polling numbers began their precipitous drop in mid-november, just days after the terrorist attacks in paris, which claimed 130 lives. he hasn't recovered, falling from between around 15% to 20% support in the days before the attack to 6% to 10% in recent days."}

{"original": "trump has managed to stay atop the polls, lichtman said, in part because he was a built-in celebrity when he entered the race."}

{"original": "you've got two billionaires, tom steyer and michael bloomberg, who can keep running hard even if no one gives them a dime. you've got a few people who have no more races left. biden, sanders and bloomberg, at 77, 78 and 77, respectively, are in their last democratic primaries. the same is likely true of retiring hawaii rep. tulsi gabbard, 38, who has been making democrats uneasy and flirting with third parties for years. all anyone has to do to get some delegates in a state is eke out 15% of the vote. right now, in most early state polls, four to five candidates are at or close to that mark."}
{"original": "most analysts would consider a brokered democratic convention a huge boost to president donald trump's reelection chances. after all, chaos at the convention has always been bad for a party. in 1968, the riots in chicago helped richard nixon narrowly win. turmoil in miami four years later helped doom george mcgovern. since that time, both parties have done their best to present unified, well-organized conventions, to avoid the kiss of death that a tumultuous convention seems to bring."}

{"original": "after winning just four games last season under rex ryan, the jets went 10-6 and created a sense of confidence and optimism throughout the organization. but with a chance to reach the postseason for the first time since the 2010 season, new york blew it — and the players and coach were left wondering what could have been."}
{"original": "i think we have something special here, wide receiver brandon marshall said, and i thought we had the formula to make a run at it."}

{"original": "harrison has established himself as one of the nfl's top nose tackles and could fetch a huge contract. new york still has leonard williams, coming off a solid rookie season, and sheldon richardson, who could be facing another suspension in 2016 for violating the nfl's personal conduct policy last offseason. it seems unlikely the jets will be able to keep them all."}

{"original": "san antonio — a mere 17 months ago, the ncaa's division i board of directors gathered in indianapolis to approve a new governance structure that was celebrated as a way for the five high-resource football conferences to finally get significant things done and feared by many on the outside as a separation that would leave the financial have-nots unable to compete."}
{"original": "the push for power conference autonomy, as it was called, had been driven by the significant legal pressures on college sports and forced upon the smaller conferences at the point of a bayonet. they would either fall in line with the wishes of former sec commissioner mike slive and big ten commissioner jim delany or else, a threat that implied the breakup of div. i or even perhaps the entire ncaa."}
{"original": "those contentious times, however, seemed like a faded footnote friday morning at the ncaa convention when officials from the 65 power conference schools and 15 athlete representatives easily passed a series of milquetoast proposals that were part of the second autonomy agenda."}
{"original": "ncaa members ok football championship games for all conferences"}
{"original": "whereas a year ago the autonomy group enacted some landmark legislation that rippled through div. i — highlighted by full cost of attendance stipends, guaranteed scholarships, and concussion protocols — the legislative package adopted by the power five this year was thoroughly non-controversial and rooted largely in ncaa minutia."}
{"original": "the biggest headline, in fact, was the resolution schools adopted to come up with a plan to address time demands on athletes — for next year's convention."}
{"original": "last year i walked out of here feeling like we did something significant, said ty darlington, one of the big 12's student representatives and the starting center on the football team. this year i felt like we sort of relaxed."}
{"original": "which isn't to say any of the new rules adopted friday were bad."}
{"original": "one of them will allow schools to pay for food, lodging and entertainment (but not airplane tickets) for up to four family members when recruits come on official visits. another will allow schools to waive application fees or housing deposits for signed recruits. a rule was passed making it easier for walk-ons who earn scholarships to receive them on a semester-by-semester basis. so was a proposal allowing athletes to purchase extra tickets to championship events such as the final four at face value in addition to the six complementary admissions they receive."}
{"original": "one more significant piece of legislation passed gives the school's lead medical personnel autonomy over return-to-play decisions; another will allow baseball players to use an agent to negotiate with major league teams during the decision period between the draft and college enrollment without jeopardizing their eligibility."}
{"original": "individually, these were all common sense changes that will benefit athletes. but after all the urgency that went into gaining autonomy and the promises of swift action to address big issues, this felt like a return to typical ncaa tedium, which may or may not have required power five autonomy to get done in the first place."}
{"original": "there's a lot that's happened for student-athletes to improve their experiences, and that shouldn't be lost, sec commissioner greg sankey said. we pushed those things more quickly (with autonomy) than they otherwise would have been produced. you have a less encumbered process that really facilitates some action. that doesn't mean every time we have a meeting it's going to be a session where we light fireworks at the end, but there is meaningful work being done, that has been done and i think that will be done."}
{"original": "but not necessarily the kind of work that seemed inevitable — and necessary — when autonomy was conceived. based on this year's agenda, fears from smaller schools that the power five would push for proposals allowing them to spend, spend, spend their way into a further separation from the have-nots appear to be unfounded. though they were not allowed to vote, several commissioners from conferences outside the power five sat in on the autonomy session friday and did not seem unhappy with any of the proposals that passed."}
{"original": "more often than not there's much more commonality, there just is, mid-american conference commissioner jon steinbrecher said. at the end of the day there's always going to be issues of resources and so on, but on many of these things, if they can do it, do it. if they don't want to do it, don't do it. sooner or later things are going to come up that we just have philosophical differences on, but for most of this stuff we're philosophically aligned."}

{"original": "name, image and likeness issues are central to the ed o'bannon antitrust lawsuit, which could ultimately end up in front of the supreme court."}

{"original": "other conferences that wanted more time; they were afraid there were loopholes, concerned about implementation, scott said. we got feedback from conferences that were nervous and just wanted more time to digest it. as a general rule if something is routinely being approved by waivers we want it in the rule."}
{"original": "though sankey, among others, insisted that the autonomy process is an improvement over the difficulties that existed before, it is obviously not a cure-all."}
{"original": "with cost of attendance out of the way, reducing time demands for athletes is now the no. 1 priority for college sports leaders. but it's also a problem with layers of complexity that affects different sports in different ways when you start getting into rules such as mandatory days off or set evening hours where coaches aren't allowed to engage in team activities. essentially, the power conference schools gave themselves a mandate friday to come up with a plan that can be enacted a year from now."}
{"original": "we have to get into the details of what everything means, north carolina athletics director bubba cunningham said. if our basketball team charters after a game, chances are they can get back before midnight. but if our volleyball team plays on a wednesday and travels on thursday, and that's not the (mandatory) day off, then you have to put another day off into that week? that's pretty hard to manage. what about if a team gets home at 1 in the morning? you have to be pretty thoughtful."}
{"original": "darlington, the oklahoma football player, said it was unacceptable that the autonomy group couldn't come up with a way to address the issue this year. he produced the most poignant moment of the entire session when he told the room he didn't feel like it accomplished anything to significantly impact the student-athlete experience."}
{"original": "oklahoma athletics director joe castiglione applauded the sentiment behind darlington's comments."}
{"original": "his statements resonated with a lot of people, maybe the vast majority of people, castiglione said. hopefully that adds even more of a sense of urgency to getting these changes made. i think people are very much engaged in the spirit and intent behind a number of these proposals, there were just a number of areas of the previous proposals that needed a little bit more work. in the long run, we will make a lot of progress, there's no doubt about it and let's be fair, there's been a great deal of progress already made."}

{"original": "when my grandmother got here almost a hundred years ago, i'm sure she never could have imagined that just two generations later, one of her grandsons would be serving as a member of the united states congress and the other would be standing with you here today to say these words: i am a candidate for president of the united states of america, castro told a crowd of supporters in front of an american flag backdrop."}
{"original": "castro, who made remarks in both english and spanish, also rolled out his campaign slogan: one nation. one destiny."}
{"original": "castro's campaign announcement at the historic plaza guadalupe came one day after hawaii rep. tulsi gabbard, 37, said she was also running for president, telling cnn i have decided to run and will be making a formal announcement within the next week."}
{"original": "castro, 44, along with gabbard, have been predicted to be two of the youngest of expected candidates. castro may also be the most well-known latino figure in a race that's likely to revolve around immigration policy."}
{"original": "his announcement also followed democratic u.s. sen. elizabeth warren unveiling plans for an exploratory committee for president, a formality that comes before the launch of a presidential campaign that legally allows potential candidates to raise money."}
{"original": "on his way to the announcement, castro rode a public bus to the plaza and live-streamed it to his facebook page. the bus, no. 68, was the same one he and his twin brother rode to school as children."}
{"original": "his first trip as a candidate is scheduled for puerto rico, where he will visit with residents still coping with the effects of hurricane maria. he told supporters his first act as president, if elected, would be to rejoin the paris climate accord, something that u.s. withdrew from under trump. in his speech, castro touched on many issues that are likely to guide the 2020 election season, including women's reproductive rights, medicare for all, black lives matter, climate change and immigration policy."}
{"original": "today we're falling backwards instead of moving forward. and the opportunities that made america, the america we love, those opportunities are reaching fewer and fewer people, castro told the crowd. today, we're at risk of dropping the baton. and that's why we are all here today. because we're going to make sure that the promise of america is available to everyone."}
{"original": "castro is likely to face stiff competition from a crowded field of high-profile democrats in a primary challenge. along with gabbard and warren, others, including former vice president joe biden and new jersey sen. cory booker, are also said to be considering a run for the democratic nomination."}

{"original": "young and telegenic, castro rose to national prominence early in his career as a latino leader from a state that democrats are eager to retake after decades of republican dominance. but in texas, o'rourke has eclipsed castro after getting closer to a statewide victory than any democrat in a generation. it now puts texas in the formerly unthinkable position of having two democratic presidential candidates in the same year."}

{"original": "but as democrats have begun announcing their candidacy for 2020, the republican national committee has started their own campaign aimed at delegitimizing liberals. after castro made his announcement, the committee sent out a cheat sheet on castro's record that characterized him as weak and used previous news coverage that described him as a lightweight and someone who didn't have enough experience for the office of the presidency."}
{"original": "julián castro has made history by becoming one of the biggest lightweights to ever run for president, said michael ahrens, a spokesman for the republican national committee. he was a weak mayor who couldn't even handle being hud secretary. this is obviously just another desperate attempt to become someone else's running mate."}
{"original": "since leaving the obama cabinet, castro has established a political action committee called opportunity first to help elect left-of-center candidates. in october, his memoir, an unlikely journey: waking up from my american dream, was released."}

{"original": "the president's behavior after the election was wildly different than his behavior before, he descended into a level of madness and engaged in a level of activity that was just absolutely unthinkable, toomey told cnn's state of the union."}

{"original": "he said the ensuing riot was a fundamental threat to the united states and recounted an episode during trump's impeachment hearing last year in which he told the president, who was accused of witness tampering: 'mr. president, this is a problem & we need to fix it.' he pushed back a little bit but then he ... he pivoted."}

{"original": "the numbers reflect followers as of wednesday, not long before the historic house vote to impeach trump on allegations of inciting the riot one week earlier."}
{"original": "leading conservatives have accused twitter of political bias in its moderation policies. but ethan zuckerman, associate professor of public policy, information and communication at the university of massachusetts at amherst, said it's more likely that gop lawmakers lost followers because their followers included qanon adherents."}

{"original": "some prominent conservatives including republican rep. matt gaetz of florida cried foul, accusing twitter of wiping out right-wing accounts because of their political beliefs. the representative lost about 6% of his total followers during the past week."}

{"original": "republican follower counts plunged after twitter purge"}
{"original": "twitter says it removed more than 70,000 accounts, many of which the social media company saidwere associated with qanon extremism, to root out commentary that could incite violence after banning trump last week. qanon adherents believe that trump is their savior in the fight against satanic democrats and deep state officials, who will be overthrown in some great awakening."}
{"original": "given the violent events in washington, d.c., and increased risk of harm, we began permanently suspending thousands of accounts that were primarily dedicated to sharing qanon content on friday afternoon, the company said."}
{"original": "the previous week twitter permanently banned trump's former national security adviser michael flynn, former attorney sidney powell, and 8chan founder ron watkins, all of whom amplified qanon content."}
{"original": "twitter also stepped up enforcement of accounts that persistently spread misleading and false information, warning that repeat violations could lead to permanent suspension."}
{"original": "a number of trump supporters vowed to delete their accounts after the president's permanent suspension. i'm a small maga account and i have lost 400 followers in 3 days. goodbye twitter. you don't want me, i don't want you, one user tweeted last saturday."}
{"original": "those factors, combined with the routine removal of bot and spam accounts, likely caused dramatic fluctuations in some users' follower counts, not anti-conservative bias, said zuckerman, the umass amherst professor."}
{"original": "a simple explanation for conservatives losing large numbers of followers is that: a) they were being followed by folks who posted qanon content; and b) they were being followed by lots of fake/sockpuppet accounts, zuckerman said."}
{"original": "conservatives accuse twitter of bias in purge"}
{"original": "the heritage foundation, a conservative think tank, lost 45,000 followers, according to rob bluey, vice president of communications."}
{"original": "it's just another example of conservative frustration with big tech, bluey said. conservatives feel they are being targeted unfairly and believe these companies tend to be controlled and run by liberals who have it out for them. at the same time, these companies always point back to their terms of service and their policies for the reason or excuse of why they took action."}
{"original": "and that, he says, is why we find ourselves in this big debate about what to do about it."}
{"original": "broadly speaking, social media companies have wide latitude to decide what can stay on their platforms and what must come down thanks to section 230 of the communications decency act, decades-old legal protections that shield them from liability for what users post on their platforms."}
{"original": "the conservative outcry over the moderation of posts, particularly those of the president, has led to multiple congressional hearings and threats to narrow or repeal the law. facebook's mark zuckerberg and twitter's jack dorsey have for years tried to appease the political right."}
{"original": "darren linvill, lead researcher in the clemson university media forensics hub, said the scale of twitter's recent removal of accounts was unusual."}
{"original": "i'm still relatively surprised they would take such sweeping action, linvill said. in the past, they have shown reticence to take action that might feed the perception of liberal bias, and this certainly has alienated many loyal users."}
{"original": "twitter gets more aggressive against qanon"}
{"original": "in the aftermath of the capitol attacks, twitter has become much more aggressive rooting out qanon and other problematic content."}
{"original": "in july, twitter banned 7,000 qanon accounts and blocked topics related to the conspiracy theory from appearing in trending topics, but that action did little to undercut its influence on the platform."}
{"original": "for that purge, they used a scalpel, only getting rid of about 10,000 of the worst offenders, linvill said. clearly, this past week, twitter switched from a scalpel to a chainsaw."}
{"original": "despite the outcry from conservatives, who described the account removals as the largest-ever twitter purge, the company has cracked down much harder in the past. in 2018, twitter suspended more than 1.2 million bogus accounts. celebrities lost followers in the six figures. ceo dorsey himself lost 200,000 followers."}
{"original": "democrats had smaller declines and some big gains"}
{"original": "the usa today analysis shows that the declines in follower counts of 13 congressional democrats were far more modest than for republicans. california sen. dianne feinstein lost the most followers with 3,425."}
{"original": "at the same time, prominent democrats gained a significant number of followers. vice president-elect kamala harris (232,020) and house speaker nancy pelosi (163,841) were the top gainers. vermont sen. bernie sanders, an independent who ran as a democrat for president in 2016 and 2020 and is part of the senate democratic leadership, increased his following by 134,251."}
{"original": "according to the pew research center, nearly every member of congress maintains one personal or campaign account and one official twitter account. these accounts produce a flood of social media posts, far more than even a few years ago."}
{"original": "in the first five months of 2020, members of congress collectively produced an average of 73,924 tweets each month."}
{"original": "democrats in congress are much more likely to use twitter to communicate, likely because u.s. adults on twitter are more likely to identify as democrats, pew found. and the number of followers for the typical democrat has grown much more quickly than for the typical republican. the median democratic member of congress has over 17,000 more twitter followers than the median republican."}
{"original": "federal reserve chairman jerome powell suggested thursday the central bank is likely to lower its forecast from two interest rate hikes this year amid volatile financial markets and a slowing u.s. and global economy."}
{"original": "during the year, we'll look at (the economy) and tighter financial conditions and we'll also lower our rate path and monitor the effects of that on the economy and markets, powell said in an interview at the economic club of washington d.c. he stressed the fed has made no decisions about the pace of rate increases this year and will respond to the economy as it evolves, saying officials will be flexible."}
{"original": "powell's remarks largely echoed his assertion at a forum in atlanta last week that the fed will be patient as it weighs future rate hikes – a message that has helped drive stocks higher. on thursday, he appeared to more explicitly indicate that fed policymakers could lower their rate-hike forecast if markets continue to be turbulent and the economy slows more than anticipated."}
{"original": "fed policymakers' estimate of two rate increases this year was contingent on a really strong outlook for 2018, powell said. while he said that may still happen, he added, we can be patient and wait and see what does evolve, noting that inflation has been modest."}
{"original": "fed fund futures markets have been predicting the fed won't raise rates at all this year."}
{"original": "the stock market plunged in mid-december after the fed raised its key interest rate for a fourth time in 2018 and forecast the two additional hikes this year. although that was a downgrade from its prior projection of three increases, markets expected the fed to take more of a wait-and-see approach to future moves in light of slowing global growth, the u.s. trade war with china, market turbulence and stable inflation."}

{"original": "we don't get distracted by other things, powell said. we don't take political factors into consideration. the fed is an independent agency and its insulation from political pressure has underpinned its credibility and influence."}

{"original": "q: what should i do about a colleague who doesn't wash his hands after going to the bathroom? — anonymous"}
{"original": "taylor: i can't think of many issues in the workplace as sensitive as personal hygiene. dealing with this problem can be uncomfortable, awkward and downright embarrassing. because this is a tricky one, you should immediately involve your human resources department, which is trained to handle such sensitive conversations."}
{"original": "while you might be appalled by your colleague's behavior (as you should be), the real issue is one of public safety. bad hygiene can impact the health and well-being of co-workers and your company's customers and clients."}
{"original": "according to research conducted by blue cross blue shield, when employees don't wash their hands, illnesses from the common cold to the flu to gastrointestinal infections can be spread to co-workers and cause them to miss work or be less productive when they do come to work while sick."}
{"original": "and not a week goes by when we don't learn of a major outbreak of e. coli or salmonella in which the suspected cause is a food worker who failed to wash his or her hands after using the restroom. sadly, many of these outbreaks do more than sicken people — they actually kill people, particularly children, the elderly and those whose immune systems are compromised from other illnesses."}
{"original": "in short, an employee failing to wash his or her hands is a serious matter that could be a violation of company policy. public-health campaigns have led to more hand-washing, but there's still a gap between those who say they wash their hands after using a public restroom and those who actually do it."}

{"original": "sometimes a personal hygiene issue stems from cultural norms or a medical condition. if this is the case, hr will respond empathetically while addressing the issue professionally."}
{"original": "q. can a company fire a new employee within a 90-day probationary period without write-ups? — chris"}
{"original": "taylor: if an employee works in an at-will state and there is no employment contract or collective bargaining agreement, an employer can fire the employee within the first 90 days without any warning or write-ups."}
{"original": "before offering details, let me define a few terms."}
{"original": "at-will means that an employer or employee can terminate their relationship at any time and for any reason, except for unlawful ones such as discrimination or retaliation. employment is at-will in all states except montana."}
{"original": "a probationary period is a set time to give an employer the opportunity to determine whether a new hire has the required skills and abilities and is a good fit with the job and company. the length of time for this varies from company to company, although 90 days seems common."}
{"original": "a write-up — also referred to as written warnings, disciplinary action or counseling forms — is used to document an employee's violation of company policy and issues with job performance."}
{"original": "as a new employee, you may want to review your company's policies to determine whether its practices include verbal or written warnings before termination within the probationary period. monitor your own performance by asking for and documenting feedback from your supervisors."}
{"original": "employers should be mindful that there is nothing magical about the number 90. sometimes, performance issues manifest themselves in less — or more — time. and firing an employee during a probationary period does not provide greater protections against a wrongful termination lawsuit or discrimination complaint."}
{"original": "companies should clearly communicate to applicants and new employees the purpose of their probationary period and whether they are an at-will employer. as a matter of good faith, supervisors should give ongoing feedback to help probationary employees understand whether they are meeting the expectations of the job."}
{"original": "no employer hires a worker thinking it's not going to work out. but if termination is necessary, it should be done in a way that follows the employer's practices, as well as state and federal law."}

{"original": "i was going until someone cut me off, motley said."}
{"original": "and tcu really never did that all day against motley, who was 12-of-15 shooting with all of those makes in the paint. the breakaway drive was in a stretch when he scored nine straight points for baylor (22-3, 9-3 big 12), including a three-point play after getting fouled while making a layup."}

{"original": "baylor: the bears have their best-ever record through 25 games overall (22-3) and best through 12 big 12 games (9-3). drew said his team was intent to erase what happened in its last home game, when the bears were down by 17 points in the first half last saturday against kansas state before a late rally came up two points short."}
{"original": "mcclure had back-to-back 3-pointers for baylor to make it 15-6 during a first-half stretch when tcu went more than 7 minutes without a field goal. mcclure started his second straight game in place of suspended al freeman, who is out for what the school called a violation of team policy. it is unclear when freeman may be reinstated. mcclure has 23 points on 9-of-12 shooting in those two starts."}

{"original": "detroit -- general motors released the first photos sunday of the u.s. version of what will be the first new vehicle from detroit's big 3 that's being imported from china -- the buick envision crossover."}
{"original": "ahead of its formal unveiling at the north american international auto show, buick offered a peek at the vehicle that it that will be produced at a joint venture plant in china. last year, buick sold more than 140,000 envisions in china."}
{"original": "americans continue to shift from traditional passenger cars to crossovers and suvs. higher-driving positions and more voluminous storage are fueling much of the migration."}
{"original": "sales of what autodata calls sport wagons and crossovers grew 18.5% in 2015 to 4.5 million, while sales of midsize cars fell 2% to 3,5 million."}
{"original": "buick needed to quickly fill a hole in their product lineup, and importing the envision is the quickest way to do it, said erik gordon, clinical assistant professor at the university of michigan's ross school of business."}
{"original": "the united auto workers union protested general motors' decision to import the envision during this year's labor negotiations. but buick can begin selling it as early as july because it's already produced in china, and shipping it here can happen faster than it would take to install new tooling in a north american plant already running near its capacity."}
{"original": "gm officials, including duncan aldred, vice president of buick and gmc, have pointed out that the company's u.s. engineers have made key changes at the warren tech center that will make the u.s. version of the crossover more appealing to american consumers' driving preferences."}
{"original": "the engines will be of larger displacement. there will be certain comfort and technological features (such as park assist and hyperstrut front suspension) that aren't available in china, aldred said."}
{"original": "the u.s. version will have a 2-liter, four-cylinder turbocharged engine, mated with a six-speed all-wheel drive transmission. the envision sold in china offers the choice of a 2-liter or a 1.5-liter, four-cylinder engine."}
{"original": "buick will also unveil another new vehicle or technology tonight, but envision fills a gap in buick's lineup."}
{"original": "aldred cites the audi q5, acura rdx and lincoln mkc as envision's direct competitors. it is similar in size to such high-volume models as ford escape, jeep cherokee, toyota rav4 and honda cr-v."}
{"original": "despite the uaw's irritation over envision, the economics of bringing a vehicle from china are enhanced at the moment. that country's economy appears to be slowing and its plummeting stock markets dragged down financial markets worldwide in the past five days."}
{"original": "the chinese government continues to devalue its currency, the yuan, as part of a policy designed to boost exports of all chinese-produced goods, from t-shirts to smartphones to cars and trucks."}
{"original": "u-m's gordon, however, doesn't see envision as a harbinger of more vehicles being shipped from china to the u.s."}
{"original": "if carmakers have excess manufacturing capacity in china, they will export cars, but the u.s. market may not be their best bet, he said. it took american buyers a while to warm up to korean cars, and korea was a strong ally that had been exporting high-quality electronic goods to the u.s. for years."}
{"original": "stephanie brinley, an industry analyst with ihs automotive, doesn't expect that most american consumers will care where the envision or any other vehicle is built."}
{"original": "buick is already importing from south korea, europe and poland, brinley said. vehicles are coming from all over the world for all manufacturers."}
{"original": "china is a larger market than north america for buick, which sold more than 1 million vehicles in china in 2015, compared with 223,000 in the u.s."}

{"original": "penne's lost the fight to taylor, which was her third straight ufc defeat."}
{"original": "after being notified of the positive test, penne told usada she was prescribed dehydroepiandrosterone (dhea), an exogenous anabolic agent, by her doctor. after a review of the case, her explanation was accepted by usada and the tennessee athletic commission, which oversaw ufc fight night 108, according to usada's release."}

{"original": "seeking to match the success he had at the high court on his immigration travel ban against predominantly muslim countries last year, trump is counting on the justices – including two that he picked – to reverse lower court losses at the hands of both liberal and conservative judges."}
{"original": "how the supreme court rules on the requests in the coming months will shed light on the justices' views about executive power, judicial discretion and trump's proclivity for upending longstanding policies by whim, or even tweet."}
{"original": "waiting for word are more than 700,000 undocumented immigrants brought to the united states as children who could be threatened with deportation under trump's policy. also in play are some of the estimated thousands of transgender troops serving in the military and others seeking to join who face a partial ban."}
{"original": "the high court already is slated to hear a dispute over the trump administration's effort to ask about citizenship in the 2020 census. other cases that could be headed there eventually include trump's ban on asylum seekers who enter the country illegally and his threat to withhold federal funds from sanctuary cities that do not fully cooperate with immigration authorities."}
{"original": "in most of those cases, the justice department took the unusual step of seeking supreme court action before lower-court appeals had run their course. the administration railed against local judges issuing nationwide injunctions against trump's policies. but the high court has been loath to jump over lower courts."}

{"original": "trump enters 2019 with a poor track record in the federal courts."}
{"original": "just as he did early in his battle to limit travelers from majority-muslim nations, trump has lost most of his battles with judges on issues ranging from early skirmishes over special counsel robert mueller's investigation into russian meddling in the 2016 election to the revoking of cnn reporter jim acosta's white house press credential."}
{"original": "more:it's not just 'obama judges'. here are republican appointees who have ruled against trump"}
{"original": "the trump administration has consistently failed in the lower courts, and they've gotten some relief in the supreme court, says josh blackman, a professor at south texas college of law in houston who follows the high court closely."}
{"original": "that wasn't the case on the deferred action for childhood arrivals program, known as daca, which has helped more than 700,000 undocumented immigrants avoid deportation and get work permits. trump sought to end what president barack obama began but was swatted down by federal district and appeals court judges who said he lacked the authority to do so."}
{"original": "the supreme court refused to block the lower court orders from taking effect but is scheduled to consider hearing the government's appeal at its friday conference. if at least four justices agree to take the case, it could be heard in april and decided by the end of june."}
{"original": "trump hasn't had better luck at the high court with his asylum ban. after a federal judge blocked his effort to cut off asylum for migrants who enter the country illegally – and before the case went to an appeals court – the supreme court narrowly refused, 5-4, to step in. both of trump's high court nominees joined two other conservative justices in dissent."}
{"original": "it probably didn't help that trump blasted federal district court judge jon tigar as an obama judge after his initial ruling, later upheld in a 2-1 opinion by federal appeals court judge jay bybee, who was appointed by president george w. bush."}
{"original": "we do not have obama judges or trump judges, bush judges or clinton judges, roberts said in response to the president's criticism. what we have is an extraordinary group of dedicated judges doing their level best to do equal right to those appearing before them."}
{"original": "roberts later provided the deciding vote against reinstating trump's asylum ban, but the issue could reach the supreme court later this year or in 2020."}
{"original": "the asylum ban case in particular raises distinct separation-of-powers concerns because congress has spoken directly to the issue, which the court found was not the situation with the travel ban, says lee gelernt, deputy director of the american civil liberties union's immigrants' rights project."}
{"original": "the administration's effort to add a question on citizenship to the 2020 census ties in to the overall battle over immigration, since it could depress the official count of immigrants and cause their communities to lose federal aid and representation in congress."}
{"original": "that battle is being fought in lower courts, but the supreme court has scheduled oral argument in february over a side issue: what evidence can be considered in a challenge mounted by state and local governments and immigrant rights groups? they want to expose the trump administration's decision-making process, while the administration says it's irrelevant."}
{"original": "ilya somin, a law professor at george mason university's antonin scalia law school, says the administration likely thinks kavanaugh's replacement of retired justice anthony kennedy is a plus."}
{"original": "they probably have a better chance at the supreme court than at the lower courts, somin says."}
{"original": "the administration had been on a losing streak in its effort to ban transgender troops from serving openly in the military – another policy from the obama administration that trump sought to change 18 months ago with a tweet."}
{"original": "that's not a great way to start a process, margulies says, noting former defense secretary james mattis and top pentagon brass were taken by surprise. that's not a very auspicious start."}
{"original": "four federal district judges blocked the new policy temporarily while it works its way through the court system. but last friday, a federal appeals court reversed one of those rulings, reasoning that the administration's policy had evolved and was not a blanket ban."}
{"original": "the justice department has asked the supreme court to intercede now rather than wait for other appeals court rulings, and a decision could come this month."}
{"original": "one of the administration's central arguments is that district court judges operating at the bottom rung of the federal judicial system should not be able to block executive actions nationwide. it's an argument that has won some support in legal circles."}
{"original": "when a federal appeals court ruled in august against trump's sanctuary cities policy, it nonetheless admonished a lower court for blocking the policy nationwide. and when the supreme court upheld trump's travel ban in june, associate justice clarence thomas said the court should go further and consider stripping district judges of that authority."}
{"original": "at the same time, critics of the administration's legal efforts contend solicitor general noel francisco routinely is seeking to circumvent supreme court rules that allow leapfrogging lower courts only upon a showing that the case is of such imperative public importance as to justify deviation from normal appellate practice."}
{"original": "the justice department has shown a remarkable lack of respect for the judicial process by repeatedly seeking to skip over the lower courts and, rather, go straight to the supreme court, new york's former acting attorney general, barbara underwood, tweeted in november."}
{"original": "if the strategy proves successful, it could lead to even more efforts by the trump administration to seek supreme court bailouts of lower court rulings. one prime target: the justice department is seeking to quash a lawsuit that alleges the president has benefited illegally from his family business, including at the trump international hotel just blocks from the white house."}
{"original": "pittsburgh (ap) — the football player and friend in le'veon bell understood why legarrette blount walked off the job that cold night in nashville more than two years ago, jogging to the locker room with the clock still running as bell and the rest of the pittsburgh steelers reveled in a critical victory over tennessee."}
{"original": "for the teammate in bell, things were a bit more complicated. here was a guy who was supposed to have his back instead pouting his way out of town while bell was in the middle of a breakout season."}
{"original": "it made me think a little more differently (about him), bell said. but legarrette's doing his thing."}
{"original": "blount's just doing it for the patriots, not the steelers, who cut blount two days after his hasty retreat. blount was back with new england by the end of the week and three months later earned a super bowl ring while bell sat at home recovering from a hyperextended left knee injury that forced him to miss pittsburgh's playoff loss to baltimore."}
{"original": "yet bell holds no grudges. the two remain in constant contact, though the texting may slow this week with the steelers (13-5) headed to foxborough to face blount and the patriots (15-2) in the afc championship game."}
{"original": "it wasn't supposed to work out this way."}
{"original": "the steelers signed blount in the spring of 2014 believing the hulking blount could be the bruising change of pace back they needed to complement the rapidly maturing bell's decidedly pragmatic style. and if blount happened to become a mentor of sorts along the way, even better."}
{"original": "in august 2014 bell and blount were picked up by a police officer after he noticed the scent of marijuana smoke coming from a car bell was driving, leading to a dui charge for bell, a drug charge for blount and brief suspensions by the nfl for violating the league's substance abuse policy."}
{"original": "the two split carries early that season, but as bell's touches went up and blount's productivity went down, the future became apparent to both. blount's frustrations bubbled over as bell finished off a 204-yard performance in a monday night game. by lunchtime on wednesday, he was released. the sting in the locker room was palpable."}
{"original": "for him to walk out on his team, yeah it hurt, right tackle marcus gilbert said. whenever legarette blount was over here, it was hard for him to fit into the offense because le'veon was on such a roll. he wanted more touches. it was just hard."}
{"original": "too hard apparently, though for blount the ends ultimately justified the means. he helped push the patriots to a championship shortly after re-signing and ran for an nfl-high 18 touchdowns this season, including two in a 27-16 victory in pittsburgh in october. bell had 149 total yards, 81 receiving and 68 coming on 10 receptions in the loss, a showcase of the versatility few backs in the league can match, blount included."}
{"original": "no, i've never seen anyone do that — to be as effective as he is, blount said. it's just something that he does. it's his style. that's all i can really say about it. you can't really describe what he can do."}
{"original": "bell, blount and their teams have moved on professionally. the role of steadying veteran presence the steelers thought they might be getting with blount has instead been filled by deangelo williams. the 33-year-old has fit in seamlessly, showing there's plenty of life in his legs during the first three weeks of the season while bell served a second suspension for running afoul of the league's drug policy, then gracefully stepping aside when bell returned."}
{"original": "i think deangelo is to the point where he's like, 'man, i just want to win. i don't want the ball 20 times,' bell said. he kind of leans on me, being a younger guy and taking more of the carries and things like that. because deangelo has done just about everything. so i'm obviously trying to be the type of player deangelo is."}
{"original": "blount wasn't at that point in his career yet when he arrived in pittsburgh, though in a twist he's found himself now splitting carries with a resurgent dion lewis. the two have nearly the identical number of carries (59 for lewis, 58 for blount) over the last month, though don't expect blount to literally exit stage left. this isn't two years ago. if it's something that comes up during blount's texts with bell, neither are saying. their bromance stopped being limited to just football long ago. they couldn't co-exist together in the same uniform. life, however, is another matter entirely."}
{"original": "this game doesn't last as long as any friendship would, blount said. this game is limited. you never know when it's over. friendships last forever. he's one of the guys that i'm going to continue to talk to for a really long time."}
{"original": "notes: bell did not practice on thursday but it wasn't injury related. he is expected to play sunday. ... lb james harrison missed practice thursday while dealing with shoulder and triceps injury. ... te ladarius green did not practice and remains in the concussion protocol. ... several players returned to practice after being held out wednesday due to illness, including k chris boswell and wr darrius heyward-bey."}

{"original": "many seniors have no choice but to tap their retirement savings the moment they leave their jobs. but what if you have another income source, such as part-time work or a recent inheritance, and don't need to touch your ira or 401(k) for quite some time?"}
{"original": "holding off on taking withdrawals from your retirement savings is a good choice for two reasons. first, the longer you keep your money invested, the more growth it can achieve. but just as importantly, you'll avoid the taxes that come with traditional retirement plan distributions."}
{"original": "there's just one problem: you can't leave your retirement plan untouched indefinitely. at a certain point, you'll be subject to what are known as required minimum distributions. rmds are yearly minimum amounts that you're required to remove from your ira or 401(k), and they're based on your account balance and life expectancy. if you're not familiar with rmds, here are a few important things to know about them."}
{"original": "1. you're on the hook once you turn 70 1/2"}
{"original": "if you retire in your early or mid-60s, you don't have to worry about rmds right away. that's because the requirement to take yearly withdrawals doesn't kick in until you turn 70 1/2. furthermore, you don't actually have to take your first rmd that year, but rather, by april 1 of the following year. so if, for example, you turn 70 1/2 in may 2018, you can leave your money alone for the remainder of the year. you do, however, need to take that initial withdrawal by april 1, 2019."}
{"original": "2. you'll pay taxes on your rmds..."}
{"original": "just because the irs forces you to remove funds from your retirement plan doesn't mean it doesn't also take its share. anytime you receive a traditional ira or 401(k) withdrawal, whether by choice or not, that money is taxed as ordinary income -- meaning, at the highest possible rate. be sure to plan for this expense so you're not overwhelmed by a huge tax bill after the fact."}
{"original": "3. but you'll pay even more if you fail to take them"}
{"original": "as much as it might pain you to pay taxes on the withdrawals you're forced to take, you'll lose out even further if you neglect to take your rmd in full. that's because the irs will assess a whopping 50% penalty on whatever required funds don't end up leaving your account in time. for example, if your rmd for a given year is $8,000 and you don't take it, you'll fork over $4,000 to the irs -- just that like. that's why it's crucial to pay attention to rmd deadlines. though you get until april 1 of the year after you turn 70 1/2 to take your first withdrawal, all subsequent distributions must be taken by dec. 31 on an annual basis."}
{"original": "4. you can delay rmds from your 401(k) if you're still working"}
{"original": "if you're housing your retirement savings in a traditional ira, you'll generally be subject to rmds regardless of your employment status at the time. but if you reach 70 1/2 and are still working and have your savings in a 401(k), you can avoid rmds for as long as you remain employed. you still need to meet a couple of criteria, though. first, you must be employed by the company sponsoring the plan your money is in, and second, you can't own 5% or more of that company. but if you satisfy these requirements, you get a pass on rmds until you leave that job."}
{"original": "5. you won't need to take rmds if you have a roth ira"}
{"original": "many savers shy away from roth accounts during their working years because they don't offer an immediate tax break on contributions. but one major benefit of roth iras, aside from tax-free withdrawals in retirement, is that they don't impose rmds. therefore, if you have a roth ira account and don't need the money in it, you let it sit and continue to grow. you can even leave it to your heirs, who will also get to enjoy tax-free distributions from that account."}
{"original": "rmds can really trip you up if you aren't careful. if you're approaching 70 1/2, be sure to read up on rmds and plan for them appropriately so you're not left in a precarious financial situation later on."}

{"original": "buttigieg's campaign manager, mike schmuhl, said in a statement that 326,000 people contributed to the campaign in the fourth quarter with an average donation of $33. for the year, he said the campaign received contributions from more than 733,000 people. and of the more than $76 million raised in 2019, 98% was donations of less than $200, schmuhl also said."}
{"original": "the totals for the mayor, whose last day in office is wednesday, underscores his position as one of the leading candidates in the democratic presidential primary. buttigieg has consistently placed fourth in most recent national polls while also polling at or near in the top in iowa and new hampshire, the first two states to vote in the 2020 primary season."}

{"original": "president donald trump, in this process, has compromised the values and principles that are the basis of the boldest social experiment in the history of humankind. he has aligned himself with corrupt, even murderous, dictators who have sought to undermine the freedoms and rights of americans and their long-standing allies around the world. and in spite of his boastful campaign slogan, he has conducted himself in a manner that disgraces the greatness of america and what it symbolized to our fellow citizens of the world before he defiled it."}
{"original": "trump has been enabled by a cowardly class of republican legislators who shamelessly stand mute as he and his minions allow foreign adversaries to corrupt our electoral process and to obstruct lawful investigations and congressional oversight. and rather than moving aggressively to hold the president accountable for his daily assault on our democracy and feeding off of racism in this country (if not out-and-out fomenting it), the democrats have largely responded with timidity."}

{"original": "between 2009 and 2013, the top 1% of income-earning americans captured at least half of all income growth in 24 states, and as a result, it's gotten more difficult to reach that top-income-earner status."}
{"original": "nationally, a family's income has to be at least $389,436 to qualify as being in the top 1%; however, your annual earnings need to be significantly higher than that to achieve this status in 12 states."}
{"original": "for instance, a family's income needs to eclipse $659,979 in connecticut to reach the top 1%, due in large part to the state being home to many high-paying insurance and hedge-fund jobs. if you live in connecticut's bridgeport-stamford-norwalk area, then your income would have to be above the $1 million mark to be in the top 1%. perhaps unsurprisingly, the average income of connecticut's top 1% income earners is a nation-leading $2.4 million."}
{"original": "achieving 1% status is also tough in new jersey, new york and massachusetts. in new jersey and new york, your family income needs to be north of $547,737 and $517,557, respectively. in massachusetts, you need to be pulling in $539,055 to call yourself part of the 1%. to see the full list, click here."}
{"original": "if you don't earn a 1%-worthy income, a disciplined savings strategy can still allow you to retire with an envy-inspiring nest egg."}
{"original": "many workers can participate in tax-advantaged retirement savings plans offered by their employers. yet, large numbers of americans are failing to make the most of these powerful tools. according to transamerica, the average worker is contributing only 8% of their income to retirement savings plans every year, and just 12% of participants are maxing out their contribution to these plans annually. further, vanguard reports that nearly one-third of participants are saving 4% or less of their income in 401(k) or 403(b) plans."}
{"original": "in 2017, up to $18,000 of earned income can be set aside in a 401(k) plan or 403(b) plan, and if you're over 50, that figure increases to $24,000. given those contribution statistics and these plan limits, most americans aren't coming anywhere close to saving as much as they could be."}
{"original": "similarly, many americans aren't making the most of iras, either. additional dollars can be invested pre-tax in a traditional iras, or after-tax in a roth ira, depending on your income. people under 50 can contribute up to $5,500 of income to either a traditional ira or roth ira, and people over 50 can contribute $6,500 to either of those plans in 2017."}

{"original": "obviously, there are a lot of savings opportunities available that can be used to amass wealth, however, one word of caution. calculating the contribution amounts across multiple retirement plans can get complex, so sit down with your tax professional to discuss your options before making your contributions."}
{"original": "a high income provides short-term financial security, but long-term financial security depends a lot on how much money you're saving every year. ultimately, the percentage of your income that you save every year can be a much better indicator of your future financial independence than your income in any one given year."}
{"original": "in order to get to the point where you're saving the maximum allowed, it can help to take small steps. if you can't hit your maximum immediately, increase your contribution rate by 1% to 2% per year until you hit the limit. this strategy won't get you to financial freedom as quickly as maxing out contributions immediately, but it can help you avoid busting your budget."}
{"original": "also, don't forget about the importance of saving sooner, rather than later. due to compound interest, saving more money earlier in your career can have a big impact on your retirement savings; especially if that money is being invested in assets that can appreciate, such as stocks. for example, a person contributing 20% of their family's $75,000 in income from age 30 to age 65 could end up with a nest egg valued at $1.67 million, assuming a hypothetical 6% annual return."}

{"original": "even in a pandemic, when americans' minds were obviously on other things, the wnba showed signs of both strength and drawing power last summer. the league got more airtime than ever before, and ratings were up. the players' social justice work, and the recognition that this has been a focus of theirs for years, won them new fans and prompted others to take a second look."}
{"original": "the wnba needs to build on that, and loeffler's continued ownership stake in the atlanta dream will only detract from those efforts. just look at some of the responses to the dream's tweet on wednesday morning asking all those who are praising wnba players now to continue showing their support next season."}

{"original": "i hope the dream goes to lebron. y'all deserve better than loeffler, said still another."}
{"original": "loeffler's toxic effect won't just go away, making her a drag on both the dream and the wnba. commissioner cathy engelbert tried to split hairs last summer, saying the league wouldn't try to force out loeffler because she wasn't involved in the team's day-to-day operations."}
{"original": "but that distinction will be lost to the general public. it's not the depth of loeffler's involvement that's at issue. it's that she's involved, period. there is no amount of distance the wnba or the dream can put between themselves and loeffler that will make people forget they are intertwined."}

{"original": "now, it's not clear if james can actually own an wnba team while he is still an active nba player, given the ties between the leagues and restrictions in the nba's collective bargaining agreement. but james has a lot of friends, and they've already proven they can get creative when it comes to setting up business endeavors that intersect and overlap with the nba."}
{"original": "james' idea drew quick support. mookie betts of the los angeles dodgers, pro football hall of famer champ bailey and world cup champion abby wambach were among the famous names to express interest in joining him."}
{"original": "if james is serious, engelbert and nba commissioner adam silver would be doing the wnba a disservice by not taking advantage of his significant spotlight."}
{"original": "the wnba is almost 25 years old, and it does not need any man to be its savior. ask those who know the game – really know the game – and they'll vouch for the wnba's level of play. but women's sports still struggle for attention and coverage, and james would make the league impossible to ignore for the immediate future."}
{"original": "and for the neanderthals who love to disparage women's sports, it would be one hell of a clapback for one of the greatest to ever play the game to say he believes so strongly in the wnba – on and off the court -- that he's willing to put his money behind it."}
{"original": "the wnba didn't start this fight, loeffler did. it's funny how she didn't object when wnba players protested policy brutality of black and brown men and women back in 2016. nor did she say anything publicly when the wnba partnered with planned parenthood."}
{"original": "only when it became politically expedient did loeffler take a blowtorch to the wnba players and their causes."}
{"original": "she mischaracterized the black lives matter movement and objected to the players spotlighting the say her name campaign last season. when wnba players called on her to sell the dream, loeffler styled herself as a victim – apparently forgetting that objecting to what someone is saying is not the same as preventing someone from speaking."}
{"original": "and when she was forced into a runoff against warnock, loeffler doubled down, waging a campaign steeped in both racism and elitism."}
{"original": "but loeffler and her hateful rhetoric were rejected in historic fashion. warnock will be the second black senator from the south, and only the 11th in the nation's history."}

{"original": "backers of the 2013 amendment heralded the immediate $1-an-hour raise it created and expected automatic increases every jan. 1. but new jersey's minimum wage is staying at $8.38 an hour in 2016 because an inflation index didn't rise."}
{"original": "that means new jersey's lowest paid workers lag compared with a $10 minimum taking effect in massachusetts and california and the phasing in of $15 minimums in several large cities. new york is getting a $9 minimum, up from $8.75. pennsylvania remains at $7.25."}
{"original": "new jersey legislators took a strong first step by empowering voters to raise the minimum wage in 2013, said rob duffey, spokesman for the advocacy group new jersey working families. but the simple fact is that an hourly wage of $8.38 won't even cover the basics in new jersey, much less sustain a family."}

{"original": "in the corporate world, there is often an event forcing stakeholders to see reality for what it is and realize that their expectations will not be met. for bp, it was the deepwater horizon explosion and oil spill that killed 11 people in 2010. at ge, imagination gave way to reality as expensive acquisitions, poor performance and rising interest rates showed that management couldn't actually deliver on its promises. at wells fargo, it was, well, one thing after another."}

{"original": "the gap between expectations and reality is becoming hard for trumpians to deny. ann coulter has angrily turned on the president for his failure to meet the clear and tangible expectation he himself set. fox news pundits see the gap. rush limbaugh sees the gap. if conservative media and social media commentators begin to amplify this expectation gap as the wall failure becomes more and more clear, the president's reputation among even his ardent supporters will crumble."}

{"original": "but there have also been questions asked as to why the epa, with authority for regulating the nation's rules on lead in drinking water, didn't move more aggressively when it became clear that flint wasn't performing corrosion controls as long ago as last april, according to emails received by edwards."}
{"original": "another congressional panel, the house energy and commerce committee, chaired by rep. fred upton, r-mich., has called on the epa to explain its role in investigating the flint crisis. on thursday, peter grevatt, director of the epa's office of ground water and drinking water, spent nearly 1 1/2 hours briefing congressional staff members on the crisis but refused to answer questions from a reporter afterwards as he was hustled outside by his staff."}
{"original": "requests to interview hedman have gone unanswered as well."}
{"original": "the people of flint deserve answers, an aide to upton said after the briefing. today's bipartisan staff briefing was to learn more details about the flint water crisis, specifically what the epa knew and when, the relationships between epa and the state, and epa and the city. ... questions still remain."}
{"original": "the aide spoke anonymously because the briefing was done in private."}
{"original": "hospitals across the country rang in the new year with a federal mandate to reveal their once-secret master price lists, although it's unclear whether the new requirement will assist many patients or contain ever-rising health care costs."}

{"original": "the 2010 affordable care act required hospitals to make these lists available to the public, but until this week, hospitals were not required to publish them. the new mandate marks an effort by the centers for medicare & medicaid services to improve price transparency in health care."}

{"original": "that is because the prices are typically starting points for payment negotiations between hospitals and insurance companies and have little connection to what most patients actually pay."}
{"original": "the only time that most consumers glimpse chargemaster prices is on hospital bills as amounts they might have owed before insurance negotiated down the price."}
{"original": "it's not a particularly useful datapoint, said marianne udow-phillips, executive director of the center for health and research transformation in ann arbor, mich. i don't expect it to have a significant impact, and i don't expect it to be a driver of lowering health care costs."}
{"original": "for patients with commercial health plans such as blue cross blue shield, the price of services and procedures is determined by private negotiations between their insurance company and the hospital."}
{"original": "so these patients should check with their insurance company for actual pricing information, including whatever deductibles they must pay before insurance fully kicks in."}
{"original": "if a patient goes online and sees a (chargemaster) price that they can't afford, i'm concerned that some consumers might forego needed care – especially if that price is the total cost of service and not what the consumer is expected to pay based on what their insurance plan covers or not, said mark fendrick, a university of michigan professor."}
{"original": "some uninsured patients may indeed be directly billed at chargemaster prices. but hospitals typically give discounts when requested, experts said."}
{"original": "the chargemaster itself is essentially the sticker price that nobody pays, said jim lee, vice president of data policy and analytics with the michigan health & hospital association, an industry group. it is the starting point or floor for pricing."}

{"original": "washington – ominous statements from washington and tehran on thursday highlighted the quandary president donald trump faces in confronting an increasingly aggressive iran, even though iran-backed protesters pulled back from their attack on the u.s. embassy in baghdad."}
{"original": "the tensions were underscored when defense secretary mike esper warned that iran might be planning additional military strikes on u.s. targets, just hours after a top iranian military commander boasted that tehran was not worried about the united states."}
{"original": "we have the power to break them several times over and are not worried, revolutionary guards commander brigadier general hossein salami said, according to tasnim, a government-affiliated news outlet. we are not leading the country to war, but we are not afraid of any war."}
{"original": "trump and his top advisers have repeatedly touted their maximum pressure policy, a sanctions-driven campaign designed to isolate tehran diplomatically and cripple the country economically."}
{"original": "but the recent clashes demonstrate that iran has its own strategy, one that has proven remarkably effective. iran's leaders, and its proxy forces in places like iraq, remain willing and able to lash out at the u.s. – causing spikes in global oil prices, undermining american allies and threatening u.s. assets abroad."}
{"original": "they're showing our impotence, said barbara slavin, director of the future of iran initiative at the atlantic council, a foreign policy think tank in washington. this is maximum resistance to maximum pressure."}
{"original": "the embassy protest erupted tuesday, two days after u.s. airstrikes hit iranian-backed militia targets in iraq and killed more than 25 people. the airstrikes were retaliation, u.s. officials said, for an iranian-sponsored attack on an iraqi base that killed an american civilian contractor and wounded american servicemen."}
{"original": "slavin and others said the u.s. response was counterproductive and demonstrates the dilemma trump faces as he walks a tightrope between a war he doesn't want and capitulation his supporters would abhor."}
{"original": "iran's attack on the iraq base may well have been designed to goad the u.s. into striking inside iraq, according to an analysis by abbas kadhim, an expert on iraq who is also with the atlantic council."}
{"original": "tehran got exactly what it wanted, he wrote in a post wednesday."}
{"original": "now, he noted, iraqi political leaders are condemning the u.s. reprisal and some are even calling for the withdrawal of american troops from that strategic country. meanwhile, iran is likely searching for yet another way to strike the u.s., as esper hinted on thursday."}
{"original": "in the dangerous stalemate between the us and iran ... the us has to expect that iran will react to any action by choosing another battlefield where the balance of power is more favorable, gerard araud, a former french ambassador to the u.s. and israel, tweeted on wednesday. we saw it in the gulf, we are seeing it in iraq."}
{"original": "the embassy attack in baghdad – a confrontational move that prompted trump to dispatch hundreds of additional u.s. troops to the region – immediately captured washington's attention and revived memories of the 1979 seizure of the u.s. embassy in tehran. that standoff lasted 444 days and helped doom then-president jimmy carter's bid for re-election. as in 1979, the protesters in baghdad this week shouted death to america! and smashed their way into the diplomatic compound, setting fire to a reception area as u.s. combat helicopters swooped over the complex."}
{"original": "images from the scene at the u.s. embassy in baghdad revealed extensive damage, showing a burned and charred reception area, smashed windows and vandalized rooms left behind by supporters and members of the iranian-trained hashed al-shaabi military network, also known as the popular mobilization forces. no deaths or serious injuries have been reported, and the embassy was not evacuated."}
{"original": "this week's tit-for-tat aggressions in iraq are part of a broader campaign that stretches back to trump's decision to withdraw in 2018 from the iran nuclear deal, a multilateral agreement aimed at curbing iran's nuclear ambitions but which trump blasted as weak. the u.s. has since imposed massive sanctions on iran in an effort to force tehran to negotiate a new deal. trump's advisers have demanded that iran end its ballistic missile program and stop funding proxy forces in the region, among other steps."}
{"original": "none of that has worked. instead, according to u.s. officials, iran sabotaged oil tankers in the persian gulf in may, downed a u.s. drone in june and struck saudi oil facilities in september. the saudi attack alone disrupted more than 5% of the world's daily oil supply."}
{"original": "the iranians have not stopped trying to extend their influence in the region. the iranians have not come back on bended knee to accept a new nuclear negotiation with more iranian concessions, said robert ford, a former u.s. ambassador to syria and algeria."}
{"original": "the iranians didn't even agree to meet trump in new york last september, despite trump's repeated entreaties to iran's president hassan rouhani, said ford, now a senior fellow at yale university and the middle east institute in washington."}
{"original": "now, with every escalation, trump's predicament worsens, peter beinart, a professor at the city university of new york, wrote a piece published wednesday in the atlantic."}
{"original": "his confidants insist that he can't afford a war – which would likely boost oil prices and damage the economy – especially in an election year. yet he also can't pursue real diplomacy, at least not without provoking a confrontation with the gop's hawkish foreign-policy elite, beinart writes. he's caught between his desire to avoid being like george w. bush and his desire to avoid being like barack obama."}
{"original": "ford said the trump administration's maximalist position may be viewed within iran as an indication that the u.s. is more interested in regime change than any kind of compromise. it looks to me like tehran is hoping that in a year, donald trump will be gone, he said."}
{"original": "slavin said trump has few palatable options to solve the current standoff."}
{"original": "we've already sanctioned iran up to the eyeballs, she said. we can kill some of their proxies here or there. but the next level is to attack iran itself, and if we do that, then it's off to the races. we have another middle east war – one that the u.s. doesn't want to fight and that could result in another failed state, just like iraq after the u.s. ousted saddam hussein."}

{"original": "an examination of tyler sash's brain brought a small measure of peace to his family — and sobering questions to anyone who loves iowa football."}
{"original": "sash, an oskaloosa native who became a star defensive back for the university of iowa and then a member of the new york giants' super bowl xlvi champions, died last september at age 27, due to a toxic mixture of methadone and hydrocodone."}
{"original": "his parents agreed to have sash's brain tested for chronic traumatic encephalopathy, commonly known as cte, and the new york times reported tuesday that doctors found their son suffered from the disease."}
{"original": "i don't think we really knew for sure what the news would be, josh sash, tyler's brother, told the register. it seemed to clear something up, as to maybe some of the struggles tyler had in the last couple years."}
{"original": "dr. ann mckee, chief of neuropathology at the v.a. boston healthcare system, told the times the severity of sash's condition was similar to junior seau, a pro football hall-of-famer who committed suicide in 2012, at 43."}
{"original": "the differences in age and nfl experience — sash played a total of 23 regular-season games in the league compared to seau's 268 — was alarming."}
{"original": "reaction to the news has been very strong nationally, said chris nowinski, executive director of the concussion legacy foundation. because he was known to be so beloved and he was so young with such a severe disease."}
{"original": "nowinski, a football player at harvard in the 1990s and author of head games: the global concussion crisis, has been pushing for more awareness of brain injuries since 2006. some of his proposals, once thought to be extreme, are gaining momentum."}
{"original": "i'm very firm in my belief that children should not be playing tackle football, nowinski said. no one should put a helmet on, at least before high school."}
{"original": "there's just no upside, and a ton of downside."}
{"original": "sash suffered two concussions in high school, at least one with the hawkeyes and two more in the nfl."}
{"original": "the severity of cte is measured on a scale of zero to 4, and sash was found to be at stage 2."}
{"original": "but it's a condition that cannot be diagnosed until after someone dies, leaving loved ones to wonder what damage the sport played."}
{"original": "we noticed some changes in tyler, josh sash said. i guess i don't want to paint the picture that he was just a completely different person, but there were a lot of very subtle changes."}
{"original": "maybe in how he acted or how he talked, or some of the things he'd get upset about."}
{"original": "sash was suspended four games in 2012 for violating the nfl's policy for performance enhancing substances, by using adderall."}
{"original": "after being cut by the giants in 2013, sash was arrested in oskaloosa for public intoxication and led police on a brief chase on a motorized scooter."}
{"original": "he displayed other erratic behaviors, especially when it came to maintaining focus."}
{"original": "one day, he was maybe going to try and sell insurance, josh sash explained. maybe he was going to get his real-estate license. and then he was going to try and be a graduate assistant with the iowa football program."}
{"original": "he was kind of all over the place."}
{"original": "as more information emerges, people in and outside the game try to pinpoint causes and effects."}
{"original": "the reality is, we're still working out all of the details and all the mechanisms, nowinski said. but it's very clear your brain does not like trauma, and some terrible things happen when it's trying to recover or stabilize itself after injury."}
{"original": "meanwhile, fans, coaches and players are left with dilemmas."}
{"original": "with the fans, it's like everybody makes a choice, robert klemko, an nfl writer for sports illustrated and mmqb.com, said. you understand that the players are taking enormous risks, whether it's their brains or their acls."}
{"original": "with the players, i think a lot of them got to the level they're at by ignoring injury risks. because if you're running around thinking about busting your ankle or breaking your arm in an nfl game, you're just not going to be effective."}
{"original": "those who follow the hawkeyes, and cheered for sash throughout his 38 games at iowa, are torn."}
{"original": "you can say 'i enjoy football, and hawkeye football,' said adam jacobi, managing editor of blackheartgoldpants.com, but you can also be concerned for these guys and sort of want to make sure that they're well taken care of after their careers are over."}
{"original": "you can't assume this is safe for these guys anymore, which is a bummer."}
{"original": "mixed feelings can be traced to the wording used by those who oversee football."}
{"original": "they call a brain injury a concussion, klemko said. you don't call a knee injury or an ankle injury something that doesn't use the word 'knee' or 'ankle.' so why wouldn't you call a brain injury a brain injury?"}
{"original": "that's because it has horrible connotations."}
{"original": "you put your body through so much as a player, said anthony herron, an ex-hawkeye player and current analyst for the pac-12 network who played in the nfl. i can remember times when you're seeing double or you're seeing triple. you feel like you're going to pass out or faint, going through different things on the field."}
{"original": "so, your body is so often on the brink of something traumatic that it feels like the norm."}
{"original": "josh sash grew up playing football and remembers younger brother tyler being a ball boy. he's now the father of two sons, tandon (4) and tayson (7 months), and wonders if he wants them to carry on that tradition."}
{"original": "it's something i'm really still trying to take in, josh said. the way that i feel right now, it's hard for me to put my stamp of approval on my own two boys playing football, at this point."}
{"original": "orchard park - buffalo bills general manager doug whaley said the team's 7-9 record this season was not good enough and that it starts with me in a monday news conference."}

{"original": "you are what your record says you are and we are 7-9, whaley said. we have to get better in every aspect."}
{"original": "whaley said the team's search for a head coach will be different than the previous two that he has been involved with, as he will lead the search. whaley was an assistant general manager when doug marrone was hired in 2013 and the team used a committee approach when rex ryan was hired in 2015."}
{"original": "i have full confidence in myself and the process that we have in place, whaley said."}
{"original": "despite reports that interim coach anthony lynn has the inside track to secure the job permanently, whaley insisted it will be an open search for the bills' next head coach. whaley confirmed that the bills have reached out and requested an interview with arizona cardinals offensive coordinator harold goodwin. whaley said there is not a timetable for hiring the head coach."}
{"original": "you don't want to rush to make a decision like this, you want to make the right decision, whaley said."}
{"original": "he also said that ryan spoke to team owner terry pegula on the phone privately last tuesday before the team made the decision to part ways with ryan."}
{"original": "i wasn't privy to the conversation (between pegula and ryan), so i cannot get into the details, whaley said."}
{"original": "whaley later said that he had no input into the decision to fire ryan."}
{"original": "whaley also said that he did not speak after ryan's firing last week because the team has a policy during the season to have a singular voice during the regular season and that voice is the head coach. he said that he and lynn have spoken about the team's decision to bench taylor for the season finale and that anthony and i have talked, and we are fine."}
{"original": "he also said he understands why taylor was unhappy with the team's decision to rest him on sunday."}
{"original": "i would be upset if he wasn't upset, whaley said."}
{"original": "whaley also said that he has often leaned on brandon for administrative advice, but with brandon taking on expanded responsibilities with the buffalo sabres and pegula sports entertainment (his official title is managing partner and president), their relationship is likely to change."}
{"original": "with his duties taking him away, (brandon's involvement in football decisions) will probably be less and less, whaley said."}
{"original": "after starting the season 4-2, the bills lost four of their last five games to finish 7-9 and miss the nfl playoffs for the 17th straight season."}
{"original": "the bills finished their season with a disappointing 30-10 loss to the new york jets on sunday."}
{"original": "whaley said the team was highly competitive for much of the season."}
{"original": "if you look at the season in totality, we did some good things, whaley said. we just weren't consistent."}
{"original": "we're not that far away, we believe."}
{"original": "washington – before he retired, sen. bob corker, r-tenn., frequently used his perch as chairman of the foreign relations committee to lob cutting critiques at president donald trump – accusing the president of putting america on a path to world war iii and being submissive to russian president vladimir putin."}
{"original": "don't expect those kind of verbal bangers from corker's successor, sen. james risch, r-idaho, a trump loyalist who is poised to win the foreign relations gavel this week."}
{"original": "a self-made millionaire, former trial lawyer and current cattle rancher, risch is a low-key legislator, unlike corker, a high-profile media star. risch shuns public confrontations; corker relished them."}
{"original": "risch will take the helm of the committee at a turbulent moment in u.s. foreign policy: lawmakers in both parties question the trump administration's approach to saudi arabia, russia, syria and north korea, among other global hot spots. risch will have to oversee the potentially controversial nomination of heather nauert, trump's pick to succeed nikki haley as u.s. ambassador to the united nations."}
{"original": "how risch will navigate that thicket remains to be seen. foreign policy experts and even some of his senate colleagues said they're not sure what to expect from the idaho republican's chairmanship, in part because risch has yet to make a big mark in the foreign policy arena. in the previous congress, he sponsored only one foreign affairs bill – a resolution commemorating the 70th anniversary of the berlin airlift. in the subcommittee he chaired, risch convened just two hearings in the past two years,although he stood in for corker three times to chair the full committee."}
{"original": "we're going to have a frankly much more quiet voice in the senate majority on foreign policy than we did in the last two years, said michael fuchs, who served as a senior state department official in the obama administration and is a fellow at the liberal center for american progress."}
{"original": "i don't know how he's going to be, corker said of risch in an interview last month as the senate was in the midst of a contentious debate over the saudi crown prince's role in the murder of washington post columnist jamal khashoggi."}

{"original": "risch's spokeswoman, suzanne wrasse, said the senator has been engaged on a wide range of foreign policy matters, from arms control treaties to russia sanctions."}
{"original": "risch is a workhorse, not a show horse, wrasse said. he is extremely engaged on these issues, and whether his input is behind the scenes, member-to-member or more public, he is very strategic and focused on the end result. he has four decades of legislative and executive leadership experience, which includes a number of major policy victories, so it is no surprise when he succeeds."}
{"original": "wrasse said risch wanted to wait until he is officially selected as chairman before speaking to the media about his priorities and outlook."}
{"original": "risch's allies said he will bring an open mind and self-effacing style to a panel that has often been run by senators with national ambitions."}
{"original": "jim risch is just an energetic, happy westerner, said sen. cory gardner, r-colo., who is close to risch. gardner said that because risch also sits on the senate intelligence committee, he will have, i think, an unparalleled understanding of the threats this nation faces."}
{"original": "sen. marco rubio, r-fla., who serves with risch on the foreign relations and intelligence committees, said risch won't try to use his new post to raise his own profile. he will let others on the committee help shape the agenda."}
{"original": "he tries to find something that you care about and allow people to play a leading role on that issue, rubio said. i think he would tell you his job is to run the committee and not necessarily be a shadow secretary of state."}
{"original": "risch will have plenty of competition for the limelight, since the foreign relations panel is stocked with senators who are far better known than he is – including rubio, mitt romney of utah and rand paul of kentucky, all former (and possibly future) gop presidential candidates."}
{"original": "risch will have to contend with a coterie of democrats on the committee seeking aggressive oversight of the trump administration. sen. chris murphy, d-conn., who has voiced fierce opposition to trump's foreign policy, said he believes risch will be fair and will make an effort to work with democrats."}
{"original": "he tends to back up the administration but not blindly, murphy said. i think we're going to butt heads a bunch, but i think he has the ability to be a real honest broker."}
{"original": "risch has been a fairly conventional conservative in his foreign policy views. he has voted with trump 90.5 percent of the time, according to fivethirtyeight, a website that conducts political, economic and other analyses. he did buck the president on a few issues. last july, risch voted in favor of a sweeping russia sanctions bill that trump opposed. he voted to open debate on a yemen war resolution the administration tried to quash, though risch eventually voted against final passage."}
{"original": "every indication that we have is that sen. risch adheres to the traditional pro-trade, tough-on-bad-guys wing of … the republican party, said danielle pletka, senior vice president for foreign and defense policy at the american enterprise institute, a center-right think tank. she said he and other republicans will inevitably clash with trump on some major policy issues, such as russia and syria."}
{"original": "risch will not be afraid to take on trump when he thinks the president is wrong, rubio and others said, but he'll be measured – and probably private – about any policy disagreements with the president."}
{"original": "jim risch has never stood down from anything, gardner said. this guy's faced 2,000-pound animals on his ranch. there's nothing that's going to frighten this guy."}

{"original": "normally, a workplace death in the united states is met with a swift and thorough response."}
{"original": "by law, employers must report a death within eight hours to the u.s. occupational health and safety administration. an inspector from osha typically arrives within a day to interview workers, review the site of the incident and determine whether the death resulted from unsafe conditions."}
{"original": "for workers in the meatpacking industry during the covid-19 pandemic, however, the system of swift reporting and next-day inspections that should protect them has broken down."}
{"original": "at least 239 meatpacking workers have died and 45,000 have contracted the coronavirus since the start of the pandemic, according to tracking by the midwest center for investigative reporting. but companies reported less than half that number of deaths to osha, a joint investigation by usa today and the midwest center found. experts say that's in large part because the agency weakened reporting requirements during the pandemic."}
{"original": "even fewer deaths triggered the kind of robust investigation osha typically conducted before the pandemic. worker advocates say that's also a consequence of a hands-off approach from osha."}
{"original": "and it isn't just how many died, but who. the u.s. meatpacking industry has long relied on vulnerable populations to fill its workforce: immigrants, refugees, people of color, and those who lack other employment opportunities. during its last data release in july, the u.s. centers for disease control and prevention found that 87% of coronavirus cases in meatpacking plants occurred among racial or ethnic minorities."}
{"original": "debbie berkowitz, a former senior policy adviser at osha and now director of the national employment law project's worker health and safety program, says that many coronavirus deaths are going unreported and uninvestigated, letting employers off the hook for unsafe conditions."}
{"original": "the agency failed. it failed, berkowitz said. i don't know what else to say."}
{"original": "anatomy of an outbreak: 'they think workers are like dogs.' how pork plant execs sacrificed safety for profits."}
{"original": "why meatpacking plants? cheap chicken, beef came at a cost. how american meat plants bred coronavirus hot spots."}
{"original": "the meatpacking industry and osha separately pushed back against those conclusions. sarah little, a spokesperson for the industry group north american meat institute, said not all covid-19 deaths need to be reported."}
{"original": "the fact that any employee contracts covid-19 does not indicate the infection was related to their workplace, little said."}
{"original": "in an email, a spokesperson with the u.s. department of labor, which houses osha, said the hands-off characterization of the agency was patently false and that the agency investigates every complaint it receives."}
{"original": "osha has been clear that employers are and will continue to be responsible for providing a workplace free of known health and safety hazards, the department said."}
{"original": "but evidence shows deaths are going unreported."}
{"original": "at a seaboard foods plant in guymon, oklahoma, 961 workers have tested positive for the virus and six have died from covid-19, according to the company. the department of labor has not received any reports of deaths from the plant, a spokesperson said."}
{"original": "a seaboard spokesperson said the company did not report the deaths because it determined they were not work-related."}
{"original": "osha opened an inspection into the plant in july, but it was not related to covid-19, according to seaboard. a labor department spokesperson said the inspection resulted in seaboard abating hazards. but no one from osha has actually visited the plant during the pandemic, said martin rosas, president of united food and commercial workers union local 2. the agency has not issued any fines or citations."}
{"original": "loren sweatt, principal deputy assistant secretary of labor at osha, denied that such instances are proof of any systemic failings."}
{"original": "by pulling isolated alleged incidents out of context from the thousands of inspections conducted by osha, these criticisms unfairly disparage the work of dedicated osha inspectors across the country, sweatt said."}
{"original": "publicly available data, as well as input from half a dozen former osha officials, suggest the problem is more widespread."}
{"original": "the last time the federal government estimated the number of meatpacking workers who died from covid-19 was in july, when the cdc said the number stood at 86. but reporters have scoured media reports, obtained government records and interviewed industry workers throughout the pandemic to tally up the 239 deaths."}
{"original": "that figure substantially outpaces osha's response. in an email, the agency said it has received 77 reports totaling 90 fatalities from covid-19 in meatpacking plants, accounting for less than 4 in 10 of the deaths noted by the midwest center. similarly, of the 65 meatpacking plants where reporters found at least one worker died, osha has not inspected 26 to date."}
{"original": "inspection is an official term osha uses to describe a robust process in which an employee typically visits a plant in person and conducts a wide-ranging inquiry into the circumstances of a complaint, injury or death. such inspections show up publicly on the agency's inspection database."}
{"original": "during the pandemic, osha is responding to some cases – including deaths – with rapid response investigations, a less robust process in which the agency asks companies about an incident by phone, email or fax. often, it accepts the company's response and closes the case. the agency does not publish the reports in its database."}
{"original": "osha says it has conducted 11 rapid response investigations of deaths at meatpacking plants to date. even when added to the inspections, it means that nearly 1 of every 4 plants with known deaths have received no osha inspection or investigation."}
{"original": "former agency officials say osha already had staffing problems before covid-19. inspectors are now even more swamped, tasked with handling coronavirus on top of their normal caseloads of unrelated worker injury and deaths. epidemiological experts normally available to them to sort out tricky infectious disease scenarios are preoccupied elsewhere."}
{"original": "as a result, worker unions and advocates say even when osha does get involved, the results have been poor. gone are the days of rapid next-day inspections of fatalities. instead, osha now conducts some inspections virtually, with many coming a week or more after the death occurred. a department of labor spokesperson said osha has conducted 10 virtual inspections following worker deaths."}
{"original": "workers have noticed the difference. in 2019, osha issued a $180,000 fine to noah's ark, a beef processing plant in hastings, nebraska, after gaseous ammonia severely burned an employee. but when the coronavirus struck this spring, sickening dozens of workers and leaving one dead, the outcome was different."}
{"original": "according to a federal lawsuit filed by three former noah's ark employees represented by the aclu, at least two workers contacted osha in august to file complaints about the plant. their complaints alleged a lack of distancing, that the company wasn't replacing soiled masks and that sick workers continued to report to the plant."}
{"original": "osha didn't inspect the plant until september, and its investigation remains open. the agency has not fined or cited the plant. without any changes, the aclu escalated by filing a federal lawsuit. mike helzer, the plant manager, disputed the allegations in the lawsuit."}
{"original": "the workers are asking the court to do what osha has not – require basic protections against the spread of coronavirus."}
{"original": "we've talked to workers at a lot of different plants who feel like they have nobody whose job it is to advocate for their safety, outside of themselves and their unions, said spencer amdur, a staff attorney with the aclu's immigrants' rights project. in meatpacking especially, osha has been so unwilling to take meaningful action."}
{"original": "experts point out that osha has cited just five meatpacking plants for covid-19 violations, totaling $69,000 in fines."}
{"original": "asked about the figures, the agency said it has received 13,477 covid-19 complaints across all industries since feb. 1, and of those, 273 have led to citations and a total of $3.6 million in fines."}
{"original": "but those watching meatpacking plants, now notorious for their potential to be superspreader environments, said the five locations cited weren't enough to prompt the entire industry to provide the safest workplaces possible."}
{"original": "it is sort of arbitrary, berkowitz said. when the exact same conditions exist in so many other meatpacking and poultry plants where workers died."}
{"original": "experts say the tug-of-war between companies and osha over reporting deaths and illnesses predates the pandemic."}
{"original": "the agency's legal reporting requirements at times conflict. one says that when the circumstances of an employee's death or illness are unclear, companies can evaluate and decide whether or not it must be reported to osha. but another rule says that in the instance of a heart attack, employers must report the incident to osha and let the agency decide if it is work-related."}
{"original": "clyde payne, a former area director for osha's regional office in jackson, mississippi, said historically, decisions often came down to how aggressively osha wielded its authority. he told employers that if any fatality occurred at their worksite, they had to report it. if they didn't, they risked being cited for a failure to report."}
{"original": "it was really my job to make the decision that it is or it isn't work related, payne said."}
{"original": "payne and other experts say that policies osha instituted last year to clarify the rules for reporting covid-19 incidents swung too far in the other direction."}
{"original": "in april, osha first released a policy that said only health care settings would have to report covid-19 deaths, except in rare circumstances in other industries. after receiving pushback, the agency restored reporting requirements in may for most businesses. but, it explicitly empowered employers to decide what was workplace related."}
{"original": "keira lombardo, chief administrative officer for smithfield foods, said that was no different than osha's prior approach."}
{"original": "osha requirements and standards include a decision tree and guidance with multiple scenarios ... to assist with making determinations, lombardo said."}
{"original": "others see it differently, saying the may notice telegraphed that the agency would be unlikely to cite companies for failing to report a covid-19 death."}
{"original": "adam finkel, a clinical professor of environmental health sciences at the university of michigan and a former osha official, said the agency should have required reporting rather than letting employers decide what to report."}
{"original": "this is a recipe for missing most of the cases, he said."}
{"original": "in september, osha again updated its policies to say employers had to report covid-19 hospitalizations only if they occurred within 24 hours of workplace exposures, and deaths within 30 days of exposure."}
{"original": "experts said that created an almost impossibly high bar with covid-19 because it can be difficult to pinpoint exposure without contact tracing. symptom onset often comes days after exposure, and hospitalization and death can occur weeks, if not months, later."}
{"original": "john newquist, a safety consultant who worked for osha for nearly three decades, said after the september memo, the fear is gone from employers."}
{"original": "the consequences have played out on the ground."}
{"original": "at a jbs plant in marshalltown, iowa, the league of united latin americans citizens filed a complaint with iowa osha on april 1, on behalf of workers who said there was a lack of distancing at the plant. in response, the agency sent a letter to jbs containing the allegations, which the company denied."}
{"original": "around that time, employee jose andrade-garcia began experiencing shortness of breath. on april 17, he was hospitalized and put on a ventilator. he spent the last month of his life unresponsive before his death on may 15."}
{"original": "jbs did not report andrade-garcia's death to iowa osha. asked why the agency did not cite the company for failure to report, mary montgomery, a spokeswoman for the iowa department of labor, said employers don't have to report covid-19 cases if they can't determine whether they were related to work."}
{"original": "iowa osha did open an inspection on may 21, six days after andrade-garcia's death and one day after his daughter, maria andrade, shared the family's experience with the des moines register."}
{"original": "montgomery confirmed that media reports, not jbs' recording of a death, spurred iowa osha's inspection."}
{"original": "even though an employee of jbs died from covid-19, that in itself should not and did not impact the inspection process, montgomery said."}
{"original": "the agency closed the inspection in june without issuing a citation. the agency evaluated jbs' due diligence to protect employees from occupational covid exposure and found it in compliance with federal guidelines, montgomery said."}
{"original": "andrade said iowa osha never contacted her about the circumstances of her father's illness and death."}
{"original": "osha had been in there and jbs had come back to osha stating that they were doing everything by the book, andrade said, which of course, it was questionable after what happened to dad."}
{"original": "usa today and the midwest center found more than two dozen meatpacking plants where workers died but osha did not conduct an inspection. to date, osha has fined just a single plant – quality sausage in dallas – for failure to report a covid-19 death."}
{"original": "in addition to reporting hospitalizations and deaths to osha, the agency requires companies to record incidents needing care beyond first aid on a 300 log kept on site."}
{"original": "union officials say companies are leaving covid-19 cases off those books, too."}
{"original": "eric reeder, president of the united food and commercial workers union local 293 in nebraska, said he cross-checked known worker deaths against logs in six plants. he found that 11 deaths known to his union were not listed."}
{"original": "they're not reporting on their logs, reeder said of the plants."}
{"original": "five deaths were at a jbs plant in grand island, nebraska, reeder said. three were at a pair of smithfield facilities in crete, also in nebraska. those facilities recorded outbreaks of more than 250 cases each this spring."}
{"original": "asked about the apparent discrepancies, a jbs spokesperson replied only that the company follows osha guidance and all applicable laws and regulations regarding the reporting of injuries and illnesses, including 300 logs."}
{"original": "lombardo, with smithfield, said the company conducts a thorough inquiry for each case of covid-19."}
{"original": "we follow the osha standards and guidance while also ensuring that each case is fully reported to appropriate health agencies, she said."}
{"original": "a u.s. department of labor spokesperson said osha initiated two fatality inspections in crete in june, based on media reports. one death was determined to be of natural causes, and the other investigation remains open. the agency opened a third inspection of a potential covid-related fatality based on a public notification, which also remains open."}
{"original": "former osha officials said they believe companies are hiding in the ambiguities of the agency's guidelines, and that it didn't have to be the case. berkowitz said the agency would have been better off saying nothing at all."}
{"original": "you had osha saying, 'we're going to give you the benefit of the doubt that this isn't work related,' berkowitz said. it was just bending over backwards to say we're not going to come after you."}
{"original": "critics of osha say the agency's failings go beyond reporting requirements."}
{"original": "in april, osha and the cdc issued workplace safety recommendations to protect employees at meatpacking plants. cdc teams had just investigated major outbreaks at a smithfield plant in sioux falls, south dakota, and a jbs plant in greeley, colorado, to develop best practices."}
{"original": "but experts say the agencies undermined the effort by making their recommendations voluntary and filled with loopholes. the instructions urged 6 feet of distance when possible and modifying work lines to spread workers out if feasible."}
{"original": "mark lauritsen, director of food processing, meatpacking and manufacturing for the ufcw union, said osha should have required employers to spread workers out, provide proper protection and relax attendance policies to ensure safety."}
{"original": "if the system was working properly, osha would have issued an emergency standard, lauritsen said, so that everybody in this country, meatpacking and other employers alike, would all know, 'here are the minimums i have to do to make the workers safe from coronavirus and covid-19.'"}
{"original": "in may, osha issued a separate instruction that said for industries outside of health care, agency field directors must maximize the use of remote inspections via video conferences, phone interviews, faxes and emails."}
{"original": "that never existed, prior to covid-19, berkowitz said of remote inspections. it's invented."}
{"original": "those on the ground said they saw the quality of inspections change."}
{"original": "at a maid-rite processing facility in northeast pennsylvania, workers filed a complaint with osha in may claiming an imminent danger in their workplace, a top priority that can lead to immediate inspection and correction."}
{"original": "but that didn't happen. at first, osha sent the company a letter. then it did a virtual inspection, though the inspector testified during a court hearing that she didn't actually see the plant."}
{"original": "when osha finally did perform an in-person inspection almost two months later, the agency gave maid-rite advance notice, which workers said allowed the company to temporarily improve conditions to pass muster. the danger returned afterward, they said."}
{"original": "employees later filed a federal lawsuit against osha, asking a court to compel the agency to resolve the hazards alleged in their complaint."}
{"original": "asked during a hearing why osha took the unusual step of giving the plant advance notice of its visit, inspector shannon warner testified she and her supervisors had done a hazard analysis."}
{"original": "osha has a right to protect their employees also, warner said. i was going into a worksite with potential covid-19 exposure."}
{"original": "for its part, the department of labor said osha by law can give up to 24 hours advance notice of a visit when special precautions are necessary. it added that osha investigates every allegation, including spending at least 1,200 employee hours inspecting the sioux falls and greeley plants."}
{"original": "an osha field instructor and member of the american federation of government employees, a federal workers union, told usa today on the condition of anonymity that inspectors are in a tough position."}
{"original": "they are safety and health professionals that want to keep the american worker safe no matter the cost, the instructor said. however, those same inspectors don't want to contract the virus and then in turn bring it home to their families."}
{"original": "more than 10 months into the pandemic, many critics of osha say one of the clearest signs of the agency's hands-off approach is the small number of covid-19 citations and fines the agency has issued to meatpacking plants."}
{"original": "according to its website, the agency has cited just five: the jbs plant in colorado and another in green bay, wisconsin; a jbs subsidiary plant in cactus, texas; the smithfield foods plant in sioux falls; and quality sausage in dallas."}
{"original": "the fines total $69,593, and each company is appealing."}
{"original": "people are really not worried about getting cited, newquist said. they know osha is overwhelmed, so they call it in and the most likely case is, 'do you have a covid program? yes. do you do this, this and this? yes. ok, we're going to close the case. thank you very much.'"}
{"original": "most of the citations osha issued came under the general duty clause, a catch-all rule that says employers are required to provide a workplace free from known hazards. osha officials tout the rule as proof the agency can hold employers to account even though its covid-19 guidelines are largely perceived as voluntary."}
{"original": "berkowitz noted the two most high profile general duty citations – of the sioux falls and greeley plants – occurred in the runup to 2020 election. she believes they had more to do with politics than policy."}
{"original": "payne, the former osha area director, added that general duty claims are difficult to sustain in court."}
{"original": "it brings to the agency a higher burden of proof when you go to litigate the case, payne said."}
{"original": "and amdur, with the aclu, said the general duty citations present another problem. because companies can challenge them, the citations can take months, or even years, to resolve. all along, dangerous conditions continue."}
{"original": "osha's doing it in a way that guarantees it won't lead to any changes during the pandemic, amdur said. they're saying even if you tell us that people are inches apart, breathing on each other with no masks and no barriers, indoors for hours at a time, we're still not going to take immediate action."}
{"original": "many critics of osha have their eyes on the calendar. union officials said they believe the incoming administration of president-elect joseph biden will offer a chance at a reset. they expect a more aggressive osha."}
{"original": "lauritsen, with the ufcw, said that even though he feels his union has successfully worked with employers to institute safeguards even without osha, additional in-person inspections would offer backup."}
{"original": "the real value of an inspector is to bring those highly trained professional eyes into plants and say, 'here's what you need to do,' lauritsen said. and right now we don't have that."}
{"original": "others are more pessimistic. much of the damage is done they say; hundreds of workers have died."}
{"original": "earlier in the pandemic, when meatpacking plants were the primary drivers of coronavirus in many rural communities, it was easier to determine that positive cases were connected to a plant. now that the virus is so widespread and crippling to rural communities across the country, experts say, it's impossible to separate the signal from the noise."}
{"original": "from the beginning, (osha) said they're not going to investigate, said marcy goldstein-gelb, co-executive director of the national council for occupational safety and health. they basically reneged on their responsibility and mission throughout."}

{"original": "van drew talked about the need to defeat his republican opponent, seth grossman, who had been shunned by the state and national party over racially charged remarks, she said. but van drew also touched on the elephant-in-the-room issue that was stoking democratic party fury: donald trump."}

{"original": "last month, van drew pivoted in a different direction. he joined the republican party and pledged his undying support for trump, thrusting the once quiet, below-the-radar south jersey district into the center of the national debate over the potential perils and payoffs of trump's impeachment for both parties."}
{"original": "new jersey democrats are now lashing out, furious that the jeff van drew that they nurtured and protected with money and political muscle during his three-decade climb from dennis township committeeman to congress has morphed into a trump enabler."}
{"original": "to many democrats, van drew's party switch goes far beyond the rank opportunism that often prompts such a move. van drew is now propping up a reckless president who poses as an existential threat to democracy itself, they argue. and he's aiding and abetting trump with their donations, they say."}
{"original": "van drew formally defected the day after voting against impeaching trump. he was one of only three house democrats to break ranks."}

{"original": "you took our money, we knocked on doors for you, we made phone calls for you, but you're going to tuck your tail between your legs?'' he said in an interview with njtv last week. that's ridiculous."}
{"original": "van drew did not respond to messages seeking comment on monday. his federal campaign account reported $932,000 on hand as of sept. 30. he is under no obligation to return money to aggrieved donors, campaign finance experts say, although it's not unprecedented."}
{"original": "the late u.s. sen. arlen specter of pennsylvania agreed to return donations upon request when he switched from the republican party to the democrats in 2009. many took him up on the offer."}
{"original": "van drew was a conservative democrat from south jersey who was often given a pass from party-line votes on sensitive, progressive legislation during his tenure in the state legislature, on the grounds that those votes could harm his chances at reelection."}
{"original": "to many, van drew was adopting the same logic as a first-term congressman, fearing that a vote for impeachment was unpopular in his district. he argued that the issue was doomed to die in the republican senate and diverted attention away from priorities voters cared about."}
{"original": "but he was caught in a tight squeeze: internal polling showed that a no'' vote could destroy his chances of winning the democratic nomination. and some democratic leaders, like suleiman, made it clear that he would not tolerate van drew's no vote."}
{"original": "so van drew jumped ship. and he is taking the money with him."}
{"original": "van drew is staked with other valuable benefits that may come in handy in a likely primary this spring. trump's campaign dispatched former trump white house political director bill stepien to help run van drew's campaign. stepien has a deep knowledge of new jersey's political landscape, having served twice as former gov. chris christie's campaign manager."}
{"original": "a pro-trump political action committee is also planning to run $200,000 worth of television ads for van drew and $50,000 in digital ads. and then, of course, there is trump, whose blessing will likely give van drew an edge against challengers in the june republican primary. the trump campaign announced monday that the president will hold a jan. 28 rally in wildwood, at the southern end of van drew's district."}
{"original": "yet, to pirone, the switch is still baffling. in her eyes, the fundraiser was the start of a budding political relationship. after the fundraiser, van drew invited pirone to a luncheon in philadelphia with house majority leader steny hoyer of maryland. she became familiar with his staff."}
{"original": "pirone noted that van drew was a little more conservative from where i am on the spectrum, but a democrat nonetheless. she was willing to support him to help democrats reclaim the house and capture a seat represented by republican frank lobiondo, who was stepping down after 24 years."}
{"original": "certainly, if i had any inkling, i would have never done anything for him, let alone host a fundraiser,'' said pirone, who was elected to the princeton borough council in november."}
{"original": "other democrats also had a nuanced view of van drew."}
{"original": "kostopoulos recalled meeting with van drew with a small group three weeks before the switch to discuss climate change policy. van drew named one of the members to his advisory panel, kostopoulos said."}
{"original": "although we suspected that he wasn't a 100 percent democrat, he was doing the right thing here and there,'' he said. his record was not bad."}
{"original": "kostopoulos was among the guests at pirone's event last year. he doesn't remember much of what van drew said beyond some general remarks. but one moment stands out."}

{"original": "notwithstanding the dow's nearly 400-point rally friday, wall street is more than happy to bid good riddance to a dismal january and spin the dice on things getting better in february and beyond."}
{"original": "the first month of the new year was far from a happy one for investors. doom and gloom prevailed, with major stock indexes like the dow jones industrial average, off 5.5% this month, and standard & poor's 500, down 5.1%, posting their biggest january losses since the financial crisis in 2009. it would have been worse had the broad u.s. market not surged 2.5% on the final day of trading due to an interest-rate cut in japan and strong earnings in the u.s."}
{"original": "by now, the litany of fears that spooked investors and sparked selling are well-known: plunging oil prices; slowing growth in once-booming china; angst surrounding the number of coming interest-rate hikes this year from the federal reserve at a time when the global economy is wobbly and investor confidence shaken."}
{"original": "economy grew just 0.7% in q4"}

{"original": "for the market narrative to shift away from doom and gloom, investors want to see a few things, says michael arone, chief investment strategist at state street global advisors. his list: price stabilization in the oil patch; data that debunk fears that china's economy is in free fall and the u.s. is headed for recession; reassurances from fed chair janet yellen when she testifies before congress in a few weeks that the central bank won't risk choking off the u.s. recovery with an overly aggressive interest-rate-hike policy; and more good earnings news in the next few weeks outside the battered energy and industrial sectors."}

(thanks, betsy devos.) forcing k-12 public schools to let biological males use the girls' bathroom? gone. (thanks, jeff sessions.) no more paris climate agreement. no more super-secret, u.s.-jobs-killing trans-pacific partnership trade agreement. no more catch and release for illegal immigrants. no more forcing nuns to buy birth control under obamacare. in fact, as looks likely, no more obamacare, period. i do feel obliged to dock trump's a grade a notch over the panic that ensued when he dangled amnesty for 800,000 illegal-immigrant dreamers to whom president obama extended the welcome mat, and he entertained even the possibility of accepting the gang of six bill promoting chain migration. fortunately, that plan blew up and now seems to be safely down the shithole."}

{"original": "president donald trump's border wall has been one of the most useless and expensive infrastructure projects in american history. but it succeeded beyond expectations as a symbol that unites and mobilizes trump supporters — which is why he used it as a distraction and a showcase for defiance the day before the house impeached him for the second time."}
{"original": "less than a week after his followers stormed the nation's capitol in a siege that led to five dead, trump was anything but remorseful in a speech to border security agents near the small town of alamo in texas' rio grande valley. hedismissed efforts to remove him from office before his term ends next wednesday and suggested — absurdly — that president-elect joe biden could be the one removed."}
{"original": "the 25th amendment is of zero risk to me but will come back to haunt joe biden and the biden administration. as the expression goes, be careful what you wish for, trump told the crowd. more ominously, he claimed that impeachment is a hoax causing tremendous anger and division and pain, far greater than most people will ever understand, which is very dangerous for the usa, especially at this very tender time."}
{"original": "the insinuation: there could be a violent response."}
{"original": "familiar lies about a maga symbol"}
{"original": "trump spent most of his speech touting the wall, his signature act in office. in a flurry of last-minute construction, the department of homeland security announced the completion of 450 miles of the emblematic barrier. however, customs and border protection reports that only 47 miles of that are new primary wall where no barrier had existed. that's a scant accomplishment for $15 billion of taxpayer money."}
{"original": "reports have shown enormous cost overruns and supplemental contracts to construction firms without competitive bidding, triggering a government accountability office investigation with findings due early this year. this follows a 2018 gao report that anticipated the waste and found that the project did not follow protocols and had no clear measure of effectiveness. scores of legal challenges have been filed related to appropriation of private land and violation of environmental laws."}
{"original": "the dhs inspector general also found that the agency did not assess costs and benefits of the project or follow other procedures."}
{"original": "trump, however, considers the wall a triumph and signed his name on a plaque affixed to the metal strips before rattling off a familiar list of lies and misleading statistics. he took credit for the 2020 drop in border apprehensions without mentioning that overall crossings fell by half under pandemic lockdowns. he heralded statistics on seizures of illicit drugs, failing to point out that 90% of those take place at ports of entry that have nothing to do with the wall."}
{"original": "trump's lies:trump's 5-year campaign of lies led to the capitol attack. and we just let it happen."}
{"original": "he lauded his offensive against what he called asylum fraud, despite the fact that his government closed asylum on the u.s-mexico border in violation of international law, rather than assess and hear cases. he also repeated unsubstantiated claims that migrants live off u.s. welfare and that middle east terrorists come over the southern border — an assertion that his own counterterrorist officials have repeatedly debunked."}
{"original": "the litany was a rehash of trump's greatest hits, but since the attempt to subvert the legal transfer of power, there were dangerous signs embedded in the braggadocio. trump stated, removing any of these measures would hamstring our workers, endanger our country and cost taxpayers hundreds of billions of dollars a year — knowing that the president-elect has called for the removal of many of these unilateral measures. trump further warned, we can't let the next administration even think about taking it (the wall) down."}
{"original": "boot trump now:trump doesn't deserve post-presidential benefits. remove him and ensure he won't get them."}
{"original": "among hardcore trump supporters who consider the wall a pillar of the maga agenda, these veiled warnings could be interpreted as further reason to block a peaceful transfer of power. given biden's promise to immediately halt construction on the wall, trump's statements to border patrol agents could also incite disobedience. most americans oppose the wall, but border patrol union leaders support it and claim that a partial survey shows union members do, too."}
{"original": "mobilization in defense of the wall would be a disaster. trump's wall has been an ineffective farce, designed to foment hate disguised as security. it has already cost the nation far too much — in resources, division and human lives. the country faces a health security threat that requires prioritizing resources to save lives. an immediate halt to the corruption, waste and deception of the border wall is a welcome and necessary step to a safer nation."}

{"original": "the tariffs result from investigations into unfair trade practices by foreign manufacturers accused of dumping products in the u.s. market. two korean manufacturers, lg and samsung, have flooded the u.s. market in recent years, evading duties by moving production to thailand and vietnam. china dominates the solar cell market."}

{"original": "employers add 156,000 jobs in dec., wage gains hit 7-year high"}
{"original": "brown and other job-seekers are experiencing a market where companies really need workers but they're being very selective. many businesses remain locked in a post-recession mindset ingrained by the downturn's severity, and that's adding up to long-term frustration for workers on the sidelines for at least six months."}
{"original": "they have realized that it's very expensive to hire and very expensive to make a mistake, and they're less willing to take a risk, says jeanne branthover, managing partner of dhr international, an executive search firm. before 2007, my clients were hiring and firing and not thinking about it."}

{"original": "baker notes that the number of part-time workers who prefer full-time jobs also remains elevated at 5.6 million, up from 4.5 million before the downturn. and while annual wage growth picked up in november to 2.9%, it's still below levels consistent with the near-normal jobless rate."}
{"original": "carl van horn, director of the heidrich center for workforce development at rutgers university, rattles off the roadblocks faced by the long-term unemployed including having to explain large gaps on a resume and age discrimination. in 2015, about 36% of the long-term unemployed were 55 or older, labor department figures show. and some have seen their skills atrophy or have succumbed to depression, alcoholism or drug abuse, van horn says."}
{"original": "such issues historically have plagued long-idled workers. a big difference nowadays, he says, is that some of the nearly 9 million workers who lost jobs in the recession have yet to find work, or retire, and continue to drift in and out of the labor force, searching for jobs sporadically."}
{"original": "about 5.5 million americans are not in the labor force — and so not counted among the unemployed — but still want a job now, up from 4.3 million before the recession, the labor department says. simply put, van horn says, the occasional job searches by those laid off in the downturn creates more competition for jobs among the long-term unemployed."}

{"original": "michael linick, a retired army colonel who has planned for presidential inaugurations, said capitol agencies have a blueprint for security that includes exercises and coordination with the military for major events. yet those protocols apparently did not come into play."}

{"original": "that something, he and others said, was paralysis spawned by two things."}
{"original": "police and military authorities at all levels were smarting from criticism after national guard troops joined police last summer to violently clear black lives matter demonstrators near the white house."}
{"original": "and some worried about putting soldiers at the capitol when trump supporters were openly suggesting the use of martial law to keep the president in power."}
{"original": "there's a simple reason soldiers weren't in place to protect the capitol, reflected in a defense department timeline and a police account: the national guard was not asked in advance to show up, even though pentagon officials said they offered to provide backup."}
{"original": "it wasn't until the capitol had been stormed that the pentagon got a request – and without planning, the guard couldn't muster quickly enough."}
{"original": "the miscalculation will not be repeated during biden's inauguration next week, when more than 21,000 soldiers are expected to protect the capitol."}
{"original": "the save america march was organized in part by women for america first, a pro-trump organization that obtained a permit from the national park service for an event to follow trump's rally at the white house."}
{"original": "demonstrations at the capitol are commonplace, and a handful of organizations share responsibility for security planning."}
{"original": "that includes the u.s. capitol police, overseen by congress and directed by sergeants at arms for the house and senate and the capitol architect, and washington's metropolitan police department, which is responsible for law enforcement in nonfederal areas. it also includes federal law enforcement agencies such as the national park service and the secret service, as well as the national guard and the defense department."}
{"original": "on dec. 31, mayor muriel bowser requested support from the district's national guard. in a letter to the commanding general, william walker, she asked that troops be deployed for traffic duty, freeing up metro police to work security during the march. bowser stressed in her letter that no (guard) personnel shall be armed during this mission."}
{"original": "unlike governors, who command national guard operations within their states, bowser has no authority to call up district soldiers; they are directed by the defense department."}
{"original": "still, bowser got exactly what she requested. according to a pentagon timeline, trump approved 340 soldiers to handle traffic on jan. 6 so metro police officers could work crowd control."}
{"original": "as congress' certification of the electoral college results grew near – and extremist messaging on the internet grew more ominous – mainstream media warned of violence. and capitol police chief steven sund began to sweat."}
{"original": "in an interview with the washington post, sund said he reached out to senate sergeant at arms michael stenger and his counterpart at the house, paul irving, on jan. 4, asking for guard backup."}
{"original": "according to sund, permission was denied because irving didn't like the optics and stenger thought the chief could informally ask national guard leaders to be on alert. (sund, stenger and irving, all of whom resigned after the siege, could not be reached for comment.)"}
{"original": "the next day, an fbi memo warned of bloodshed in graphic terms, citing an online thread shared among prospective demonstrators: be ready to fight. congress needs to hear glass breaking, doors being kicked in, and blood … being spilled. get violent. stop calling this a march. … go there ready for war. we get our president or we die."}
{"original": "it is unclear how widely fbi intelligence was shared among law enforcement agencies and the military."}
{"original": "about that time, the save america march permit was amended. instead of 5,000 participants, there would be up to 30,000."}
{"original": "right-wing radicals are notorious for bloodthirsty rhetoric that often doesn't lead to action. moreover, the mob that descended on the capitol had full-throated backing from trump, who positioned himself as the law-and-order president."}
{"original": "still, watts, kohn and others said the failure to anticipate an attack was remarkable given the volume and intensity of violent rhetoric from trump and his devotees."}
{"original": "that miscalculation may have been enhanced, watts suggested, by unconscious bias. the attendees weren't people of color, but mostly white – so some in authority may have viewed them as less threatening."}
{"original": "this is a blue lives matter crowd, watts said, referring to a pro-police slogan. i think that kind of gave (security officials) a disorienting way to think about it."}
{"original": "on june 1, national guard troops and federal law enforcement used tear gas, batons and less lethal projectiles to drive peaceful black lives matter protesters out of lafayette square, clearing the way for trump to pose with a bible at st. john's church. national guard helicopters buzzed demonstrators later that evening."}
{"original": "the use of military force against civilians drew such a fierce backlash that the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff issued a public apology. in congress, hearings were convened to challenge the use of national guard troops for a political event."}
{"original": "watts said concerns about that fiasco appear to have factored into the house and senate sergeants at arms' denial for sund to seek national guard reinforcements. it also may have influenced the district of columbia's preparations."}
{"original": "two days before last week's rally, the district of columbia council issued a statement calling on all coordinating agencies to ensure safety, prevent violence, and to do so with no appearance of preference or disparate treatment."}
{"original": "kenyan mcduffie, chair pro tempore of the council, said the goal was to avoid any repeat of what happened during black lives matter demonstrations."}
{"original": "the world watched law enforcement attack peaceful protesters with rubber bullets and chemical agents, all to facilitate a photo op for president trump, mcduffie said."}
{"original": "the day before last week's rally, bowser wrote a second letter – this one to the pentagon and the u.s. attorney general. during summer protests, she noted, washington's metropolitan police department had to manage crowds while working around unidentifiable, armed federal law enforcement."}
{"original": "that caused confusion among residents and visitors and could become a national security threat with no way for mpd and federal law enforcement to decipher armed groups, she wrote."}
{"original": "to be clear, bowser concluded, the district of columbia is not requesting other federal law enforcement personnel and discourages any additional deployment without notification."}
{"original": "with trump planning a rally and social media pushing his supporters toward violence, sund told the washington post he grew increasingly worried."}
{"original": "on jan. 4, the capitol police chief asked house and senate sergeants at arms for permission to request additional guard members. the congressional officers balked, sund said, with irving citing concerns that declaring an emergency would produce bad optics."}
{"original": "that evening, sund spoke with the national guard commander in the district about leaning forward so there would be some readiness in case troops needed to be called in an emergency, according to the post. but there was no plan, no force in place."}
{"original": "this is where some analysts believe a third factor influenced decision-making: the issue of martial law."}
{"original": "as the threat of violence loomed, sund told the post, lt. gen. walter e. piatt, director of the army staff, declined to recommend that army secretary ryan mccarthy approve an urgent request for guard deployment, saying he did not like the image of the national guard standing a police line with the capitol in the background."}
{"original": "as the mob was storming the capitol, sund told the post, he pleaded with the defense department to send troops but got no help until the assault was over. his account was corroborated by john falcicchio, bowser's chief of staff, who said sund was literally crying for help during a conference call, according to the post."}
{"original": "piatt disputed that version of events. he said when mccarthy received the capitol police request for reinforcements, he immediately ran to the acting secretary of defense's office to request approval."}
{"original": "pentagon and national guard officials have stressed that, after a request has been submitted, it takes hours to assemble, equip and transport civilian soldiers unless they have already been mobilized."}
{"original": "linick, the retired army colonel, said notions of a martial law declaration may have added to pentagon concerns over the lafayette square scandal."}
{"original": "in december, a pro-trump organization called we the people took out an ad in the washington times urging the president to immediately declare a limited form of martial law and temporarily suspend the constitution so the military could oversee a revote in key states."}
{"original": "former national security adviser michael flynn, a trump confidant and retired army lieutenant general who had been pardoned by the president days earlier, broached the idea on newsmax and was invited to a meeting with the president. according to the new york times, the ensuing discussion led to infighting among white house staffers."}
{"original": "ten former secretaries of defense were so disturbed by talk of military interference with the democratic process they authored an op-ed jan. 3, exhorting current pentagon leaders to refrain from any political actions that undermine the results of the election or hinder the success of the new team."}
{"original": "watts, the foreign policy research institute fellow, said angst about political sensitivities undoubtedly was magnified by trump's willingness to castigate and fire officials who challenged him."}
{"original": "the result, watts said: a systemic breakdown where security officials were in this sort of paralysis about what to do. … everybody's just trying to ride out the term and not get fired or draw the president's ire."}
{"original": "the fear of getting cross-wise with the commander and chief has to weigh on decision-making, agreed linick."}
{"original": "after trump's fiery speech at the white house, his followers trekked toward a joint session of congress that had just gotten underway. some wore riot helmets and were armed with chemical spray, metal pipes and baseball bats."}
{"original": "don ritchie, historian emeritus of the u.s. senate, said the capitol police force has been beefed up and professionalized over the years in response to previous riots, shootings and other violence. still, he said, the duty mostly involves keeping tabs on high school kids, and the force seemed overwhelmed and underprepared on jan. 6."}
{"original": "there's never been an incident such as this where a mob attacked the building, broke in and tried to attack the members of congress, ritchie said."}
{"original": "the national guard had been called up only twice previously to protect the capitol, ritchie said – in 1932 when military veterans marched peacefully to request world war i pensions, and during the 1968 political riots. the halls of congress were not breached in either incident."}
{"original": "while many police officers resisted valiantly last week, video showed some simply stepping aside. (two capitol police officers have been suspended for misconduct and at least 20 reportedly are under investigation.)"}
{"original": "insurgents pushed through barricades, scaled walls, bashed windows, vandalized offices and posed for selfies. for about two hours, they occupied the capitol."}
{"original": "this week, all eight members of the joint chiefs of staff signed a memo to military personnel urging them to obey lawful orders from civilian leadership … and remain fully committed to protecting and defending the constitution of the united states from enemies foreign and domestic."}
{"original": "five people died in the jan. 6 insurrection, including two officers. dozens of law enforcement personnel were hurt."}
{"original": "when it was over, a question lingered like smoke over a battlefield: where was the national guard?"}
{"original": "mitch mcconnell, r-ky., the senate majority leader, has launched a congressional probe into what he described as a massive failure of security."}
{"original": "but watts said that's not the end of the story. a dysfunctional presidency has weakened democratic institutions and undermined public confidence, he warned, leaving polarization, distrust and vulnerability. it's a corrosive, slow cancer."}

{"original": "i've been involved in crash repairs, and that's not a great situation in the garage with 20 people running around, oil leaking on the floor, things catching on fire and sharp sheet metal being cut off, miller said. it's a fairly unsafe situation. and at times it would be unsafe really for the driver to get back in a car that was damaged that heavily."}

{"original": "often, teams have repaired accident damage so that drivers can return to the track to make a few laps and pick up points."}
{"original": "the most famous example of this occurred in the final race of the 1973 season, when point leader benny parsons crashed heavily early in the event. mechanics from other teams swarmed parsons' car and pieced together repairs to allow him to return to the track and score enough points to win the championship."}
{"original": "under the new rules, parsons would not have been allowed to return to the track."}
{"original": "the changes will be in effect for all three national series: monster energy nascar cup, xfinity and camping world truck."}
{"original": "additionally, miller said wednesday that nascar's move to segmented races will impact the point at which events are considered official in case of weather issues. previously, a race that reached the halfway point was considered official. now, miller said, races that reach the end of the second of three stages will be official."}
{"original": "stage lengths will be different at each track, and many of those lengths have not been determined. officials said wednesday that the stages for the season-opening daytona 500, scheduled for feb. 26, will be 60 laps for stages one and two and 80 laps for stage three. the race would be considered official after 120 laps, as opposed to 100 laps (halfway) in previous seasons."}

{"original": "one can't help noticing that many of these people are the same experts who thought it a good idea to advance regime-change in iraq and libya, who are now advocating the same in syria, and who think occupying afghanistan for 17 years and running is sound."}

{"original": "going forward, i have three humble suggestions for any gung-ho military interventions:"}
{"original": "►we sorely need separate congressional authorization for each new military incursion. that means exhaustive hearings, democratic debate and public consensus. one problem we've had since the 2001 terrorist attacks is that we've had a roving, all-purpose authorization for use of military force used and/or abused to initiate, expand and/or unendingly keep our armed forces in an increasing number of muslim-majority countries. does the american public even know the size and nature of our post-2001 expanding military footprint?"}
{"original": "►for the love of god, let's spread the sacrifice around. when commentators such as max boot, joe scarborough, bret stephens and other foreign policy and media elites send their grown children to fight in the middle east, middle america's sons and daughters can go, too. otherwise, no can do."}
{"original": "►for any new future military interventions, there ought to be clear goals and a clear exit strategy delineated with no room for mission creep and endless quagmires."}
{"original": "one reason we admire president george h.w. bush was because he kept the persian gulf war in check and didn't get us embroiled in iraq. let's emulate that restraint and wisdom."}
{"original": "there will always be strife and chaos in the middle east due to the centuries-long shiite-sunni enmity. our military presence there doesn't mitigate it; we are, in some ways, participants there and often end up sowing more discord and creating more terrorists."}
{"original": "and of course there are the unforeseen, unintended consequences: our iraq misadventure ended up empowering iran and imperiling the christian minority in iraq. our libyan fiasco ended up creating the refugee and migrant crisis affecting europe."}
{"original": "to the american voter i'd humbly say: think for yourself. don't fall for the same tired drumbeats. reject blind loyalty to party and ideology. realize that on the issues of illegal immigration and war, especially, there are vested interests with ulterior motives pushing counterintuitive policies. always keep america's interests in mind."}

{"original": "this week, the arizona cardinals hired kliff kingsbury, the 39-year-old former texas tech coach who was recently fired after six seasons and a 35-40 record, including three straight losing seasons."}
{"original": "like many fans — they were also stunned that kingsbury lasted only a few weeks as usc's offensive coordinator — dallas wfaa sportscaster dale hansen was surprised by the cardinals' coaching hire and criticized it."}
{"original": "as hansen explicitly says on the abc affiliate station, it is not because kingsbury was fired and is now being given a second chance. his outrage and shock echos that of countless fans who have pointed out the lack of diversity among nfl coaches, specifically that white privilege enables less accomplished white coaches to be elevated over coaches of color with stronger resumes."}
{"original": "while admonishing the nfl for consistently overlooking coaches of color or being too quick to fire them compared with their white counterparts — he takes a shot at dallas cowboys coach jason garrett — hansen recognizes his own white privilege and argues for an end to the obvious double standard."}
{"original": "kingsbury fits all the criteria to be a head coach in the nfl: he's an offensive genius, he's young — and he's white, and not necessarily in that order."}
{"original": "there have been six new coaches hired so far, all white and two coaches of color. they are replacing steve wilks, fired in arizona after just one year, vance joseph in denver after just two. the cowboys coach jason garrett is in his ninth year — apparently because he wins so much."}

{"original": "washington — the pentagon will review more than 1,100 medals issued since the 9/11 terror attacks for possible upgrade to the medal of honor, the country's highest award issued for valor in combat, according to documents obtained by usa today."}
{"original": "the sweeping review ordered by defense secretary ash carter would represent one of the most significant steps in decades to honor troops who have displayed extraordinary courage in combat. it stems from a study of military decorations and awards that was ordered in march 2014 by then-defense secretary chuck hagel to ensure that after 13 years of combat the awards system appropriately recognizes the service, sacrifices and action of our service members."}
{"original": "should even a fraction of the medals under review be upgraded, it's possible that dozens more troops would receive the medal of honor for their bravery in iraq and afghanistan. a formal announcement is scheduled for thursday. the review and creation of new awards to honor the-post 9/11 generation of troops are the latest in a series of dramatic steps carter has taken regarding military personnel; others include opening all combat jobs to women, and preparing to rescind the ban on transgender troops from serving."}
{"original": "rep. duncan hunter, a california republican, marine veteran and member of the house armed services committee, saluted the pentagon's medal review but called it overdue. he blamed military red tape and too many layers of approval required for all the medals it awards for valor."}
{"original": "it's a systemic problem, hunter said. i'm glad they're finally getting around to fixing it. this is military bureaucracy at its worst."}
{"original": "among the other recommendations carter has approved:"}
{"original": "• a new award for troops who have directed drones over battlefields in the middle east and afghanistan. the r device would be awarded to recognize remote impacts on combat operations."}
{"original": "• establishing a standard definition for meritorious service that limits combat awards to those exposed to hostile action or at significant risk of exposure."}
{"original": "• setting goals and guidelines to ensure medal of honor and other awards are made in a timely way."}
{"original": "the veterans of foreign wars, the service organization that represents 1.7 million members, supports the review and the recognition for drone operators, said joe davis, a spokesman."}

{"original": "the proposal for potential upgrades to medal of honor has the potential to be the most controversial. of the 37 recommendations, it was the only one not reached by consensus, records show. it would require the army, air force, marine corps and navy to re-examine each of the service cross and silver star nominations they have awarded since sept. 11, 2001. the army alone awarded 718 silver stars."}
{"original": "the army and air force plan to review the service crosses and silver stars each branch has awarded. but the navy and marine corps oppose such a review, according to a briefing paper, because top officials there believe reviewing prior decisions undermines the integrity of commanders' decisions. the marine corps is a department of the navy."}
{"original": "a memo from navy secretary ray mabus added that such a review may have long-term detrimental impact on our service culture and our awards program."}
{"original": "mabus' memo goes on to note that the pentagon certified in 2010 that the services' medal of honor processes and standards were sound."}
{"original": "much of the prestige of our valor decorations stems from confidence in the process before awarding them, the memo says. reconsidering all previous valor award decisions without an evidentiary basis would reverse the longstanding policy that protects the integrity of the process by which we award our highest decorations."}
{"original": "part of the rationale for the recommendation to review the service crosses and silver stars, according to another briefing paper, is that from 2001 to 2010, all the medals of honor for u.s. conflicts were bestowed posthumously. after this pentagon guidance was issued, there is no requirement to meet the 'risk of life' portion of the (medal of honor) award criteria all recipients have been living."}
{"original": "in addition, the paper notes, combat experience of commanders differed early in the conflict and this lack of combat experience may have led to an initial reluctance to recommend members for the (medal of honor)."}
{"original": "the review included input from more than 1,000 combat-experienced troops at 13 posts, according to another document."}
{"original": "seventeen medals of honor have been awarded since 2001. four were for service in iraq, while 13 were for afghanistan. all four medals for iran were posthumous."}
{"original": "listen to reporter tom vanden brook what he learned while reporting on this big change to the medal of honor process:"}
{"original": "asked about the pentagon's actions on medals, white house press secretary josh earnest on wednesday said he didn't want his remarks to affect the rigorous process in awarding the medal. but he did acknowledge the sacrifices troops have made since 9/11."}
{"original": "that's an indication that this generation of americans has — has borne a significant burden in protecting our country since 9/11, earnest said. and we certainly have — the president himself has raised concerns about the wisdom of the decision that was made by the previous administration to go to war in iraq, but that does not in any way diminish the president's deep appreciation, respect and even honor for those who have served our country in iraq and afghanistan since 9/11."}

{"original": "the report found most of the post-conviction donations, totaling $525,000, were made to support the work of mit's embattled media lab, led by former director joi ito, while $225,000 went to seth lloyd, a professor of mechanical engineering and engineering systems and physics."}

{"original": "the report found these administrators were not seeking personal gain but instead were trying to balance the competing objectives of obtaining funding for media lab programs, while denying epstein any personal benefit from his association with mit. morgan and newton are retired from the university, the new york times reported, while mit announced last month that ruiz would step down for a career outside of academia."}
{"original": "by insisting that such donations remain anonymous, they also were attempting to protect mit's reputation, the report says. regardless of their intent, these administrators were aware of the risk that the donations might become public, but did not adequately consider the potential damage accepting donations from a convicted sex offender could cause to the mit community."}

{"original": "ito, who also taught at mit, resigned hours after a september article in the new yorker detailed how his lab accepted gifts from epstein despite being listed as disqualified in mit's official donor database. the article said the lab listed epstein's contributions as anonymous and avoided disclosing to the school the full extent of his involvement."}

{"original": "our asylum laws have some gaping holes. these gaps endanger many groups, but none more so than women and girls who are fleeing domestic violence, honor killings, mass rape in wartime, gang rape by criminal gangs, and other gender-related violence. congress must explicitly recognize gender-based persecution as a potential asylum ground."}
{"original": "asylum requires a well-founded fear of being persecuted. but not just any persecution will do. the persecution has to occur for one of five specific reasons — your race, your religion, your nationality, your political opinion, or what the law calls your particular social group. gender is notably missing from this list."}
{"original": "that omission is not surprising. u.s. asylum laws, like those of most other western countries, track the language of an international refugee convention that was adopted in 1951. gender-related violence was simply not on the public radar at that time."}

{"original": "without specific congressional recognition of gender-based persecution, women and girls fleeing the most horrific violence imaginable have had to argue that they will be persecuted because of their particular social group. today that is easier said than done. the nation's highest administrative tribunal that decides asylum claims — the justice department's board of immigration appeals — has been adding more and more roadblocks to asylum claims that are based on particular social group."}
{"original": "this was not always the case. in 1985, the board defined particular social group as one in which membership is immutable. gender, of course, meets that definition."}
{"original": "the immutability test makes perfect sense. if you will be persecuted only because of an innocuous characteristic that you can easily change, then you don't need asylum. but if that characteristic cannot be changed, you have no other practical way to protect yourself. the immutability test thus allows asylum for those who need it and withholds it from those who don't."}
{"original": "but the board could not leave well enough alone. along the way it invented two additional requirements. one is social distinction. if you claim persecution because of your membership in a particular social group, you must now prove that your home society describes that class of individuals as a group. second, you must now prove what the board calls particularity. by this it means you must prove that your home society can figure out whether hypothetical other individuals are members of the group."}
{"original": "there are only four problems with those requirements: the board has no convincing legal authority to impose them. no one really understands what they mean. they are nearly impossible to prove. and they make no policy sense: why should the u.s. decision whether to grant asylum to someone depend on whether her home society thinks of the particular class as a group, or on whether the home society can tell which other individuals belong to that group?"}
{"original": "last june, then-attorney general jeff sessions made this bad situation worse. overruling board precedent, he announced that, henceforth, anyone fleeing domestic violence (or, for that matter anyone fleeing gang violence) will generally be unable to prove either social distinction or particularity and therefore should be denied asylum. although a federal court has blocked that decision for now, the supreme court will likely determine its ultimate fate."}
{"original": "but the problems go beyond that specific case. first, the artificial constraints that the board has imposed for all claims based on particular social group are both harmful and irrational. second, it is only because gender is not on congress's list of specifically protected grounds that women and girls have had to fit their claims into particular social group in the first place."}
{"original": "women would still prove need for asylum"}
{"original": "what arguments could possibly be made for protecting people from racial or religious persecution but not from gender persecution?"}
{"original": "perhaps the fear is that domestic violence is too endemic, that allowing asylum would open the floodgates. we need not worry, for a woman or girl fleeing domestic violence has multiple legal burdens that minimize the numbers: she must prove that her fear is both genuine and well-founded, that the harm she fears is severe, that her government is unable or unwilling to protect her, that no place anywhere in her country would be safe, and — even if gender is added to the list — that the persecution will be inflicted because of her gender. these are all high bars, and proof requires meticulous, persuasive documentation. canada has recognized domestic violence asylum claims since the 1990s, and no floodgates have opened."}
{"original": "the u.s. cannot singlehandedly eradicate all violence against women and girls — even here at home. but we can at least avoid being an accomplice. when women and girls arrive at our shores asking only that they not be beaten, raped or murdered, delivering them to their tormentors is not an option. congress should restore the original meaning of particular social group, and it should recognize that gender, like race and religion, belongs in the list of specifically protected grounds."}

{"original": "we test mattresses the same way you might: we sleep on them for at least 30 nights to see how they hold up. unlike you, though, we also subjected some of these mattresses to a series of standardized tests into our state-of-the-art testing labs in cambridge, mass. between the at-home testing and the lab testing, we gather data related the following attributes:"}
{"original": "comfort: perhaps the most important part of a mattress is the comfort it provides. of course, comfort is subjective and differs from person to person. instead of assessing how just one tester felt on the bed, testers considered how supported their body felt throughout the night, and in different sleep positions. testers were mindful of their own sleep habits, even considering whether or not they found themselves rolling around at night to find a cooler spot on the bed."}
{"original": "motion transfer and bounciness: we asked our testers to have another person (or sometimes a pet) join them on the mattress to see how noticeable the movement caused by a bedmate might be. if you're a light sleeper, sleeping on a mattress that does nothing to insulate you from a tossing and turning bed partner isn't going to do your sleep quality any favors. for most of the mattresses, we double-checked our assessment of the mattress's motion transfer by placing a water-filled wine glass or a newton's cradle (that famous desk toy with the ball bearings suspended on strings) on one side of the bed, and asking our testers to climb onto the other side and move around a bit. if their movements were enough to spill water from the wine glass or make the balls in the newton's cradle clack together, then we could confirm that that mattress would not be a good pick for a light sleeper."}
{"original": "unsurprisingly, motion transfer is closely related to bounciness. in some cases, we gauged a mattress's bounciness by jumping up and down on the mattress like small children with energy to burn. in the lab, though, the bounciness test is much more sedate. the tester makes a video recording of dropping a bowling ball onto the center of the mattress from about waist height; after checking the video, we determined the bounciness by noting how much air (if any) the bowling ball got on the first bounce."}
{"original": "edge support: testers assessed the support provided by the edge of the bed by determining whether the mattress edges sloped beneath their weight while they were lying down along it or sitting down on it. while this may not matter to some sleepers, when a mattress is crowded with a partner or a pet, too-little edge support can mean the difference between staying aloft or falling off the bed. if the mattress edges provide too little support, it could also make it difficult for you to put your shoes on in the morning, or complete any other task that is often done while sitting on the mattress corners or edges."}
{"original": "for the mattresses that were tested in our labs, we placed a bowling ball on the edges and corners of the mattress. if the bowling ball stays in place and doesn't roll away, then we conclude there's enough support at mattress edges for you to sleep on without having to worry about falling out of bed in the middle of the night."}
{"original": "heat retention: one of the more recent hot-button issues in mattresses is heat retention. if a mattress cannot vent or disperse the heat you give off quickly enough, you might be in for a warmer sleeping experience than you were expecting. while this is ideal for those of us who sleep cold, people who sleep warm can end up sweating and miserable in the middle of the night."}
{"original": "in our earlier tests, we relied on our testers' subjective responses to heat retention. in more recent iterations of our mattress testing, we started measuring it in our labs. first, we place temperature sensors on the mattress, cover the mattress with a heated blanket, and turn it on a high setting for an hour. then, we turn the heated blanket on and off every fifteen minutes. in order to see if a mattress retains heat, we check the temperature spikes over time. if a mattress vents the heat from the heated blanket efficiently, then the temperature peaks should not rise over time (in fact, with cooling mattresses, those peaks should go down over time). for mattresses that retain heat, though, we'd expect to see those temperature values go up over time. by looking at the temperature, it's easy to see whether a given mattress will keep you (too) warm or leave you cool."}
{"original": "support: while you know your body's needs best, we can give you a rough idea of the amount of support a mattress provides, whether we test it in someone's home or in the lab. for at-home testing, our testers lie on their backs on the mattress and check for any gaps between their lower back and the top of the mattress. if the gaps are present, then it is unlikely that the mattress will be able to provide you with adequate back support."}
{"original": "future lab tests will confirm the at-home testing by placing weight plates on either end of a barbell, placing the barbell on the mattress, and seeing how much the mattress attempts to fill in the gap between the two weights."}
{"original": "memory: some people want the memory-foam experience where their mattress perfectly conforms to the contours of their body. typically, memory foam retains the imprint of a person's body for a longer period of time than a standard coil-constructed mattress. to verify that a memory foam mattress lives up to its name, we place 150 pounds of weight onto the mattress, leave it overnight, and then remove the weight. if the mattress springs back instantaneously (or didn't seem to change shape at all under the weight), then the mattress has very little memory. however, if we can actually see the mattress returning to its original shape in real time, then the mattress has some degree of memory and shape retention."}
{"original": "moving and unboxing: mattresses-in-a-box are a beast to unpack and to move once they're open to their full size. we asked testers to describe how difficult it was to remove the mattress from its packaging, as well as how feasible they thought it would be for someone to move that mattress by themselves once fully expanded."}
{"original": "odor: foam mattresses aren't known for smelling like daisies, especially when they first are sprung from their packaging. the packaging and manufacturing processes cause chemicals to become trapped within the mattress; these smelly chemicals are released into the air once the plastic around the mattress is cut open. testers noted the smell of the mattress when they first opened it, and again 24 hours later (the minimum time it's recommended you let a mattress off-gas before sleeping on it)."}
{"original": "customer experience: we asked testers to answer questions related to the experience of ordering and receiving the mattress itself. what was the delivery process like? how easy is it to install the mattress? how long are the trial period and the warranty period? how seamless is the return process?"}
{"original": "because the requirements for a comfortable mattress can vary so much from person to person, some of the aforementioned tests are opportunities to gather data about a mattress, rather than grade it objectively. for example, some people may prefer bouncy mattresses over stiff mattresses, or vice versa. in this case, we don't penalize a mattress for being bouncy (or stiff); we passively collect this data so as to provide you with the information you need to determine whether a specific mattress is right for you."}
{"original": "what should you know about mattresses"}
{"original": "let's face it: mattresses are expensive. and everyone needs a bed, so you don't have many options other than coughing up the cash. what's more, most mattresses last you a decade—and you don't want to be stuck sleeping on a bed you find uncomfortable for 10 years. you want to be sure you're getting your money's worth, and a mattress you'll love for years to come. but where do you even begin?"}
{"original": "first: you need to do your research. seeing as you're already here, you're headed in the right direction! but also read expert and buyer reviews—and a lot of them. given how much time you spend in bed, and the impact that quality sleep has on our waking hours, it's critical you choose what's best for you. a bad night's sleep can be a literal pain in the neck or back that impacts your mood, memory, and productivity the next day (or even for months on end!). as comfort is subjective and personal, we recommend researching multiple products to get a holistic look at your options. keep your own preferences in mind: for instance, we might not have liked the comparatively large 14.5-inch height of the otherwise comfortable saatva, but that might be exactly what you're looking for to fit your ultra-low bed frame."}
{"original": "one of the best parts of the online mattress industry is that most bed-in-a-box companies offer a trial period so that you can literally sleep on it. that said, it's important to take each company's return policy into account. some companies make it super-easy by retrieving the mattress free of cost, but others require you to coordinate the return, donation, or disposal of the mattress in order to receive a full refund."}
{"original": "what to consider when buying a mattress in a box"}
{"original": "can you try the mattress in a store before you buy? while purple and tuft & needle are online-only retailers, casper has a handful of brick-and-mortar stores where you can feel the mattresses in person—just like a traditional mattress store. other companies partner with specific retailers. leesa, for example, teamed up with west elm and pottery barn, so you can buy the mattress straight from these vendors and visit some of their physical locations to test it out."}
{"original": "what level of firmness do you want? mattresses range from extra firm, almost like sleeping on a carpeted floor (or a slab of rock, depending on your preferences), to soft and squishy, like a cloud (or quicksand). finding the right firmness for you is essential to getting a good night's rest. if you're not sure what you want, you can always visit a mattress showroom to get a sense of your preferences before buying online."}
{"original": "what fabrication are you looking for? boxed mattresses come in a myriad of materials. you can choose among memory foam, traditional coiled springs, hybrid mattresses (which combine foam and coils), or something off the beaten path, such as purple's unique polymer. each type has benefits and drawbacks. memory foam, for example, contours well to your body under the pressure of your weight, but can feel too enveloping to some people and retain heat. coils can provide more support, but will also feel bouncier and may transfer more motion, say, from a restless partner."}
{"original": "do you want more edge support? if you're an active sleeper, or your bed is home to a party of more than one, edge support can help prevent you, a partner, the kids, and even pets from rolling overboard, which can be an issue with some memory foam mattresses. or if you like to sit on the edge of the bed as you put on shoes or socks, you might not want to feel the mattress sloping down or collapsing underneath you. coil and some hybrid mattresses have an encasement around the bed to help provide support around the edges."}
{"original": "does the mattress require a box spring or a foundation? many newer mattresses work fine without a box spring (a fabric-covered wood frame that contains springs to increase bed buoyancy and boosts up the mattress for additional height), as long as you have a platform bed or adequate slats to provide support and/or the height you'd like your bed to be. just be sure to check the mattress specifications before it shows up at your door. if you do need a base, these companies sell them to match their mattresses."}
{"original": "does the mattress require special accessories? some mattresses, such as the extra-thick saatva, may not work well with standard sheets or bed frames. that might mean you need to replace your favorite sheets with a deep-pocket set or, if your bed frame isn't compatible, new furniture, which can get expensive."}
{"original": "do you have (or plan to get) an adjustable base? if you have or are hoping to get a motorized adjustable base, you'll want to buy a mattress that is compatible. some mattresses aren't designed to fold up and using them with a motorized adjustable could damage the mattress and potentially break the base."}

{"original": "amerisleep as3 the key word for this mattress is firm. it has some give without losing all bounciness, but if you're used to a soft, memory foam-type mattress, the amerisleep may feel a little dense. our tester tried the amerisleep right after the super-squishy allswell, and though she generally prefers firm mattresses, it took a few nights to get used to the amerisleep's comparable lack of give. in the beginning, there were nights our tester woke up with tension in her lower back, though this didn't happen frequently enough for her to know whether this was due to the mattress itself or poor posture when hunched over her desk during the day. but after this breaking-in (or getting-used-to) period, the mattress felt great. it has a sturdy core and a supple upper layer, so lying on it makes the sleeper feel cradled but not coddled. it retained heat, albeit a minimal amount, in our tester's experience and in our lab testing. even so, our tester found it comfortable, maybe thanks to the mattress's biopur foam topper, which has open cells that increase breathability, according to amerisleep. our tester thinks this feature likely made it feel comfortable, even when she snuggled up with blankets in a stuffy apartment. finally, there's at least one thing that any prospective amerisleep buyers think of as a positive: because it's so firm, it's really easy to make the bed."}

{"original": "the chill mattress from cocoon by sealy the all-foam chill mattress—a boxed mattress offering from cocoon by sealy, an offshoot of the well-known mattress brand—has a medium-firm feel with a tiny bit of bounce. its three layers of foam, which include a support layer, comfort foam, and memory foam, are topped with a polyester and cotton cover that purports to have cooling properties. our tester—usually a back or side sleeper—found that the foam's top layer conformed to her body with enough support from the firmer layer below to prevent potential uncomfortable pressure in areas like the hips. because there's some sinking into the foam, the mattress traps a bit of body heat, but the cooling top layer seemed to offset anything that might cause intense night sweats. lab tests show it retained minimal, but not zero, heat—but our tester, who tends to sleep hot, thought the mattress felt cozy, not cloying and thinks this isn't a deal-breaker. our tester found the mattress comfortable and supportive when she slept on her side, but sometimes woke up with some discomfort in her lower back, which indicates it isn't quite as supportive as it could be for that sleeping position. for some reason, she also woke up on her stomach a few times while testing the mattress (even though she almost never sleeps on her stomach), and thought it felt comfortable like this, so it's probably a fine option for stomach sleepers, too."}
{"original": "overall, the chill mattress from cocoon by sealy should be a great choice for someone who wants a medium-firm mattress with some cooling properties at a reasonable price, starting at $730 for a twin—our tester falls right into that category and was sad to send it back. people who want a very soft or very firm mattress may be disappointed, as might someone who sleeps on their back all the time. but for what it promises to do—stay cool and provide cozy support—the chill comes through. mattress materials: foam mattress with three layers of foam —support layer, comfort foam, and memory foam—and cooling cloth cover. delivery and packaging: front-door drop-off, arrives in a cardboard box that weighs about 75 pounds. trial period: 100 nights. return protocol: contact cocoon by sealy and the company will arrange for the mattress to be picked up and donated to a local agency—no need to box the bed or even break a sweat. pros medium-firmness will have broad appeal"}

{"original": "puffy lux the puffy lux is a great mattress, but it isn't for everyone. for better and worse, the lux's standout attribute is its softness. our tester, a hybrid side and stomach sleeper, found herself looking forward to sleeping on it each night. the mattress's surface is responsive and has a nice amount of immediate give—it doesn't take time to gradually contour to your form like some foams, which also means you dodge the quicksand effect. the mattress perfectly cradled our tester without making her feel as though she was sinking in too deeply, and she loved that sensation while sleeping and lying on it in every sleep position—back, side, and stomach. the puffy's cushiony surface that cradles, however, is a double-edged sword. though our tester loved it, she thinks some will find it too soft. folks who have larger frames—especially those who prefer catching zzz's prone or supine, both positions that require more support for the back—may find the mattress isn't firm enough to maintain spinal alignment for back or stomach sleeping, which could even lead to back strain. the mattress is made with puffy's cooling cloud foam material, which is a bit of a misnomer, as it's just designed to keep your temperature neutral, not actually cool you. our tester felt the temperature neutral claim held in her experience sleeping on the bed. the mattress never retained heat, nor did it actively cool in our tester's experience and lab results. the lux is made with four layers of foam."}

{"original": "purple purple sets itself apart with its unique gel-like material unlike the typical memory foam, coil, or hybrid mattresses that pad the rest of the market. the gel material results in an undeniably comfortable surface that hugs the body without feeling like quicksand. it also absorbs movement extremely well, as evidenced by our tester's wine-glass test: when her partner rolled and flopped around on his side of the bed, the filled wine glass balanced on her side hardly registered the motion. the extreme squish and stretch of the top polymer layer makes it seem like the mattress wouldn't offer much support, but it's quite the opposite. it cradles the body regardless of preferred sleep position. this was the first mattress our tester tested, and she'd been dealing with the quintessential i'm not 25 anymore and work at a desk all day lower back pain. it wasn't long after she started sleeping on the purple that her pain diminished, and that's a big reason why she continued using a purple mattress, buying herself one after the test period. nonetheless, some may find the mattress is too soft to provide enough support night after night. purple also has no competition when it comes to delivery. the others, excluding the saatva, arrive in massive boxes that are awkward and near-impossible to haul around, especially up stairs. purple's mattresses arrive wrapped in plastic tubing that has cloth straps stitched right in."}

{"original": "avocado green mattress the avocado green mattress is a fairly well-rounded bed that doesn't quite cater to everyone. our tester felt the mattress stood out temperature wise—it was consistently cool, even on hot summer nights, and she never woke up overbaked. lab testing confirmed that it's among the coolest mattresses we've tested. it was also just comfortable. it's not the same comfort offered by the leesa and other top picks, but it gives sleepers a cozy feel that our tester enjoyed. the avocado green mattress is a hybrid, meaning its construction incorporates springs and foam. it has hundreds of coils sandwiched between two layers of latex, which is known for being cooler than memory foam and its springy with a responsive surface, meaning it quickly responds to pressure or weight. latex doesn't yield the sinking, molding, or cradling sensation you get from memory foam, rather the surface has some plushness, but little give or tendency to compact beneath body weight. our tester felt the springiness of this mattress might be too much for some, but that it's a great option for people who prefer the feeling of coils, and don't want to completely sacrifice plushness. the mattress didn't beat our top picks because it isn't as versatile in terms of the sleep positions it accommodates."}
{"original": "side and back sleepers will enjoy it, but our tester found that her lumbar spine was unsupported when she slept on her stomach for more than one consecutive night, making the mattress less than ideal for people who prefer stomach sleeping. our tester also noticed the mattress she received was two inches short of a standard queen in width and length, coming in at 78 inches by 58 inches. for our tester, who is just accompanied by her cat each night, it wasn't a problem. however, anyone who is joined by a partner, kids, or large pets, this might be an issue. when our tester asked customer service about the size discrepancy, the representative said it was something avocado heard about often, and suggested jumping on the bed to encourage it to expand to its full size, which seemed questionable, at best. mattress materials: the avocado green mattress is made with two layers of organic latex rubber foam that sandwich pocketed coils, and it's covered in organic fabric. delivery and packaging: avocado's delivery takes longer than many mattress-in-a-box companies because the products are handmade. our tester's mattress took just over three weeks to arrive at her door. trial period: 365 nights. return protocol: avocado requires customers submit photos of the mattress condition. once it's verified, they coordinate with a local charity to pick up the mattress for donation. pros cool"}

{"original": "zinus the zinus green tea mattress, which we tested in the 12-inch thickness, is a soft mattress with minimal support but a super-affordable price. it's different from some other mattresses on this list, because it's available on amazon and, at under $350 for a 12-inch thick queen-size mattress, it's a lot cheaper than most mattresses out there. it is also widely beloved, with nearly 40,000 reviews and an overall 4.2-star rating. zinus' mattress foam, called biofoam, is made with green tea extract, castor seed oil, and charcoal. zinus says these natural components are used to prevent the typical chemical-y smelling scent of a mattress in a box, but when our tester unboxed it, it had the same pungent smell we've come to expect. (it dissipated in about 24 hours, though.) when our tester laid down on the zinus, the first thing she noticed could be a plus or a minus, depending on personal preferences: it's extremely soft. the mattress is composed of different kinds of foam, so it molds to pressure and weight, creating what felt to our tester like a divot underneath the body. in some ways, this is good—it has a nesting effect, so it's cozy—but she tends to sleep hot, and found that the zinus retained body heat more than other mattresses she's tested (namely, the helix). it also made it difficult to get out of bed in the morning because her 130-pound body had sunk so deep into the mattress."}
{"original": "still, she slept pretty well each night, despite not loving soft mattresses and occasionally feeling more overnight heat than she preferred. and the zinus has its fans (apart from all those amazon shoppers), one of whom is another reviewed staff member: anna lane, our parenting editor. she loves zinus mattresses so much that she has one in every bedroom of her house. i initially bought one for my son because i found that it was the most reasonably priced, not-super-toxic mattress, she says. i didn't have high hopes for comfort because of the price point, but once we tried it out, both my husband and i agreed that it was super-comfortable. then we bought two more: one for us and one for our daughter. bottom line: it's not for everyone. but buyers seeking a short queen size that measures 70 inches long, versus the regular 80 (a few people are), who like soft mattresses (some people do), and who prefer to save money (many people do), the zinus is a solid option. mattress materials: foam: three inches of memory foam, two inches of comfort foam, seven inches of high-density base support foam. delivery and packaging: front-door drop-off. the 12-inch thick queen size arrives in a rectangular cardboard box. it weighs about 60 pounds. trial period: 100 nights. return protocol: zinus instructs purchasers to contact customer service for instructions on returning decompressed (i.e., open) mattresses. these may prove a hassle to return if purchased anywhere other than zinus's site, if amazon reviewers' experiences are accurate."}

{"original": "jillian bearden and rachel mckinnon have much in common as cyclists, olympic hopefuls and transgender women — and much in conflict as opposite poles of an intractable argument over how to balance what's fair with what's right."}
{"original": "bearden agrees with the international olympic committee that naturally occurring testosterone gives transgender women an unfair advantage in competition against cisgender women, meaning women who were born female, while mckinnon believes subjecting trans women to testosterone blocking violates their human rights."}
{"original": "bearden sees trans women who compete with unlimited levels of natural testosterone as dopers and cheaters while mckinnon says looking at the issue that way only furthers the oppression of transgender people."}
{"original": "and never the twain shall meet."}
{"original": "usa today sports spoke with the antagonists, both of whom say they are fighting for fairness. bearden sees it as fairness for all competitors while mckinnon frames it as fairness for transgender athletes. all of this comes in the wake of updated ioc guidelines in 2015 that require women who transition from men to block certain amounts of natural testosterone."}
{"original": "the issue is important now because governing bodies such as usa cycling, usa track and field, usa fencing and us lacrosse are crafting, or have recently crafted, policies that more or less mirror these ioc guidelines. and it all comes at a time that ashland johnson, director of education and research for the human rights campaign, calls the dawn of a trans movement in sports."}
{"original": "the dispute between bearden and mckinnon is personal as well as intellectual. they've never competed against one another — bearden is at the highest pro level — but bearden says she asked mckinnon to leave her cycling team last spring because of their visceral disagreements. mckinnon then formed her own team and members of each cycling club mostly share the orthodoxies of their respective leaders."}
{"original": "i've proven how powerful testosterone is from when i competed as a male, bearden says. that doesn't mean specifically that the more testosterone you have the stronger you are, but the hormone provides a certain stamina that continues to charge you. it gives you that edge of pushing power."}
{"original": "mckinnon says whether other competitors believe transgender women have an unfair advantage is irrelevant because she says there is no way to measure if such advantages even exist."}
{"original": "this is bigger than sports and it's about human rights, mckinnon says. by catering to cisgender people's views, that furthers transgender people's oppression. when it comes to extending rights to a minority population, why would we ask the majority? i bet a lot of white people were pissed off when we desegregated sports racially and allowed black people. but they had to deal with it."}
{"original": "the ioc has long struggled with issues of gender. it instituted gender testing decades ago when men, in rare cases, were suspected of competing as women. at first the testing was of the crude, pull-down-your-pants variety. later that morphed into chromosomal testing with a cheek swab. and in 1999, the ioc ended compulsory gender testing."}
{"original": "but guidelines adopted in 2004 effectively said trans women had to undergo sex reassignment surgery. new guidelines in 2015 threw out the surgery requirement but said trans women needed to test below a specified level of testosterone for more than one year before they could compete, down from two years."}
{"original": "bearden thinks the new guidelines make sense. mckinnon thinks they are manifestly discriminatory."}
{"original": "all this comes at a time when president trump wants to ban transgender troops from serving in the military, a move condemned by generals and many in congress. the department of defense is tasked to develop an implementation plan by march. that will come just weeks after the pyeongchang winter olympics."}

{"original": "bearden transitioned in 2015 and she has been a scientific test subject for the ioc by providing before-and-after performance data that she says proves the power of testosterone. she understands that pressing for human rights always sounds like the right thing to do, but she believes in this instance it would actually hinder a transgender sports movement that's only just begun."}
{"original": "two years ago, no transgender woman (cyclist) was out (publicly) racing, bearden says. no one would dare come out of the shadows. now, because we've laid the appropriate groundwork, we have our foot in the door (with the ioc) to where we can compete as our true selves."}
{"original": "quite frankly, it makes me feel good racing with 50 other women who know that i've passed a usa cycling policy because i've submitted my (testosterone) levels. it stops the questioning, the bullying. i can stand on the podium and feel comfortable. without a policy, for a lot of women who don't know me, they'd be, like, what the (expletive)? and i get that."}
{"original": "under ioc and usoc guidelines, olympic-caliber transgender women are required to keep their testosterone below a certain level — 10 nanomoles per liter — before competing, and must present a doctor's note showing testosterone levels are below that required threshold. natural testosterone in transgender women is tested with the same methodology as unnatural testosterone created by doping is measured in cisgender men and women."}
{"original": "mckinnon, who teaches a class on ethics and inclusion at charleston, cites the olympic charter in saying that sport is a human right."}
{"original": "we cannot have a woman legally recognized as a trans woman in society, mckinnon says, and not be recognized that way in sports. … focusing on performance advantage is largely irrelevant because this is a rights issue. we shouldn't be worried about trans people taking over the olympics. we should be worried about their fairness and human rights instead."}
{"original": "bearden makes a distinction between discriminatory bathroom bills and what she sees as rule-makers doing their best to promote equality and inclusion."}
{"original": "having your rights violated is very different than a sport you sign yourself up for, she says. you have to comply with certain rules. i don't feel that's discriminatory. i don't think (guidelines) infringe on anyone's rights. i feel like (testosterone blocking) is necessary to achieve fairness. there are so many rules in sports, and complying with these rules allows us to ride with cisgender women because it's fairest to them."}
{"original": "bearden lives in colorado springs, home of the usoc. she believes compromise can lead to good solutions. mckinnon, originally from victoria, british columbia, believes she has an uncompromising call to justice."}
{"original": "both women want transgender people to thrive — in athletics and in society — and both have received death threats for their trouble. last august, when bearden became the first trans woman to race with a pro peloton in the u.s., the daily wire (a self-styled commentary site for conservatives) ran a story under the headline: man who thinks he's a woman crushing women's cycling."}
{"original": "mckinnon says testosterone testing is insensitive to transgender athletes who are uncomfortable outing themselves. she points out some athletes are at an in-between place in terms of their gender. scottie pendleton, who rides for mckinnon's foxy moxy team, identifies as gender nonconforming and goes by the pronouns of they and them."}
{"original": "i race in the men's field, but i identify as more of a woman than a man, pendleton says. there are a lot of misconceptions out there about gender and it's unknown how diverse the transgender community is. we've culturally defined gender as these two very specific things and that you have to be one or the other. transgender breaks that barrier."}
{"original": "pendleton says there is limited research to show that natural testosterone can enhance sports performance metrics. it comes down to: what does fairness in sports actually mean? i think any time you exclude anybody because they are different — regardless of how or why they are different — you're discriminating."}
{"original": "johnson, of the human rights campaign, says: all athletes, regardless of gender, should be subject to the same testing standards, and a policy shouldn't single out a trans competitor. but at the same time, i don't necessarily see (the ioc's guidelines) as an anti-trans policy because there have been unfair advantages linked to testosterone."}
{"original": "chris mosier became the first transgender man to compete in the duathlon world championships in 2016 and is now sponsored by nike. his success was key in prompting the ioc to come up with its adjusted guidelines two years ago."}
{"original": "i was not perceived to be a threat to anybody, mosier says. no one expected me to be competitive. but there is an assumption that trans women will dominate in sports."}
{"original": "the adjusted guidelines said that athletes who transition from female to male, such as mosier, are eligible to compete without restriction. those guidelines also said that athletes who transition from male to female can compete with one year of hormone therapy to block testosterone and keep it at the specified threshold."}
{"original": "mckinnon says the ioc's testosterone cutoff of 10 nanomales per liter is arbitrary and there's no right way to measure it. she says some cisgender women have testosterone levels over the threshold and some cisgender men have levels below it."}
{"original": "so you can be a really tall cyclist and that's fine? mckinnon says. there are so many natural advantages someone could have physically that there is not a good argument for why singling out testosterone solves the problem."}
{"original": "the court of arbitration for sport is considering a case on the fairness of testosterone levels for intersex athletes — individuals who are female but develop some male characteristics, including high levels of testosterone. in 2014, the court suspended a testosterone rule of the iaaf, world governing body for track and field, citing a lack of scientific evidence about the degree of the advantage that women with high levels of testosterone have over their counterparts with normal levels."}
{"original": "there were no regulations in place at the 2016 olympic rio games and the same situation will apply to the upcoming 2018 pyeongchang olympic winter games, ioc spokesperson emmanuelle moreau told usa today sports by email. the court case is still ongoing and we have no timeline as to when it will be completed."}
{"original": "author roger pielke, in his book the edge: the war against cheating and corruption in the cutthroat world of elite sports performance, wrote: the role of naturally occurring testosterone in athletic performance is scientifically interesting, but it is inherently no more relevant to athletics policy than any other naturally occurring characteristic of the human athlete, man or woman."}
{"original": "joanna harper, chief medical physicist of radiation oncology at providence portland (ore.) medical center, has been an adviser to the ioc. she spoke before the court of arbitration in the intersex case and later put together a study in the journal of sporting cultures and identities in which she collected data from herself and seven other transgender runners who had transitioned and undergone hormone therapy. it found all of them were significantly slower in performance as females."}
{"original": "bearden also saw her times and performances decline drastically as a result of her hormone replacement therapy in 2015. a decade's worth of elite-level bike racing as a man faded once she transitioned to female and began the therapy."}
{"original": "people toss the word 'fair' around all the time, harper says. the fact of the matter is every athlete has advantages and disadvantages. but sporting bodies need to craft divisions that are equitable and meaningful. we let left-handed baseball players pitch when they might have some form of an advantage. on the other hand, we do not allow 200-pound boxers to fight 130-pound boxers."}

{"original": "people should trust the procedures that we have in place, coyle said friday at a news conference at williams arena. we have procedures that have been reviewed by outside agencies. we have procedures that people have focused on and worked on to a fault. those procedures include providing due process for everybody involved."}
{"original": "coyle declined to answer almost every question from reporters about the situation, citing federal and state student privacy laws."}
{"original": "minneapolis police are not investigating the alleged assault, police spokesman scott seroka said."}
{"original": "lynch's attorney, lee hutton, didn't respond to a phone and email messages from the associated press, and messages left at numbers believed to belong to lynch's parents also weren't returned."}
{"original": "this is the second eoaa investigation into allegations of sexual assault by lynch, who is in his final year of college eligibility. he was arrested on suspicion of sexually assaulting a 19-year-old woman in a campus apartment building on may 8, 2016, and suspended from the team during that offseason."}
{"original": "after the hennepin county attorney chose not to charge him and the eoaa investigation cleared him, he was reinstated in time for the 2016-17 season. the eoaa investigation concluded it was more likely than not that lynch reasonably believed the sex was consensual."}
{"original": "lynch transferred to minnesota after playing his first two years at illinois state and sitting out the 2015-2016 season per the ncaa's transfer rule. lynch, whose uncle, kevin lynch, was a star for the gophers from 1988-91, played at edina high school in the twin cities area."}
{"original": "we do a lot of background, head coach richard pitino said, and we never saw any red flags."}
{"original": "the gophers (13-3, 2-1 big ten) host indiana on saturday. having lost another key post player, eric curry, to a preseason knee injury, they'll have trouble replacing their starting center on the court. he's averaging 10 points, eight rebounds and four blocks per game. the 6-foot-10 lynch set the single-season record at minnesota in 2016-17 with 114 blocks."}
{"original": "pitino has had plenty of off-the-court trouble to deal with involving his program over five years with the gophers. three players, including current starting guards nate mason and dupree mcbrayer, were suspended late in the 2015-16 season for their involvement in a sex video posted briefly on the social media accounts of another player, kevin dorsey. mason and mcbrayer were reinstated in the offseason, and dorsey transferred."}
{"original": "i believe in what we're doing on and off the court, pitino said. we do our very best to educate."}

{"original": "for most nfl teams, the process of figuring out how to get better starts this week."}
{"original": "and every club — even the one that winds up winning the super bowl next month — will try to make upgrades during the offseason via free agency, the draft or trades."}
{"original": "teams are self-evaluating right now, said ted sundquist, the former general manager of the denver broncos, letting the owner know, 'this is where we think we're at. this is the direction that we're going to go. this is where we think we need to improve in order to get to the playoffs next year.' you have a firm understanding, having come out of week 17, where your holes are."}
{"original": "some teams need more help than others, of course. and some moves will work out better than others."}
{"original": "sometimes, the chips just fall the way they do, sundquist said, and your plan just gets blown up."}
{"original": "what's known is that there will be change."}
{"original": "when you finish the season in the national football league, you're probably dreaming if you think you're going to have the same exact roster back as you had a year ago, washington redskins coach jay gruden said. we're going to have a draft with new players. we're going to have free agents. we're going to lose some of our free agents."}
{"original": "reporters from the associated press who cover the nfl look at what each team's most pressing needs are:"}
{"original": "cowboys : de, cb — suspensions and injuries cast doubt over whether randy gregory and demarcus lawrence are long-term answers as pass rushers. cbs morris claiborne and brandon carr might not be back, so dallas could revisit 2012, when it signed carr in free agency and moved up in the draft to take claiborne."}
{"original": "giants : ol, qb — the running game has been bad for years and the offensive line could use plenty of help, especially at tackle. eli manning just turned 36, so it's time to find a real qb of the future."}
{"original": "redskins : dl, lb — didn't do much last offseason to upgrade their defensive line, which needs a run-stopper or two; only eight teams allowed more rushing yards. a starting linebacker, plus depth there, is also a must."}
{"original": "eagles : wr, cb — a topflight wideout, particularly a deep threat, is the most pressing need, because philadelphia only had one with 500 yards receiving. a starting cornerback is another priority."}
{"original": "falcons : dt — atlanta's biggest remaining hole is the interior defensive line, where jonathan babineaux is 35."}
{"original": "buccaneers : rb, wr — running back became a priority when doug martin was suspended for violating the nfl's policy on performance-enhancing substances. also needed: a receiver to take attention off mike evans."}
{"original": "saints : de, cb, lb — need another edge rusher to make teams pay for using multiple blockers on de cameron jordan. new orleans struggled with cb depth, while an upgrade over journeyman mlb craig robertson would help a struggling defense, too."}
{"original": "panthers : wr, ol — cam newton's numbers went from mvp-worthy to mediocre and part of the problem was a lack of help. carolina had just one receiver among the top 50 in catches. offensive tackle is an area of need, with michael oher's uncertain future and mike remmers' inconsistent play."}
{"original": "packers : cb, olb, rb — after a series of injuries at cornerback, stunting the development of damarious randall and quinten rollins, green bay needs someone at that position, along with help for the pass rush. also must figure out a plan at running back."}
{"original": "lions : ol, lb — detroit must do a better job of protecting qb matthew stafford and improving the running game, so a veteran to join an offensive line that started two rookies in 2016 would be a good start. could replace oft-injured lb deandre levy."}
{"original": "vikings : ol — the line failed to protect qb sam bradford at times and largely was responsible for the league's worst rushing offense (75.3 yards per game, 3.2 per carry). left guard alex boone and center joe berger are probably the only keepers."}
{"original": "bears : qb — whether or not jay cutler stays, chicago clearly needs its quarterback of the future."}
{"original": "seahawks : ol, rb — despite an overhaul last offseason, offensive line is still an issue. wouldn't hurt to add a running back to ease thomas rawls' load."}
{"original": "cardinals : cb, ol — the most glaring need is a db to play opposite patrick peterson. arizona needs help along the interior and depth for its offensive line."}
{"original": "rams : ol, wr — to help jared goff and todd gurley, improvement is needed along the mediocre line and throughout an unimpressive receiving corps."}
{"original": "49ers : qb — san francisco has plenty of needs, but none more important than quarterback after neither blaine gabbert nor colin kaepernick impressed this season. the only other qb on the roster is journeyman christian ponder, so the niners might add a couple."}
{"original": "patriots : de — after trading chandler jones in the offseason, then jamie collins in october, and with chris long a free agent, new england likely will want young talent to replenish the front seven."}
{"original": "dolphins : lb — kiko alonso was solid when healthy, but miami could use at least two linebackers after having trouble stopping the run and defending short passes over the middle. plus, injuries exposed a lack of depth."}
{"original": "bills : wr, s, qb — big holes at receiver, where buffalo needs someone opposite sammy watkins, and safety, where aaron williams' neck injury created problems. qb has been unsettled since jim kelly retired two decades ago."}
{"original": "jets : qb, cb, s — a roster overhaul starts at quarterback, where ryan fitzpatrick was a bust, geno smith got hurt, bryce petty was uninspiring before getting hurt, and christian hackenberg is a real project. with darrelle revis a shell of his shutdown self, new york's secondary could end up with four new starters."}
{"original": "texans : ot, qb — lt derek newton tore both patellar tendons on one play in october and it's unlikely he'll be ready for the start of next season, while duane brown is an unrestricted free agent after next season. houston could draft a qb after brock osweiler's poor season."}
{"original": "titans : cb, wr — cornerback is a glaring need, with jason mccourty finishing up his eighth season and perrish cox gone. tennessee could use a speedy wide receiver to stretch the field."}
{"original": "colts : pass rusher, cb — indianapolis needs someone to chase down qbs, thanks to robert mathis' retirement and trent cole's contract expiring. adding a cornerback to start opposite vontae davis also would help."}
{"original": "jaguars : ol — made strides along their offensive line, going from allowing 71 sacks in 2014, to 51 in 2015, to 34 this season. but if qb blake bortles is going to develop further, he needs more protection, so jacksonville should add at least one tackle and maybe two interior linemen."}
{"original": "steelers : lb — james harrison is 38 and isn't going to play forever. pittsburgh needs to develop a consistent pass rusher opposite bud dupree. lawrence timmons is set to become a free agent and former first-round pick jarvis jones not in the team's 2017 plans."}
{"original": "ravens : cb — a season-ending injury to jimmy smith left the ravens with journeyman shareece wright and rookie tavon young at the corners for the final three weeks."}
{"original": "bengals : ol, de — only six teams allowed more sacks. cincinnati expected first-round pick cedric ogbuehi to move into the right tackle spot, but he struggled, had his role reduced, and was benched. the defense is old, and the line struggled to generate pressure at times."}
{"original": "browns : qb — robert griffin iii got hurt in the opener, missed 11 games, returned, showed rust, then got hurt again. after skipping the chance to draft a top college quarterback last year, cleveland must get it right with one of its two top-10 picks."}
{"original": "chiefs : lb, wr — derrick johnson ruptured his achilles tendon; he already was in the twilight of his career. so finding a middle linebacker is crucial. and kansas city's seemingly endless search for offensive help means it'll eye a wideout to support jeremy maclin and tyreek hill."}
{"original": "raiders : lb — oakland could use a more dominant inside linebacker than perry riley jr. or malcolm smith to complement edge rushers khalil mack and bruce irvin."}
{"original": "broncos : ol — denver must refurbish its line for the second consecutive offseason. two free agents, russell okung and donald stephenson, didn't fare well. guards max garcia and ty sambrailo regressed. center matt paradis was bothered all season by bad hips."}
{"original": "chargers : owner — it won't happen, but fans have been clamoring for it as dean spanos appears to be leaning toward moving the team to los angeles. the chargers missed the playoffs for the sixth time in seven seasons — and were the only team to lose to the 1-15 browns."}

{"original": "carly evans never missed her weekly appointment with her therapist. she called it her maintenance – it kept everything in her life running smoothly."}
{"original": "that changed in september, when evans, a high school english and drama teacher and mother of three, found herself juggling an impossible burden: educating students in a pandemic while stewarding her own family through the crisis."}
{"original": "i wish i could say 'i'm handling it so well and am on it every day,' she said. i'm not."}
{"original": "evans' district in sudbury, massachusetts, has been operating since september on a hybrid model of teaching, so she splits her time between working on campus and remotely from home. her two youngest children, who are in second and third grade, need adult supervision with their own online schooling, a responsibility she splits with her mother, who lives with the family. (evans' husband, also a teacher, has to show up in-person for his job at a private school.)"}
{"original": "evans, 42, keeps a color-coded daily schedule to make sure nothing falls through the cracks. but, of course, things do. and top of the list? taking care of herself."}
{"original": "since september, evans said, she has canceled more therapist appointments than she has kept. with everything going on, she said, it's that much harder to justify giving myself that hour every week."}
{"original": "she isn't sleeping. before the pandemic, she suffered migraines every few months and called in sick on those days. now, she has one a week, an increase she attributes to stress. she makes herself work through the pain – there aren't enough substitute teachers to go around, and already, she said, i have so little time with her students. she's exhausted, she said, but she has to keep going."}
{"original": "you power through and do what you've got to do, she said. i keep telling my own children this is temporary. it doesn't feel like it, but it is."}
{"original": "since summer, experts have warned that the mental health of the nation's teachers – a category dominated 3-1 by women – could suffer when school resumed. that prediction appears to be bearing out. many say their psychological well-being is suffering in ways they've hardly ever experienced."}
{"original": "because of the pandemic, about three-fourths of the 100 largest school districts opted for complete remote learning, an october study found, and a little over a quarter of all districts began the year with a hybrid approach. but as covid-19 case counts climb, districts across the country have ricocheted from remote to in-person to hybrid models, and many that started with even a semblance of in-person learning have fallen back to remote education."}
{"original": "between the unpredictability, the isolation and the newfound challenges in reaching their students – who mental health experts worry are also struggling – what little mental health support is extended to teachers feels like nowhere near enough."}
{"original": "i spend all day staring at a screen and kind of generating enthusiasm into the void that zoom is, and i end the day so tired, and so done, and so frustrated, said emma wohl, a middle school teacher in washington state whose district has been fully remote this year. the moments of joy i used to have are so much more rare."}
{"original": "last august, the national education association, a major teachers union, found that 28% of educators said the pandemic made them more likely to leave teaching. a study from louisiana tracked early childhood educators' mental health last spring, finding that rates of depression almost doubled, with more than a third of those educators indicating depressive symptoms. in a survey from august to september by the national board for professional teaching standards, the vast majority of teachers reported working longer hours, and only a quarter said their school offered adequate support for mental health."}
{"original": "still, there is little data tracking depression or anxiety among teachers, especially over the past few months, meaning there's no clear picture of just how educators are faring. experts say all signs point to a crisis on par with the kind of trauma experienced after national disasters."}
{"original": "i saw that kind of level of strain and stress because of natural disasters creating havoc. i saw it after 9/11 in new york city. you see it after crises, said randi weingarten, president of the american federation of teachers, describing what she has heard from members of her union. the only time we've seen it on a sustained level like this is obviously when you had a war."}
{"original": "research shows that high stress can trigger symptoms of anxiety and depression. already, women were at greater risk for both conditions. as of the end of november, about 48% of all women exhibited symptoms of one such condition, an increase of 8 percentage points from this april and above what is normally seen, according to data collected by the federal centers for disease control and prevention. about 37% of men reported the same."}
{"original": "teachers have reached out to me and said, 'for the first time in my life i have to see a therapist,' said amy bintliff, an assistant teaching professor at ucla, who has been trying to track teacher mental health since the pandemic began."}
{"original": "but therapists covered by teachers' insurance plans may not have evening hours, and they don't necessarily have the time – or spare money – for weekly appointments."}
{"original": "there are access issues to mental health services, bintliff said."}
{"original": "it's a theme that has emerged repeatedly since march, said laura wangsness willemsen and elisheva cohen, two researchers who have been tracking teachers since the coronavirus pandemic began, focusing on a cohort of elementary school teachers in minnesota. their research didn't initially focus on mental health, they said, until teachers kept bringing up the topic on their own."}
{"original": "the level of stress isn't sustainable, they said. teachers have been operating in crisis mode since spring. by now, any surge of energy that fueled them through the pandemic's initial months has been depleted."}
{"original": "we see a deeper exhaustion going into the school year, and that hasn't resolved, wangsness willemsen said."}
{"original": "the sources of stress and fatigue are complex. many teachers have had to switch back and forth between in-person and online learning, often with only a few days' notice."}
{"original": "evans said she has heard as late as saturday that a recent student exposure to covid-19 means her monday lesson is switching from in-person to virtual. she used to plan her lessons out a month in advance but now gives herself only a week at a time. it's simply not worth the chance that she may have to change things at the last minute."}
{"original": "teaching from home is also a fundamentally different exercise, one that is simultaneously more invasive but also lonelier. students on zoom lessons often have their cameras off and microphones muted, making it harder to engage or connect with them. normally, teachers can rely on their colleagues for consistent emotional support in quick lunch room chats. that sort of spontaneous support isn't an option right now."}
{"original": "the challenges are greater for mothers. research has shown that in many families, moms are more often the ones supervising a child's virtual education. teachers experience that dynamic two times over – instructing their students virtually while also working as the primary parent to ensure that their own children don't fall behind in their own distance learning."}
{"original": "every mom i know is holding all of the weight, said erin herda, a middle school ethnic studies teacher and mother of two in washington state. i'm still the one monitoring all (my daughter's) online dance classes and then having to throw tantrums to get other people to do chores. that definitely impacts my mental health, and my children's, when i have to throw tantrums."}
{"original": "herda's younger daughter, who is 8, frequently comes to her for help with assignments – often while herda is in the middle of a zoom session with her own students. we've had to learn how to work with accepting those moments, and just say this is what it means to be working from home, she said."}
{"original": "and all the while, many teachers carry the knowledge that their students – who often rely on in-person school for meals or for social support – are struggling, too. research has shown that teachers' mental health declines when their students are doing poorly."}
{"original": "districts and teachers unions have put forth benefits and programs meant to help support teachers' psychological well-being. american federation of teachers launched a trauma benefit this year, which includes counseling for teachers who have experienced events including infection by contagious disease or major disaster. there are mental health webinars, wellness town halls and even online yoga."}
{"original": "in practice, though, it's all scratching at the surface. the trauma benefit has been used by some teachers, weingarten said, but not as much as she had hoped, which she attributes to stigma against recognizing mental health problems and a lack of awareness that the resource exists."}
{"original": "for teachers who are stretched thin, those kinds of offerings provide little recourse. they require time and energy, which are in short supply."}
{"original": "i don't want to go to a webinar to think about my mental health, wohl said. in my (school) building, people try to organize a get-together after school, but it's over zoom, and i'm done with zoom for the day."}
{"original": "other resources that might once have been available, and that could have provided some relief – calling in sick, for instance, if a teacher is feeling physically ill or needs a mental health day – are no longer tenable, teachers said."}
{"original": "in many districts, there simply aren't enough substitute teachers to meet the need. substitutes are typically retired teachers, and for districts using any hybrid or in-person model, the risk of coronavirus exposure poses a heightened threat. and especially in a pandemic that is straining everyone's mental health, teachers said, the chance to actually see one's students is too precious to abandon."}
{"original": "these kids, they only get to come so much of the time, and they want to see me. they don't want to see a sub, evans said."}
{"original": "for schools that are remote, getting a substitute set up for online learning poses its own set of logistical challenges – getting a zoom, transferring it over, making sure the substitute is comfortable navigating online learning software. for many, that burden factors in when determining whether to call in sick."}
{"original": "herda took one day off in october, and it was more stress than imaginable, she said. her district still hasn't developed a clear system for arranging substitute teachers over video chat. so she had to alert human resources, tech support and her principal a week in advance of her absence. and still, she was fielding questions from the school on her supposed day away."}
{"original": "with that in mind, she said, the idea of taking a day off for mental health is difficult to conceive."}
{"original": "i don't feel confident there's any measures in place that would help make sure my students have anything guaranteed to help them, that would take the pressure off of me, she said. it would still rely on me doing all of the work even if i was very sick."}
{"original": "meanwhile, federal support has lagged. outlining his own health agenda, president-elect joe biden vowed to make it safe for schools to reopen by the end of his first 100 days in office – assuming congress and state and local governments took measures to support school teachers and to curb the coronavirus spread."}
{"original": "but those are tremendous assumptions and promise a safe return to the classroom only when the school year has almost ended. news of a vaccine could offer some hope that, even if things are bad now, they will eventually improve. a top cdc panel, the advisory committee on immunization practices, has recommended that teachers be part of the next wave of americans vaccinated, meaning they could be immunized by some time in february."}
{"original": "but for many, it feels too far away to really make a difference, especially as winter looms."}
{"original": "it's like that trauma response where you cannot look forward. you just live day to day, herda said. that's the way i'm making it through."}
{"original": "u.s. officials tuesday formally named russia as the likely source of a massive, ongoing cyber attack that has compromised key government and private sector systems across the country."}
{"original": "a joint statement issued by the fbi, department of homeland security and director of national intelligence and national security agency characterized the hacking campaign as likely russian in origin and responsible for perhaps all of the recently discovered compromises of public and private networks."}
{"original": "at this time, we believe this was, and continues to be, an intelligence gathering effort, officials said in an acknowledgment that the attack is continuing weeks after the breach was made public. we are taking all necessary steps to understand the full scope of this campaign and respond accordingly."}
{"original": "the public attribution to russia is the most definitive accounting yet after separate statements last month by secretary of state mike pompeo and then-attorney general william barr who both pointed to the kremlin. barr left the administration dec. 23."}
{"original": "president donald trump, meanwhile, has sought to downplay the breach while suggesting that china was to blame for the attack. trump has accused the news media of inflating the seriousness of the hacks and has repeatedly deflected blame from russia, undermining his own administration's warning last month that the attacks posed a grave risk to government networks and the private sector."}
{"original": "pompeo: russia 'pretty clearly' behind cyberattack on us, but trump casts doubts and downplays threat"}
{"original": "cyber attack:private sector, infrastructure, all levels of government at risk"}
{"original": "although federal authorities have so far traced the attack's launch back to march, it remains unclear just how long operatives have been lurking in some of the government's most critical agencies – including the departments of state, homeland security, treasury and commerce – and what may have been lost or compromised."}
{"original": "the u.s. has said the hackers employed sophisticated tactics not seen in past intrusions, complicating efforts to eliminate the threat."}
{"original": "the attackers penetrated federal computer systems through a popular piece of server software offered through a company called solarwinds."}
{"original": "the threat apparently came from the same cyberespionage campaign that has afflicted cybersecurity firm fireeye, foreign governments and major corporations."}
{"original": "the system is used by hundreds of thousands of organizations globally, including most fortune 500 companies and multiple u.s. federal agencies, which are now scrambling to patch their networks."}
{"original": "of the approximately 18,000 affected public and private sector customers of solarwinds' orion products, a much smaller number has been compromised by follow-on activity on their systems, federal officials said in the tuesday statement. we have so far identified fewer than 10 u.s. government agencies that fall into this category, and are working to identify the non-government entities who also may be impacted."}
{"original": "this is a serious compromise that will require a sustained and dedicated effort to remediate, the officials said."}
{"original": "the russian government did not immediately respond."}
{"original": "senate intelligence committee vice chairman mark warner said the administration's statement was slow in coming."}
{"original": "it's unfortunate that it has taken over three weeks after the revelation of an intrusion this significant for this administration to finally issue a tentative attribution, warner said. i would hope that we will begin to see something more definitive, along with a more public pronouncement of u.s. policy towards indiscriminate supply chain infiltrations of this sort in the future."}
{"original": "we need to make clear to russia that any misuse of compromised networks to produce destructive or harmful effects is unacceptable and will prompt an appropriately strong response, he said."}
{"original": "president donald trump, in response to reports that the fbi began an investigation of him last year to find out whether he had a clandestine agenda to help russia, said saturday that former fbi director james comey and other losers at the bureau tried to do a number on your president."}
{"original": "he called comey a total sleaze and crooked cop. the president also took swipes at special counsel robert mueller and the new york times, which broke the story friday night. my firing of james comey was a great day for america, he tweeted."}
{"original": "comey responded saturday morning in a tweet that quoted president franklin d. roosevelt: i ask you to judge me by the enemies i have made."}
{"original": "the newspaper said the decision to investigate trump himself was an aggressive move by fbi officials confronting the chaotic aftermath of the firing of comey and enduring the president's verbal assaults on the russia investigation as a witch hunt."}
{"original": "cnn reported that counterintelligence agents were investigating why trump was acting in ways that seemed to benefit russia."}
{"original": "both news organizations said trump's firing of comey was a major factor prompting the fbi to take action."}
{"original": "although the report was published friday night and prompted a sharp response from white house press secretary sarah sanders, trump did not weigh in until 7:05 a.m saturday."}
{"original": "wow, just learned in the failing new york times that the corrupt former leaders of the fbi, almost all fired or forced to leave the agency for some very bad reasons, opened up an investigation on me, for no reason & with no proof, after i fired lyin' james comey, a total sleaze!"}
{"original": "in a series of tweets, he said the fbi was in complete turmoil at the time because of comey's poor leadership and his handling of an investigation of democratic presidential nominee hillary clinton."}
{"original": "my firing of james comey was a great day for america, trump tweeted. he was a crooked cop...........who is being totally protected by his best friend, bob mueller, & the 13 angry democrats..."}
{"original": "he singled out several fbi agents in his five-part tweetstorm."}
{"original": "lyin' james comey, andrew mccabe, peter s and his lover, agent lisa page, & more, all disgraced and/or fired and caught in the act. these are just some of the losers that tried to do a number on your president, he tweeted. part of the witch hunt. remember the 'insurance policy?' this is it!"}
{"original": "trump was referring to charges that some fbi agents, among them mccabe, peter strzok and page, a colleague he was intimately involved with, were part of a conspiracy to undermine the president."}
{"original": "addressing the russia aspect of the times report, trump said he had been far tougher on russia than obama, bush or clinton. maybe tougher than any other president."}
{"original": "he repeated his long held contention that getting along with russia is a good thing, not a bad thing."}
{"original": "later saturday, trump blasted the new york times article in a telephone interview with fox news host jeanine pirro,"}
{"original": "i think it's the most insulting thing i've ever been asked, he said. i think it's the most insulting article i've ever had written, and if you read the article you'll see that they found absolutely nothing."}
{"original": "sanders said in her statement friday night that comey was fired for just cause and that trump has never favored russia."}
{"original": "this is absurd. james comey was fired because he's a disgraced partisan hack, and his deputy andrew mccabe, who was in charge at the time, is a known liar fired by the fbi. unlike president obama, who let russia and other foreign adversaries push america around, president trump has actually been tough on russia."}
{"original": "the obstruction probe was an idea the fbi had previously considered, but it didn't start until comey was fired, cnn reported. the justification went beyond trump's firing of comey, cnn said, according to its sources, and included the president's conversation with comey in the oval office asking him to drop the investigation into his former national security adviser michael flynn."}
{"original": "trump insisted last year that he didn't fire fbi director james comey because of the russia investigation, despite video and documentary evidence to the contrary, including a key interview with nbc news."}
{"original": "i was going to fire comey knowing there was no good time to do it, he told nbc anchor lester holt. and in fact, when i decided to just do it, i said to myself — i said, you know, this russia thing with trump and russia is a made-up story. it's an excuse by the democrats for having lost an election that they should've won."}
{"original": "not that it matters but i never fired james comey because of russia! trump tweeted shortly after the firing. the corrupt mainstream media loves to keep pushing that narrative, but they know it is not true!"}

{"original": "pittsburgh (ap) — ben roethlisberger wasn't being cruel or unnecessarily harsh. the pittsburgh steelers quarterback had just seen enough — or not enough, to be accurate — out of wide receiver martavis bryant that he felt it was time to speak up."}
{"original": "two weeks and two largely listless performances on the eve of the playoffs isn't what roethlisberger wanted to see out of the remarkably talented if still occasionally inconsistent bryant. so roethlisberger issued what he called a challenge during his radio show on tuesday, saying it was time for bryant to toughen up."}
{"original": "there was no edge in roethlisberger's voice as he repeated it in so many words on wednesday as the steelers (10-6) prepare for a trip to cincinnati on saturday night in the wild-card round."}
{"original": "i just felt like we need him, roethlisberger said. i love that guy like a little brother and just wanted him to know we needed him to step up."}
{"original": "something that — when it happens — gives pittsburgh arguably the best trio of receivers in the nfl in bryant, all-pro antonio brown and markus wheaton. brown is the record-setting road-runner and perennial pro bowler. wheaton is the versatile everyman and bryant is perhaps the most athletically gifted of the bunch. his 6-foot-3 frame and seemingly effortless speed make him a matchup nightmare for opponents."}
{"original": "they do, anyway, when bryant is engaged and on the field. he spent most of last sunday's win over cleveland on the sideline with what coach mike tomlin called a minor neck injury but could also have doubled as a momentary benching after bryant — who was slowed all week by an illness — was beat out by browns defensive back jordan poyer for a roethlisberger pass in the first quarter."}
{"original": "oftentimes, when young guys don't get an opportunity to practice, they lack a little detail in play, tomlin said."}

{"original": "i'm still balling, bryant said. you have your ups and you have your downs. it's about how you bounce back. i'm going to be ready to go."}
{"original": "good thing, because the steelers need him with the running game almost certainly limited. deangelo williams sat out practice on wednesday to undergo treatment on his injured right foot, leaving the running game in the largely inexperienced hands of fitzgerald toussaint and jordan todman."}
{"original": "to win in cincinnati for the 15th time in 18 tries, pittsburgh will have to do it on roethlisberger's right arm, one that has developed a fondness for chucking it deep to bryant and letting bryant — lovingly referred to as an alien by some — be bryant."}
{"original": "bryant was a supernova when thrust into the starting lineup in week 7 as a rookie. he scored eight times in 10 games, including a 94-yard sprint against the bengals that helped kickstart pittsburgh's run to the afc north title. he missed the first five games of this season — four while serving a suspension for violating the league's substance abuse policy and another after getting nicked up when he returned to practice — only to make another dazzling entrance. he caught a pair of second-half touchdowns from landry jones to ignite a rally against arizona on oct. 18 and went over 100 yards in romps over cleveland and indianapolis."}
{"original": "all of which made his lethargic play of late all the more frustrating to roethlisberger, who communicated frequently with bryant during the receiver's suspension."}
{"original": "roethlisberger called bryant after calling him out over the air, a conversation bryant insisted would remain between he and his quarterback. not that it matters. consider the message received."}

{"original": "former milwaukee chief edward flynn and newark public safety director anthony ambrose urged a reporter to consider the demographics of the victims of crime."}
{"original": "newark provided figures that show in 2019, the victims and suspects of murders, aggravated assaults and robberies were usually black people, who make up just under half the city's population."}
{"original": "the standard forms new jersey police use to track pursuits don't record the race of a suspect, making it difficult to know if there's a racial disparity in the pursuits that don't end with a death."}
{"original": "murder victims were 92 percent black people and 97 percent of murder suspects were black. at least 60 percent of aggravated assault victims and suspects were black. robbery victims were more evenly split — 40 percent black to 37 percent white. robbery suspects were black 70 percent of the time."}
{"original": "newark isn't the only city where crime disproportionately involves black people."}
{"original": "data provided by atlanta police department — a city with a proportion of black residents two percentage points greater than newark— shows a rate similar to newark for black murder victims (87 percent) and suspects (94 percent) and a higher percentage of black people involved in aggravated assaults in 2019. atlanta aggravated assault victims were 87 percent black, and 94 percent of the people arrested for assault were black."}
{"original": "atlanta's violent crime numbers are similar to detroit, a city with a black population 28 percentage points greater than newark. more than 90 percent of the victims and perpetrators of aggravated assault and murder were black in 2019, data provided by detroit shows."}

{"original": "members of the newark police division do not arrest for race, ambrose said in an emailed statement. we make arrests to equally protect the citizens of newark, without consideration of the race of the perpetrator."}
{"original": "data compiled by the network shows that on top of a huge racial disparity in pursuit deaths, newark's chases in the last decade are among the least effective in the state: just under half the pursuits ended with arrests, about 40 percent caused crashes and about 18 percent caused injuries."}
{"original": "a 10-year look at police pursuits does not paint an accurate picture of our policies over the last few years, when we changed strategies to protect the public, ambrose said in the statement."}
{"original": "newark's policy on pursuits was last updated in 2017, adding restrictions on the reasons officers can chase cars — no chasing stolen cars and no chasing people just because they fled from police."}
{"original": "newark cops initiated many fewer pursuits in 2017 and 2018 compared to years before. there were fewer crashes and injuries, but still at least three deaths."}
{"original": "the pursuits also became less effective, ending with more crashed cars than arrested suspects."}

{"original": "supervisors play a huge role in pursuits, said joseph blaettler, former union city deputy chief. and that's part of the reason why cops, as soon as they get into a pursuit, they have to call it out. the supervisor has to monitor the pursuit."}

{"original": "wilmington, del. — the sept. 24 fire in a canby park rowhome will go down in wilmington as one of the most traumatic events in city history. the tragedy ultimately took the lives of three firefighters and injured four more, leaving the department and community reeling."}
{"original": "in the days that followed, city officials realized they had another very serious problem, said mayor mike purzycki."}
{"original": "because of a decision made in the 1980s, wilmington had no insurance to cover workers' compensation costs. now, the city has to pay an estimated $9 million or more out of pocket to cover health care costs for firefighters injured in the blaze, purzycki told the news journal."}
{"original": "officials have no idea how high costs could go. the city is still receiving hospital bills old and new, purzycki said. firefighter brad speakman, who spent 41 days in the burn unit at chester-crozer medical center, requires continued care and may need skin grafts and plastic surgery."}
{"original": "it's a horrific disaster and tragedy for these families, purzycki said. we'll work through the finances."}
{"original": "the workers' compensation coverage the city owes is different from the life insurance policies covering the firefighters who died. the firefighters who lost their lives are covered. the cost for treating the injured could equal about 7% of the city's entire $154 million budget."}
{"original": "it's hard to imagine we won't have a deficit, purzycki said."}
{"original": "the city has insurance policies that cover lawsuits brought by employees and residents, damage to city-owned properties and even for fire department boats. yet it has no outside policy to guard against the possible costs of health care for public safety personnel injured on the job."}
{"original": "this has apparently been the case for decades. the city has been self-insured since the late 1980s, according to the mayor's office."}
{"original": "there's the risk manager, the finance department, the auditor, the human resources director. who's supposed to be in charge of this? asked city councilwoman loretta walsh, chair of the public safety committee. how did it slip through so many fingers?"}
{"original": "now the new mayor is faced with a challenge."}
{"original": "when you're trying to put together a financial plan for the city and all a sudden you find yourself with a $7 to $9 million liability, it's unsettling, purzycki said. it certainly wasn't something we anticipated."}
{"original": "firefighters ardythe hope and speakman were both critically injured the blaze. the fire –– which police allege was intentionally set by beatriz fana-ruiz, an intoxicated and unstable resident, according to police –– burned over 70 percent of hope's body and over 30 percent of speakman's body. hope succumbed to her injuries weeks later."}
{"original": "three other injured firefighters, john crawthray, terrance tate and peter cramer, were treated at christiana care medical center. the city is absorbing the cost of each individual's fire-related health care. capt. christopher leach and lt. jerry fickes died fighting the rowhome fire."}
{"original": "under the 2008 workers compensation reform law, delaware and participating out-of-state hospitals treating workers' compensation injuries may only charge up to 80% of their usual charges, said john rago, purzycki's deputy chief of staff for policy and communications."}
{"original": "but delaware has no facilities to treat serious burn victims, and crozer-chester medical center, where hope and speakman were treated, does not participate in the discount program."}
{"original": "the city hired a third-party consultant, pma management corp., to negotiate the price down with crozer-chester, rago said. the consultant secured a 15% discount on the initial hospital bill for a total of $3,470,867.22 on nov. 14 and a 22.5% discount on the second payment of $2,671,951.99 on dec. 18, rago said. recent specialist bills, due at the end of this month, will be discounted 32%, rago said."}
{"original": "2 firefighters killed in delaware blaze"}
{"original": "pma is entitled to 35% any cost savings they negotiate, rago said, but due to this extraordinary situation and the exorbitant bills, they have limited their charges to $10,000 per invoice."}
{"original": "the mayor said his office is trying to find out who established the workers'comp plan and when."}
{"original": "what we have to understand is the thinking that went into not having any protection at all for potential liability like this, purzycki said. we may find this was a decision made 30 years ago and no one ever changed it. we still have a lot of questions."}
{"original": "purzycki has been advised that catastrophic loss coverage, a workers'comp umbrella policy, would cost about $350,000 to $400,000 a year. the canby park fire was the first fatal fire in the city in almost two decades. because of the rarity of such severe fires in wilmington, purzycki said, it's possible that the city took a chance by forgoing coverage for the injured."}
{"original": "we'd never had anything like that happen before so even though we might have a large expense this year, on an ongoing basis, we would've come out ahead, he said."}

{"original": "without conducting an analysis of its claims history and insurance rates in the past, city officials couldn't say this week whether they would have saved more money with or without insurance."}
{"original": "city auditor earl jeter said his office conducted an audit of risk management for the first time in 2016 but did not review workers'compensation. he said the huge amount of money the city is paying could inspire another review."}
{"original": "that's something that we might be thinking about in the near future, he said."}
{"original": "al greto, founder of the delaware and pennsylvania law firm gretolaw, said it's not necessarily a bad idea to forgo insurance. he said he would expect an actuary to investigate the city's claims history and the costs of insurance before making that decision."}
{"original": "insurance companies are in the business of collecting more premiums than paying out claims,' he said. maybe the city is cutting out the middleman and this time the numbers didn't work out, but over time, they could."}
{"original": "douglas s. kerr, the risk manager for baltimore, md., said wilmington's choice not to insure is one made by many municipalities. baltimore is 100% self-insured, he said."}
{"original": "we looked at the marketplace to determine if insurance was the right way to go, he said. we felt it better off being self-insured."}
{"original": "philadelphia's risk manager, barry scott, said the same. philly is self-insured, he said, and the city is prepared to absorb worker's compensation costs if claims arise."}
{"original": "it's a matter of weighing the risks and the costs, he said."}
{"original": "the city's risk management committee is comprised of the administrative assistant to the mayor, the city solicitor, the finance director, the city treasurer and two city council members, according to the city code. the group is supposed to review the risk management program at least annually, the code states."}
{"original": "purzycki said he is looking forward. he is considering obtaining high-deductible insurance coverage for worker's compensation expenses and other cost-containment measures."}
{"original": "we're not trying to blame anybody, he said. we're going department by department and reviewing every policy, every procedure, every expectation. we're reimagining the way the city works."}
{"original": "the city has already paid about $6 million of the bills from cash on hand, purzycki said, but when the fiscal year ends in june, officials will have to reconcile the costs."}
{"original": "the mayor said he isn't prepared to comment on whether he will raise taxes until he establishes a comprehensive spending and funding plan."}
{"original": "it doesn't help my 2018 budget, purzycki said. it's very likely we'll have a liability to carry forward."}

{"original": "anyone who knows how this will all shake out is lying. they don't. but the commander in chief took out the world's most notorious terrorist, one with plenty of american blood on his hands. trump is the good guy here, not the terrorist."}

{"original": "here's a pro tip: if your statement has a but in the middle (i'm looking at you, elizabeth warren), just eliminate the throat-clearing, political pablum that came before it and say what you really mean. we get it: iranian guy bad, orange man worse."}
{"original": "this attitude will cost democrats in the upcoming election. not just on foreign policy, but across the board (they speak of the economy as though we are in another great depression). they just can't give trump an inch no matter how safe or prosperous the world is, thanks at least in part to the president's decisions."}
{"original": "it hasn't always been this way. after the death of osama bin laden, republicans praised obama's decision to get him."}

{"original": "but no such allowance is given to president trump when he kills a terrorist. as commentator guy benson tweeted, the u.s. auto industry is alive, and (abu bakr) baghdadi/soleimani are dead, referencing the islamic state leader trump had killed a few months ago and recalling obama's reelection slogan."}

{"original": "i won't belabor the point, the quality of the work was poor. we did a bad job, poppell said, adding that a quality assurance team has since analyzed dcf's choices at every step in the process. each one of those (cases) may have a dozen decision points along the way. the overall review indicated in those cases, roughly half the time on all those decisions, we made the wrong one."}
{"original": "usa today's two-part investigation, published in october and december, revealed that after florida lawmakers rewrote the state's child welfare rules in 2014 to make it easier to seize children from their parents, thousands of kids flooded the foster care system. faced with a shortage of foster parents, dcf sent some children to live in unsafe homes where they were physically and sexually abused."}

{"original": "to prevent future missteps, dcf will expand its crisis incident rapid response team, originally established to investigate child deaths, to evaluate the agency's work in cases that involve accusations of sexual abuse against foster parents, poppell said. experts will review those cases, offer corrective feedback and provide a recommendation on whether a child should be returned to a home where abuse was alleged."}

{"original": "yet by 2017, the state needed space for 6,000 more foster kids, usa today's investigation found. foster care agencies crammed kids into overcrowded homes and sent nearly 200 to foster parents previously accused of abusing or neglecting the kids in their care. dcf also failed to address biological parents' lack of access to drug treatment, mental health care, or domestic violence services – the root problems driving child removals."}
{"original": "the number of children removed from their parents each month has fallen back down to pre-2014 levels but remains higher than the national average, poppell said. abuse of children in foster care has been in decline since 2007, and florida's numbers are below the federal target."}

{"original": "the gamecocks (14-3, 4-0 sec) are among three teams undefeated in league play with kentucky (15-2) and florida (14-3) the others, both 5-0."}
{"original": "i think the guys will be excited, gamecocks coach frank martin said."}
{"original": "it's been a season of runs for south carolina centered about thornwell's presence on the court."}
{"original": "the gamecocks opened 7-0 including wins over ranked opponents in michigan and syracuse to enter the rankings. but when thornwell, their 6-foot-5 senior, was suspended on dec. 4 for an undisclosed violation of athletic department policy, south carolina showed cracks in its cohesiveness."}
{"original": "the gamecocks went 3-3 without thornwell — the losses coming to ncaa tournament hopefuls seton hall, clemson and memphis — and lacked a steadying hand to pull them through in difficult situations."}
{"original": "but thornwell was reinstated before league play began earlier this month and has revitalized the team. he has led south carolina in scoring (16.8 points) and rebounding (7.8) in their four sec wins along with having 17 of the team's 40 steals so far in conference play."}
{"original": "martin said playing hard has been a hallmark of his team much of the season and does not expect his players to approach the gators and wildcats much differently than they have the rest of their schedule."}
{"original": "you don't play as hard as we do without being excited for every game, martin said."}
{"original": "thornwell and the gamecocks carry the motivation of last year's ncaa near miss. south carolina finished with a program best 24 wins in the regular season and went 11-7 in sec play, just its fourth season of double-digit league wins in 25 conference seasons."}
{"original": "but south carolina was edged out of the field of 68, even getting an inadvertent text from an ncaa staffer about its inclusion before it was corrected and disappointment set in."}
{"original": "we don't want to feel that way again, thornwell says."}
{"original": "south carolina's surge is built on defense. the gamecocks lead the sec in points allowed (59.2 points per game) this season and thornwell, last year's sec defensive player of the year, leads in steals during conference play."}
{"original": "thornwell said mastering martin's defensive concepts is a task in itself that does not always come easily. it used to be that when the man you're guarding passed the ball, thornwell said, you could get a few moments of rest and re-engage once your guy got back into the play or a shot went up. under martin, the gamecocks must stay in line pressuring their man and defending hard without the ball in sight."}
{"original": "it's like re-learning basketball, thornwell said."}
{"original": "martin won't have much to say to pump up his team this week. florida and kentucky have dominated south carolina much like they've dominated the sec the past two decades. the gators have gone 27-7 over south carolina since 1999. the wildcats are 30-7 in that same time frame."}

{"original": "indeed, at the time of world war ii, although the supreme court's jurisprudence on equal protection had not evolved to where it applied to the federal government, there were separate — and widely acknowledged — constitutional problems with the internment that many recognized. specifically, attorney general francis biddle and secretary of war henry l. stimson, both harvard-trained lawyers, counseled that the detention of u.s. citizens would clearly violate the constitution's suspension clause."}
{"original": "that clause guarantees that the privilege of the writ ofhabeas corpus may not be suspended unless when in cases of rebellion or invasion the public safety may require it. the habeas privilege had long been understood to mean that in the absence of a valid suspension, the government could not detain citizens and others arguably protected by domestic law without filing criminal charges. president lincoln even believed that a suspension was necessary to detain confederate soldiers who waged war against the union."}
{"original": "roosevelt nonetheless issued 9066 and in it granted the military, in the words of one senior war department official, carte blanche to do what it wanted. when legal challenges to the military regulations eventually spilled into the courts, the supreme court deferred extensively to executive branch assertions that such policies were necessary for national security. first, the court upheld the military's curfew and exclusion regulations in the hirabayashi and korematsu cases, and even called into question the ability of japanese americans to assimilate into american society."}
{"original": "then, when a direct challenge to the internment came before the court in ex parte endo, the court did rule against the government — but its opinion did not even discuss the important constitutional issues at stake. instead, it narrowly interpreted the relevant military regulations in a way that misunderstood those issues. the court then held up its decision until after the 1944 election and tipped off the white house so that it could pre-empt the decision by announcing the closing of the camps."}

{"original": "what happened during world war ii suggests that judicial deference to the executive on national security matters — even in wartime — can be very dangerous. it likewise counsels that internal checks within the political branches can fail when concerns over national security may overrun constitutional considerations. after all, in sanctioning and later defending the military policies directed at japanese americans, government actors ignored the legal advice of key advisers within the executive branch as well as the recognition of many prominent officials — including no less than fbi director j. edgar hoover — that the factual basis for the military regulations that followed under 9066 was dubious."}
{"original": "more generally, the lessons of world war ii raise fundamental questions about the judicial role in a constitutional democracy. by deferring to the government in the hirabayashi and korematsu cases, the court announced decisions that we now routinely teach to law students as the embarrassments that they are. but none of the decisions has been overruled, leaving as their larger and inescapable legacy a historical precedent sanctioning racial and ethnic discrimination among our ranks, gutting the suspension clause, and upholding a policy of mass incarceration under military auspices."}
{"original": "these events should prove a cautionary tale. as the supreme court reviews the latest iteration of the travel ban, it bears remembering that its deference to the executive during world war ii and unwillingness to confront the constitutional problems raised by the japanese-american internment led the court down a path that we now view as anything but its finest hour."}

{"original": "indianapolis (ap) — linebacker d'qwell jackson became the first cost-cutting loss of the indianapolis colts' offseason."}
{"original": "he probably won't be the last."}
{"original": "new general manager chris ballard made his first significant move thursday, releasing the 33-year-old defensive signal-caller as the colts attempt to rebuild their struggling defense."}
{"original": "d'qwell is a consummate professional, coach chuck pagano said in a release issued by team officials. the way he approaches the game is second to none. his leadership and mentorship provided a valuable example for the younger players on this team. we are grateful for all of his contributions to the organization and wish him the best."}
{"original": "jackson was a three-year starter for the colts and had one year remaining on the four-year contract he signed in 2014."}
{"original": "he led the team in tackles in each of his first two seasons and finished second last season despite being suspended the final four games for violating the nfl's performance-enhancing substance policy."}
{"original": "but releasing jackson will save indy $5.5 million under the salary cap and will allow to either bring in a younger player with more upside or go with two players, edwin jackson and antonio morrison, who filled in after jackson was suspended."}
{"original": "it's a decision that could be a precursor of what's to come."}
{"original": "franchise sacks leader robert mathis already has announced his retirement. linebackers trent cole and erik walden and safety mike adams, all in their 30s, could become free agents next month. and if ballard releases oft-injured defensive lineman art jones and cornerback patrick robinson, the colts could clear another $7.6 million."}
{"original": "if all of those moves occur, ballard would have an opportunity to turn one of the league's older defenses into one of the younger ones virtually overnight."}
{"original": "when ballard was introduced to local reporters on jan. 30, he made it clear that's where he intends to focus initially."}
{"original": "defense wins championships, he said. that definitely is a priority and that's probably why i have such respect for chuck because he is a defensive head coach."}
{"original": "jackson was cleveland's second-round draft pick in 2006 and played seven seasons with the browns before joining the colts."}

{"original": "he played with tiger woods for the first time. kizzire was so nervous on the opening tee shot at the honda classic that he hooked it into a palmetto bush and had to go back to the tee. he had rounds of 74-78 to miss the cut."}

{"original": "every single item on the golf course will be touched, said alex nakajima, general manager for golf and tennis at kapalua."}
{"original": "coore was delighted to hear the grass kapalua chose is celebration bermuda, which he said was key to making the plantation course play how it's intended — fast. the last several years, the course has played soft. previously, the 4-iron gary woodland hit into the 18th green would not have stopped rolling until it was on the green. coore recalls telling one resort guest years ago to hit a club he normally hits 150 yards to the seventh green, even though he had 250 yards. it rolled to the green."}
{"original": "mark rolfing, a tv golf analyst who has lived at kapalua from the start, summed it up best."}

{"original": "one problem is what to do about world ranking points because of the staggered start."}

{"original": "the tour already has presented a proposal to the official world golf ranking board, and a decision could come as early as april."}
{"original": "one scenario that makes the most sense is to keep score where everyone starts even, like a regular tournament, and award points accordingly."}
{"original": "more than leaving the flagstick in for putts on the green, the one new rule that got plenty of chatter in the first tournament of the year was the knee-length drop."}
{"original": "a bit absurd, bryson dechambeau said."}
{"original": "the question is how much attention it gets in a month."}
{"original": "the reason for the change from shoulder length was to get the ball in play. the original proposal was to drop it an inch above the ground, which was changed to eliminate any questions whether the ball was dropped or placed. some rules experts felt it was important to retain a randomness of the drop."}
{"original": "the trouble at kapalua was how it looked, with players at times looking like ballerinas trying to make sure the drop was level to their knees."}
{"original": "i think the optics will become more comfortable over time, said thomas pagel, senior managing director of governance for the usga. think about what it was like at first when we went to shoulder height instead of dropping it over the back."}
{"original": "for the first time since 1999 at kapalua, players had to walk the steep hill to the fourth fairway at the sentry tournament of champions. previously, they were given rides in carts to the crest of the hill."}
{"original": "for starters, it has to do with a tour policy of only one person in a cart for insurance reasons. that's why the tour has four- and six-seat carts handy whenever there is a playoff. mostly, however, it was because there were not enough carts to go around."}
{"original": "most of the carts were used for the long shuttle between the ninth green and the 10th tee, not so much for players and caddies but the players' friends and relatives who wanted rides, along with the walking scorer, standard-bearer and other support staff."}
{"original": "amazingly, no one pulled a hamstring."}
{"original": "equally amazing is why the players were given rides up the hill in the first place. it was in 2000, and described by one pga tour executive as a pace of play issue (with a 30-man field), and the same year the pga tour was fighting a federal lawsuit by casey martin by saying that walking was an integral aspect of golf."}
{"original": "dustin johnson and brooks koepka are among those playing in abu dhabi next week, just like rickie fowler, phil mickelson and tiger woods have in previous years. it's a strong field, with appearance money as the main attraction. that's the reward for great golf."}

{"original": "since cracking the top 10 in the world, thomas has played only one time overseas except for pga tour-sanctioned events. the exception was the french open last summer at le golf national, site of the ryder cup in the fall."}
{"original": "i didn't get a dime to go to france last year, thomas said. it worked in the schedule because i didn't want to take three weeks off. and it would have been a big deal to win a european tour event, something i haven't done. i knew it was going to be a good field. world ranking points, there would be a fair amount. and it was an opportunity to go to france and check out the golf course."}

{"original": "over the weekend, headlines abounded about how the dow jones industrials (djindices:^dji) and s&p 500 (snpindex:^gspc) had their worst-ever start to a year last week. in the face of near-hysteria, many investors could use some perspective to put last week's drop into broader context. below, you'll find a list of 11 simple reasons not to panic about the stock market's losses."}
{"original": "1. in the long run, a 6% drop is just a blip. the decline the stock market suffered last week, seen in the context of its longer-term performance since 2007, barely registers."}
{"original": "2. declines like this happen all the time. on average throughout history, 10% declines in the markets have happened about every 11 months. yet the stock market has continued its inexorable march upward over the decades."}
{"original": "3. markets recover — often quickly. the same panicked reactions happened last august, when a similar event in china sent u.s. stocks down more than 10%. by november, the s&p had recovered back to where it had traded before the drop. you won't always see such a kneejerk reaction, but historically, even the largest market crashes have eventually given way to new all-time records for the dow and s&p."}
{"original": "4. falling markets make future gains more likely. overall, based on stock market history, the odds that the s&p 500 will be lower five years from now are about 20%, or one out of five. after even just a 5% drop, the odds of losing money decline, making it a better time to invest rather than a worse time."}
{"original": "5. the market's best days have historically followed substantial drops. in 2015, both the dow's best day and the s&p 500's best day came in the aftermath of the august decline. those who panic-sold after the declines missed out — and likely didn't manage to get their money back into the market until after stocks had recovered even further."}
{"original": "6. calendar-driven thinking is irrational. one big reason why the market's drop is getting so much attention is that it's coming at the beginning of the year. it's another example of how too great a focus on annual performance can distort investor perception. the fundamental prospects for companies aren't tied to the calendar year, so your expectations about stock-price movements shouldn't be either."}
{"original": "7. the market first hit this level in may 2014. even after the decline, the stock market has only given up gains from about a year and a half. from 2009 to mid-2014, the s&p 500 nearly tripled. overall, markets typically haven't tripled even over seven-year periods."}
{"original": "8. the best-performing stocks have routinely undergone big losses along the way. look at the top-returning stocks over the past decade, and you'll find plenty of times when shares traded well below their best levels. to get truly large returns, you have to be willing to wait through large pullbacks."}
{"original": "9. in the long run, stock returns go positive. there's been no 20-year period in which stocks have lost money. that's true even when you consider the impact of inflation on stock market returns."}
{"original": "10. you don't have to time the market to be a successful investor. strategies like dollar-cost averaging let you ease into the market, taking advantage of downturns to buy more shares on the cheap while also letting you get even better bargains in the future if the market keeps falling."}
{"original": "11. there are stocks that you've wanted to buy for a long time. for years, investors have watched share prices go through the roof, making them too nervous to buy. now, those shares are on sale. what are you waiting for?"}
{"original": "it's easy to panic when the stock market goes down, especially when you see headlines everywhere telling you that you should. the best way to win at long-term investing is to embrace the counterarguments to that way of thinking. a long-term approach will serve you well as long as you have the time horizon and the discipline to stick it out."}

{"original": "question: last summer, i traveled to florida with my daughter and we rented a car from avis. during the trip, we drove from destin to crestview, and crossed the mid-bay bridge. we knew it had a $4 toll, and we paid it in cash, handing the money to an attendant rather than using an automated machine."}
{"original": "as we drove on, we saw a second sign further down that stated a second toll of $2 would be due. we gathered money to pay, but as we drove on we saw a sign saying something about using a sunpass or using a toll by plate. i was unsure what that meant. we kept waiting to see a toll plaza or some other kind of toll machine, but we never saw a way to pay the toll."}
{"original": "a few weeks later, i got my credit card bill and noticed a charge from avis for $13.85. i called avis, and the representative told me it was a charge for a toll by plate in florida. i explained that i had been ready to pay the toll but couldn't find anywhere to pay. avis said they couldn't help me. i called the florida department for toll roads and they said they couldn't do anything either."}
{"original": "i didn't hear anything about this when i initially rented the car from avis. something is wrong when a $2 toll ends up costing $13.85. can you do anything to help me?"}
{"original": "answer: kraemer was understandably irritated by the add-on toll payment fees to her rental bill, weeks after she returned the car. she's not alone: the florida attorney general's office has logged 192 toll-related complaints since january 2016."}
{"original": "we are addressing the bulk of these through ongoing negotiations with several major rental car companies that do business in florida to ensure that the companies provide sufficient disclosures regarding the administrative fees they charge related to cashless tolls and give clear and complete information regarding cashless tolls, says florida attorney general pam bondi."}
{"original": "in the meantime, visitors need to be aware that the sunshine state uses cashless tolls — and protect themselves from what many say are excessive fees charged by rental companies for paying those tolls."}
{"original": "don't let the toll road slow you down"}
{"original": "florida has more than 700 miles of toll roads, more than any other state. many stretches use electronic tolling, with drivers paying those tolls either via a toll-by-plate system, which reads cars' license plates and sends a monthly bill to registered owners in the mail, or by pinging transponders installed in the vehicles and deducting tolls from their accounts."}
{"original": "all-electronic tolling first went into effect on florida's turnpike in february 2011, when the southern 47 miles of the turnpike mainline in miami was converted to a cashless system, according to chad huff of florida's turnpike enterprise, a unit of the florida department of transportation. florida's turnpike administers most, but not all, of the state's toll roads."}
{"original": "all-electronic tolling isn't exclusive to florida; drivers encounter cashless roads and bridges across the u.s., including in california, colorado, and new york, as well as countries around the world. the system certainly has its benefits: cashless toll roads are faster and safer, since drivers don't get stuck in toll-plaza backups or need to fumble for change, raising the risk of accidents. in florida, ever-increasing miles of road will use all-electronic tolling, as existing highways are retrofit to remove toll plazas. a decade ago, the florida department of transportation mandated that all new toll roads must utilize cashless tolling."}
{"original": "but complaints crop up when visitors are caught unawares, blithely cruising down parkways with their toll payments in hand and baffled when there's no one to hand it to. these renters end up paying a premium. it's not usually the tolls themselves that garner consumer outrage — often individual tolls are less than $1 — but extra fees rental agencies slap on top of those tolls."}
{"original": "kraemer incurred a $2 toll on the spence parkway, an 11-mile stretch of highway that connects to the mid-bay bridge in the florida panhandle, but is tolled separately from the bridge itself. the tolls are collected by the mid-bay bridge authority. while the bridge itself still has booths where you can pay tolls in cash, the spence parkway does not; it's been all-electronic since 2015. its open-road, all-electronic tolling means drivers can pay without stopping or even slowing down."}
{"original": "kraemer could have paid the toll herself had she purchased a sunpass transponder beforehand. sunpass is the state's most widely used prepaid tolling program. for a short-term visitor like kraemer, the sunpass mini sticker transponder is the cheapest and easiest option. the mini sticker is $4.99 and can be purchased online or at one of almost 5,000 retail locations including cvs, walgreens and publix. you must load it with $10 minimum for tolls. after your trip, you can close your account and request a refund check by mail from sunpass. the sticker goes on your rental car's windshield, and you remove it when returning the car. it's not reusable; it'll be destroyed when you peel it off. repeat visitors might invest in portable sunpass transponder, which costs $19.99, plus $10 for the account minimum balance. as an incentive, sunpass customers pay lower tolls than cash customers, if cash is even an option."}
{"original": "without a sunpass, kraemer's rental car was charged a toll by plate, meaning the camera system on the spence parkway photographed her license plate and sent the bill to avis. like other rental car companies, avis also has its own transponders in some cars in its fleet as well."}
{"original": "kraemer ended up repaying avis for that $2 spence parkway toll, plus an additional $3.95 per day for three days on top of that. avis' policy allows for that daily charge with a monthly cap of $19.75 per month, plus toll charges, of course."}
{"original": "the same daily fees and monthly maximums are in place at budget, national, alamo and enterprise. payless rings in with a slightly lower daily fee of $2.95, with the same monthly fee cap. hertz tacks on a little more, charging $4.95 per day, or a maximum of $24.75 per month."}
{"original": "with these rental car companies, drivers don't need to decide at the counter if they're going to use the company's toll-payment system. once they trigger a toll, they're automatically opted-in for the rest of their rental, according to avis representative alice pereira — and like kraemer, they're charged a daily free from that point on regardless of whether they actually use additional toll roads."}
{"original": "opting in at the counter may not be such a bargain, either. at dollar and thrifty, drivers also have to buy the toll-payment option for their entire rentals, not just for days they need it. dollar and thrifty charge $10.49 per day, capped at $52.49 per week, for their all-inclusive tolling with platepass, which includes the actual tolls. that would have cost kraemer quite a bit more than she paid avis for her one jaunt down the parkway."}
{"original": "if you skip the daily fee but end up triggering a toll charge, the penalties are considerably higher. dollar and thrifty will hit you with an administrative fee of $15 per toll, up to $90 total, as well as the actual toll costs, according to representative lauren luster. similarly, fox charges $8.99 per day, with a maximum of $134.85 per 15-day rental, and it likewise pops travelers with a $15 per-toll infraction fee, up to $90 per rental agreement."}
{"original": "rental car companies are required to disclose their toll-collection fees. but renters can miss the details; kraemer said she had no idea about avis' fees until she got her credit card statement. i sent her complaint to avis. a company representative reached out to her and agreed to remove the $11.85 in fees from her bill, so she ended up paying for just the $2 toll."}
{"original": "• plan your route to avoid tolls. before you leave home, read up on whether you'll encounter all-electronic toll roads or bridges as part of your destination planning. on the road, you can direct google maps and other navigation programs to avoid toll roads, and see if alternate routes are feasible or ridiculous. sometimes, though, it's just not possible to avoid tolls."}
{"original": "• figure out what your rental car company charges, since fees vary widely. the local toll authority's website might provide you with a comparative synopsis of the leading rental car companies' procedures and fees — information you might use to either pick your rental or plan your toll strategy."}
{"original": "• if it's compatible, use your own transponder from home. many states are moving towards interoperability. in florida, motorists from georgia and north carolina can use their home state's tolling transponders, and other states will follow as necessary equipment is installed, according to huff. not all transponders will work: for now, the e-zpass, accepted in 16 states across the midwest and northeast, cannot be used in florida."}
{"original": "• buy your own transponder. florida's sunpass makes it easy to buy before your trip, doesn't require a transponder deposit, and will refund your unused balance when you close your account. if you use your own, check to see if your rental has a transponder already installed, and switch it off."}
{"original": "• opt in to your rental car company's toll-payment system. this is the most expensive choice, but it is also the simplest. find out if you need to opt in ahead of time to avoid hefty administrative fees."}

{"original": "trump's response:trump claims doj inspector general report shows 'attempted overthrow' of the government"}
{"original": "wray described the surveillance authority provided by the foreign intelligence surveillance act (fisa), which is approved by the court, as an indispensable tool in national security investigations."}
{"original": "in recognition of our duty of candor to the court and our responsibilities to the american people, the fbi is committed to working with the court and (justice department) to ensure the accuracy and completeness of the fisa process, wray wrote."}
{"original": "the centerpiece of the training regimen, as outlined in the fbi filing, is the proposed creation of a case study based on the inspector general's findings in the page surveillance applications. wray ordered that the training program be created by april 30 and is requiring that all agents and lawyers who staff fisa complete the training by june 30."}
{"original": "i am determined that operational personnel understand, holistically, what occurred during the activities reflected in the (inspector general's) report, and that, in addition, personnel working on fisa applications understand the importance of rigor during each and every phase of the application process, the director wrote."}
{"original": "after the inspector general's report was released, judge rosemary collyer, chief judge of the foreign intelligence surveillance court that considers the sensitive wiretap applications, rebuked the fbi and asserted it had misled the court when seeking permission to wiretap page."}
{"original": "the frequency with which representations made by fbi personnel turned out to be unsupported or contradicted by information in their possession, and with which they withheld information detrimental to their case, calls into question whether information contained in other fbi applications is reliable, judge rosemary collyer wrote."}

{"original": "in its filing, the fbi was required to show the court how it would adhere to the rules governing requests for surveillance allowed under the foreign intelligence surveillance act. the law, enacted in 1978, outlines procedures investigators must follow when they ask judges for permission to conduct electronic surveillance of people suspected of acting as foreign agents."}
{"original": "although the inspector general debunked claims by president donald trump that the russia investigation was motivated by political bias, it revealed a dysfunctional system in which a team of investigators, handpicked to conduct one of the fbi's most sensitive investigations, committed basic and fundamental errors."}
{"original": "the fbi sought four court-ordered wiretaps of page. each application contained multiple errors, according to inspector general michael howoritz's report."}
{"original": "among the most common were omissions of important information, including some that contradicted investigators' suspicions that page was acting as a foreign agent."}
{"original": "during senate testimony last month, horowitz said the surveillance of page continued even as investigators gathered new evidence that weakened the assessment of page's activities.."}
{"original": "horowitz's report concluded that investigators overstated the reliability of a former british intelligence officer whose information they used to justify the surveillance warrants. agents described christopher steele as someone whose information had been corroborated and used in criminal proceedings. horowitz's report said that wasn't true."}
{"original": "investigators also didn't provide documentation to back up some of their assertions to justify the wiretap warrants. in some cases, the documents showed their claims were wrong. one supervisor said he didn't necessarily review full documents to make sure they supported what the agents claimed, according to the report."}
{"original": "horowitz referred a former fbi attorney to prosecutors for possible criminal investigation for altering an email from a liaison at another government agency. the email confirmed page had been a source of information for the other agency, but the fbi attorney changed it to say the opposite."}
{"original": "that covered up a piece of information that would have undercut the fbi's justification to wiretap page."}
{"original": "this, collyer wrote in her order, gave rise to serious concerns about the accuracy and completeness of any surveillance warrant applications involving that attorney."}

{"original": "it's no secret just how much damage president donald trump has done to our communities. he has repeatedly tried to snatch away our health care — and return us to the days when you could be denied care for having a pre-existing condition. his reckless, unnecessary trade war and big oil ethanol waivers have decimated iowa farmers and producers — evaporating livelihoods and exacerbating a tragic spike in farm bankruptcies. and his chief legislative victory — a tax cut that largely benefited the wealthiest americans — was little more than a slap in the face to working people."}
{"original": "but worse, somehow, than his policy failures has been the damage he's done to the soul of our nation. he fans the flames of hate groups at home. he embraces murderous dictators abroad. he rips children from their mothers' arms at our border. he pressures foreign nations to interfere in our elections. every day, his endless spigot of unhinged lies, thoughtless cruelties, and petty complaints embarrasses his office and degrades our national character. is it any wonder that the once-unimaginable sight of allied world leaders mocking and laughing at the american president has now become routine?"}

{"original": "washington state's star quarterback, luke falk, played most of the season with a broken bone in his non-throwing wrist and couldn't play in the holiday bowl because it hadn't healed enough from recent surgery. but none of that was known outside the cougars program until after the season. it was kept secret by leach, whose policy is to never talk about player injuries."}
{"original": "other coaches are more open about player injuries, knowing there's interest from fans, ticket buyers and viewers about which players aren't able to play and why not. by contrast, leach hates talking about them and doesn't want injury stories in the news media to gain traction for his team as an excuse to play less than its best."}
{"original": "i don't want to empower poor and inept and lazy journalists with story material, leach said. they just want to talk about scores and injuries. what comes out of these stories is, 'so and so is injured. so his team has all these excuses to lose, because the whole thing is riding on x-number of injured players. so therefore they can't win.'"}
{"original": "i don't want that mentality floating around our team in any way shape, form or fashion, leach said. then, the other thing is, whatever weaknesses or vulnerabilities that we have as a team, i can't possibly fathom why i would have any interest in revealing that to my opponent."}

{"original": "next time we have a press conference, i would be more than happy to go up there, get a hot cup of coffee and cool it off for them, he said. that's a courtesy i'm willing to provide, and i'd be happy to do that. but the fact they found me blowing on my coffee more fascinating than the questions that they ask i find kind of telling."}

{"original": "i think the odds of agreement on (biden's entire) program are quite low and even getting a scaled-down plan through will be a high hurdle, says brian gardner, chief washington policy analyst at stifel."}
{"original": "the biggest obstacle is that republicans can block any bill in the senate with 40 votes. control of the upper chamber will be split between the two parties, with 50 democrats and 50 republicans. vice president kamala harris can break a tie, officially giving democrats control of the senate but leaving them far short of the 60 votes needed to power legislation through."}
{"original": "there is a remedy. a process known as reconciliation allows the senate to pass a tax and spending bill with a simple majority, but only once a year. that means democratic leaders would still have to corral the party's centrists and hold on to progressives who may reject any legislation that waters down their priorities."}
{"original": "this all has got to be done with democratic votes, gardner says. can you do this by keeping all democrats – no defections? i'm very skeptical."}
{"original": "that doesn't mean the democratic victories in georgia aren't meaningful. congress can still pass limited measures that provide a modest boost to the economy. with democrats controlling the senate, mark zandi, chief economist of moody's analytics, expects the economy to grow an average 3.7% a year and create 12.5 million jobs during biden's four-year term. that compares with 3.5% growth and 11.6 million jobs under a republican senate, zandi says."}
{"original": "show me the money:when will the extra $300 in unemployment benefits start? these states are already paying the bonus"}

{"original": "biden also can accomplish major economic initiatives through executive actions, without congress's approval. for example, he's expected to largely reverse president donald trump's crackdown on both legal and illegal immigration, adding more consumers and workers to a u.s. economy that needs both. and he's likely to rally u.s. allies to confront china on trade issues, eventually removing many of the tariffs unilaterally imposed by trump, zandi says. that would eliminate a tax on american shoppers."}

{"original": "congress recently passed a $908 billion relief package that extended unemployment benefits to 14 million americans through mid-march, and provided more aid to struggling small businesses and financially stressed states and cities. the federal government is also sending another stimulus check – this time, for $600 – to most people."}
{"original": "trump, democrats and some republicans favor $2,000 stimulus checks for americans. a democratic-controlled senate led by schumer could mean quick passage of such a proposal, gardner says, with a second $1,400 check going to individuals early this year."}
{"original": "but gardner doesn't expect a second sweeping relief bill that further extends jobless benefits and provides additional aid to distressed states and cities for at least six months. such a measure would not garner 60 votes, he says. and in six months, the assistance likely wouldn't be needed because a covid-19 vaccine is expected to be widely available, providing a major lift the economy."}
{"original": "zandi is more optimistic. he believes that under schumer's leadership, congress will pass a $600 billion relief package that includes more jobless benefits, rental assistance and more aid to small businesses."}
{"original": "biden is proposing $7.3 trillion in new spending over 10 years, including upgrading the nation's roads, bridges and highways; building a clean energy economy; investing in research and development to bolster manufacturing; ensuring the government and its contractors buy american products; providing tuition-free community college; ensuring access to affordable child care and universal preschool; and providing aid for americans to buy or rent homes."}
{"original": "with the narrowest of majorities in the senate, democrats will need to use reconciliation to pass the initiatives and centrists are likely to oppose many of them, gardner says."}
{"original": "the bigger the bill, the harder it gets to swallow, he says. i think it's got to be more tailored."}
{"original": "in the end, gardner predicts, congress will pass legislation to upgrade the nation's crumbling roads, bridges, highways, ports and rural broadband networks."}
{"original": "everybody (lawmakers) likes big building (projects) in their districts, he says."}
{"original": "zandi projects a $1.5 trillion spending blueprint – about half infrastructure upgrades, and the rest a variety of social programs, such as housing, healthcare and childcare."}
{"original": "to help pay for his proposed outlays, biden plans to raise taxes by about $4 trillion over the next decade. he proposes eliminating loopholes for people earning more than $400,000; subjecting incomes above $400,000 to the 12.4% social security payroll tax; and phasing out itemized deductions at incomes of $400,000."}
{"original": "he also wants to increase the corporate tax rate from 21% to 28%, and tax capital gains and dividends at ordinary rates for incomes above $1 million."}
{"original": "new soft drink flavor:mountain dew major melon: watermelon is soda's first new flavor in more than a decade"}
{"original": "zandi believes a reconciliation bill will raise the corporate tax rate to 28% and tax the wealthy at higher rates."}
{"original": "but gardner reckons democrats will have to compromise and raise the corporate rate to 24%, a middle ground that will be opposed by progressives. ultimately, he predicts, the reconciliation bill will raise taxes only on wealthy americans in exchange for a republican demand to make the 2017 trump-led tax cuts – which are slated to expire in 2025 – permanent for those earning less than $400,000."}
{"original": "biden supports a democratic proposal in congress to raise the federal minimum wage from $7.25 an hour to $15. but with just a slim senate majority, democrats would not be able to garner the 60 votes to overcome republican opposition, gardner says."}
{"original": "washington – president donald trump has less than two weeks left in office, but his response to and role in wednesday's violent storming of the u.s. capitol has unleashed a new round of calls for his removal – even from within his own party."}

{"original": "there is real cause for alarm here, said deepak gupta, a harvard university lecturer and attorney who specializes in constitutional law. for the next couple of weeks, this unhinged person is formally, legally the commander of the armed forces, and there's really no telling what he might do."}

{"original": "i think we've got to hold our breath for the next 20 days, sen. mitt romney, r-utah, another prominent trump critic, told reporters on wednesday evening after the capitol had been secured."}
{"original": "trump's allies dismissed the fresh chatter as nonsense and rejected allegations that trump's rhetoric helped stoke wednesday's attack on congress. after the house and senate formalized president-elect joe biden's win in the nov. 3 election early thursday, trump called for a smooth transition of power, in a jarring message shift."}
{"original": "at a news conference earlier thursday, sen. lindsey graham, r-s.c., said he did not support removing trump and dismissed impeachment as political talk."}
{"original": "i'm hopeful the worst is behind us and we can transfer power on january 20th, he said."}
{"original": "but lawmakers in both parties say trump incited the mob violence that unfolded at the capitol, in which pro-trump rioters breached security, ransacked the building and nearly derailed the electoral college count to formalize biden's win."}

{"original": "i wish he would just do what nixon did and step down, powell told nbc."}

{"original": "but is it realistic to think trump will be ousted before the jan. 20 inauguration of his successor?"}
{"original": "here's a rundown of the avenues for removal – and a reality check on their possible use:"}
{"original": "the amendment, ratified in 1967, created a legal mechanism for designating a head of state when the president is disabled or dead. it also formalized the historical practice for the vice president to permanently take over if the president dies or resigns, and gives the president and congress shared power to replace a vice president."}
{"original": "under the amendment, the vice president and a majority of the cabinet could declare the president unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office. if the president disputes that determination, two-thirds of both the house and the senate must vote to put the vice president in charge."}
{"original": "on thursday, pelosi and the top senate democrat, chuck schumer, called on pence and trump's top advisers to invoke the clause."}
{"original": "what happened at the u.s. capitol yesterday was an insurrection against the united states, incited by the president, schumer said in a statement thursday morning. this president should not hold office one day longer."}

{"original": "but gupta said the 25th amendment was not really designed to oust a sitting president, even one who lawmakers believe is unfit to hold the office."}
{"original": "one of the defects of the 25th amendment is it relies on the president's closest political allies – his people – to invoke it, he noted. its drafters did not see it as a tool to remove a president who seems intent on undermining an election or holding onto power."}
{"original": "what they had in mind was situations in which the president becomes incapacitated for medical reasons, he said."}
{"original": "but norman ornstein, a resident scholar at the american enterprise institute think tank, said trump's singular focus on overturning the election – and his refusal to do his day job – is justification enough for invoking either the 25th amendment or impeachment proceedings."}

{"original": "foley noted that impeachment would also bar trump from holding public office again, presumably a benefit to critics who think he is unfit and fear he will run again in 2024. but impeachment is a lengthy and politically fraught process."}

{"original": "even trump's most ardent foes said it's far-fetched to think the narrowly divided house would reconvene to impeach trump and the senate, currently controlled by republicans, would then follow through to convict him."}
{"original": "he certainly deserves it, sen. dick durbin, the chamber's no. 2 democrat, told reporters. after what happened yesterday, he should be removed from office. but i don't believe there's a stomach for it on the republican side and there's very little time left."}
{"original": "in the wake of wednesday's violence, several legal experts and trump critics raised the prospect that trump could be charged with seditious conspiracy or inciting insurrection."}
{"original": "foley said there's little question in his view that rioters at the capitol engaged in criminal activity and that trump incited them. but, he said, it's not clear if trump himself could realistically be charged in connection with that deadly attack."}
{"original": "plus, he noted, department of justice policy generally holds that a sitting president is immune from criminal charges while in office."}
{"original": "after leaving office he's subject potentially to criminal liability, foley said. but sedition is a complicated crime and ... it has a kind of ugly use in american history for political opponents, so i think we would want to be careful about going down that road."}
{"original": "gupta said trump could potentially be ousted under a provision of the 14th amendment that bars individuals who engage in insurrection against the constitution of the united states from holding office."}

{"original": "trump's previous impeachment took much longer."}

{"original": "pelosi declared a formal impeachment investigation on sept. 24, 2019."}

{"original": "opposing view:sensible border security justifies government shutdown"}
{"original": "the proximate cause of the shutdown is a dispute over funding for trump's border wall, the one mexico was supposed to pay for."}
{"original": "physical barriers (though not concrete walls) are an important component of border security in certain places along the 2,000-mile border. but much of today's illegal immigration problem involves people who overstay their visas or who wish to be apprehended so they can apply for asylum or refugee status. trump seemed to comprehend this when he initially signaled he would compromise. but he beat a hasty retreat when he started coming under attack from hard-line conservative pundits and power brokers."}
{"original": "trump has been seeking $5 billion for the wall; democrats have been offering $1.3 billion for border security. a deal in this case would not be difficult to envision, as the numbers involved are dwarfed by the $3.8 trillion budget."}
{"original": "ideally, in return for the democrats meeting him partway on border security, trump would agree to end his policy of threatening dreamers — young adults who were brought here illegally as children — with deportation once their court protection ends."}
{"original": "this fight over border funding, however, has larger overtones that might stand in the way of a quick resolution. wednesday's meeting at the white house with congressional leaders ended with no signs of progress."}
{"original": "democrats, who take control of the house on thursday, are happy to finally be in the position of being able to say no to trump and want to display that power to their rank-and-file voters. they plan to offer a measure funding the department of homeland security through feb. 8 and the rest of the government for the remainder of the fiscal year."}
{"original": "trump, meanwhile, has spent his first two years catering to his base and ignoring or insulting just about everyone else. he does not appear inclined to change that now."}

{"original": "if you can't see this reader poll, please refresh your page."}
{"original": "let's face it: most of us could be doing a better job with our finances. whether you need to set more money aside for your future, watch your spending from here on out, or get your debts under control, there is usually room for improvement. we asked our contributors to suggest five ways our readers could save money in 2016, and here's what they had to say."}
{"original": "selena maranjian: one way to save thousands of dollars in 2016 is to make good use of retirement accounts. most of us can enjoy tax breaks by contributing to traditional iras and 401(k)s. our contributions are made with pre-tax dollars, and for 2015 and 2016, the contribution limits are $5,500 for iras and $18,000 for 401(k)s (with an extra $1,000 and $6,000 allowed, respectively, for those 50 and older). thus, if your taxable income is $60,000 and you contribute $10,000 to these accounts, your taxable income is reduced, to $50,000."}
{"original": "if you're in the 25% tax bracket and you avoid paying $10,000 in taxes in 2016, you save $2,500! if you're able to be more aggressive, and contribute $20,000 to these accounts, you can save a whopping $5,000. better still, your contributions will go to work for you, and will, ideally, grow over time. most of us need retirement savings accounts to draw on in retirement, so using iras and 401(k)s is a smart thing to do."}
{"original": "it's not a no-brainer thing to do, though. there are a few more considerations. for one thing, understand that traditional iras and 401(k)s let you save tax dollars up front, but you do get taxed eventually -- when you withdraw your money, typically in retirement. at that time, the money is taxed at your ordinary income tax rate, which is often lower in retirement than when you're working."}
{"original": "so also consider the roth ira and the roth 401(k), which accept post-tax money (i.e., they don't reduce your taxable income for the year of contribution) but are designed to ultimately let you withdraw your money in retirement tax-free. opt for them and in 2016 you can set yourself up to save thousands in future years."}
{"original": "sean williams: as we dive headfirst into 2016, one of the smartest money moves you can make, which may be able to save you thousands, is to take advantage of 0% interest, or low-interest, credit cards while you have the opportunity to do so in order to pay down whatever credit card debts you may owe."}
{"original": "according to a recent nerdwallet report, the average u.s. household carries a whopping $15,355 in credit card debt; and based on the latest weekly reading from creditcards.com, the average apr paid on a credit card is 15.07%. these figures imply that the average household is on track to pay in excess of $2,300 this year in credit card interest. understandably, what you pay will depend on your credit history, credit score, and other variables, but this is money that can be put to better use."}
{"original": "while i'm not a huge fan of suggesting that heavily indebted people open a new credit account, i believe opening an account with an extended special offer of 0% apr (say 12 or 18 months), and transferring your interest-bearing balances to your new account, could help save you thousands in 2016. instead of paying $2,300-plus in interest, you can take that money and apply it, dollar-for-dollar, toward your debt. historically low lending rates have allowed credit card providers to offer these extended periods of 0% apr, but as lending rates rise you may find these offers to be fewer and far between. consumers who have this option available probably won't want to sit on this idea for too long, otherwise those special apr deals may disappear."}
{"original": "jordan wathen: the single smartest thing i think anyone can do is review their spending on recurring expenses at least once each year."}
{"original": "while we remember the $15 bag of popcorn we bought at the movies, it's very easy to forget about routine charges for things like auto and home insurance, club and gym memberships, and bills for cell phones and cable. the best part about shaving even a very small amount from a monthly expenditure is that the savings are recurring, month after month and year after year. cutting $25 off a cable bill isn't just a small, $25 victory, it's a $300 annual triumph."}
{"original": "take the time in 2016 to look at every single recurring expense with a fine-tooth comb. shop around for big purchases, particularly things like insurance, cable, and cell phone services. i'd be surprised if the average person couldn't identify at least $1,000 in waste, particularly if they haven't shopped around for major recurring purchases in several years."}
{"original": "dan caplinger: one of the biggest financial obligations you'll ever carry in your lifetime is the mortgage on your home, and taking advantage of low interest rates on a mortgage loan will definitely save you thousands of dollars over the decades you spend paying it off. yet even though interest rates have been extremely low for years, some homeowners still haven't taken advantage of the opportunity to refinance their mortgages. the result is monthly payments that are hundreds of dollars higher than they need to be or missing out on the chance to replace an outstanding 30-year mortgage with a new 15-year loan."}
{"original": "to be fair, there are good reasons why some homeowners haven't refinanced their mortgages. some haven't been able to refinance, as they've worked to get out of negative equity situations in which they were underwater on their mortgage loans. others haven't been aware that they might qualify for special government programs designed to help struggling homeowners find refinancing options that otherwise might not be available to them. regardless of the reason, though, now is a great time to look and see whether you can save on your mortgage. with rates likely to rise now that the federal reserve is tightening monetary policy, you might not get a better chance than you have now to save money on a refi."}
{"original": "matt frankel: while it may not be the most immediate way to save money, one of the best things you can do over the long term is to work on maximizing your credit score."}
{"original": "in fact, most of the other money-saving suggestions mentioned here depend on your credit to some extent. as dan said, refinancing your mortgage can be a great idea, but to get the best interest rate, you'll need a high credit score. and if you have bad credit, sean's suggestion of using a 0% apr credit card offer to your advantage may not even be an option for you. finally, good credit can help reduce some of your other expenses like jordan mentioned, such as insurance premiums and deposits on utilities and cell phones."}
{"original": "aside from obvious solutions such as paying all of your bills on time, there are plenty of other ways you can boost your credit. just to name a few, here are a couple you may not know."}
{"original": "30% of your fico score is based on amounts owed, which emphasizes your debtrelative to your credit limits. so, by using sean's suggestion of opening a new card, you could improve your debt utilization and potentially boost your score, assuming you don't make any new charges."}
{"original": "10% of your score is based on your credit mix -- that is, the variety of credit accounts you have. so, if you have an auto loan but no mortgage or credit cards, it could actually hurt your score. having several types of accounts is a good thing, even if you don't use your credit card(s) much."}
{"original": "the point is that there are plenty of things you can do to improve your credit, and doing so can save you tons of money in the long run."}

{"original": "the city prosecutor position was one of his first jobs after graduating from the university of arizona college of law in 1972. he stayed only four months before moving to the pima county attorney's office, where he almost didn't get hired because the chief deputy county attorney, james howard, said he thought roll was too bashful and quiet to be a trial lawyer."}
{"original": "howard was wrong. in his seven years in the office, roll prosecuted more jury trials than anyone in the office and won almost all of them."}
{"original": "in 1980, he joined the u.s. attorney's office in tucson and made a name for himself leading organized crime and drug prosecutions, and his ambition and attention to detail made him a natural for white collar crimes and complex finance cases."}

{"original": "roll served four years on the court of appeals, which included temporary assignments on both the pima county superior court bench and the arizona supreme court. he was nominated to a lifetime appointment on the federal bench by president george h.w. bush in 1991 and unanimously confirmed by the senate."}
{"original": "as a prosecutor roll put a lot of bad guys in jail, and as a judge he did the same."}
{"original": "as an acting arizona supreme court justice he authored an opinion upholding the 2,975-year prison sentence of a child molester, and as a federal judge he threw the book at a man and sentenced him to the maximum 10 years in prison for shooting his girlfriend in the face, even though she testified it was an accident and begged roll for leniency."}
{"original": "just a few weeks later, roll, a lifelong catholic, even put a priest in jail — for embezzling $400,000. he did, however, show his merciful side. even though the man faced 60 years in prison, roll gave him six months after receiving hundreds of letters from parishioners who said the priest had used the money to help them buy food and pay rent and medical bills."}
{"original": "he denied bail for a border patrol agent who'd been accused of shooting a suspected border-crosser in the back, saying the fact that the agent had moved the body and delayed reporting the incident indicated he'd tried to conceal the crime. in another high-profile case, he granted bail for one of six suspected members of the irish republican army accused of trying to purchase detonators and a shoulder-fired stinger missile in tucson, even though, as a foreign national, prosecutors considered him a flight risk."}

{"original": "i think he tried to be very fair, but i think if there was any discretion, it was generally in favor of the prosecution because he believed that people that were charged with things need to be pulled up and pay the price, kay said."}

{"original": "he said he didn't mind that roll approached cases from the point of view as a prosecutor, and in fact appreciated it."}
{"original": "it was interesting because we're sort of different personalities. he was sort of a conservative prosecutor, and i'm sort of a progressive defense lawyer, but we got along because he played it straight, piccarreta said. he was not a bully, which you see too often these days with prosecutors. he was just a lawyer handling a case, and i was a lawyer on the other side."}
{"original": "piccarretta was the defense attorney who represented michael elmer, the border agent accused of shooting the immigrant in the back. elmer was initially tried and acquitted in state court, then retried on civil rights violations in federal court."}
{"original": "though the victim's mother was critical of roll, piccarreta said roll went by the book."}

{"original": "it was not the only time roll would be threatened. two years before his death, roll presided over a case in which 16 immigrants who were in the country illegally claimed they were detained at gunpoint, kicked, beaten and threatened with dogs by a rancher named roger barnett after crossing his land near the border."}
{"original": "the case erupted as anti-immigrant fervor was just beginning to grip the nation, and barnett was hailed as the vigilante rancher by right-wing cable tv personalities glenn beck and lou dobbs. barnett sought to have the case dismissed on the grounds that non-u.s. citizens had no right to sue over civil rights violations because they had no civil rights."}

{"original": "it becomes very uncomfortable to live under that situation, said zapata, one of roll's close colleagues on the bench. you're living with the u.s. marshals. they're at your house. you're living with them escorting you to and from wherever you want to go. it limits your movement, and it reinforces the fact that you are in danger and your family is in danger."}
{"original": "zapata, who keeps a framed copy of roll's funeral program on his desk adorned with a small american flag, recalled another high-profile case roll had ruled on years earlier."}
{"original": "this one involved a challenge to the brady handgun violence prevention act by former graham county sheriff and second amendment activist richard mack, who claimed that a provision of the law that required local law enforcement agencies to conduct background checks was unconstitutional."}
{"original": "roll agreed and struck down that provision of the law. he was later reversed by the 9th circuit court of appeals, which was in turn reversed by the u.s. supreme court, allowing roll's ruling to stand."}
{"original": "he made that decision based strictly on the law and what was constitutional, zapata said. but in the end it was a terrible irony that he ended up being killed by a kid who tried to buy a gun at one place and they told him no, and he went to another place and got the gun that he ended up taking out to the congress on your corner."}

{"original": "in his inaugural address on jan. 1, new york gov. andrew cuomo, like other governors, announced that he will push for the legalization of recreational marijuana, but he said nothing about what he will do to mitigate the health risks. before legislators legalize marijuana, they should require bold and direct warning labels to be placed on the packaging as is done with tobacco products. if the states fail to act, then the food and drug administration should step in and require it."}
{"original": "in early 2017, after exhaustive review, the national academies of sciences, engineering, and medicine found that there are significant health risks associated with using cannabis and cannabinoids. yet none of the 33 states that have legalized medical marijuana, or the 10 states that have legalized recreational use, gives adequate warnings of those risks."}
{"original": "the situation is similar to when cigarettes first became extensively marketed. the health risks were known but not disclosed, leading to disease and lives being lost. in addition to appearing on the packaging, the warning labels should be displayed prominently wherever the product is sold, in advertising and in mandated public service announcements funded by the marijuana industry."}

{"original": "the report found either substantial or moderate evidence of an association between cannabis use and the development of schizophrenia or other psychoses; increased symptoms of mania and hypomania in individuals diagnosed with bipolar disorders; increased risk for the development of depressive disorders; and increased incidence of suicidal ideation, attempts and completions."}

{"original": "in the rush to legalize and decriminalize marijuana, these risks are largely being ignored. washington and colorado were the first states to legalize recreational marijuana. while both warn pregnant mothers not to use it, the only other significant warning on the packaging is that there may be health risks, a watered-down mealy mouthed warning that fails to give consumers the concrete information they need to avoid danger."}

{"original": "with muted inflation readings that we've seen coming in, we will be patient as we watch to see how the economy evolves, powell said in a discussion with former fed chairs janet yellen and ben bernanke at the american economic association and allied social science association's annual meeting in atlanta. the talk was moderated by new york times reporter neil irwin."}
{"original": "the dow jones industrial average, already up about 400 points after a booming jobs report, leaped another 400 points by early afternoon following powell's remarks."}
{"original": "powell also said he would not resign if asked to do so by president donald trump, who has repeatedly criticized powell for lifting rates and crimping the faster economic growth trump has promised. trump has reportedly discussed the possibility of firing powell, news that further intensified a market sell-off last month."}
{"original": "a president can dismiss a fed board member only for cause, and it's unclear if he can remove a fed chief who could continue to serve on the board. experts, however, have said such a move would roil markets and jeopardize the fed's independence."}
{"original": "while fed officials have been providing a generally upbeat view of the economy, powell noted the market has plunged from its early fall peak because of fears of slowing global growth and the trump administration's trade fight with china, among other factors."}
{"original": "we're listening carefully to that, and we're going to be taking that downside risk into account as fed policymakers decide whether to raise interest rates, powell said friday."}
{"original": "he seemed to compare the fed's flexible approach to early 2016, when the central bank forecast four rate hikes that year but wound up hiking just once amid a market sell-off, economic troubles abroad and a drop in oil prices."}
{"original": "powell's message was unmistakable, in our opinion, says economist michael feroli of jpmorgan chase."}
{"original": "powell also said the fed would be willing to pause its campaign to shrink the $3.5 trillion portfolio of bonds that it purchased during and after the great recession to lower long-term interest rates – presumably if the economy weakened significantly."}
{"original": "we said we'd be prepared to adjust the plan as appropriate to achieve our objectives of solid economic growth and stable inflation, powell said. we wouldn't hesitate to change it."}
{"original": "by contrast, at his december news conference, powell reiterated the fed's view that the balance sheet reduction was on autopilot and the fed was relying on its benchmark short-term interest rate to tweak the economy's temperature. his remarks further fueled investor concerns that powell and the fed were blithely moving forward with a campaign to tap the brakes on the economy despite scant evidence of inflation, market turbulence, slowing global growth and forecasts for weakening activity in the u.s."}
{"original": "fed officials instead focused on the economy's recent performance, which has reflected healthy growth and unemployment that has dropped below 4 percent."}
{"original": "last month, fed policymakers forecast two rate hikes in 2019, down from its previous estimate of three, but fed fund futures markets were pricing in just one move. lately, markets have expected none."}
{"original": "the stock market punished the fed by plummeting further after powell's december news conference, hurting consumer and business confidence and raising the prospect that the dimmer outlook could itself hurt the economy."}
{"original": "on friday, powell seemed to be acknowledging that he and other fed officials got the message, and markets responded in kind."}
{"original": "when we get conflicting signals, policy is very much about risk management, powell said."}
{"original": "potentially huge news from the japan times: mlb confirmed that it is investigating texas rangers starter yu darvish to determine if he had any connection to the illegal gambling ring that got his brother sho darvish arrested by osaka police in october."}
{"original": "yu darvish has not been accused of any wrongdoing by the osaka police at this point, but mlb has confirmed that it is conducting a probe to find out if there is any link between the ace and the reason for his younger brother's arrest in october. we are aware of this situation and are looking into it, per our standard protocols, mlb's vice president for communications michael teevan wrote in a recent email to the japan times. (sho darvish) is alleged to have accepted some 1,850 wagers valued at ¥10,000 each on pro games in both north america and japan. it is still unclear whether or not any of the bets were taken on games involving the rangers."}
{"original": "there's nothing yet to suggest the pitching darvish had anything to do with his younger brother's gambling activities, though it's worth noting that sho darvish's arrest came after an investigation lasting more than a year — suggesting he could have been betting on baseball games while yu darvish was an active big leaguer in 2014. the right-hander missed the entire 2015 season following tommy john surgery."}
{"original": "family can always complicate decisions, but it doesn't appear darvish would have much to gain for participating. even if sho darvish somehow won every single bet he accepted according to the allegations, he would have made less than $3 million total, a fraction of the $56 million darvish will have earned from the rangers by the time his contract expires. and darvish denied any involvement in a statement tuesday:"}

{"original": "days after a crisis with iran threatened to upend his presidency and drag the u.s. into another middle east war, trump spoke at length about what he described as bold and decisive action to deliver american justice via a u.s. drone strike near the baghdad international airport that killed soleimani last week."}

{"original": "trump touched on the iranian response to soleimani's death, saying the u.s. was ready to go if iran's rocket attack inflicted additional damage or resulted in the death of u.s. soldiers stationed on the two iraqi bases that were targeted. trump said iran hit us with 16 missiles but thathe decided to stand down after he saw the relatively minor impact, which he attributed to a pretty good warning system."}

{"original": "the toledo rally is one of three trump has scheduled this month. the others are set for wisconsin, a critical state for his reelection effort, and new jersey. it was his first major political event since the confrontation with iran escalated."}
{"original": "trump has raised iran at virtually every political rally he has hosted since entering the white house in 2017. his remarks on one of washington's most challenging foes in the middle east have generally focused on the 2015 multi-national nuclear agreement that offered sanctions relief in exchange for iran curbing its nuclear program."}
{"original": "trump pulled the u.s. out of that agreement in 2018, arguing it did not do enough to curb iran's nuclear ambitions."}
{"original": "iran and the u.s. bothmoved wednesday to deescalate the confrontation. trump largely avoided saber-rattling during a nine-minute address to the nation and even suggested the possibility of a diplomatic resolution to the crisis. iranian leaders, including foreign minister javad zarif described the attack as self-defense."}

{"original": "though the iowa caucuses might open the ears of presidential candidates, it is ultimately the facts that win over candidates. facts like: taxpayers have subsidized oil for over a century; artificial regulatory barriers block market access for renewable fuels; and, when given a choice, consumers prefer renewable fuels."}

{"original": "the aclu's creators felt the courts must be an essential protector of americans' rights. chief justice john roberts, in his year-end report last month on the federal judiciary, made much the same point as he paid homage to the founders and the constitution."}
{"original": "roberts also issued a warning: we have come to take democracy for granted, and civic education has fallen by the wayside. in our age, when social media can instantly spread rumor and false information on a grand scale, the public's need to understand our government, and the protections it provides, is ever more vital."}
{"original": "baldwin and his peers would not have argued with that, although they may have pointed out that america, even in the founders' time, was notoriously bad at recognizing some basic american rights. and they would have quibbled with any suggestion that the government of their day, including the judiciary, was doing a good job of enforcing those rights."}

{"original": "the aclu spearheaded a movement that radically extended the reach of the bill of rights — especially of the first amendment. it helped america during world war ii avoid the severe assault on speech that characterized government policy during world war i. that second war, nonetheless, saw other civil liberties missteps, including our government's decision to segregate more than 100,000 people in internment camps simply because of their ethnicity."}
{"original": "the battle over government's encroachment on rights has never ended. it was refought during the george w. bush and barack obama administrations over the limits of government surveillance and detention of suspected bad guys. and it is being refought now, with the aclu and other organizations squaring off against an executive branch that seems unwilling to recognize scarcely any limits at all."}
{"original": "few organizations manage, on their 100th birthday, to remain as relevant as on the day of their birth. that the aclu has pulled it off is a tribute to the vision of its founders. it is also a reminder that the rights baldwin and his allies swore to protect never become completely immune to our leaders' worst impulses."}

{"original": "perhaps the greatest present danger to america's security is the perception, if not the reality, of the united states choosing sides amidst renewed violence in the battle between sunnis and shiites in the heart of the middle east."}
{"original": "for more than 1,400 years, sunnis and shiites have been at odds. the first armed clash between adherents of the two main branches of islam took place in a.d. 680, in karbala, still a major city in central iraq. through the years, persians and arabs (two very distinct peoples, languages and religions), now iran and saudi arabia, have been at odds or in battle. as recently as 30 years ago, iran and then-sunni iraq (backed by its neighboring saudis) fought one of the longest wars in the 20th century — nearly eight years. today, each side is engaged in proxy wars in yemen and syria. but only rarely has this hatred threatened to boil over as directly, viciously and widely as now appears possible."}
{"original": "across the middle east, shiite and sunni nations and deeply potent minorities in many of these countries are digging in for a battle that threatens to spread far beyond the region. in such an atmosphere, the u.s. must resist even the appearance of choosing sides."}
{"original": "not lost for a second on the players involved, however, is just that perception. for decades, we were seen as too close to the sunni leaderships of saudi arabia, the united arab emirates and bahrain. while clearly sunnis and shiites will each back their own at all costs, many believed america would invariably back the sunnis. no longer. today, while large elements of popular arab and iranian opinion still see america as in the hip pocket of the sunnis, the efforts to bring iran to an agreement on a nuclear weapons moratorium and to the fight against the islamic state terrorist group have shifted perceptions. either perception is dangerous and wrong-headed."}
{"original": "while secretary of state john kerry called his counterparts in iran and saudi arabia this week to urge calm after the saudis executed a leading shiite cleric and mobs burned the saudi embassy in tehran in retaliation. but congress isn't helping matters by requiring a consular interview overseas for any citizen of 38 visa-exempt nations, including all of western europe, who has visited shiite-dominated iran, iraq or syria (or sunni-dominated sudan) since 2011. this move comes at the very moment iran is hoping to lure vast numbers of businessmen when western sanctions are lifted."}
{"original": "certainly, we have every reason for continuing to play the saudi card. saudi monarchs were for decades the most consistently friendly arab leaders toward america. iran, by contrast, since the ouster of the shah, has been one of america's most determined foes. saudi rulers have supported a host of u.s. adventures in the islamic world — in neighboring iraq and in the battle against al-qaeda, which was founded by the son of one of the monarchy's most devoted servants. other sunni nations are equally important to u.s. interests. bahrain — a sunni monarchy ruling an increasingly unruly shiite majority — serves as home to the american 5th fleet."}
{"original": "today, however, there is no reason to play the saudi card. nor for that matter is it likely to help. saudis' fears of a tilt away from them toward iran could well have played a role in the monarchy's decision to execute the shiite imam nimr al-nimr. so imagine what a real-life tilt toward either side could mean now. we must find a way to right the ship, to redress the balance."}
{"original": "at stake is any ability to bring together the kind of arab coalition president obama seeks — forces that could challenge sunni isil on the ground. other countries — the uae, bahrain and qatar, pillars of the middle east economic establishment — are lining up behind saudi arabia. certain figures in iraq and the assad regime in syria are lining up with shiite iran. but in paramount jeopardy is america's image as a neutral force of moderation. only by restoring that image can the united states hope for a constructive outcome in syria or in the struggle with our paramount threat, the islamic state."}

{"original": "kim's speech was not all sweetness and light. he warned that his patience is not infinite, and that in the absence of diplomatic progress, his country may resort to more confrontational tactics. little has happened since the famous singapore summit back in june between kim and trump; we seem no closer to a deal on north korea's threatening military capabilities now than we did six months ago. meanwhile, kim clearly resents and suffers from the tough international sanctions that the trump administration has convinced the united nations to impose these last two years, after north korea's big missile and nuclear tests of 2017. the latest statistics show that, despite sanctions evasion in multiple quarters, north korean trade was down as much as half in 2018 compared to the year before."}

{"original": "but kim held out an olive branch nonetheless. he seems to want a deal, and seems interested in another summit. he was much more specific than ever before about what he might offer in the course of such a tete-a-tete with trump. so far, north korea has only offered to place a moratorium on future nuclear and long-range missile tests, which has been a welcome development, but has only talked vaguely about denuclearization and has not stopped making more bombs. now, apparently, kim would put nuclear production capability on the table as a bargaining chip."}
{"original": "north korea experts like jonathan pollack and jung pak have documented how unlikely kim would be to give up all his nuclear bombs (u.s. intelligence estimates he has as many as 60 by now). they represent the collective accomplishments of a program that kim's grandfather and father prioritized when they led north korea, so giving up all those bombs quickly would almost seem to dishonor the memory and legacy of his forefathers. and perhaps even more importantly, kim as well as his generals remember the one cardinal mistake saddam hussein, mohammar quadhafi, and the taliban all committed — leaving themselves vulnerable in war against the united states because of the lack of a nuclear deterrent. for kim to give up the bomb, he would need a great deal of confidence that relations will remain peaceful."}
{"original": "there is an opportunity to compromise, relax"}
{"original": "yet there is still a big opportunity for compromise, if kim is serious about ending production of more bombs. north korea could stop expanding its nuclear arsenal, and we could relax, then lift some of the sanctions imposed on north korea over the years, especially the u.n. sanctions that have really cut into north korean trade with china and south korea in the last couple years. the goal of complete denuclearization could await another day."}
{"original": "with this approach, the united states would keep enough sanctions in place to stay true to its principle that north korea cannot be accepted as a nuclear-weapons state; before being fully welcomed into the community of nations, it will in fact have to honor its obligations under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and give up all its bombs. yet as a practical matter, that second stage of nuclear talks can wait for a number of months or years. that is ok. the world will be much safer if north korea stops enlarging and improving its nuclear and long-range missile arsenals that could threaten not only south korea and japan (and the almost 300,000 americans living in those two countries combined), but also eventually north america."}
{"original": "trump should take what he can get for now"}
{"original": "the real challenge is likely to be verification. we know where some, but not all, of north korea's nuclear infrastructure is located. as such, international inspectors would have to be allowed to return not only to the yongbyon location where they have been before, and where north korea has operated a nuclear reactor to make plutonium as well as centrifuges to enrich uranium. they would also need some degree of free reign to explore other suspicious sites around the country. on the one hand, this would not be an arrangement unique to north korea; similar provisions are part of the iran nuclear deal, for example. on the other hand, north korea has shown extreme nervousness about such inspections in the past."}
{"original": "another possible problem: john bolton, trump's national security advisor, and secretary of state mike pompeo may consider a deal that only freezes, rather than eliminates, north korea's nuclear arsenal inadequate for purposes of american and allied security. but they should reassess, or trump should overrule them."}
{"original": "this compromise deal would go further than the iran deal, in fact, if north korea were willing to see its nuclear production facilities dismantled permanently. yes, kim would keep his nukes for a while. but he would have powerful economic and military reasons to behave himself. in this case, taking half a loaf is far more realistic than hoping for a complete denuclearization accord that just isn't in the cards anytime soon. we should immediately engage in serious talks to see just how serious kim really is about this intriguing and promising offer."}

{"original": "gov. kim reynolds has indicated she might be willing to support automatically restoring voting rights to felons who complete the terms of their sentence, a move that could re-enfranchise more than 50,000 iowans and potentially reduce the errors that are denying some legal voters their right to have their ballot counted."}

{"original": "right now, the country with the world's biggest oil reserves — venezuela — is putting out a fraction of its traditional production, as a corrupt and inept socialist government has lost the ability even to keep the golden goose going. meanwhile, iraq is in turmoil, iran is crazy and saudi arabia has been looking shaky."}
{"original": "despite all this, oil and gas prices are holding steady, and while what's going on in the middle east constitutes a diplomatic crisis, it's nothing like the sort of earthshaking trouble it would have been a decade or two ago."}
{"original": "you can thank the frackers for our energy independence"}
{"original": "why is that? because frackers have turned the united states from a nation deeply dependent on imported oil to a net exporter and the world's single largest producer of oil and gas."}
{"original": "for decades, u.s. foreign policy and defense strategy revolved around keeping the flow of oil from the middle east going. now it's an afterthought. in fact, though the navy used to have to be able to keep the strait of hormuz open so that oil could flow out against possible iranian efforts to stop it, now the navy only needs to be able to keep the strait closed, keeping iran from selling the oil it produces for revenue it desperately needs."}
{"original": "even an iranian drone attack that shut down half of saudi arabia's output didn't have much impact."}
{"original": "and world markets know that donald trump, or any subsequent american president, can quickly boost supplies even further by opening up federal land to hydraulic fracturing, which extracts oil and gas from rock by injecting high-pressure mixtures of water, sand or gravel and chemicals."}
{"original": "any effort to block the flow of oil would probably just have the effect of boosting u.s. market share, making the united states even more economically powerful."}
{"original": "that's not just bad news for iran. it also weakens the hand of saudi arabia, which has gone from jihad-encouraging frenemy to a nervous ally as it faces iran across the persian gulf, while its power over the united states is also reduced."}
{"original": "fracking also drastically undercuts the power of vladimir putin, whose economic leverage depends on russian oil and gas exports."}
{"original": "they're gonna have to compromise:democrats must embrace shale gas boom to win elections and climate battle"}
{"original": "and it's not just the united states undercutting putin. as cornell law professor william jacobson blogged, while everyone was focused on the killing of iranian terror general qasem soleimani, israel became a natural gas superpower. the new offshore tamar and leviathan gas fields give israel a huge new supply of cheap natural gas, enough to supply its own needs while leaving huge amounts to export."}
{"original": "this is particularly significant because israel's biggest market is europe, now dependent on, you guessed it, piped-in gas from russia. europe is also starting to receive shipments of natural gas from the united states, once again, courtesy of fracking."}
{"original": "environmentalists oppose fracking, but it's hard to understand why. fracking has led to the replacement of coal with cleaner-burning natural gas. united states carbon emissions have fallen largely because of this substitution."}
{"original": "russia isn't happy about our natural gas success"}
{"original": "putin doesn't like this and has dispatched russian trolls to try to stop pipelines in the united states, has worked against u.s. fracking and has also tried to block canadian oil sands development. and he's getting help."}
{"original": "back in 2017, in response to claims that president trump was a putin puppet, scholar walter russell mead commented:"}

{"original": "they don't call the democratic presidential candidates, who have pretty much all come out against fracking and pipelines, putin puppets. but what's more likely to strengthen the united states and weaken our adversaries — from putin to the ayatollahs to the chinese — than a bigger boost for american energy independence? someone should ask them why they want to make us weaker and putin stronger."}

{"original": "her remarks laid bare divisions between trump and the republican party just a day before a crucial runoff election in georgia that could determine control of the senate. republican lawmakers have increasingly broken with the president, including on a major defense policy bill and trump's attempts to overturn the electoral college results in congress."}

{"original": "social security is a program that more than 41 million retired workers rely upon each and every month. according to the social security administration (ssa), 71% of unmarried elderly individuals, and 61% of elderly individuals as a whole, receive at least half of their monthly income from social security."}
{"original": "however, social security was never meant to be leaned on so heavily by retirees. the ssa suggests that social security benefits are only designed to replace about 40% of your working wages. yet based on the data above, we know that 3 out of 5 seniors would likely be in serious trouble without social security income. according to the november ssa snapshot, the average retired worker brings home $1,354.78 a month, or about $16,260 a year. that's (depressingly) not too far from the federal poverty level of $11,880."}
{"original": "hey social security, you're doing it wrong!"}
{"original": "yet, according to a new study from the senior citizens league (tscl), a nonpartisan organization designed to keep senior citizens and retirees abreast of the policy decisions that can affect them, a simple change to social security could give retirees a considerably brighter outlook and, according to the report, net the average retiree in 2015 nearly $30,000 extra in lifetime benefits over 25 years."}
{"original": "a notable problem tscl has identified with social security is the method by which cost-of-living adjustments, or colas, are calculated. social security colas are the raises beneficiaries receive most years."}
{"original": "social security's cola is calculated based on changes in the consumer price index for urban wage earners and clerical workers (cpi-w). the cpi-w is designed to measure the change in the price of a predetermined basket of goods and services. to calculate social security's cola, the average cpi-w reading from the third quarter of the previous year acts as the baseline figure, while the average cpi-w reading from the third quarter of the current year serves as the comparison. if there's a year-over-year decline in the average cpi-w readings, no cola is given. if, however, there is an increase, social security beneficiaries receive the difference, rounded to the nearest 0.1%."}
{"original": "but, as tscl points out, the cpi-w has a fatal flaw: it represents the spending habits of working americans, not senior citizens, despite the fact that two-thirds of all social security recipients are retired workers."}
{"original": "this fix could put nearly $30,000 in retirees' pockets over their lifetime"}
{"original": "according to tscl, the solution would be to switch the cola measure to the consumer price index for the elderly (cpi-e). as the name implies, the cpi-e only factors in the spending habits of households with individuals who are 62 and older."}
{"original": "as you can see by the dec. 2011 comparison of the cpi-w and the cpi-e below, the weighting of expenditures is quite different for certain categories. for example, seniors spend twice as much on medical care as do working americans. they also tend to spend more on housing. by comparison, the cpi-w places a higher emphasis on education, apparel, entertainment, and transportation expenses."}
{"original": "these percentages may not look large on this bureau of labor statistics comparison, but over the course of 25 years using the cpi-e instead of the cpi-w could be expected to increase annual payouts by an average of 8.9%, or $29,568 in aggregate, based on the current average monthly payout of $1,355 a month for retired workers."}
{"original": "what's more telling is that over the past 33 years, the cpi-w would have resulted in a greater annual cola than the cpi-e on just three occasions (2006, 2009, and 2012). in the remaining 30 years, the cpi-e would have provided a substantially higher cola, which would presumably allow seniors to more comfortably afford the rising cost of medical care. not surprisingly, medical care inflation has outpaced social security's cola in 33 of the past 35 years."}
{"original": "the cpi-e has its flaws, too"}
{"original": "on one hand, tscl makes a strong case for the cpi-e considering that seniors make up a majority of social security recipients, and given that they're falling far behind the medical care inflation curve. but the cpi-e brings its own set of problems to the table."}
{"original": "to begin with, there are far more working americans than there are seniors. in other words, even though the cpi-w doesn't perfectly match the spending habits of seniors as outlined in the bls chart above, it arguably creates a more accurate picture of the spending habits of americans than the cpi-e because it has so many additional data points for analysis."}
{"original": "another concern is that the cpi-e doesn't factor in the rising cost of medicare part a expenses. part a is the hospital insurance component of medicare, and it covers in-patient costs, surgeries, and long-term skilled nursing care. part a costs can be extensive, and if they aren't factored into the cpi-e seniors could still wind up falling way behind the medical care inflation curve, even if the cpi-e were being used to calculate colas instead of the cpi-w."}
{"original": "lastly, and this could arguably be the biggest issue of all, switching to the cpi-e, could also expedite how quickly the social security trust burns through its spare cash. tscl's calculations demonstrate that seniors would receive a higher cola in most years than with the cpi-w, which means even more pressure on social security."}
{"original": "will the cpi-e debate gather steam on capitol hill? it's really anyone's guess at this point, but considering that republicans are in charge of congress for at least the next couple of years, and many of them favor moving to a chained cpi (a measure that produces even slower growing colas than the cpi-w), i wouldn't hold my breath."}

{"original": "all investors, from rookies to professionals, make mistakes from time to time. the characteristic that distinguishes great investors is the willingness and ability to learn from those mistakes. with that in mind, three of our contributors would like to share their biggest investing regrets from the past year, in the hopes that they (and you) will learn from them."}
{"original": "selena maranjian: my biggest investing regret of 2015 is one i've regretted over many years: holding too many different stocks. i'm not a rookie investor, but i'm making a rookie mistake by adding more and more holdings over time without thinning them out."}
{"original": "what's so bad about that? well, lots of things. for starters, it's much harder to keep up with dozens of different companies than it is to keep up with 10 to 20. thus, i'm underinformed about most of them and i may not realize when it's a good time to sell one -- or add shares."}
{"original": "having lots of holdings does offer diversification, so that if one holding tanks, my portfolio isn't likely to suffer too much. but that also means that my gains in any particular holding aren't likely to move the needle by a lot, either. imagine, for example, one portfolio with 10 stocks and one with 50, with assets evenly distributed in each. each holding in the 10-stock portfolio represents 10% of its overall value, while each of the 50-stock one represents just 2%."}
{"original": "it's best to have your portfolio concentrated on your best ideas -- ideally your 10 to 20 best ones, not your 50 best ones. after all, if you're adding money to your portfolio, wouldn't it be better to add to one of your top ideas, rather than, say, your 48th-best idea? it's not smart to hold too few companies, but holding too many doesn't let your most promising holdings perform as powerfully for you as they could."}
{"original": "dan caplinger: my biggest investing regret in 2015 was one that i've struggled with throughout my investing career: being reluctant to buy shares of stocks after they've already gone up in price substantially. i tend to be a value investor, looking for stocks that have gotten beaten up and hoping to buy in at bargain prices. once the stock bounces back, it's frustrating to have missed out on the best opportunity to invest."}
{"original": "what 2015 taught me is that many stocks that have already seen substantial gains turn out to have more room to run. for instance, dow component nike (nyse: nke ) has performed extremely well in recent years, and coming into 2015, it was reasonable to expect a potential pullback based on rising competition and a strong dollar. yet in its most recent quarterly report, nike reported a 4% rise in revenue that produced earnings growth of 20%, despite facing currency-related headwinds. on a currency-neutral basis, double-digit percentage growth in all of nike's geographical areas showed how well the athletic giant has done even in economically weaker parts of the world. not buying into nike early in 2015 cost investors a 34% gain, showing how you can miss out on opportunities by thinking it's too late in the game to take advantage."}
{"original": "matt frankel: my biggest investing regret of 2015 is hanging on to some of my losing investments for far too long."}
{"original": "like dan, i tend to be a bargain hunter and try to pick up beaten-down stocks with the intention of holding them for years to come. however, sometimes it becomes a good idea to know when you made the wrong choice, cut your losses, and move on."}
{"original": "for example, i first bought shares of transocean (nyse: rig ) in 2013, and added to my position in late 2014 on what i thought was just temporary weakness in oil prices. when i bought my shares, the company had an impressive $27.3 billion backlog of business and was paying a generous $3.00/share dividend. since then, the backlog has shrunk by nearly 40%, and the dividend was cut by 80% in february 2015, and finally suspended in september 2015."}
{"original": "if i had followed my instincts and cut my losses when the company initially chopped its dividend, not only could i have sold for $19 per share (about 50% more than today's price), but i could have put that money to work for me in a more positive way. it is important to be able to admit when you're wrong, and i intend to learn from this mistake."}

{"original": "on wednesday night, she shared her story – through the same technology – with wxia-tv."}
{"original": "her name is lisa collis, and she texted that it was at about 4:30 p.m. on new year's eve in a parking lot in alpharetta when she saw two children alone in a parked car."}
{"original": "luckily for all, since collis is deaf and this is alpharetta, she was able to report what she saw by texting 911."}
{"original": "our 911 dispatcher was able to text back with her, said george gordon with the alpharetta department of public safety. and they created a communications string where we obtained all the details, the location, what was going on, what's the problem, and we were able to dispatch a police officer to the scene... we're very grateful to collis."}
{"original": "gordon said this was the first time anyone had texted to 911 since the city started the 911-texting service in late 2014."}
{"original": "i pulled in next to the car and as i was getting out i saw the children, but there were no adults in sight, she said. i waited 10 minutes in my truck before i texted 911."}
{"original": "gordon said the texts go straight to police and an officer was heading toward collis even while the 911 dispatcher was still texting with her."}
{"original": "here's what she and the dispatcher texted each other:"}
{"original": "collis: does anyone work on text?"}
{"original": "911: alpharetta/milton 9-1-1. if it is safe to do so please call 9-1-1. if not, what is the address of the emergency?"}
{"original": "collis: i'm at old navy by northpoint mall. someone left two young kids in the car. they're about 2 and 5 i think. i'm deaf."}
{"original": "911: okay, what type of vehicle?"}
{"original": "collis: it's silver. it's parked right in front of the store."}
{"original": "911: car, truck, suv or van?"}
{"original": "she gives the dispatcher a few more details, and then the dispatcher tells her an officer is on the way."}
{"original": "collis said, in her texts with wxia-tv on wednesday, that she didn't think twice about contacting 911."}
{"original": "i wasn't sure if it was going to work. i have two [children] of my own and i didn't think it was right to [leave kids in a car alone]. especially if they were that young. no one should ever leave children in a vehicle, especially just to shop. i was thrilled when the 911 operator answered my text, she said."}
{"original": "city policy does not permit 911 dispatchers to appear on camera or answer questions from the public, including the news media, but gordon said the center is proud that alpharetta is the first city in georgia to join a handful of georgia counties in providing the 911 texting service."}
{"original": "i would like to see more agencies making it available in all areas, collis said. it not only made it accessible for the deaf people, but works for those who couldn't speak or if their lives are in danger."}
{"original": "it could be domestic violence, gordon said. it could be seeing a serious crime in progress, or wanting to be an anonymous witness, whatever it is, where you don't have to speak [or it's too dangerous to speak], you can text-in anything to the 911 center now in our city, and that's a tremendous benefit to the public."}
{"original": "gordon said in this case the parents had left a 15-year-old babysitter in charge of the children in the car, but the babysitter left the children alone."}
{"original": "gordon said the parents had returned to the car by the time the officer arrived. the officer's investigation resulted in warnings, but no arrests."}
{"original": "so far, according to the fcc, georgia is far behind other states in providing 911 texting."}
{"original": "only a limited number of 911 centers in georgia have upgraded. they include the city of alpharetta, and paulding and floyd counties."}

{"original": "i'm happy and i'm sad, she said when asked about how she'll feel on the anniversary. one, two, three, four, five, six shootings – dead."}
{"original": "a shadow passed over her face as she remembered the young aide, the federal judge, the 9-year-old girl and the others who were murdered that day. then she stiffened her posture and collected herself, punching her left hand in the air for emphasis as she repeated her mantra: move ahead. move ahead. move ahead."}
{"original": "the past is never far away, of course. an hour or so before her conversation with usa today, conducted over zoom on wednesday afternoon, a mob supporting president donald trump's grievances over the election had stormed the capitol and forced the frantic evacuation of lawmakers from the house and senate chambers, including kelly. giffords had gotten reassurances that he was safe just before the interview."}
{"original": "after the interview was over, she posted a message on twitter to her husband. as i sat waiting for information about @senmarkkelly's safety today, i couldn't stop thinking about what you must have gone through 10 years ago this week, she tweeted. i love you, sweetie."}

{"original": "every movement needs one or two heroic figures, and gabby, for us as a movement, is that heroic figure, said sen. chris murphy, d-conn., who has emerged as a central leader against gun violence since the sandy hook shooting in his home state. he and giffords have been friends since both were first elected to the house in 2006 and assigned offices next to one another in the attic of the cannon house office building."}
{"original": "progress in enacting federal laws on gun violence has been excruciatingly slow. two years ago, the democratic-controlled house passed legislation to strengthen the federal background check system – in a nod to giffords, it was introduced on jan. 8 and numbered h.r. 8 – but the republican-controlled senate never took up the bill and trump had vowed to veto it, anyway."}

{"original": "patience and persistence, even in the face of setbacks, are qualities she has honed in her own recovery from the bullet that pierced her brain. she has limited use of her right arm and leg; she walks with a limp and uses a cane. her memory is sharp and her humor intact, but she struggles to speak."}
{"original": "for her videotaped remarks to the democratic national convention in august, which lasted about 90 seconds, she practiced and trained with her speech therapist for 130 hours, ambler estimated."}
{"original": "that said, her use of language this week was more fluent than it had been during a usa today interview with her in 2014, although she still typically responds to a question with just a word or two. now 50, she seemed more confident and relaxed. she easily recalled the name of a tucson restaurant she had taken the reporter to more than six years earlier – it was pizzeria bianco – and lamented the fact that it has since closed."}

{"original": "even though the long, difficult process of developing an effective vaccine against the coronavirus has ended successfully, now begins another long, difficult process: the act of administering the vaccine into people's arms. according to reuters, 10 million doses of the vaccine remain unused. what is going on?"}
{"original": "vaccine administration is much harder than it sounds for at least two reasons: logistics and vaccine refusal."}
{"original": "the logistical problem begins with shipping and storage, since the pfizer and moderna vaccines must be kept in the freezer. (the pfizer vaccine requires an especially cold freezer.) but the logistical problem doesn't end once the vaccine arrives at its final destination. the process of vaccinating thousands of people in a single location is a challenge in and of itself."}
{"original": "to facilitate the process, patients must register ahead of time rather than standing in line. not only does this reduce the risk of social congestion, but it allows more efficient allocation of vaccines, which reduces waste."}
{"original": "solutions to the problems surrounding vaccination"}
{"original": "the best way to accomplish this would be with a covid vaccine app. at least one state will launch an app soon, but every state needs one. additionally, an app that can factor in age, gender, and other underlying health conditions could help prevent line jumping. medicare might be in a good position to create a federally coordinated registration app, but they have no expertise in scheduling programs. therefore, there is no national covid app, and we are unlikely to get one."}
{"original": "another logistical problem is the observation period required after a person receives the jab. patients must remain socially distanced, but waiting rooms in most facilities aren't all that big. therefore, the rate at which people can be vaccinated is capped. to help address that, we need to work around the clock. after all, president-elect biden's goal of fully immunizing one million people a day translates to 1,388 vaccinations per minute (since two doses are required)."}
{"original": "angry politicians have made things worse. new york governor andrew cuomo's solution is to fine everyone. healthcare providers that are too slow to vaccinate will be fined $100,000, while those that speed things along by giving the vaccine too freely will be fined $1,000,000. the result is predictable: 54% of new york's vaccines are sitting idle, and some have been thrown in the trash. apparently, fines don't fix logistical problems."}
{"original": "the second challenge is vaccine refusal. disturbingly, a substantial proportion of frontline health care workers — about 50% in some locations — are refusing the vaccine. why?"}
{"original": "covid vaccine:why holding second doses of covid-19 vaccines in reserve is the wrong strategy"}
{"original": "anti-vaccine propaganda on social media always plays a role, but the problem is much bigger this time. one reason is that much of the public fears that the vaccines were rushed before being properly tested. this is not true, as the phase iii clinical trials enrolled over 30,000 volunteers for each vaccine.but the perception persists. names like operation warp speed probably didn't help."}
{"original": "in addition to sending a terrible message that frontline health care workers don't trust the health care system, vaccine refusal also worsens the labor shortage currently hitting hospitals, which in turn exacerbates all of the other logistical problems. what can be done?"}
{"original": "how to speed up the sluggish rollout"}
{"original": "two things. first, mass vaccination programs for the general public should occur in large spaces, such as mostly idle school gymnasiums and cafeterias. also, because so many people are working from home, there is a lot of empty retail space that could be converted into makeshift clinics."}
{"original": "second, it should be public health policy that frontline health care workers cannot refuse the covid vaccine. those who do should be given a choice: get the jab or lose your job."}

{"original": "intelligence officials have so far refused to tell congress how many unknowing americans have had their personal communications collected under the program."}
{"original": "civil liberties groups of all political stripes fear that the fbi and other federal agents could use the information collected on americans to search for evidence of domestic crimes — such as failing to pay taxes or minor drug offenses — without having to obtain a warrant as they normally would in such cases."}

{"original": "having failed to do so before she and president donald trump fly off to florida early on jan. 20, the day joe biden is sworn in as the 46th president of the united states, making the snub the first deliberate break in the 100-year-old first ladies' transfer-of-power tradition in decades."}
{"original": "in modern history, there has always been an invitation, this goes back to at least bess truman and mamie eisenhower (in 1952), says kate andersen brower, author of first women: the grace and power of america's modern first ladies."}
{"original": "during her time as first lady, trump, 50, made an effort to carry out some first-lady traditions she liked, but not this one."}
{"original": "instead, she posted a seven-minute farewell video on her twitter account, reflecting on her four unforgettable years in the white house, praising her own flotus be best agenda, and urging americans to remember that violence is never the answer and will never be justified."}
{"original": "usa today reached out to the east wing but so far trump has not commented on her failure to meet with jill biden. trump's chief of staff and spokeswoman, stephanie grisham, resigned abruptly in the wake of the deadly jan. 6 attack on the u.s. capitol by a mob pro-trump extremists."}
{"original": "we have not heard from the first lady's office, said michael larosa, spokesman for jill biden."}

{"original": "no, i don't think they're doing the traditional protocol, which is unfortunate, she said. but i think we're all ok with it."}
{"original": "earlier, the first lady posted an essay on the white house website last week denouncing both violence at the capitol and salacious gossip, unwarranted personal attacks and false misleading accusations she claimed were aimed at her, although she didn't explain."}

{"original": "the former fashion model, who has been an unusually low-key flotus, announced her unconventional approach early when she delayed moving into the white house by five months so her then-10-year-old son barron could finish the school term in new york."}
{"original": "once again breaking with tradition, says anita mcbride, who served as chief of staff for former first lady laura bush, who's now a fellow at american university who directs the first ladies initiative exploring their influence on politics, policy and global diplomacy."}
{"original": "the civic ritual of the first ladies' meet-and-greet just after the election may seem inconsequential but it's not, first lady historians say. it's at least as important as the usually simultaneous meeting of the outgoing and incoming presidents, which also did not happen."}
{"original": "president trump will be among a handful of outgoing presidents who skipped their successor's inauguration, and the first in more than 150 years. no one can think of a first lady who deliberately snubbed her successor, at least not in modern times."}
{"original": "it's one of the more visible customs that became a tradition, so that for the last 40-plus years or more, americans have grown accustomed to seeing the new first family invited to the white house in tandem with the president inviting the president-elect, mcbride says."}
{"original": "almost organically over the decades, this tradition has come to symbolize a kind of peaceful transfer of power, not to mention good manners and grace under pressure, mcbride and andersen brower say."}
{"original": "the point is conveying unity and continuity, and that is the most dramatic, visible display that the transfer has occurred – that the new first family has gone to the house, mcbride says."}
{"original": "ceremony matters. tradition matters, adds andersen brower. our expectations about what's normal and civil behavior in our society matters."}
{"original": "i know a tea in the residence between two powerful women married to presidents might seem quaint, but i believe in the power of these traditions to set the stage for civil relationships that lead to dialogues between people that can sometimes lead to action, she adds. michelle obama and laura bush were able to work together because of the relationship they forged early on."}
{"original": "obama in turn hosted trump at the white house days after the bitter november 2016 election campaign. both trumps had indulged the racist birther movement that asserted president barack obama was not born in the u.s., a slur the former first lady later said she never forgot and never forgave. but the two of them managed to convey civility as they discussed how to raise children in the white house fishbowl."}
{"original": "the ostensible purpose of the meeting is to give the incoming family a walk-through of the white house's private living quarters on the second and third floors and introduce them to the residence staff."}
{"original": "according to the white house historical association, 19th-century presidents-elect and their wives typically called on the sitting president and first lady once they arrived in washington, and sometimes the outgoing presidents hosted dinners or receptions for them. by the 20th century, this had changed. newspaper coverage suggests that the first well-documented first ladies meeting for tea and a tour of the white house took place in december 1920 when first lady edith wilson hosted her successor florence harding."}
{"original": "in fact, these meetings between first ladies have not always been sweetness and light even when the new administration is from the same party as the outgoing administration, as was the case with nancy reagan and barbara bush in 1989. their relationship was frosty at best, even though bush had served eight years as second lady in the reagan administration. their meeting was brief, occurring just nine days before the bushes were to move in, according to andersen brower."}
{"original": "in 1960, when mamie eisenhower welcomed ailing jacqueline kennedy (she had given birth to john jr. via a caesarian-section two weeks earlier) to the white house, that was awkward, too, according to andersen brower. aside from politics, the older, frumpier eisenhower resented younger, glamorous kennedy, and was reluctant to move out of the white house."}
{"original": "jackie had been told by the white house that she would be getting an invitation in mid-november, but mamie clearly had no interest in making a big announcement or a show of public affection to her young and beautiful successor. mamie was in control and she intended to relish her position, andersen brower wrote in her book."}
{"original": "the much-anticipated meeting was not revealed to reporters until five minutes after jackie had arrived."}
{"original": "other meetings between first ladies didn't happen because of tragedy or resignation: lady bird johnson became first lady suddenly in 1963 after the assassination of president john kennedy, but she welcomed her successor, pat nixon, in 1968."}
{"original": "betty ford became first lady in 1974 after president richard nixon resigned rather than be impeached, and her husband, then vice president gerald ford, became president, then lost his re-election bid in 1976 in part because he pardoned nixon. devastated by the loss, ford didn't really want to meet her successor rosalynn carter but she conducted a brief but cordial tour after president ford reminded her to be a good sport, andersen brower writes in her book."}
{"original": "the reason there's been no mingling of trumps and bidens at the white house is because the president never conceded he lost the election and has spent the last two months baselessly claiming he won by a landslide. he acknowledged the inevitable only in the wake of the riot at the capitol by a mob of his supporters whipped into a rage by trump at a rally down the street from capitol hill."}
{"original": "last week, melania trump, who only occasionally said or did anything to contradict her husband, recognized the obvious as well, saying it was the honor of my lifetime to serve as first lady."}
{"original": "she portrayed herself as a victim of shameful attacks from people who are looking to be relevant and have an agenda. this may have been an allusion to another call-out by her ex-friend stephanie winston wolkoff, who's been promoting her critical book about trump and charged in a daily beast essay that trump was as morally responsible for the mob as her husband."}
{"original": "once she was living in the white house, trump carried out other traditional first lady engagements, particularly those involving children, whom she made the focus of her be best initiative. except for the pandemic, she was always on hand for the annual easter egg roll and halloween party, and the annual visit to children's national hospital in washington."}
{"original": "she dutifully greeted the white house christmas tree's arrival every year and organized the holiday decorations, although a secret recording by wolkoff showed she really didn't care for that latter task. she hosted a record low of only two state dinners (a third was cancelled due to the pandemic in 2020), and enthusiastically revealed details of the table settings, menus and decor for both formal affairs."}
{"original": "for many americans who watched the violence engulf the u.s. capitol last week, the treatment of the rioters came down to a matter of black and white."}
{"original": "law enforcement officers responded slowly, and in some cases passively, as a largely white crowd that supported president donald trump trashed the seat of congress in a fit of violence that led to five deaths."}
{"original": "the images loomed in stark contrast to last year's black lives matter demonstrations, when mostly peaceful protesters decrying the constant killings of african americans by police were frequently met with rubber bullets, tear gas and a significant show of force by law enforcement."}
{"original": "no one can tell me that if that had been a group of black lives matter protesting yesterday, they wouldn't have been treated very, very differently than the mob of thugs that stormed the capitol, president-elect joe biden said, addressing the nation a day after last week's riot."}
{"original": "racism is the achilles heel of the united states, and the killing of george floyd, a black man, by a white minneapolis police officer; the death of breonna taylor who was shot in her apartment by louisville metro police officers; and a pandemic that is having a disproportionate impact on people of color, has vividly illustrated the vast economic and social inequalities woven into the american system."}
{"original": "race, particularly the hardened notions around black and white identity, is not rooted in biology. rather, scholars say, this stratification that has riven virtually every aspect of american life was a social construct that allowed an elite few to hoard wealth and power, justified the subjugation of those being exploited, and created a color divide that prevented the working class from uniting."}
{"original": "research shows that the racial wealth gap wasn't created because of something that individuals or families of color did wrong,'' says kilolo kijakazi, an institute fellow with the urban institute, a think tank focused on economic and social policy. it is driven by these structural barriers … policies, programs and institutional practices that facilitate the creation of wealth for white families while creating barriers to wealth accumulation by or stripping wealth from families of color.''"}
{"original": "in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic, those long-standing racial and economic disparities are putting african americans at greater risk of losing their jobs, their businesses, their homes, and their lives."}
{"original": "as a result of the downturn caused by the health crisis, 9.9% of african americans were out of work in december, in contrast to 6% of whites, 9.3% of latinos and 5.9% of asians."}
{"original": "african american entrepreneurs, long denied equal access to credit and capital, struggled to access the federal paycheck protection loans that kept some businesses afloat during the early months of the pandemic."}
{"original": "black- and brown-owned small businesses had less access to that relief,'' biden said on jan. 8 when announcing his economic and jobs team. he added that one-third of black-owned small businesses, as well as one-fifth of those owned by latinos and more than one-quarter of native american-owned businesses had less than a month of cash in reserve to handle expenses without more relief."}
{"original": "and the median wages paid to black workers, whether they lack a high school diploma or have a graduate degree, are less than whites at every level of education, according to kijakazi, citing analysis by the center for economic and policy research. that makes it harder to save and build a financial cushion to fall back on during hard times."}
{"original": "black people are striving for the american dream, but they're simply not getting the return on their investment,'' says andre perry, a brookings fellow who is the author of know your price: valuing black lives and property in america's black cities."}
{"original": "we're working, perry adds. we're going to school. we're buying homes. but predatory lending, job discrimination ... and racism is throttling economic mobility.''"}
{"original": "human beings, whether they're from senegal or syria, australia or the united states, share 99.9% of the same dna, and most of the differences represented by that fraction of a percent have no biologic relevance,'' says lawrence brody, director of the division of genomics and society at the national human genome research institute."}
{"original": "but in the past few hundred years, the development of the concept of race, and the assigning of status according to such distinctions, became a way to serve the self-interests of those who had, and wanted to maintain, power."}
{"original": "clearly, in modern times, it was just an excuse for domination,'' brody says."}
{"original": "anti-racism scholar ibram x. kendi traces the start of documented anti-black racist ideas to the chronicle of the discovery and conquest of guinea.'' the work, published in 1453, sought to justify exclusive trading in enslaved african captives by portugal's prince henry as an endeavor to expose them to christianity rather than as a way for him to build wealth."}
{"original": "the author, gomes eanes de zurara, essentially created the idea of multi-ethnic blackness that is inferior in the minds of racist thinkers, kendi said in an email. the captives had varying skin tones and represented several different peoples, but zurara deemed them a single group that was lesser and in need of salvation."}
{"original": "so, kendi says, racist notions became a way to justify the exploitation of african peoples."}
{"original": "a similar scenario would play out two centuries later across the atlantic, where wealthy british colonists would protect their power by creating a society that granted and denied opportunities, protections and basic rights along color lines. but those divisions, ultimately codified by law, were carved out over time."}
{"original": "though terms like negroe,' and indian'' were used during the early 17th century, the first time a law uses the word white'' to refer to a category of people in the english-speaking colonies that became the u.s. appears to have occurred in april 1691, according to terrance macmullan, professor of philosophy at eastern washington university and author of habits of whiteness: a pragmatist reconstruction, citing research by the historian theodore allen."}
{"original": "the law, passed by the colonial virginia legislature known as the house of burgesses, threatened banishment for any free white man or woman who married a negroe, mulatto, or indian man or woman bond or free,'' and essentially outlawed english women having sex with any man who was not white."}
{"original": "but disparate treatment for those who would be defined as white, and those who were deemed black, had begun decades before."}
{"original": "in 1640, john punch, an african man, ran off with two other servants, a dutchman and a scotsman. when the three men were caught, they were punished quite differently."}
{"original": "while the two europeans with white skin had to fulfill their period of indentured servitude and then spend another three years as servants to the colony, punch, a black man, was sentenced to bondage for the rest of his life."}
{"original": "they do the same thing, commit the same offense ... but the 'negro' will be in perpetual servitude,'' says deena hayes-greene, co-founder of the racial equity institute in greensboro, north carolina. that's beginning to create this wedge.''"}
{"original": "the virginia colony's wealthy planters became focused on keeping laborers from uniting and the virginia slave codes of 1705 were pivotal and onerous. they created white slave patrols, criminalized marriage between whites and people who were black or of mixed heritage, and expanded the rights of those who owned enslaved people, including giving them permission to kill those workers without consequence."}
{"original": "these poor white people who had been seeing themselves similarly oppressed with indigenous people and kidnapped and enslaved black people are now aligned with land-owning whites,'' hayes-greene says. the message was, 'you're not going to get what we get, but you'll get more than them. you can police them, you can oversee them, you can harm them in any way, and you'll be acquitted.'"}
{"original": "in 1790, after the united states had become a nation, whiteness officially became a requirement to vote, own land and to have other rights when the country's first rule of naturalization declared that only a free white person'' could be a citizen."}
{"original": "those early laws had long-ranging ramifications."}
{"original": "one of the continual questions about american politics is why americans across what we call race lines don't make common cause according to class,'' says nell irvin painter, author of the history of white people.'' and a lot of that is because of the really gut-level impossibilities for poor white people and working-class whites to see themselves together with poor and working-class nonwhite people.''"}
{"original": "the economic disadvantages black people face began most glaringly when those who were enslaved were denied the ability to profit from their own work, kijakazi says."}
{"original": "for black families, these policies began with human trafficking and bondage of people of african descent to build wealth for white people, while denying black people wealth from their own labor, she says."}
{"original": "long after the civil war, the ability of black americans to build and hold on to wealth continued to be hindered, whether it was discrimination that blocked them from getting more than menial jobs, the destruction of black businesses and homes by white mobs in cities like tulsa, oklahoma, or restrictive covenants and redlining that prevented black buyers from moving to white areas or getting loans to buy and build in neighborhoods of color."}
{"original": "many whites, however, do not believe discrimination has been an impediment to black americans getting ahead, according to a usa today analysis of a pew research center survey from early 2019. among those earning between $30,000 to $74,999 a year, 33% of whites believed racial bias was a significant reason african americans might have a harder time progressing than whites, compared with 79% of black americans who felt that way."}
{"original": "the wedge of race has made it more difficult to enact economic policies that could broadly benefit americans, regardless of background, particularly those who are lower income or part of the working and middle class, scholars and social justice experts say."}
{"original": "it's a part of the american ethos,'' says bishop william barber ii, co-chairman of the poor peoples campaign, regarding the use of race to divide people who he says should otherwise be allies."}
{"original": "president lyndon johnson, a texan who shepherded the most significant civil rights legislation of the past century, spoke of this dichotomy as well. according to a 1988 article in the washington post written by journalist and former johnson staff member bill moyers, johnson told him that, if you can convince the lowest white man he's better than the best colored man, he won't notice you're picking his pocket. hell, give him somebody to look down on, and he'll empty his pockets for you."}
{"original": "activists and scholars note that working-class americans broadly agree on policies that could lead to greater economic equity."}
{"original": "david madland, a senior fellow with the center for american progress, says his research found working-class americans, regardless of race, backed progressive economic policies and when given the opportunity to vote directly on ballot initiatives, supported changes like raising the minimum wage."}
{"original": "but the working class do not often get a direct say on economic issues,'' madland says. most often they are choosing between candidates .... some candidates seek to divide the working class along racial lines, often to avoid having to deal with the common economic issues that the working class of all races deal with.''"}
{"original": "an emphasis on those issues however could erase those divisions."}
{"original": "race can be a wedge,'' madland says. but a focus on progressive economic policies can help unify the working class."}
{"original": "cross-racial alliances have existed throughout u.s. history, from the abolitionists who fought to end slavery, through the early days of the labor movement, and up to the recent protests against police brutality and systemic racism that filled the nation's streets."}
{"original": "ann beeson, the former ceo of every texan, an austin, texas-based social justice advocacy group, says that while some politicians have resorted to racist dog whistles to argue against the affordable care act, both white texans and people of color have been united in demanding health care access."}
{"original": "there is no question that the conservative political resistance to medicaid expansion in the south is rooted in racism, beeson said. but it's important to distinguish between politicians and the grassroots ... because there is broad support from both people of color and rural and other white americans in actually pushing for medicaid expansion.''"}
{"original": "multiracial coalitions are also working to boost wages and secure job protections and benefits for the working class."}
{"original": "the labor movement has embodied both alliances and division. black and white workers in the south drew together during the reconstruction period that followed the end of the civil war, but were purposely divided when laws were passed to reinforce white supremacy, says mary kay henry, president of the service employees international union."}
{"original": "even without government intervention or politicians influence, parts of the labor movement excluded workers of color from joining. that's why i think this is a moment for our union and the rest of the labor movement to embrace the fight for racial justice and to integrate into it how we bargain on behalf of workers.''"}
{"original": "one recent union victory involved an agreement with swedish health services, a health system with multiple hospitals in washington state. workers bargained together and got management to agree to stand with nurses of color if a patient says they'd prefer a white nurse instead, the seiu says."}
{"original": "the poor peoples campaign has focused on mobilizing poor people of all backgrounds, organizing ... from alabama to appalachia,'' bishop barber says. he says that when campaign workers have told white coal miners in kentucky, for instance, that the same politicians who are supporting voter suppression laws have also voted against legislation that would raise wages, or allow them to unionize, invariably, in room after room, people see we're being played against each other.''"}

{"original": "dimitroff, the atlanta falcons general manager since 2008, has extremely deep ties with belichick. dimitroff's first nfl job was on the cleveland browns' grounds crew when his father was a scout and belichick was the coach."}
{"original": "dimitroff climbed the ranks before spending five years as the patriots' director of college scouting under belichick."}
{"original": "now belichick and the patriots stand in the way of the falcons' attempt to win their first super bowl."}
{"original": "it's a challenge dimitroff said he relishes."}
{"original": "this is kind of a dream game that way, to be able to go against the patriots and against one of my mentors in this league, dimitroff said friday."}
{"original": "dimitroff's respect for his former boss is obvious. he says new england is where he learned the most important lessons that prepared him for the opportunity in atlanta."}
{"original": "i learned a lot from my father and from different places i was at, of course, but it wasn't until i got to the patriots that i truly realized the idea at the core of the team concept, he said."}
{"original": "i mean, i grew up hearing it all the time, but actually being put into effect there in new england, i'll take that with me forever."}
{"original": "the falcons retained dimitroff when hiring coach dan quinn in 2015. the two formed a management partnership that produced atlanta's second super bowl berth, perhaps faster than either could have predicted."}
{"original": "though quinn was given ultimate control of player personnel decisions, the two appear comfortable sharing authority with no apparent sign of friction. dimitroff calls their relationship a partnership."}
{"original": "the coach and gm often are seen in warm embraces on the field after games, and dimitroff says they talk 10 or more times during a day on so many levels from policy to acquisitions to how we're going to replace lights in this (indoor practice) facility."}
{"original": "dimitroff says quinn is a general manager's dream to be with. quinn has started four rookies and four second-year players on defense this season."}
{"original": "the success of the young players, including rookies keanu neal, dion jones, de'vondre campbell and brian poole, is the best reward for a general manager and his scouts."}
{"original": "i mean, he has all kinds of nerve to go into this season and start four rookie defensive players, dimitroff said. to me, that's amazing. i've had countless personnel men call me and ... laud dan for that. that's what personnel men want, that's what general managers want."}
{"original": "quinn was willing to commit to the rookies because of their speed and athleticism. that's the falcons' new image, according to belichick."}
{"original": "i'd say the stamp on the team, the thing that i would notice the most is just the speed, the team speed that the falcons have, belichick said. they have a lot of fast guys. defensively they close up space very quickly."}
{"original": "quinn said when he interviewed with atlanta he was looking for a general manager who together we could share the whole vision of what a team could be."}
{"original": "dimitroff's vision bears the imprint of his time under belichick. the patriots' influence also comes from falcons assistant gm scott pioli, the former new england gm."}
{"original": "dimitroff signed a three-year extension on nov. 7 that carries through the 2019 season."}
{"original": "belichick said he remembers the young dimitroff in cleveland working in the organization when he was coming out of high school and into college."}
{"original": "but he's a football guy, so it's in the family, belichick said. he works hard. he knows the game. he did a real good job for us with skill players, defensive backs, receivers, linebackers, running backs, things like that."}

{"original": "as loan defaults multiplied and banks collapsed, lenders abruptly lost their appetite for risk and abandoned their former if you breathe, you qualify loan standards. the urban institute says lenders would have issued an additional 6.3 million mortgages between 2009 and 2015 if lending standards had been more reasonable — for example, like the pre-housing-crisis home loan requirements of 2001."}
{"original": "with such stringent loan criteria in place, homeownership rates in the u.s. fell sharply, especially for minority households, according to the pew research center."}
{"original": "» more: building financial health in the black community"}
{"original": "black and hispanic households today are still far less likely than white households to own their own homes — 41.3% and 47%, respectively, versus 71.9% for whites — and the homeownership gap between blacks and whites has widened since 2004, drew desilver, a senior writer at pew research center, wrote in a recent report."}
{"original": "pew research finds that black and hispanic home buyers have a harder time qualifying for conventional mortgages than white and asian applicants — and when approved, are typically charged higher interest rates."}
{"original": "in september 2016, fannie mae, the government-sanctioned company that buys many of the mortgages that lenders issue, unveiled two new credit scoring initiatives in its underwriting process. here's what those changes may mean, especially to borrowers of color."}
{"original": "fannie mae's automated loan-underwriting system is how nearly 2,000 lenders determine whether a borrower qualifies for a mortgage. among upgrades put in place late last year was the integration of trended credit data. this takes credit reporting beyond simply noting yes or no as to whether you paid a bill on time each month."}
{"original": "trended data actually takes into account the amount you pay, the level of revolving debt that you have and how that relates to your total available debt, says mike mondelli, senior vice president of transunion's alternative data services. it also compares the amount you paid with what the minimum due was."}
{"original": "it's a 24-month snapshot of borrowers' payment patterns. that allows lenders to better predict how borrowers might pay their bills going forward."}
{"original": "for example, consider two borrowers. one pays off the full balance each month or makes a payment higher than the minimum amount due. another makes only the minimum payment due. both pay on time, but if all else is equal, trended data might help a lender conclude that the first borrower is a lower credit risk."}
{"original": "use of trended data could move about 23 million people from a nonprime to a prime score categorization, mondelli says."}
{"original": "in 2015, more than one-quarter (27.4%) of black applicants were turned down for home loans, most commonly because of credit history issues, according to pew research. and people with subprime scores — generally considered to be below 670 — pay higher interest rates."}

{"original": "the updated fannie mae system also incorporates some alternative credit data, such as rent and utility payments, when it's available. mondelli says that information is just beginning to come into play."}
{"original": "while credit and debit card companies have been adopting alternative credit data, mortgage lenders are the last to make such moves, mondelli says."}
{"original": "trended data is the focus for now, particularly for mortgage lenders."}
{"original": "addressing the cause of tight credit"}
{"original": "karan kaul, a research associate for the housing finance policy center at the urban institute, doubts if either initiative will have a significant impact on minority homeownership."}
{"original": "it is a step in the right direction, and i think we need this step. we always want to improve our credit scoring models, kaul says. but at the same time … this doesn't address the root cause of why credit is tight."}
{"original": "urban institute research says lenders, for the most part, are still shying away from loosening lending restrictions because the scars of the housing crash remain fresh. and lenders are concerned about continued legal action and default risks."}
{"original": "the issue of tight credit is a structural problem that is, unfortunately, at this point deeply embedded into the mortgage market, and it's going to require a multipronged strategy, kaul says."}
{"original": "are minority borrowers getting a break?"}
{"original": "still, there may be some hope for minority borrowers. mindy armstrong kielmeyer, senior product manager at fannie mae, says all 1,800 lenders that use its underwriting system have access to the upgrades."}
{"original": "trended credit data provides additional information that we can take into consideration when a borrower is on the border of getting an 'approve' recommendation, kielmeyer told nerdwallet by email. and with alternative credit data, lenders can now underwrite loans for borrowers with no credit score, she says. since its implementation, we have seen hundreds of loan applications underwritten using this enhancement."}

{"original": "just months before the presidential election, facebook says it's taking steps to combat deepfakes, videos that have been manipulated using artificial intelligence to make it appear that someone has said or done something they haven't."}
{"original": "facebook is banning videos that are edited or synthesized to fool users but will allow parody and satire."}
{"original": "why now? many fear this insidious form of digital disinformation could be used to mislead voters, much the same way that fabricated news stories influenced public opinion in 2016."}
{"original": "so what are deepfakes anyway and just how worried should you be that the video you are watching isn't real?"}
{"original": "deepfakes are videos doctored using cutting-edge artificial intelligence, or ai, to distort reality. the technology, which analyzes real images to generate fake ones, is a growing form of disinformation and social media platforms have been struggling with how to deal with it."}
{"original": "facebook and other tech companies are sponsoring a deepfake detection challenge to encourage ai researchers to develop new ways to automatically detect doctored videos."}
{"original": "facebook disinformation:what you can do to stop its spread"}
{"original": "wait, is that video real? the dangers of manipulated recordings"}
{"original": "the ability to create fake videos or manipulate existing videos has been around for decades but typically required some software or skill. in recent years, tools have become popular on social media and elsewhere that allow anyone to manipulate images and video, though this footage usually appears obviously manipulated."}
{"original": "today, powerful new technologies are making it cheaper, faster and easier to produce deepfakes that are nearly indistinguishable from reality, says hao li, associate professor of computer science at the university of southern california."}
{"original": "there are also simpler but still effective ways to hoodwink social media users called cheap fakes, which typically involve editing videos to spread disinformation or propaganda."}
{"original": "digitally manipulated video is dangerous because we tend to have faith in what we see, li says. it's a real problem, and it's something that is advancing really quickly, he says. regulators and lawmakers are not catching up with this kind of technology."}
{"original": "facebook's new deepfake policy is too narrow, says hany farid, a computer science professor at university of california, berkeley specializing in digital forensics."}
{"original": "under the policy, facebook would not prohibit videos using lower-tech methods of spreading disinformation, such as last year's video of house speaker nancy pelosi which was edited to make it seem as though she was slurring her speech, monika bickert, vice president of global policy management, told lawmakers during a wednesday congressional hearing."}
{"original": "what they are saying is: if it's a misleading video of someone saying something they didn't say and it was created using this specific type of technology, deepfakes, then we reserve the right to take it down, but if it was generated using some other kind of technique, we don't have a problem with that, farid says. that doesn't really make sense. the issue is not how it was made, the issue is: is it misleading and is it harmful?"}
{"original": "why you should worry (no, really)"}
{"original": "rachel thomas, director of the center for applied data ethics at university of san francisco, says she expects cheap fakes and the more sophisticated deepfakes to proliferate ahead of the presidential election as part of shadowy campaigns to sway public opinion."}
{"original": "imagine a fake donald trump or a fake joe biden simulated saying a racial slur. then imagine how quickly those videos would spread on facebook or youtube."}
{"original": "the stakes are very high, thomas says. this kind of misinformation can have a big impact."}
{"original": "when used to target elected officials or political candidates, doctored video can erode trust. nearly two-thirds of americans recently surveyed by pew research said altered images and videos caused a great deal of confusion in understanding the basic facts of current events."}
{"original": "how can you tell if the video you're watching is a deepfake?"}
{"original": "that is becoming incredibly difficult. the technology behind fake videos is improving almost on a continuous basis, says siwei lyu, computer science professor at the state university of new york at albany and a member of the deepfake detection challenge's advisory group."}
{"original": "he recommends psychological preparedness, as in being constantly on the alert for videos, images and audio that have been altered."}
{"original": "whenever you see an interesting video showing something that is bizarre or exceptional, a certain vigilance should be raised, he says."}
{"original": "examine the video carefully before sharing it on social media. is the video low-resolution or grainy? is it a single person talking in the video? is it relatively short, say 30 seconds or 60 seconds long?"}
{"original": "is the lighting strange or the face discolored or blurry? is there blurriness between the face and neck or between the face and the hair? is the sound not synced with the images?"}
{"original": "some of the other tell-tale signs discernible to the naked eye, according to subbarao kambhampati, a computer science professor at arizona state university: different-sized eyes or ill-formed teeth, or more than two eyes, or inconsistencies in the background of the video."}
{"original": "but, says kambhampati, the rapid improvements in deepfake technology means that we will soon have to rely on ai techniques to detect what the human eye cannot."}
{"original": "there is not a 100% foolproof way of identifying deepfakes, not even for ai researchers, thomas says. detection is always going to be an arms race. as people develop more accurate detection algorithms, fakers will develop even more sophisticated frauds."}
{"original": "there are non-technical ways to sniff out a deepfake, just like other forms of disinformation. ask yourself: who is the person publishing this information? is this person reliable? what else has this person posted? are the claims in the post backed up by sources you trust?"}
{"original": "when in doubt, turn to nonpartisan fact-checkers who've spent hours, sometimes days, tracking down accurate information, farid says."}
{"original": "you never want to jump to a conclusion one way or another, you never want to say: i looked at this and i'm sure it's real or i looked at this and i'm sure it's fake, he says. the best you can really hope to do is to say: you know what? i should be careful here because i'm not sure, and then research it."}
{"original": "fair warning: it's going to get worse"}
{"original": "li says his company, pinscreen, will demonstrate for attendees of the world economic forum in davos how to livestream fake video."}

{"original": "washington capitals superstar alex ovechkin, recently named one of the captains for the upcoming nhl all-star game, has informed the league he won't be playing so he can better prepare for the second half of the regular season."}
{"original": "my body needs a rest, he said wednesday."}
{"original": "ovechkin, 33, clearly feels strongly about it, because nhl rules dictate that he will have to sit out a game for skipping the event."}
{"original": "the nhl started the one-game penalty in 2009 when detroit red wings superstars pavel datsyuk and nicklas lidstrom sat out to rest their bodies for the stretch run. the red wings appealed, but the nhl refused to back down. the one-game penalty, served in the team's first game after the all-star game, has been policy since."}
{"original": "because washington's bye week comes right after all-star weekend (jan. 25-26 in san jose), skipping this year's event has added appeal for ovechkin, who has played in seven previous all-star games."}
{"original": "in 2016, ovechkin and chicago's jonathan toews both skipped the asg and had to sit out a game."}
{"original": "this is bad news for the nhl because ovechkin is a major attraction at all-star games, often playing to fans at these events. however, he also has more reason to skip this season because the capitals played until june last year when they won the stanley cup."}

{"original": "the hall of famer's words were brief before practice wednesday, with some of the players meeting for the first time the former star of the franchise's showtime era in the 1980s."}
{"original": "he's going to come in here and try to make us better, get us back to winning, jordan clarkson said."}
{"original": "co-owner jeanie buss installed johnson as president of basketball operations after firing longtime general manager mitch kupchak and dismissing brother jim as executive vice president of basketball operations a day earlier."}
{"original": "everything happened so fast, rookie coach luke walton said. the initial thought is why do it right before the trade deadline, but magic came in and we got to work right away."}
{"original": "walton was processing his own conflicted emotions, having been close to kupchak and jim buss. he spoke to both men on the phone after their ousters, listening as they offered encouraging words about his bright future with the franchise and ability to work with the young roster."}
{"original": "it was definitely a little sad, walton said. it's important to really remember all the great things they did while they were here, too. on the other hand, you have earvin coming in. he's in there and making phone calls."}
{"original": "it was a strange feeling all day, honestly."}
{"original": "walton said johnson spent the last two days at the team's practice facility, talking with him and other employees about focusing on their individual jobs."}

{"original": "julius randle experienced the awe factor when johnson addressed the team."}
{"original": "he is going to be around, the power forward said. he has an open door policy to talk to him whenever we need to."}
{"original": "perhaps more important to the players than the front office shake-up was the absence of williams, who is headed to the houston rockets for corey brewer and a future draft pick, a deal that has yet to be confirmed by either team. rookie brandon ingram called williams' departure a real heartbreaker."}
{"original": "the 30-year-old guard led the lakers off the bench with 18.6 points per game. williams was a fourth-quarter spark and steadying presence in the locker room."}
{"original": "that was my vet, ingram said. he told me a lot of things on and off the court."}
{"original": "the lakers have yet to announce kupchak's replacement, although walton referenced speculation that agent rob pelinka would be hired as gm."}
{"original": "walton said he wasn't involved in the team's discussions with pelinka, who has been a frequent presence at lakers games as kobe bryant's agent."}
{"original": "i like rob, walton said. if it was someone i didn't like, i'd probably be disappointed."}
{"original": "the 16-time nba champion lakers come out of the all-star break with a record of 19-39, third-worst in the league. they are at oklahoma city on friday and host san antonio on sunday."}

{"original": "three former galena (reno, nev.) high school football players have sued the coach, principal and washoe county school district, alleging they were kicked off the team for standing up to the coach's bullying."}
{"original": "in the federal lawsuit filed wednesday, the three players allege they were kicked off the varsity football team after they stood up to coach steve struzyk for taunting and demeaning them during a dispute about an over-the-counter supplement. they also allege principal tom brown backed struzyk, telling the players that bullying behavior not allowed in the classroom is ok on the football field, according to the lawsuit."}
{"original": "terri keyser-cooper, who represents high school seniors mateo lemus, bryan madison and jake berger, said state law and the district's own anti-bullying policy prohibits such a double standard."}
{"original": "the public policy point we're trying to make is that this conduct is as prohibited on the athletic field as it is in the classroom, keyser-cooper said. this coach was over the top and played a significant role in harming these students and their future."}
{"original": "in a prepared statement, spokeswoman victoria campbell said the school district couldn't comment on the specifics of the lawsuit."}
{"original": "the district, however, takes all such allegations seriously and is looking into this matter, campbell said. based on its findings, the district will continue to adjust its policies, regulations, and training practices to ensure that all our children receive the highest quality education available in a safe and respectful learning environment."}
{"original": "we will also, when appropriate, vigorously defend the district's actions."}
{"original": "the three players had been co-captains of the football team this season and were recognized as star players for the school."}
{"original": "berger played running back and safety. he had 245 yards rushing and 41 yards receiving in three games. lemus played receiver and linebacker. he caught 10 passes for 137 yards and four touchdowns in the grizzlies' first three games. he also ran 10 times for 29 yards. and madison played receiver and free safety. he caught two passes for 40 yards and two touchdowns."}
{"original": "galena finished 2-7 and did not win a game after the players were dismissed the week of sept. 17. the season ended oct. 27."}
{"original": "struzyk completed his 15th season at galena. he couldn't be reached for comment."}
{"original": "what's so really traumatic for these kids is they were all planning on getting football scholarships, keyser-cooper said. football was an essential element of their life, to which they dedicated tremendous time and attention."}
{"original": "according to the lawsuit, the school discovered in september the three players had used a testosterone-enhancing supplement, boost elite, which is available over the counter. keyser-cooper said it was ultimately determined that the supplement was not prohibited by nevada interscholastic athletic association."}
{"original": "but struzyk was troubled by it. he called a meeting of the varsity players and angrily rescinded the trio's status as team captains."}
{"original": "struzyk placed a trash can in the middle of the room and with dramatic flourish ripped up the captain's papers for lemus, madison and berger, the lawsuit said. struzyk threw the ripped captains papers in a trash can he had positioned nearby. struzyk condemned lemus, madison and berger as a disgrace and unsuitable to be captains."}
{"original": "a few days later, struzyk called lemus into his office and interrogated him about his use of the supplement and whether he sold it to other players, which lemus denied. the lawsuit said the conversation took nearly 90 minutes as struzyk berated lemus, calling him a cancer on the team and belittling both his football and leadership skills."}
{"original": "when lemus tried to defend himself, the coach became enraged, the lawsuit said."}
{"original": "i'm not the kind of person to bend over and take this, lemus said, according to the suit."}
{"original": "you better learn to bend over if i tell you to, struzyk responded, according to the suit."}
{"original": "as the conversation spiraled, lemus felt that he was being forced to leave the team. he handed over his football gear and thanked struzyk for the opportunity to play, the lawsuit said."}
{"original": "in the days that followed, madison and berger approached struzyk, hoping to convince him to bring lemus back. struzyk angrily rejected their entreaty, kicked them out of his office and told them to turn their (stuff) in, according to the lawsuit."}
{"original": "when the boys and their parents asked principal brown to intercede, brown told them such language is just football talk. a district investigation into a bullying complaint filed by the players' parents found there is not enough corroborating evidence to substantiate school personnel violated the district's anti-bullying policies."}
{"original": "outside of the confrontation over the supplements, the players reported that abusive language by coaches was common during practices."}
{"original": "keyser-cooper acknowledged that tough language is common in athletics, but said abusive language shouldn't be accepted. she said the district's own policies prohibit it, pointing to a coaches handbook that advises coaches to treat players as they would treat their own children and to always act as a role model."}
{"original": "that way of treating football players is not supposed to happen, at least at the public high schools, she said."}
{"original": "she added that she doesn't believe these players are overly sensitive."}
{"original": "these guys have been around football their whole life, she said. it's not like they woke up one day and got offended because someone said something awful to them."}

{"original": "the request is for more combat engineers to install concertina wire and for more aircraft and crews to transport cbp officers. acting defense secretary patrick shanahan must review the request and determine how to provide the assistance. a decision is expected next week, said the officials who were not authorized to speak publicly."}
{"original": "dhs officials didn't immediately reply to a request for comment."}
{"original": "the dhs made the request as a standoff played out between president donald trump and congressional democrats about border security and how to respond to a large influx of migrants making their way across mexico from central america. trump insists the situation is a national emergency, but democrats have resisted wall funding without a more comprehensive overhaul of immigration policy."}
{"original": "trump initially called for the deployment of troops in october in a step that was criticized as an election-year ploy. the number of troops reached 5,800, but withdrawals began around the holidays as 4,000 troops remained. the current authorization for the deployment expires jan. 31, although an administration official said that could be extended."}
{"original": "the latest troop request comes during a partial government shutdown that has lasted two weeks and that trump said friday could last months longer. trump has demanded $5 billion, but democrats who now control the house have refused to provide that much. cbp officers are considered essential personnel who continue working during the shutdown."}
{"original": "trump has called the southern border sieve and said illegal immigration pours through it so physical barriers are needed."}
{"original": "trump met again friday with congressional leaders. schumer said afterward that the president was prepared for the shutdown for a very long period of time, months or even years, which trump confirmed at a later news conference. trump asked vice president mike pence, senior adviser jared kushner and homeland security secretary kirstjen nielsen to meet with congressional staffers during the weekend to discuss options."}
{"original": "we're not doing a wall, house speaker nancy pelosi, d-calif., said thursday."}
{"original": "sen. chuck schumer, the democratic leader from new york, said friday the shutdown made the border less secure because cbp officers were working without pay, immigration judges weren't being hired and a system for employers to check whether immigrants were eligible to work is offline."}

{"original": "given its recent history for war and turmoil it's not surprising that somalia's fledging effort at democracy has been marred by delays, corruption and allegations of vote-buying."}
{"original": "since october, people have gone to polling stations across the country to cast ballots as part of a complex process to choose members of parliament who will then vote for a new president and prime minister. the goal is to install the horn of africa nation's first representative leadership since dictator mohamed siad barre ousted a popularly elected government in a 1969 military coup."}
{"original": "he was overthrown in 1991, engulfing somalia in a bloody civil war — first between clan militias and then by the al-shabab terrorist group, which continues to control swaths of territory."}
{"original": "the last 25 years have been particularly bad with ... the state destroyed, said michael keating, the u.n. special representative for somalia. this is the first time since 1969 that the somalis are attempting to put together a rules-based process involving quite a large number of people to bring about a peaceful transfer of power."}
{"original": "though somalis were promised a direct election for 2016, political leaders instead designed an indirect vote: 14,025 delegates chosen by 135 clan elders are electing members of the lower house of parliament. the clan elders are choosing the upper house members, and the two houses of parliament will then elect a president and prime minister by late january."}
{"original": "the country's last parliamentary election took place in 1984, but was hardly democratic: strongman siad barre only allowed voters to approve a list of 171 members of parliament his regime had chosen."}
{"original": "an indirect process was created for the latest elections, because somalia has no court system to handle any election disputes and no national census to register voters."}
{"original": "for many somalis, the lack of promised universal suffrage represents a continuation of government by a powerful elite."}
{"original": "we are hearing that corruption is high. we are hearing people have been excluded from becoming candidates, and regional administrators are abusing their power, said mursal saney, deputy director of the heritage institute for policy studies in mogadishu. it's unfair to empower a political elite that already was dominated and to keep others outside the power."}
{"original": "during negotiations by clan elders on who to choose, seats were being sold for as much as $1.3 million, according to one official involved in the electoral process who was not authorized to discuss the issue publicly."}
{"original": "in a country where 73% of the population lives below the poverty line, many somalis see the widespread graft as an indication that the elites aren't serving the country's pressing needs. we as a civil society would like for the money that is being spent on vote-buying to be spent on the establishment of social services like schools, hospitals, clean water, electricity, said abdullahi m. shirwa of somalia peace line, a non-profit group in this capital city."}

{"original": "throughout trump's presidency, cheney has remained a loyal republican vote but has repeatedly come out against the president over his rhetoric and some foreign policy decisions."}
{"original": "in recent months, cheney's criticisms of the president have grown stronger. she's taken veiled jabs at trump over his refusal to wear a mask, publicly asked him to stop using his twitter account to accuse an msnbc media host of murder and pushed trump for answers after media reports surfaced showing russians had offered bounties to the taliban for killed u.s. troops."}
{"original": "and before backing trump's removal, cheney vehemently opposed pro-trump efforts by some of her republican colleagues to object to counting electoral college results in certain swing states, saying on twitter that congress has no authority to overturn elections by objecting to electors. doing so steals power from the states & violates the constitution."}
{"original": "washington — the partial shutdown of the u.s. government has begun to make it harder to assess the health of the economy by delaying or distorting key reports on growth, spending and hiring."}
{"original": "government data on home construction and retail sales, for example, won't be released next week because staffers who compile those reports have been furloughed. the retail sales report provides a snapshot of consumer spending, which fuels more than two-thirds of the economy. with macy's and kohl's having said thursday that their holiday sales were weaker than expected, a broader gauge of retail spending would have provided important clarity."}
{"original": "in addition, the next report on the economy's overall growth, set for jan. 30, won't be released if the shutdown remains in effect. even if the government has fully reopened by then, federal workers won't likely have had enough time to produce the scheduled report on the nation's gross domestic product."}
{"original": "not all agencies are closed. congress approved funding last year for the labor department, so the government's next monthly jobs report will be released as scheduled on feb. 1. but it's unclear how long the department will be able to issue jobs reports — the most closely watched barometer of the economy — after that."}
{"original": "though the economy remains healthy in most respects, there are rising concerns that growth could slow or even stall in coming months. the trade war between the united states and china, which has helped depress global growth, is likely slowing business investment. the stimulus from the trump administration's tax cuts is expected to fade."}
{"original": "and borrowing costs have risen since the federal reserve raised short-term interest rates four times last year. before rebounding this week, stock markets had plummeted roughly 16 percent from their peak oct. 2."}
{"original": "fed officials are now stressing their flexibility on rate hikes, emphasizing that they will be patient and their policy data dependent. by this, the fed means that the government's latest readings on hiring, inflation and growth will factor heavily in its rate decisions. yet much of that data will now be unavailable — to the fed or anyone else."}
{"original": "for us, one of the biggest effects of the shutdown has been around data, raphael bostic, president of the fed's atlanta regional bank, said wednesday. we're worrying about that."}
{"original": "even some reports that are released on schedule are likely to be distorted by the shutdown. for example, the january jobs report may show an artificially high unemployment rate and low employment figure. that's because up to 380,000 federal employees who aren't working or being paid during the shutdown — but who will return to work afterward — could be counted as unemployed for january."}
{"original": "if so, that would raise the unemployment rate by 0.2 percentage point, estimated ben herzon, an economist at macroeconomic advisers, a forecasting firm. and the monthly job count could decline by 380,000 if the shutdown continues through the end of january, herzon said. that could push the monthly job figure into negative territory."}
{"original": "if all the federal workers eventually receive back pay, as occurred after previous shutdowns, then the january jobs report would later be revised to restore those 380,000 jobs, according to the labor department's bureau of labor statistics."}
{"original": "future jobs reports could be jeopardized, too, if the government remains shut down. the census bureau conducts the monthly surveys that the bls uses to calculate the unemployment rate. census is part of the commerce department, which remains closed during the shutdown. as a result, it's unclear if future jobs reports will be released if the shutdown continues, the bls said."}
{"original": "other economic reports have already been missed. they include a monthly report on factory orders that was scheduled for monday. that report typically provides insights into how much u.s. companies are spending on large equipment."}
{"original": "inflation data will also be affected: the consumer price index will be released friday morning as scheduled, because it is prepared by the labor department. but the fed's preferred inflation gauge is published by commerce's bureau of economic analysis, which is closed."}
{"original": "and because the agriculture department is closed, future reports on wholesale prices and import prices won't include farm-related data, the bls said thursday."}
{"original": "a report on the number of people seeking unemployment benefits, considered a nearly real-time reflection of layoffs, is still being published. but it could be distorted by the shutdown: nearly 5,000 federal employees sought benefits two weeks ago, according to the latest data available, roughly five times the usual figure."}
{"original": "and only a portion of the government's report on productivity, or output per hour worked, will be released feb. 6, the labor department said. that's because that report requires data on the growth of gdp, the broadest measure of the economy."}
{"original": "even after the government fully reopens, weeks will likely be needed before all the postponed reports can be prepared and released."}
{"original": "it may take some time to get a 'clean' read on the economy, economists at bank of america merrill lynch said thursday."}
{"original": "washington — the senate ethics committee released its annual report this week declaring that for the ninth straight year, it imposed no disciplinary sanctions against anyone in 2015. since 2007, the committee has received 613 allegations of wrongdoing and has summarily dismissed more than 90% of them. only 75 have had even a preliminary investigation."}
{"original": "the total of the committee's discipline during the nine-year period is a half-dozen letters the committee has written to senators saying, basically, you should not have done that. the committee did not issue activity reports prior to 2007, and did not respond to a request for comment on this story."}
{"original": "the committee's activity reports indicate that in nearly every case, allegations are dismissed because there are not enough facts to prove wrongdoing (13 of 55 cases last year) or there is no senate rule governing the alleged activity (36 of 55 cases). in seven cases last year, the ethics committee carried out preliminary inquiries; five of those were dismissed as inadvertent or minor technical violations. none of those cases was made public by the committee."}
{"original": "these results raise all kinds of red flags, said meredith mcgehee, policy director at the non-partisan campaign legal center. it begs credulity that there have been no ethics violations worthy of disciplinary sanction since 2007 in the entire senate. the fact is the senate ethics committee has become the 'dead letter' office."}
{"original": "the lack of public punishments may simply reflect that the committee has not found any violations that rise to that level, said stanley brand, an ethics lawyer who has advised the committee and also advised lawmakers under investigation. you don't start out saying we have a quota of members of the senate that we are going to prosecute, brand said. there has to be a probable cause for every investigation. ethics watchdog groups want every peccadillo to be investigated like a federal crime and i don't think that's the way it should work."}
{"original": "a coalition of government watchdogs, including the campaign legal center, sent letters to senate leaders in 2014 urging them to reform the committee and create an independent ethics office modeled after the house office of congressional ethics, which reviews ethics allegations and makes recommendations to the house ethics committee for further action. oce reports become public even if the ethics committee rules that there was no violation, which has made the office wildly unpopular among lawmakers."}
{"original": "the last time the senate ethics committee issued any kind of public scolding was a may 2012 letter to then-sen. tom coburn, saying that he should not have held an official meeting with doug hampton, a former aide to then-sen. john ensign, r-nev., who had become a lobbyist but was still barred from lobbying the senate. the incident was part of ensign's messy affair with hampton's wife; coburn had intervened to counsel hampton on his departure from ensign's office and the committee concluded it should have known he was still under a lobbying ban. ensign resigned while the ethics committee was investigating him."}
{"original": "senate ethics has a reputation of being a black hole for allegations, said jordan libowitz of the left-leaning watchdog group citizens for responsibility and ethics in washington. information tends to go into the committee and nothing comes out of it."}
{"original": "libowitz said the committee tends to be more interested in protecting the individual senators and staffers instead of the institution."}
{"original": "the committee serves both as the ethics cop and the ethics adviser to the senate. in 2015, the ethics committee handled approximately 10,265 telephone inquiries and 2,784 inquiries by email for ethics advice and guidance and wrote 930 advisory letters on how to avoid conflicts of interest or improper gifts, according to the new activity report."}
{"original": "by comparison, from january 2013 through december 2014, the house ethics committee launched 53 investigations, created four subcommittees to probe specific matters and issued 19 publicly disclosed resolutions as well as 43 resolutions that were confidential, according to an activities report it issued a year ago."}
{"original": "it's no secret that most americans are woefully unprepared for retirement. according to a report from the economic policy institute, the median family between the ages of 32 and 61 has just $5,000 saved in a retirement account, while almost half of workers have no retirement savings whatsoever."}
{"original": "given the many expenses you'll face as a senior, it pays to get your hands on as much retirement money as possible. so this year, when you think about your 401(k) strategies and goals, don't make the same mistake a good 25% of workers are currently making: passing up an employer match."}
{"original": "how much free money are we giving up?"}
{"original": "employer matches weren't always the norm, but these days, companies seem to be getting more generous. an estimated 92% of companies that offer a 401(k) plan are willing to match employee contributions up to a certain amount. unfortunately, 25% of workers don't contribute enough to capitalize. the result? we're leaving an astounding $24 billion in unclaimed matching dollars on the table each year."}
{"original": "in fact, the average employee who doesn't receive a full company match passes up $1,336 annually. and not surprisingly, it's lower earners – those who need that extra money the most – who are increasingly likely to miss out. among those earning less than $40,000 a year, 42% don't contribute enough to pocket company matching dollars in their entirety. higher earners – those making more than $100,000 a year – are far more likely to get a full match, though 10% still end up falling short."}
{"original": "age is a factor here, too. employees under the age of 30 are about twice as likely to miss out on employer matching dollars than those over the age of 60. and while workers are more likely to claim their full employer match as they get older, this trend is interrupted when they reach their mid-30s and only picks back up in their mid-40s – presumably because during this time, child care expenses and obligations eat up much of the money they'd otherwise allocate to retirement savings."}
{"original": "but no matter your reason for passing up free money, it's a major mistake, and one that might prove costlier than anticipated in the long run. the thing to remember about passing up a 401(k) match is that you're not just losing out on the base amount you fail to collect; you're also forgoing the opportunity to grow that money into a larger sum."}
{"original": "let's assume you pass up $1,336 a year for 20 years, during which time your investments could've generated a somewhat-conservative 6% average annual return. first of all, over the course of 20 years, that's $26,720 less in your 401(k) right off the bat. but if you take growth potential into account, you're actually missing out on $49,000 – almost double."}
{"original": "now think about what $49,000 might do for your retirement. for one thing, it gives you an extra $200 a month in spending money over a 20-year stretch. furthermore, it's money that could go a long way toward travel, paying off your mortgage or tackling the mountain of medical bills you're likely to face as you age."}
{"original": "no matter how old you are or how much you earn, here's your takeaway from all of this: do what it takes to collect that employer match. otherwise, you're putting your retirement at risk."}
{"original": "if you're living paycheck to paycheck, contributing to a 401(k) can be easier said than done, so here are a few ways to eke out some additional savings:"}
{"original": "bank whatever extra money comes your way. whether it's a bonus, a tax refund, or an unexpected inheritance, take your found money and put it into your 401(k). if you weren't counting on it to begin with, you should have less of a problem socking it away."}
{"original": "cut back on one major spending category. if you take one large expense and lower it, whether it's housing, transportation or food, you might feel the effects less so than you would by cutting numerous corners elsewhere. think about it: you're probably better off living in a smaller apartment and shaving $300 off your rent than slashing your cable package, getting rid of your internet service, and being homebound every friday and saturday night to save money on leisure."}
{"original": "consider some part-time work. if your current paycheck is truly maxed out but you have a hobby or talent you can monetize, a little effort might bring in some much-needed cash. it's far better than spending three evenings a week rotting away at a telemarketing center. that said, if your only option is that less appealing job, take it, at least temporarily, if it will give you enough cash to get that full match."}
{"original": "it's not often that free money comes your way, so if you have a chance to get your hands on some extra retirement cash with no strings attached, you'd be crazy not to take advantage. and while it might require some sacrifice now, your 65-year-old self will be unquestionably grateful down the line."}

{"original": "less than 24 hours after trump's conversation with raffensperger was made public, the first formal calls for a criminal inquiry came monday from reps. ted lieu, d-calif., and kathleen rice, d-n.y., who urged the fbi to open an immediate criminal investigation."}
{"original": "the evidence of election fraud by mr. trump is now in broad daylight, the lawmakers said in a letter to fbi director christopher wray."}
{"original": "the fbi acknowledged it received the referral but declined further comment."}
{"original": "the justice department also declined to comment."}
{"original": "raffensperger, in an interview on abc's good morning america, said an appropriate venue for an investigation would probably be the fulton county, georgia, district attorney's office."}
{"original": "district attorney fani willis, a democrat, said her office stood ready to investigate if a case was referred to prosecutors."}
{"original": "like many americans, i have found the news reports about the president's telephone call with the georgia secretary of state disturbing, willis said in a statement."}
{"original": "as i promised fulton county voters last year, as district attorney, i will enforce the law without fear or favor, she said. anyone who commits a felony violation of georgia law in my jurisdiction will be held accountable."}
{"original": "lieu and rice said their joint request to the fbi centered on provisions of two federal election fraud statutes and one georgia law, which they say trump may have breached during his call saturday with raffensperger and the secretary of state's general counsel."}
{"original": "the lawmakers called specific attention to trump's demands for georgia officials to find 11,780 votes to overturn the biden victory."}
{"original": "and there's nothing wrong with saying, you know, um, that you've recalculated, trump told the officials, according to a recording of the conversation obtained by the washington post."}
{"original": "lieu and rice said the president's request for a recalculation of the vote represented a solicitation of election fraud in violation of federal and state laws."}
{"original": "we request that if you believe mr. trump also violated state criminal law, that you refer the state violations to the georgia attorney general or the appropriate district attorney in georgia, the lawmakers said in the letter to wray."}
{"original": "at a briefing late monday afternoon in atlanta, gabriel sterling, the state's voting system manager, said he was not aware of discussions about the prospect of a criminal investigation."}
{"original": "asked to assess the president's call, sterling said, i personally found it to be something that was not normal, out of place. nobody i know who would be president would do something like that to a secretary of state."}
{"original": "nick akerman, an assistant special prosecutor during the watergate investigation, said trump's call to raffensperger is not much different from wiretapped conversations involving mafia bosses he heard during his years as a federal prosecutor."}
{"original": "akerman said he was particularly struck by trump's suggestion that it's going to be very costly if the state official doesn't recount votes in a way that favors trump."}
{"original": "so tell me, brad, what are we going to do? said trump, who was joined on the call by white house chief of staff mark meadows and the president's lawyers. we won the election, and it's not fair to take it away from us like this. and it's going to be very costly in many ways. and i think you have to say that you're going to reexamine it, and you can reexamine it, but reexamine it with people that want to find answers, not people that don't want to find answers."}
{"original": "more:trump travels to georgia before senate runoff that will decide control of senate"}
{"original": "akerman said the words represented a threat."}
{"original": "(trump) doesn't come right out and say, 'you're going to be in big trouble.' … when he says it's going to be costly, i think everybody knows what that means, he said. it's specific enough and vague enough that you know what he's talking about. who would it be costly to? i mean, come on. … it was a veiled threat saying, 'you better take care of this and find me these ... votes or you'll be in trouble.'"}
{"original": "people get the message. … it doesn't take much. it's all there. it's right out of 'the godfather,' akerman said."}
{"original": "the former manhattan federal prosecutor characterized the call as part of a pattern of criminal activity by the president, referring to trump's call in 2019 when he repeatedly urged ukrainian president volodymyr zelensky to investigate biden, then his potential presidential rival. akerman also cited the instances of possible obstruction outlined in special counsel robert mueller's report on the russia investigation and the presidential pardons he has granted to allies convicted in the russia inquiry."}
{"original": "mueller, who refused to clear trump of criminal wrongdoing, said charging him with obstruction was not an option because of a long-standing justice department policy against prosecuting a sitting president. after trump leaves office this month, that policy would no longer be relevant should prosecutors pursue an investigation."}
{"original": "this is the way he operates. you can't look at (the call to georgia officials) myopically. you have to look at this whole pattern of activity, akerman said. if i were a prosecutor and i was given this case, i would be looking at … the federal racketeering statute."}
{"original": "as jarring as trump's words sounded on the recording, some former prosecutors said, building a criminal case probably would be difficult."}
{"original": "proving the criminal intent behind the words that trump used during the calls is the biggest hurdle, said david weinstein, a former miami federal prosecutor. i ... can make an argument that (trump) was encouraging raffensperger to create fraudulent evidence or simply change the numbers. alternatively, i can make an argument that trump was simultaneously actively extorting raffensperger to do the same, with a threat of criminal prosecution behind that suggestion."}
{"original": "weinstein said trump defenders would probably argue that the president was puffing and simply suggesting other alternatives, not actively extorting or encouraging raffensperger to break the law."}
{"original": "the prosecution would then have to show proof that trump went beyond that and that it created a reasonable belief in raffensperger's mind that he was being extorted or forced to break the law, he said."}
{"original": "brian kelly, who was head of the public corruption unit of the u.s. attorney's office in boston and was among the attorneys who prosecuted organized crime boss whitey bulger, said he does not believe the biden justice department will – or should – pursue a criminal investigation based on trump's call."}
{"original": "proving election law violations are very difficult. if president trump believes there are actually additional legitimate votes which need to be counted, then he is certainly within his rights to urge state officials to find them and count them, kelly said. it's a waste of time, and it's inappropriate to use the criminal justice system to settle political scores."}
{"original": "patrick cotter, a former federal prosecutor who oversaw numerous cases against organized crime figures, said a case against trump would face political obstacles."}
{"original": "because trump is an elected official who has just lost an election, he and his supporters would claim that any criminal prosecution was politically motivated, cotter said. leaving aside the political difficulties of such a situation, the ability to ever seat a jury that was not infected with trump's false claims of a political motivation for the charges would be a serious obstacle to conviction. not insurmountable in my opinion, but significant."}
{"original": "cotter said it was hard to separate the trump recording from cases involving the conversations of known criminals – with a few exceptions."}
{"original": "i would note that the majority of the mafioso i prosecuted or investigated would never have exhibited the astounding stupidity and obviousness of the trump gang on that call, cotter said. more intelligent criminals would never have made such threats on a call they should have expected was being recorded."}
{"original": "washington and georgia require only one-party consent for recording phone calls. somewhere i imagine john gotti is shaking his head and muttering, 'freakin' amateurs,' cotter said."}
{"original": "opinion: impeach trump over new threats"}
{"original": "to understand events around the world today, one must think in terms of the class struggle."}
{"original": "this sentence sounds like something that could be written by a doctrinaire marxist. but it is nonetheless true. much of the current tension in america and in many other democracies is in fact a product of a class struggle. it's not the kind of class struggle that karl marx wrote about, with workers and peasants facing off against rapacious capitalists, but it is a case of today's ruling class facing disaffection from its working class."}
{"original": "in the old soviet union, the marxists assured us that once true communism was established under a dictatorship of the proletariat, the state would wither away and everyone would be free. in fact, however, the dictatorship of the proletariat turned into a dictatorship of the party hacks, who had no interest whatsoever in seeing their positions or power wither."}

{"original": "on syria, trump is right to ignore failed foreign policy elites who embroiled us in iraq"}
{"original": "yugoslav dissident milovan djilas called these party hacks the new class, noting that instead of workers and peasants against capitalists, it was now a case of workers and peasants being ruled by a managerial new class of technocrats who, while purporting to act for the benefit of the workers and peasants, somehow wound up with the lion's share of the goodies. workers and peasants stood in long lines for bread and shoddy household goods, while party leaders and government managers bought imported delicacies in special, secret stores. (in a famous soviet joke, then-leader leonid brezhnev shows his mother his luxury apartment, his limousine, his fancy country house and his helicopter only to have her object: but what if the communists come back?)"}
{"original": "djilas' work was explosive — he was jailed — because it made clear that the workers and peasants had simply replaced one class of exploiters with another. it set the stage for the soviet union's implosion, and for the discrediting of communism among everyone with any sense."}
{"original": "elites of postwar institutions don't want change"}
{"original": "but the new class isn't limited to communist countries, really. around the world in the postwar era, power was taken up by unelected professional and managerial elites. to understand what's going on with president donald trump and his opposition, and in other countries as diverse as france, hungary, italy and brazil, it's important to realize that the post-world war ii institutional arrangements of the western democracies are being renegotiated, and that those democracies' professional and managerial elites don't like that very much, because they have done very well under those arrangements. and, like all elites who are doing very well, they don't want that to change."}
{"original": "the postwar era saw the creation of international institutions ranging from nato to the united nations to the world bank, along with a proliferation of think tanks and nongovernmental organizations (ngos) to accompany them. it saw the vast expansion of higher education in the united states, and the transformation of academic degrees into something close to must-haves for the upper-middle class. it saw a great expansion of power on the part of media organizations, and on the part of government bureaucrats and lobbyists, both of whose numbers increased enormously."}
{"original": "but after the turn of the millennium, other americans, much like the workers and peasants in the old soviet union, started to notice that while the new class was doing quite well (america's richest counties now surround washington, d.c.), things weren't going so well for them. and what made it more upsetting was that — while the soviet union's apparatchiks at least pretended to like the workers and peasants — members of america's ruling class seemed to view ordinary americans with something like contempt, using terms such as bitter clingers, deplorables and flyover people."}
{"original": "class wars in america disguised as culture wars"}
{"original": "suddenly, to a lot of voters, those postwar institutional arrangements stopped looking so good. but, of course, the beneficiaries showed no sign of giving them up. this has led to a lot of political discord, and a lot of culture war, since in america class warfare is usually disguised as cultural warfare. but underneath the surface, talk is a battle between the new class and what used to be the middle class."}
{"original": "if you look at the yellow jacket protests in france, the election of brazilian president jair bolsonaro and events in places like italy and hungary — or, for that matter, the brexit movement in britain — you find a similar unhappiness with institutional arrangements and the sleek and self-satisfied elites who benefit from them. people who, in president bill clinton's famous phrase, worked hard and played by the rules now suspect that the rules were rigged, and that they were treated as chumps."}
{"original": "talking about the yellow-vest movement, french geographer christophe guilluy observes: immediately, the protesters were denounced as xenophobes, anti-semites and homophobes. the elites present themselves as anti-fascist and anti-racist, but this is merely a way of defending their class interests. it is the only argument they can muster to defend their status, but it is not working anymore."}
{"original": "that's right. it's class war masquerading as something else, but people have seen through the mask."}
{"original": "understanding this won't make the conflict less intense, but it might make it clearer what's really at stake. what's happening in america is an echo of what's happening in democracies around the world, and it's not happening because of trump. trump is the symptom of a ruling class that many of the ruled no longer see as serving their interest, and the anti-trump response is mostly the angry backlash of that class as it sees its position, its perquisites and — perhaps especially — its self-importance threatened."}

{"original": "i've conducted somewhere around 10,000 interviews in my 40 years as a journalist, but one in particular has been on my mind lately."}
{"original": "it was my sept. 12, 2016, face-to-face meeting with longtime usa gymnastics team doctor larry nassar."}
{"original": "the reflection was spurred by days of raw, emotional testimony over the last week in a michigan courtroom. more than 100 amazingly strong women detailed the physical and mental struggles they experienced after being sexually assaulted by nassar under the guise of medical treatment."}
{"original": "their horror stories have been covered live on tv and spread across the internet, attracting worldwide attention to what many are calling the worst sex abuse scandal in american sports. nassar, a 54-year-old physician who also worked at michigan state university, faces up to 125 years in prison. and whatever sentence he receives won't even begin until he completes a 60-year sentence handed down last month in a federal child porn case."}
{"original": "i was part of the indystar investigative team, along with mark alesia and marisa kwiatkowski, that first exposed nassar's crimes in a story published sept. 13, 2016. to the best of my knowledge, i was the first — and still the only — journalist to interview nassar about the sexual abuse allegations."}
{"original": "nassar came to our attention about a month before the interview. it was aug. 4, 2016. that was the same day we published a story revealing usa gymnastics officials kept sexual abuse complaint files on scores of coaches, but failed to report many of those allegations to law enforcement. it was part of an internal executive policy."}
{"original": "among the many gymnasts who contacted us in the days after that story ran were three who wanted to share stories about a treatment they received from nassar as minors struggling with sports injuries. looking back now, the young women told us, they were convinced they had been sexually assaulted."}
{"original": "hearing their remarkably similar accounts, we set out to see if there was something to the story. my job was to learn about nassar's alleged use of an invasive, intravaginal procedure, then try to arrange an interview with the gymnastics and sports medicine icon."}

{"original": "my next option was to send emails to nassar at both his msu and personal accounts. i didn't expect a response. so when i checked my email the next morning, i was surprised to see two messages from nassar in my inbox."}
{"original": "i am very sorry for what has occurred with this misunderstanding of my medical care. it saddens me greatly to think that these gymnasts feel i offended them when i was trying to help them, the first said."}
{"original": "i think it would be best for us to meet and discuss this so you have a good understanding of these procedures. i would like to meet at my house next week, thursday morning at 9:30 am if that works for you. i would like the meeting to be private between you and i to openly discuss this."}
{"original": "the second email from nassar was sent about an hour after the first."}
{"original": "my wife told me this morning that i should talk to my lawyer first about our meeting and meet with the lawyer instead of at our house. that may be best. ok? larry."}
{"original": "i quickly wrote back to nassar. i offered to meet him that night or the next day. i also sent nassar my cell phone number. later that afternoon, nassar's then-attorney, matthew borgula, called me. he wanted to know more about the allegations and discuss the possibility of an interview. i asked for a few minutes to gather the team and our editors in a conference room, then called borgula back."}
{"original": "by then, borgula told us, he and nassar were aware that one of the women who contacted us also had filed a complaint with msu police."}
{"original": "he may be willing to talk to you, borgula said. there is a serious risk of destroying this man's reputation just based on the mere allegations of some sort of sexual assault."}
{"original": "anguish, courage:here are some of the most empowering moments from larry nassar's victim testimony"}
{"original": "borgula, who had been hired to look into allegations surrounding nassar's departure from usa gymnastics and communicate the doctor's position, declined to comment monday citing attorney-client privilege."}
{"original": "it's not clear what the attorney knew at that time, but his willingness to make nassar available for an interview suggests he didn't know the full story."}
{"original": "but in that call, borgula issued the first of what would be several denials on behalf of nassar. he said that the doctor said he never used any procedure involving vaginal penetration. i told him that claim was contrary to what the three women alleged."}
{"original": "he adamantly denies any wrongdoing. he adamantly denied any intravaginal examinations and he's never had any type of an exam or procedure done on a minor without the mother present, borgula said."}
{"original": "months later nassar would plead guilty to penetrating underage athletes. and testimony last week revealed he often treated girls alone in hotel rooms and training rooms."}
{"original": "but that wasn't the story nassar was telling in 2016. he's a well-respected doctor, borgula said. he's had thousands of patients. he's been honored in various different capacities and he feels like he's being thrown in with other investigations that have nothing to do with him. so i appreciate you giving him the opportunity to respond."}
{"original": "the conversation ended with an invitation to meet with nassar and burgola at the attorney's office in grand rapids. i again suggested the next day, which was a thursday, but borgula said he was tied up the rest of week. he said we could meet the following monday."}
{"original": "i want him to have a chance to respond before you put his name in that paper, borgula said, because he's adamant he's done nothing wrong and he thinks this is going to destroy his career."}
{"original": "that monday, i left home at 6 a.m. for the drive to grand rapids to meet nassar and his attorney at borgula's office. my colleagues were busy working other angles."}
{"original": "the nassar i encountered wasn't the broken man the world saw last week, head down in a courtroom listening to dozens of victims describe how his abuse ripped apart their innocent, young lives. he was not the same man who wrote the judge a six-page letter complaining about the emotional distress he experienced listening to the survivors."}
{"original": "i saw the confident larry nassar, buoyed by a reputation as a caring miracle-worker. i saw the charismatic doctor, a man with a legion of adoring supporters. i saw the smooth nassar, a master manipulater who had convinced police and university officials that earlier complaints were misunderstandings — and went on molesting young girls."}
{"original": "at times in the about 30 minutes we were together, he came off almost arrogant. that was particularly true as he tried to convince me the misunderstanding was the result of the women's ignorance of his sophisticated medical work. his demeanor didn't come as a surprise. nassar was revered in gymnastics and highly regarded internationally as a sports medicine physician."}
{"original": "but at other times, i picked up a different vibe. when we first met, nassar essentially pleaded that we not write a story. he even indicated he could provide dirt on usa gymnastics officials. as we talked, particularly when he wasn't directing the conversation, nassar came off as much more socially awkward. faced with a question, he would stammer. his eyes fluttered. they're the kind of nonverbal cues i look for during contentious interviews."}
{"original": "still, i chalked up his odd countenance to the difficult circumstances. i was nervous, too. there i was telling a physician with an unblemished reputation that we were about to publish a story making serious, criminal allegations."}
{"original": "at that time, i didn't have the benefit of the knowledge the following 16 months would provide. today, aware that nassar knew he had committed the crimes we were about to expose — and that he had previously faced and quietly eluded similar allegations — his behavior makes more sense."}
{"original": "former usa gymnastics doctor accused of abuse"}
{"original": "when we met in a conference room in borgula's office, nassar had a stack of medical books, magazines and a laptop. before agreeing to answer questions on the record, nassar asked to show me a video. he said it was one of many he had made for training purposes. he said he hoped it would help me better understand the medical procedure the three women had misconstrued as a sexual assault."}
{"original": "the video focused on the backside of what appeared to be a young girl. she was lying down, wearing underwear. nassar worked his hand between her legs, massaging the girl's buttocks and inner thighs. his hands slowly worked deeper into her crotch, but i never saw any penetration."}
{"original": "nassar appeared at ease as he started to explain what he was doing. but the presentation was interrupted when my phone pinged with a text message that would end up derailing the interview."}
{"original": "my colleagues' text confirmed a lawsuit had been filed against nassar in california. the way i saw it, i had an ethical duty to tell the doctor and borgula. with this new development, i asked, did they want to continue with the interview?"}
{"original": "borgula asked for a copy of the lawsuit. i forwarded him a copy one of my colleagues had sent to me. nassar and his attorney then left the interview room to review the new allegations from a former olympian."}
{"original": "i waited alone for about 15 minutes before they returned. although the victim was identified only as jane doe, the background in the court record about her olympic involvement was enough for them to know who she was. nassar said he couldn't believe the woman would make such allegations. he said he had a plaque in his office that she sent him as a thank-you gift after the 2000 olympics."}
{"original": "support investigative journalism:the 6 benefits of an indystar digital subscription"}
{"original": "in light of the lawsuit, borgula cut off the interview. nassar would not be allowed to talk, but the attorney said he would make a statement addressing the allegations."}
{"original": "he denies all the allegations. he's never heard these allegations before. no one from law enforcement, any other regulatory body, usa gymnastics, any individuals, parents — no one has ever suggested dr. nassar has done anything in any context with either this gymnast or any other that he's aware of. this is the first time anyone's ever made such an allegation related to usa gymnastics, borgula said."}
{"original": "again, this would be proven wrong. others had complained."}
{"original": "borgula and nassar parted ways not long after our interview. the split came after federal authorities served a search warrant at the embattled doctor's home and found 37,000 images of child pornography."}
{"original": "as i gathered my notebook and recorder, it was clear the lawsuit rattled nassar. his eyes were watery, and he was trembling as i shook his hand and said goodbye. my last memory of the encounter was nassar pleading for me to be fair and to consider the harm a story could do to his reputation and family."}
{"original": "after i left, i drove to a parking lot of a nearby office building and called back to indianapolis to share the little my interview had yielded."}
{"original": "our story was published on the internet that afternoon and in the indianapolis star the following morning. we were immediately bombarded with phone calls and emails from nassar's supporters. they vociferously defended him, while questioning our motives, ethics and truthfulness."}
{"original": "here's one of many examples: ... i am 150% sure that he is innocent, and i do not appreciate the one-sided reporting on this issue. please, i urge you to look beyond making money by writing scandalous stories and consider the huge, unfair negative affect this is having on an innocent man's life. these false allegations bring me and my family so much sorrow. please listen and also report on the many, many people who are coming to this man's defense. by focusing on these false allegations, you are doing good to no one."}

{"original": "a decade ago, president barack obama affirmed that marriage unites a man and woman. so did 45 states and the federal government. the only states to redefine marriage had done so through activist court rulings or, in 2009, legislative action. at the ballot box, citizens had uniformly voted against redefinition. a majority agreed with obama."}
{"original": "then, in 2012, obama evolved, and the supreme court took cases involving marriage law. nothing in the constitution answered the actual question at hand: what is marriage? the court should have left the issue to the people. but in 2013, it struck down the federal definition of marriage as a male-female union in a 5-4 ruling."}
{"original": "the court also punted on a challenge to a state definition of marriage adopted in a 2008 constitutional referendum by which a majority of californians — yes, californians — overturned an activist court. only in 2015 did the supreme court, breaking 5-4 again, redefine marriage for the nation, provoking four irrefutable dissents."}
{"original": "same-sex marriage advocates told the public that they sought only the freedom to marry. same-sex couples were already free to live as they chose, but legal recognition was about the definition of marriage for all of society. it was about affirmation — by the government and everyone else."}
{"original": "it's unsurprising that once a campaign that used to cry live and let live prevailed, it began working to shut down catholic adoption agencies and harass evangelical bakers and florists. this shows it was never really about live and let live — that was a merely tactical stance."}
{"original": "while these were the early effects of redefinition, the more profound consequences will be to marriage itself. law shapes culture; culture shapes beliefs; beliefs shape action. the law now effectively teaches that mothers and fathers are replaceable, that marriage is simply about consenting adult relationships, of whatever formation the parties happen to prefer. this undermines the truth that children deserve a mother and a father — one of each."}

{"original": "marriage redefiners could not answer these questions when challenged to show that the elimination of sexual complementarity did not undermine other marital norms. today, they increasingly admit that they have no stake in upholding norms of monogamy, exclusivity and permanence."}
{"original": "same-sex marriage didn't create these problems. many in america had unwisely already gone along with the erosion of marital norms in the wake of the sexual revolution — with the rise of cohabitation, nonmarital childbearing, no-fault divorce and the hookup culture. it was no surprise that many would then question the relevance of the male-female norm. legal redefinition is a consequence of the cultural breakdown of marriage."}
{"original": "but same-sex marriage is a catalyst for further erosion. already, we see respectable opinion-makers mainstreaming throuples, ethical nonmonogamy and open relationships. this was predictable; we and others predicted it."}

{"original": "there's a deeper logic, too. implicit in the push for same-sex marriage was body-self dualism — the idea that we're actually nonphysical entities inhabiting physical bodies, or ghosts in machines. that's why the plumbing in sexual acts seemed not to matter."}
{"original": "true one-flesh union, the foundation of conjugal marriage, was thought illusory. what mattered was emotional union and partners' use of their bodies to induce desirable sensations and feelings. of course, two men or two women (or throuples or even larger sexual ensembles) could do that. but the logic didn't stay with marriage. if the body is mere plumbing, then sex matters less than identity."}

{"original": "honolulu (ap) — until this year, the sony open did not hold many fond memories for brandt snedeker."}
{"original": "he made his pga tour debut as a rookie in 2007 and missed the cut by seven shots. he returned the following year, shot 68-72 at waialae to make the cut, walked into the scoring trailer and was told he would not have a tee time the next day."}
{"original": "i remember making the cut and the guy in the scoring trailer said, 'there's a new rule — mdf.' and i said, 'what's mdf? what the hell are they talking about, mdf?' i finally made the cut and they're telling me i can't play, snedeker said."}
{"original": "mdf stands for made the cut, did not finish. it became the most loathsome acronym in golf."}
{"original": "and it all started eight years ago in the sony open."}
{"original": "that's when the pga tour took its first step toward trying to reduce the size of the field on the weekend. a dozen times the previous year, after the cut was made to the top 70 and ties, the field was so large that the final round had to be played in threesomes off both tees, taking at least 5 1/2 hours."}
{"original": "it was no good for television. it was no fun for anyone."}
{"original": "not that the original alternative was much better."}
{"original": "the tour decided that if more than 78 players made the cut, the closest number to 60 advanced to the weekend. everyone else received last-place money and credit for making the cut, even though they didn't play. so in 2008 at the sony open, there were 68 players at 1-under 139 and 86 players at even-par 140."}
{"original": "the 18 players at 140 were sent home. that included snedeker, who was only nine shots out of the lead."}
{"original": "put that into context this year. matt kuchar made the cut on the number friday and was nine shots out of the lead. under the original policy to limit the size of weekend fields, he would have been on his way to the next tournament. on saturday, he shot 62 and went into the final round tied for sixth. even if he doesn't win, there are fedex cup points, ranking points and ryder cup points to be earned."}

{"original": "two weeks later, 19 other players had mdf next to their names at torrey pines."}
{"original": "snedeker was so mad at the sony open that he called pga tour headquarters demanding an explanation. stephen ames was curious what would happen if tiger woods were even in that position and the tour explained to sponsors why it was sending home golf's biggest attraction (woods had his only mdf six years later)."}
{"original": "the mandatory players meeting was held that week in san diego, and while the new anti-doping policy was tops on the agenda, there was greater passion over whether someone who finished two rounds in the top 70 could get a tee time saturday."}
{"original": "the tour changed it a month later to the policy that remains today. if more than 78 players make the 36-hole cut, there is a 54-hole cut for top 70 and ties."}
{"original": "everyone talks about how rigid the tour is, snedeker said. but there are certain things where they say, 'ok, we may have screwed this up. let's reevaluate.' they worked it out, and i think it's a great policy now. i think that speaks to their willingness to get it right."}

{"original": "i ask my judicial colleagues to continue their efforts to promote public confidence in the judiciary, both through their rulings and through civic outreach roberts wrote. we should reflect on our duty to judge without fear or favor, deciding each matter with humility, integrity, and dispatch. as the new year begins, and we turn to the tasks before us, we should each resolve to do our best to maintain the public's trust that we are faithfully discharging our solemn obligation to equal justice under law."}
{"original": "trump himself has been among the federal judiciary's harshest critics when rulings have gone against him. he has often vented those frustrations on social media in the wake of adverse decisions in cases ranging from his personal business interests to immigration policy during the course of his presidency."}

{"original": "it's important because it's an important societal issue,'' said manfred, who took over for bud selig on jan. 25, 2015, and approved a domestic violence policy in september. baseball has tried to be thoughtful and a leader in the space. like every institution, we're not perfect. we're not always right. but we really would like to send the right message in terms of what we do here."}
{"original": "when you have a new policy, the first ones take on a special significance in terms of tone and precedent and all those things. so i'm going to make sure to know everything i can possibly know about each of these cases before i make any decisions."}
{"original": "the punishment rulings, particularly in the cases involving chapman and puig, who, unlike reyes, aren't facing criminal charges, should be in during spring training."}
{"original": "i would love to have these resolved before we begin play again,'' manfred said. the one thing i've learned about these cases is timing is not mine. you have to really rely on the criminal process playing out in order to put yourself in a position that you're comfortable what the facts actually are before you impose discipline."}
{"original": "so i'd love to get it done on that timetable, (but it's) not completely within my control."}
{"original": "no charges filed against aroldis chapman"}
{"original": "it's no different, manfred said, in the cardinals' computer hacking investigation. major league baseball is waiting for the government's investigation to be completed before any discipline is levied."}
{"original": "the government is uniquely positioned to know exactly what happened there,'' manfred said. if i conduct my own investigation, the idea that i would be able to uncover the sort of information they can without the benefit of subpoenas and warrants, is just not realistic."}

{"original": "look, the media landscape is really challenging for us,'' manfred said. we have advantages in terms of national broadcast agreements, long-term rsn (regional sports network) deals that are out there, but that's a temporal advantage."}
{"original": "it's possible that some of the ways we currently get games to our fans are not going to be available to us. it requires us to be really thoughtful of where the industry needs to be in response to some of the changes that may be coming.''"}

{"original": "it includes new options people will have to message a business on whatsapp, the company said in a blog post."}

{"original": "but this isn't something new. back in 2016, two years after whatsapp was acquired, the company launched a major update to its policy where it started sharing user information and metadata with facebook, as reported by wired."}
{"original": "a growing discomfort at the level of personal information being mined combined with more aggressive moderation by social media tech giants recently have prompted more americans to look into encrypted messaging."}
{"original": "parler going dark also may be a factor in the growth of the apps. and a prompt by elon musk to use signal doesn't hurt either."}
{"original": "signal's creator moxie marlinspike said in a 2015 interview: privacy is at an all-time low, and surveillance is at an all-time high."}
{"original": "here's how signal and telegram compare on privacy:"}
{"original": "the signal app is a free messaging and voice call app that supports end-to-end encryption for all features – meaning no one can access your information other than the intended recipient."}
{"original": "i use whatsapp for work, but was on it first with my kids for when they were out of the country. two were on deployment, one kept using whatsapp but the other who was on a special ops deployment (so we) had to switch to signal due to security protocols, said twitter user @simpse01."}
{"original": "with signal, you register with your phone number, and after that the app knows little to nothing about your account because even to discover and send you information the app sends a different set of numbers to act as a contact."}
{"original": "information is neither transmitted nor stored on signal's servers. your message history is stored on your own devices, the app's privacy policy reads."}
{"original": "signal tweeted sunday that it was continuing to shatter traffic records and add capacity as more and more people come to terms with how much they dislike facebook's new terms."}
{"original": "we don't use your data to show you ads, telegram's privacy policy states. one of its big attractions is the fact that users do not have to link it to a phone number (after registration). the app instead uses a username to add contacts."}
{"original": "we neither store nor process your personal data, rather we store and process random sequences of symbols that have no meaning without the keys which we don't have, the policy says about its end-to-end encryption."}
{"original": "the app does collect basic device data and ip addresses for moderation. and if you want to use a two-factor authentication system using email, the company will see that, too. but for those looking for an alternative to a facebook-owned platform that might not be a deal breaker."}
{"original": "wilmington, del. — children and teens appear every day in delaware courtrooms with ankles locked together by metal leg irons."}
{"original": "their crimes range from drug possession and theft to gun charges and rape. all are in state custody because they cannot afford to post bail. all are presumed innocent until proven guilty."}
{"original": "they are shackled and brought into court like a slave more or less, said democratic state rep. james johnson. that is something that will stick with with you the rest of your life."}
{"original": "defense attorneys and child advocates say this daily scene in family court is grisly — youths are restrained and left traumatized by a criminal justice system that is supposed to rehabilitate, not punish, them. that is why there is an effort to end the shackling of youths during proceedings at the the state's three courthouses."}
{"original": "adult defendants in delaware are not usually shackled during trials so as not to influence juries. typically, adult defendants wear leg irons only during other court proceedings."}
{"original": "supreme court reluctant to rule on juvenile murderers' life sentences"}
{"original": "for juveniles, handcuffs and belly chains are removed once they get to the courtroom, but leg irons remain during all proceedings. nearly half of all states have ended this practice in the united states."}
{"original": "johnson introduced a bill in the state house of representatives in june to limit the use of shackles except in rare circumstances where the court can show that restraints are necessary to prevent flight or physical harm to the child or others. the bill is on hold in the house judiciary committee and could get support if the department of services for children, youth and their families doesn't change its policy on shackling juveniles on its own."}
{"original": "the department's division that handles youth detention and transport to court is looking forward to young people attending court free of shackles, a spokeswoman said, but is concerned about the layout of the family court facilities in dover and georgetown. the 3-decade-old courts are in desperate need of upgrades and pose security concerns, court officials have said."}
{"original": "in november, delaware supreme court chief justice leo e. strine jr. stressed to lawmakers the need for funds to upgrade these buildings."}
{"original": "one judge in dover was spat on by an inmate when they were forced to share the same elevator in the back of the courthouse, according to an attorney. and because the facilities are small, those seeking protective orders bump into people they are accusing and lawyers have little space to discuss cases with their clients."}
{"original": "we will need to work with our system partners — family court, the attorney general's office and the public defender's office — to ensure that any changes that are implemented can be done in a way that can provide for the safety of the youth and others in the courthouse provided the challenges of the physical plant in some of the court facilities, department spokeswoman dawn thompson said in a statement."}
{"original": "delaware chief public defender brendan o'neill said the matter is pressing and can't wait for those changes."}
{"original": "the practice of routinely shackling kids coming into court without an affirmative finding that they pose a genuine security risk is just flat out wrong, he said. we are trying to change it."}
{"original": "in january 2014, the national juvenile defender center, a nonprofit in washington, d.c., launched a nationwide campaign to end indiscriminate juvenile shackling. the campaign comes amid a flurry of criminal justice reform efforts, including pushes to end the money bail system and a proposal to scale back mandatory minimum sentences."}
{"original": "people are realizing that the things we have done in the past have not worked and should be changed, johnson said. this is one of the changes that should be made."}
{"original": "twenty-three states have banned the practice of juvenile shackling either by legislation or court order. about half of those have done so since 2014."}
{"original": "most recently, in september, the maryland court of appeals and the state judicial council adopted an anti-shackling policy that leaves the decision to shackle a youth up to a judge if there are safety concerns."}
{"original": "maryland public defender paul b. dewolfe, a strong supporter of the change, wrote in an editorial in the baltimore sun last year that during the media storm surrounding the death of freddie gray, one instance of juvenile shackling stood out to him. a teen was arrested by baltimore police during protests and told an nbc reporter that being shackled felt like a caged animal."}
{"original": "it's tragic, dewolfe told the news journal. it's tragic to see a 12- or 13-year-old coming into a courtroom ... in chains. it's completely unnecessary and goes against the whole principle of juvenile court."}
{"original": "juveniles who are detained in delaware are transported by the division of youth rehabilitative services to the state's three courthouses in kent, sussex and new castle counties."}
{"original": "when they arrive, handcuffs and belly chains are removed, but leg irons remain during court proceedings. on a case-by-case basis, judges can consider if an individual poses a safety risk and should have the additional restraints left on."}
{"original": "even with the restraints on, youth can still pose a risk, some say. for example, a 17-year-old defendant kicked out the window in a van that was taking him in shackles from a family court proceeding in september."}
{"original": "he jumped out of the moving vehicle in wilmington and was on the run from authorities for about a month."}
{"original": "advocates say these types of scenarios are rare — and need to be weighed against the more widespread harm that shackles can inflict on children."}
{"original": "attempts by the news journal to speak with youth who have been detained and their families were unsuccessful."}
{"original": "karen derasmo, executive director of prevent child abuse delaware, said the experience of being shackled can impact a child's brain at a time when it is still developing."}
{"original": "what we always have to imagine and appreciate is that kids' brains are in the process of developing, she said. they tend to think much more concretely about things. they don't have some of the higher level of thought processes that adults have."}
{"original": "for that reason, shackling could be traumatizing to a young person, especially because those who are entering the juvenile justice system are probably already experiencing a higher level of toxic stress in life, she said."}
{"original": "it could actually affect the way their brain is developing and how they are going to view the world going forward, she said."}
{"original": "gilbert said eliminating juvenile shackling can also change the courtroom environment from one of an authoritative, penal system to one of openness and fairness."}
{"original": "we know that the idea of procedural justice is so important to youth, she said. the juvenile court is designed to be different from the adult court system. it is supposed to be rehabilitative, not punishing."}

{"original": "one certainty: an estimated $56 billion to $100 billion cash infusion from frozen assets that comes with sanctions relief. it may be used to purchase military equipment and benefit companies controlled by iran's conservative islamic revolutionary guard corps, not middle-class iranians who the white house had hoped would feel empowered by the deal to push iran to become a more cooperative member of the world community."}
{"original": "the drop of oil prices from $100 a barrel to $30 a barrel overwhelms any benefits from the deal, said patrick clawson, director of research at the washington institute for near east policy."}
{"original": "iran is expected to increase its oil output by $6 billion a year at current prices, far less than hoped for, clawson said."}
{"original": "iranian president hassan rouhani, who pushed for the nuclear deal and is considered a moderate force in iran, hoped sanctions relief coupled with increased oil exports would help his followers win parliamentary elections next month, said ali alfoneh, an expert on the iranian leadership at the foundation for defense of democracies, a washington think tank."}
{"original": "but with no immediate impact on iran's economy likely as a result of the accord reached last summer, he has difficulties telling the iranian public he solved iranian issues by getting the nuclear deal with the united states, alfoneh said."}
{"original": "iran announced monday that it had removed the core of its arak nuclear reactor and filled it with concrete, as required under the agreement. if true, that would be the last of several steps iran had to complete, including the dismantling of machines that process nuclear fuel and shipment of uranium stockpiles, to gain relief from united nations and european union sanctions."}
{"original": "that will happen when yukia amano, the director general of the international atomic energy agency, signs off on iran's progress, probably this week."}
{"original": "on wednesday iranian officials issued mixed messages on the progress at arak reactor."}
{"original": "iran's deputy foreign minister abbas araqchi said the work would be done by saturday and predicted amano's report would come soon after, according to iran's tasnim news agency. behrouz kamalvandi, spokesman for the atomic energy organization of iran, said that only the initial steps had been taken for removing the core of the arak reactor and filling it with concrete. the measures have not been finalized but they may be in next few days, and implementation day will likely happen next week, the iranian students' news agency reported."}

{"original": "in the nuclear agreement, the u.s. committed itself to lift a very small portion of sanctions and then issued grand statements about facilitating trade, he said. the greatest risk (for businesses) is a serious misconnect between what the u.s. government plans to do and what people around the world think the u.s. government plans to do."}
{"original": "complicating matters is an ongoing debate between republican and democratic leaders of congress and the white house over whether recent ballistic missile tests by iran constitute a violation that warrants new sanctions."}
{"original": "u.s. says iran tested rockets 1,500 yards from american carrier"}
{"original": "sen. chris coons, d-del., a member of the senate foreign relations committee, told reporters monday he is urging president obama to press ahead with new sanctions. i am concerned with the hesitation to move forward with the ballistic missile-related designations, coons said. i'm going to continue to raise this issue, to push and to insist on rigorous enforcement this year."}
{"original": "obama said monday he would veto any new sanctions imposed by congress."}
{"original": "clawson said the impasse risks sending a message to iran that it could do anything it wants without repercussions."}
{"original": "lifting holds on the billions of dollars of iranian cash frozen in foreign banks is likely to boost sectors of iran's economy that are most worrisome to the united states and its allies, alfoneh said."}
{"original": "much of that money is likely to be used on large infrastructure projects that will put thousands of iranians to work, he said. but there's a catch: the revolutionary guards control at least a third of iran's economy, including construction and engineering firms that would handle large infrastructure projects, he said. according to the u.s. state department, the guards conduct iran's overseas military operations, including support for terrorist groups."}
{"original": "the private sector is so small they can't take upon their shoulders the task of employing a lot of people, alfoneh said. it's going to be the revolutionary guards who are going to hire people and whose people will benefit, not the iranian middle class who rouhani wants to empower."}

{"original": "industry representatives had predicted that washing machine prices, as well as those for solar panels, would likely increase as a result of the steep new taxes recommended by the u.s. trade representative and green lighted by trump."}
{"original": "large imported washing machines and parts will be subject to tariffs of up to 50%, while solar panels will have taxes as high as 30%. while largely aimed at south korea and china, the new duties will apply with a few exceptions, worldwide."}
{"original": "the tariffs come in the wake of whirlpool complaining that korean manufacturers were flooding the u.s. market with steeply discounted washing machines from 2012 to 2016."}
{"original": "meanwhile, solar makers suniva and solarworld accused china of giving unfair subsidies and financing to its solar producers during that same time period. china manufactures 71% of the world's solar modules."}

{"original": "the duty on washing machines will gradually reduce and then expire after three years, while the tax on solar cells and modules phases out after four years."}

{"original": "confidence in the covid-19 vaccine is growing, a usa today analysis of dozens of polls and scientific papers shows."}
{"original": "surveys in recent weeks show close to 60% of respondents saying they'd get the covid-19 vaccine, up from a low of 1 in 2 americans polled in september."}
{"original": "a pew research center survey of 12,648 americans in late november showed 60% said they'd get the vaccine if it were available today, up from 51% polled in september. the kaiser family foundation noted a similar increase, with 71% of the 1,676 surveyed indicating they'd accept a covid-19 vaccine, up from 63% in september."}
{"original": "usa today's analysis drew on methods used by duke university and florida state university researchers and by the federal advisory committee on immunization practices to summarize vaccine polling."}
{"original": "it's unknown what percentage of the population needs to get the vaccine in order to wipe out covid-19. but the increased willingness to receive the vaccine marks a notable reversal of previous trends and comes at a crucial time in the pandemic that's claimed more than 350,000 lives in the united states alone. the country is now being battered by a third wave of surging infections while the administration of vaccines has gone slower than planned in recent weeks."}
{"original": "distrust of the covid-19 vaccine has been visible in pockets across the country, from nursing home workers in ohio to indigenous communities in montana to college students in texas."}
{"original": "from march through late fall, trust in the covid-19 vaccine declined steadily, according to dozens of surveys of americans asked whether they'd get the vaccine when it became available."}
{"original": "a running morning consult poll of 2,200 adults found 72% of those surveyed in april would accept the covid-19 vaccine. as of oct. 10, that number dropped to about 48% willing to get vaccinated. a cnn/ssrs poll found a similar trend – of the approximately 1,200 people polled, 66% said in may that they'd get the vaccine; by october, just 51% indicated they'd get it."}
{"original": "a review published last week in the journal vaccines looked at 126 scientific studies and surveys of popular opinion towards the covid-19 vaccine and found a decreasing trend in vaccine acceptance since march. the researchers found that overall confidence in the covid-19 vaccine fell, on average, from more than 70% of people polled in march indicating they'd get a vaccine to just 50% in october."}
{"original": "cheryl lin, an author of the review and co-director of the policy and organizational management program program at duke university, said the decline in vaccine acceptance as the coronavirus spread was almost counterintuitive."}
{"original": "willingness to get vaccinated did not increase with growing case numbers or death total, said lin. when people first realized the seriousness of the outbreak and personally experienced the pandemic, acceptance was high. then, six months later, vaccine acceptance dropped to below 50%."}
{"original": "many of the surveys lin studied highlighted communities that are especially distrustful of the covid-19 vaccine. polls from pew research center, gallup and economist/yougov have shown republicans as less accepting of the vaccine than democrats. and surveys published in the journals annals of internal medicine and vaccine have found that black respondents were less likely to say they'd get the vaccine."}
{"original": "unfortunately, health disparities are likely to persist if we don't make a strong effort to target those groups with customized communication campaigns and more accessible vaccine delivery, said lin. there's an urgent need for a national campaign, in addition to political figures or celebrities getting the shot in front of the cameras, and really targeting specific groups."}
{"original": "washington – the supreme court was deep into oral argument back in 2014 about a florida fisherman's federal conviction for destroying evidence – in his case, 72 undersized grouper."}
{"original": "what kind of a mad prosecutor would try to send this guy up for 20 years? associate justice antonin scalia railed."}
{"original": "you make him sound like a mob boss or something, chief justice john roberts chastised the justice department's lawyer."}
{"original": "the case – which went well for the fisherman, if not the fish – was one of many recent examples in which the high court has admonished prosecutors for stretching laws to win convictions. others rescued by the justices ranged from a jilted wife charged with assault under an international chemical weapons treaty to a legal immigrant deported for hiding four prescription tablets in a sock."}
{"original": "since you're reading this story, you might also like to hear about tonight's democratic presidential debate. click 'play' above to listen."}
{"original": "on tuesday, the high court will shed some light on whether its forgiveness extends to shutting down access lanes to the george washington bridge – the busiest bridge in the world – for political retribution."}
{"original": "the case pits two mid-level public officials with ties to former new jersey governor chris christie against federal prosecutors who charged them with fraud and won 18-month prison sentences for a political prank that ran amok."}
{"original": "upset by a democratic mayor's refusal to endorse republican christie's re-election in 2013, the two associates created gridlock for several days in fort lee, n.j. as it turned out, they also helped turn a popular governor with presidential ambitions into a joke on late-night television, helping to tank his political future."}
{"original": "the scandal, now going on seven years, became known as bridgegate. the supreme court's willingness to hear it following two lower court convictions is a positive sign for christie aides bridget kelly and william baroni, though it's too soon to tell if they'll get off the hook like the florida fish captain."}
{"original": "what's clearer is the court's impatience with federal and state prosecutors, even in cases of political corruption."}
{"original": "four years ago, the court vacated the conviction of former virginia governor bob mcdonnell, who had been sentenced to two years in prison for accepting luxury gifts and loans from a wealthy businessman in exchange for official acts. the justices ruled unanimously that those acts were commonplace actions taken on behalf of constituents."}
{"original": "the ruling made it harder for prosecutors to use federal fraud statutes against public officials by characterizing what the justices called common favors as crimes. that could work against the trump administration in the new jersey case."}
{"original": "a good number of the recent cases are examples of where prosecutors stretched the law, says ellen podgor, a white-collar crime research professor at stetson university college of law."}
{"original": "the supreme court began pushing back against public corruption prosecutions in 1987, reversing the conviction of kentucky officials who had skimmed money paid by the state to insurance companies. the court reasoned that fraud statutes do not guarantee officials will perform their duties honestly. a generation later, it added that honest services fraud must include bribery or kickbacks."}
{"original": "more recently, the justices have sided frequently with small-time criminal defendants swept up by large-scale prosecutions:"}
{"original": "in 2014, the court ruled unanimously that the federal government had no business using an international chemical weapons treaty to prosecute a jilted wife who committed a two-bit local assault against her husband's lover."}
{"original": "in 2015, it chastised federal prosecutors for deporting a tunisian man on drug paraphernalia charges based on four adderall tablets hidden in a sock."}
{"original": "in 2017, the justices ruled unanimously that a serbian immigrant's lie about her husband's military record was not reason to strip away her citizenship."}
{"original": "last year, the court again ruled unanimously that states, along with the federal government, cannot impose excessive fines as criminal penalties – such as the seizure of a small-time drug dealer's $42,000 land rover."}
{"original": "the protection against excessive fines guards against abuses of government's punitive or criminal law-enforcement authority, associate justice ruth bader ginsburg wrote."}
{"original": "perhaps sensing a sympathetic audience, lawyers for kelly have raised another recent supreme court decision: last year's ruling against the trump administration's effort to include a citizenship question on the 2020 census."}
{"original": "noting that chief justice john roberts said commerce secretary wilbur ross' reason for adding the question seems to have been contrived, kelly's lawyers said ross could have been imprisoned for fraud under the reasoning used to convict their client."}
{"original": "that astoundingly expansive theory of criminal fraud cannot be correct, they wrote. it would undo, in one fell swoop, three decades of this court's precedents rejecting attempts to enforce 'honest government' through vague federal criminal statutes."}
{"original": "but there's another side to the bridgegate saga. the justice department says kelly and baroni didn't just conceal political motives. rather, it says they blatently made up a non-existent traffic study and used port authority of new york and new jersey resources to manufacture what kelly warned would be some traffic problems in fort lee."}
{"original": "unlike some of the small fish the supreme court saved from overzealous prosecutors, such as florida fish captain john yates, public officials are in positions of power, says jennifer ahearn, policy director at citizens for responsibility and ethics in washington, an anti-corruption group."}
{"original": "this is really how our system works, ahearn says. we give discretion to prosecutors in the federal criminal justice system writ large. you don't have courts stepping in and saying, 'this person isn't worthy of being prosecuted.'"}

{"original": "then there was trump's brief publicity stunt thursday in the white house briefing room, where he refused to take any questions from reporters."}
{"original": "giving donald trump air time without context or conditions is downright irresponsible. yes, the public at large has a right to hear from the president, but the media have a responsibility to provide their audience with context and facts."}
{"original": "here are several options for how the news networks could approach trump's tuesday night remarks:"}
{"original": "►air the president's address on a 15-to-30 minute delay so they can fact-check his statements and air those fact-checks as the remarks are broadcast."}
{"original": "►refuse to air the speech in its entirety and only air truly newsworthy sound bites about substance and public policy."}
{"original": "►get an advance copy of the speech and clear it for accuracy before agreeing to air it."}
{"original": "►give a democrat, such as rep. joaquin castro, d-texas, equal time to rebut the president."}
{"original": "the reality is no matter what news networks do, donald trump will not relent on his crusade to brand the media fake news and the enemy of the people. knowing that, the news media should err on the side of the public good and the public interest. they should calibrate their programming decisions around the most effective way to communicate truth, fact and context to their audiences."}
{"original": "make no mistake about it, if the media decide to air the president's remarks unchallenged and unfiltered, they are complicit in spreading propaganda and disinformation to the american people."}

{"original": "biden said he considered former campaign rival sen. bernie sanders for the post, but didn't want to risk democratic control of the senate to have him. runoffs pending certification in georgia resulted in a senate evenly divided between republicans and democrats, which will allow vice president-elect kamala harris to break ties in biden's favor."}

{"original": "farmers count on the usda for a wide range of services, many of which are now suspended during the shutdown that began dec. 22."}
{"original": "it's especially troublesome as farmers have been caught in a downward spiral of lost markets, low prices for milk, crops and livestock. also, the shutdown threatens the implementation of the 2018 farm bill and its program aimed at helping small dairy farms endure one of the worst downturns in the dairy industry in recent memory."}

{"original": "when farmers are hurting, it's felt throughout the rural economy."}
{"original": "each dollar of net farm income results in an additional 60 cents of economic activity as farmers spend money in their local communities, according to university of wisconsin research."}
{"original": "that translates to millions of dollars in urban centers as well since most of the items farmers buy come from other places."}
{"original": "and to some degree, farmers are gamblers. they borrow money in the spring to plant crops, betting that the fall harvest will cover their loans and generate a profit. they borrow money to raise livestock, hoping the price they receive when the animals are sent to market will be sufficient."}
{"original": "there are a lot of farmers who count on fsa loans to pay bills. and that works its way through the community, said jim goodman, a board member of the wisconsin-based group family farm defenders who recently retired after 40 years of dairy farming."}
{"original": "during the shutdown, the government continues to inspect meat, poultry and eggs. it's also releasing data needed for setting farm milk prices."}
{"original": "certain usda activities will continue if they are related to law enforcement, the protection of life and property or are financed through available funding."}

{"original": "representatives from the cosmopolitan have declined to provide specifics on what — if anything — took place, and a spokesperson described initial reports by other outlets as inaccurate when contacted in november. reached friday night, the cosmopolitan said in a statement to usa today sports that it was company policy to not comment on potential litigation."}
{"original": "at least part of tmz's original report was erroneous. the first version of the story — which claimed simpson had become drunk and disruptive — also alleged that a dispatcher referred to simpson by name. a spokesperson for las vegas metropolitan police department told usa today sports that the department was not contacted about simpson and a search of radio traffic from that nov. 8 night included no mention of simpson."}

{"original": "controversial coach marcelo bielsa will take charge of ambitious lille for next season, signaling his return to french football after a chaotic end to his spell with marseille."}
{"original": "lille said in a statement on sunday that bielsa will replace interim coach franck passi on july 1 and has been given a two-year deal."}
{"original": "marcelo bielsa is without a doubt one of the most respected and influential coaches in the world and it's a huge satisfaction for lille, said marc ingla, a club director. it also proves the ambition of our club."}
{"original": "a former argentina manager, bielsa is highly rated as an innovative, attack-minded leader who brings the best out of his players."}
{"original": "with lille hiring bielsa, lyon already settled into a new stadium, marseille recruiting aggressively under new american ownership and monaco challenging paris saint-germain strongly, next season promises to be an even more competitive one in france."}
{"original": "a more entertaining one, too, now that bielsa is back and likely to give the french media plenty of headlines."}
{"original": "bielsa stunned fans and the club's directors when he quit marseille last season, after just one game of the new campaign. the 61-year-old argentine was taking charge of his second season and was a fan favorite when he suddenly quit."}
{"original": "he was out of contract but had struck a verbal agreement with the president to extend his tenure."}
{"original": "then, just before putting pen to paper on his new deal, he changed his mind, alleging that marseille officials amended the terms of the agreement at the last minute. he had previously publicly criticized marseille's president in a vitriolic outburst during a news conference because he was angry at the club's transfer policy, saying it had signed players over his head."}
{"original": "controversy seems to follow bielsa, who in football circles earned the nickname el loco bielsa (crazy bielsa), due to his driven personality, single-mindedness, tough talking and relentless determination to do things only on his terms."}
{"original": "in the summer of last year, he quit as coach of italian side lazio — just two days after the italian club announced it had signed him."}
{"original": "in football terms, bielsa made much of his reputation more than a decade ago."}
{"original": "at club level, he won three argentinian titles with newell's old boys and velez sarsfield — reaching the south american copa libertadores final with newell's in 2002. later on, he also guided athletic bilbao to the europa league and spanish cup finals in 2012."}
{"original": "with argentina, he won gold at the 2004 olympic games and led argentina to the copa america final the same year."}
{"original": "lille's new owner gerard lopez, the president of the finance group genii capital and former president of the lotus formula one team, previously spoke about bielsa in glowing terms."}
{"original": "lopez recently took over from michel seydoux — a french businessman and film producer who was club president since 2002 — and lopez is keen on rebuilding lille with talented young players in the same way monaco has done."}
{"original": "on the final day of the transfer window last month, lille signed six players aged 23 or under. dutch forward anwar el ghazi, who joined from ajax, scored his first goal for the club on saturday."}
{"original": "the club's scouting network is also likely to be very strong in south america, with bielsa working closely alongside luis campos — who is an advisor to lopez."}
{"original": "campos previously worked with jose mourinho at real madrid and then for three years as a technical director with monaco."}
{"original": "the well-connected campos oversaw the arrival of several promising young players at monaco — including highly rated attacking midfielder bernardo silva — and they have blossomed so much that monaco is top of the league and has scored more than 100 goals overall this season."}
{"original": "although lille qualified six times for the champions league during seydoux's tenure and clinched the league and cup double in 2011, results have dropped and the northern french club is currently in 14th place."}
{"original": "the club's youth system — which produced players such as chelsea star eden hazard — has not been so successful in recent years and this will also be an area for bielsa to improve."}
{"original": "the rules of the retirement game just saw a sizable overhaul in congress, giving a nod to the reality that many americans can't afford to quit working."}
{"original": "the changes aren't massive enough to put to rest concerns about a coming retirement crisis, where some forecast a growing gap between the haves and have-nots. even so, the adjustments are likely to help some households boost their retirement savings."}
{"original": "the new law, signed by president donald trump in late december, has key twists for those who work at small businesses, those who steadily work part time at a given company and those who are worried about whether they're on a bleak path to outlive the money in their 401(k). eventually, workers may see their 401(k) plans begin to add options that offer annuities in their 401(k) plans, too."}
{"original": "the secure act — or the setting every community up for retirement enhancement — offers small business owners some additional tax incentives for starting a retirement plan and seeks to make it less costly to do so. financial services firms would be allowed to offer new multiple employer 401(k) plans to unrelated small companies with unrelated businesses."}
{"original": "workers who spend a large chunk of their careers at small companies that do not offer pensions or 401(k) plans are particularly vulnerable to an inadequate level of savings to cover the bills in retirement."}
{"original": "here's a look at some points to know:"}
{"original": "1) turning 70 in 2020? new rules can help delay spending savings."}
{"original": "start thinking of age 72, instead of 70½, if you want to delay taking money from your ira or 401(k) for as long as possible."}
{"original": "under the new law, savers who are currently in their 50s and 60s wouldn't be required to take a minimum distribution from retirement savings until they hit age 72."}
{"original": "taking out the correct required minimum distribution, or rmds for short, is essential each year, especially since the penalty for not doing so is 50% of what you should have taken out that year. the penalty is in addition to the ordinary income tax you pay on the money you withdraw from the retirement accounts. (tax experts at h&r block note, though, that it is possible to get a waiver by making the appropriate withdrawal as soon as the mistake is discovered and filing form 5329 with an explanation of the error. if the irs considers the error to be reasonable, the penalty will be waived. it may help to talk with a tax professional.)"}
{"original": "given that many americans are living longer and working longer, it can make sense for some to try to keep their hands off their retirement savings for as long as possible."}
{"original": "this isn't necessarily a one-size-fits-all-situation, said keith bernhardt, vice president of retirement income for fidelity investments."}
{"original": "keeping the money in a tax-deferred ira or 401(k) can help the account grow more in the future, too, depending on the success of your investments."}
{"original": "you're still benefiting from the tax-deferred nature of having money inside the account, bernhardt said."}
{"original": "the new threshold applies to people who turn age 70½ in 2020 and later."}
{"original": "the new 72 is simpler to track than the old age rules. after all, it's a little odd to try to figure out when you turn age 70 and a half."}
{"original": "one potential point of confusion: if you turned 70½ in 2019 or earlier, you don't get the benefit of the new delay. you're still required to take the rmd for 2019 and in future years."}
{"original": "the new rules can give you more flexibility for minimizing the tax hit in some years, too. maybe you'd rather spend money from a regular brokerage account earlier in your retirement years."}
{"original": "say that investment outside of a retirement account is worth $10,000 but only $2,000 of that money represents actual earnings. then, you'd only be taxed on the $2,000 not the entire $10,000."}
{"original": "take $10,000 out of the ira and you'd be taxed on the full amount if you saved that money on a pretax basis while working."}
{"original": "take a hard look at your own numbers and talk to a tax professional or financial adviser."}
{"original": "outliving your money remains a real risk for many. once people retire, they can run the risk of dipping too heavily into their retirement savings and running short of money as they age."}
{"original": "though people retire at different ages, fidelity noted that participants in the 401(k) plans it manages often retire around age 65."}
{"original": "regardless of age, most make withdrawals in the first year, then the withdrawal rate declines until the required minimum distribution age, according to fidelity."}
{"original": "one drawback for withdrawing money from a tax-deferred retirement account is that withdrawals are taxed at your regular income tax rate. you might face a 10% penalty if you withdraw the money before age 59½ as well. if you take out too much money, you're at risk of driving up your annual income tax bill."}
{"original": "2) retirement savings can help young families, too."}
{"original": "the act allows parents to withdraw money without penalties — but you would pay income taxes on those withdrawals — from a 401(k) or ira to cover costs associated with childbirth or adoption. the change applies to distributions in 2020 and afterward."}
{"original": "new parents would be allowed to withdraw up to $5,000 without the 10% penalty if the money is withdrawn within a year of the birth or adoption. you'd have to check with your plan sponsor to see when this might be allowed within a given plan."}
{"original": "3) working part time won't hurt your ability to save."}
{"original": "going forward, the new law requires companies that offer 401(k) plans to allow part-time employees who have worked at least 500 hours a year for at least three consecutive years to set aside money from their paychecks into the plan. the employer isn't required to make matching contributions until the worker meets the plan's normal eligibility requirements."}
{"original": "in the past, someone who was steadily working part time could legally be excluded from saving for retirement in a 401(k) or similar plan if he or she worked less than 1,000 hours a year. so the change is expected to open the doors for many people who work in retail, health care and other part-time heavy fields. the change may be particularly beneficial for women."}
{"original": "how soon will you be able to save? it might be sometime in 2024 or earlier."}
{"original": "some plan sponsors could wait until 2024 to make this change relating to part-time workers based on the statute, said mark iwry, a nonresident senior fellow at the brookings institution. iwry was responsible for national retirement policy and regulation of the private pension system while serving as senior adviser to the u.s. secretary of the treasury during the obama administration."}
{"original": "but, he continues, some plans will voluntarily implement this change earlier by taking into account years worked before 2021. or, he said, some might conceivably decide for administrative simplicity not to look back for three years and simply allow participation by employees who have at least 500 hours of service in a given year."}
{"original": "4) time for a wake-up call."}
{"original": "by december 2021 or after, savers are expected to begin receiving estimates once a year for how much monthly income their current 401(k) savings might generate in retirement."}
{"original": "iwry, who has supported such a disclosure for more than a decade, said the number will be key in helping people understand what kind of regular income their retirement accounts could generate."}
{"original": "people don't readily have a way to translate the account balance that they've accumulated to the amount of regular income that it can deliver to them in their retirement years, iwry said."}
{"original": "think of something similar to the estimates that you receive for social security retirement benefits."}
{"original": "once you have a clearer picture, you may decide to work longer, save more, or maybe even realize that you're well on track when it comes to saving for retirement."}
{"original": "right now, many people are in the dark when it comes to their retirement savings, according to joshua gotbaum, a guest scholar for economic studies at the brookings institution."}
{"original": "many people haven't saved enough before they retire, but they don't know it, he said. or others who have retired don't know how long their savings will last and they could be afraid to spend even when they have enough financial resources to do so."}
{"original": "this lifetime income benchmarking will help both, gotbaum said."}
{"original": "consider this example: a woman with $50,000 in her 401(k) at age 65 could get an annuity paying just under $3,000 per year — or $250 a month — for life."}
{"original": "it's a number that might motivate you to bump up your regular savings rate."}
{"original": "in 2020, individuals can save up to $19,500 in their 401(k) plans — or $500 more than last year. if you're 50 or older, you can save even more than that through what's called catch-up contributions, which max out at $6,500 in 2020. in all, someone 50 and older could save up to $26,000 in 2020."}
{"original": "the annual contribution limit for individual retirement accounts for 2020 is $6,000 or $7,000 for those 50 and older."}
{"original": "5) want to work and save more into your 70s?"}
{"original": "if you're working, the new law removes the age cap for setting aside savings into a traditional individual retirement account. beginning in 2020, the age cap — formerly age 70½ — goes away for individuals who have wage income."}
{"original": "you're allowed to set aside money in a traditional ira as long as you have income from work. another plus: if a couple could contribute to a spousal ira before age 70½, the new rules allow them to do so now even if the person is older than 70½."}
{"original": "but remember, the change is only effective starting with tax year 2020 contributions made for the year 2020, so people should understand the 70½ age limit is still in place for traditional iras when it comes to contributions made for tax year 2019."}

{"original": "more than 40 million americans had a disability in 2016, according to the u.s. census bureau. for some, physical and cognitive impairments can hinder their ability to make decisions, live independently and provide for themselves financially. while parents may be accustomed to stepping in, every family should prepare for the day they no longer are around to do so."}
{"original": "the fear that we have as parents is that our loved one is going to outlive us, says brian n. rubin president of the special needs alliance, an organization of attorneys that specialize in disability and public benefits law. 'special needs' is a term used to describe those who need extra support because of a medical, emotional or learning disability, such as rubin's 37-year-old son mitchell, who has autism."}
{"original": "we don't expect anybody else to do what we do for our child, so while we're still here, we want to try and have some peace of mind that everything will be ok, rubin says."}
{"original": "here is how to achieve that goal:"}
{"original": "step 1: consider the financial implications"}
{"original": "when you plan for people with disabilities, everyone's goal is the same — to provide security for their family member, says john nadworny, a partner with special needs financial planning, a specialty practice of winchester, mass.-based shepherd financial partners."}
{"original": "government services such as social security income (ssi), social security disability insurance (ssdi) and medicaid will provide much of that security. families can also supplement government resources with their own funds or purchase a life insurance policy to provide income for their child after they pass away."}
{"original": "creating a financial plan also means making sure the parents have enough for retirement, says michael berry, head of the advanced planning team for voya financial in des moines. it's really important to do a complete life plan for not only for the individual (with special needs), but also for the advocate, berry says."}
{"original": "step 2: put legal protections in place"}
{"original": "many government services have income and asset limitations. for example, to qualify for ssi, you must have less than $2,000 in assets. a child who is left an inheritance or designated the beneficiary of a life insurance policy may inadvertently be disqualified from receiving benefits, says jay robert, a new york-based attorney with kassoff, robert & lerner, who specializes in special needs planning."}
{"original": "depending on the state, that could cost the adult child hundreds of thousands of dollars a year, says benjamin rubin, an attorney and mitchell's brother. this is an astronomical sum that most families cannot afford for the rest of that child's lifetime, benjamin says. the rubins estimate that mitchell receives approximately $90,000 per year for such services as his day program, job coaches and housing."}
{"original": "a special needs, or supplemental needs, trust is a legal vehicle that will hold the assets of a person with disabilities without costing them their government benefits. those trusts will essentially protect any assets held for the benefit of the children, robert says."}
{"original": "there are two types of special needs trusts — first-party and third-party trusts. first-party trusts have a payback provision, meaning that when the beneficiary dies, any money left in the trust will first be used to repay the states that paid out benefits on their behalf. with third-party trusts, any money left in the trust could pass back to family members."}
{"original": "another financial vehicle is an able account, a tax-advantaged savings account that lets you save up to $100,000 without losing government benefits. like first-party trusts, able accounts have a payback provision."}

{"original": "more:break the taboo of talking money with our partners"}
{"original": "step 3: gather your support team"}
{"original": "identify those who will support your loved one after you're gone. for example, a guardian would have the legal ability to make decisions for the adult child if he or she is unable to do so, while a trustee would oversee the special needs trust."}
{"original": "involve the person with disabilities in the planning process if possible. a lot of people with mental health concerns absolutely can say who they want and who they don't want involved in their lives, says cynthia r. haddad, a partner with special needs financial planning."}
{"original": "create a letter of intent that will let people know what you want to happen once you are gone. this detailed set of instructions should include everything from an overview of the benefits the child receives to who you want — or don't want — playing a role in your child's life."}
{"original": "the goal in the advocacy community is for every individual with disabilities to live a full life in a community, benjamin says. with the right financial resources and legal protections in place, an adult with special needs can thrive."}
{"original": "experts recommend working with professionals who specialize in special needs planning. here are some organizations that can help you find the professional help that you need."}

{"original": "life out in los angeles was just a little too hectic as the wide receiver prepared for the nfl draft."}
{"original": "martavis bryant skipped out on it too, in part because of the pain of missing out while serving a one-year suspension for violating the nfl's substance abuse policy was a bit too acute."}

{"original": "haden returned from a fractured fibula that threatened to disrupt his season by providing pittsburgh's secondary with a steadying presence while artie burns struggled in his second season."}
{"original": "haden embraced change when he signed with the steelers in august after seven years in cleveland, and the steelers repaid his respect by making him the lone game captain on sunday while facing his former team."}
{"original": "alualu had the first multiple sack game of his eight-year career against the browns, including the one that gave the steelers 56 on the season, a franchise record."}
{"original": "the giddy celebration after alualu took down cleveland's deshone kizer early in the fourth quarter provided alualu with a reminder on why he signed with pittsburgh after seven seasons in jacksonville."}
{"original": "just being around these guys, this atmosphere, i knew i wanted to be around these talks just so that it kind of changes my mentality of where i came from, alualu said."}
{"original": "i'm not saying i'm used to being a loser or anything like that, but it was definitely different being around this group and i just wanted to feed off of that. hopefully we can keep going and get that ring."}
{"original": "that's been the mission since the second the patriots finished off their 36-17 dissection of the steelers 49 weeks ago."}
{"original": "pittsburgh limped through that game with a depleted wide receiving group, a secondary that looked overmatched at times and a pass rush that did little to disrupt brady."}
{"original": "that won't be the case when the steelers open the playoffs on jan. 14. bryant's return and smith-schuster's arrival have given the steelers a complement to star antonio brown they didn't have last season."}
{"original": "while brown is recovering from a left calf injury suffered in a close loss to the patriots on dec. 17, he appears to be close to returning. the nfl's leading receiver posted video on instagram monday showing him walking briskly on a treadmill."}
{"original": "pittsburgh's best chance at reaching the super bowl in minneapolis next month is with brown's no. 84 on the field."}
{"original": "yet the past two weeks have shown the steelers have the versatility to survive and perhaps even thrive even if he's limited."}
{"original": "smith-schuster and bryant were spectacular against new england and kept it going against houston and cleveland."}
{"original": "i wish everybody had a juju in their life, left tackle alejandro villanueva said."}
{"original": "the 21-year-old smith-schuster is the league's youngest player and he's spent most of his rookie season documenting his acclimation to life in the nfl, episodes that include putting together some of the league's most entertaining touchdown celebrations , losing his bicycle, having villanueva teach him how to drive and adopting a french bulldog named boujee."}
{"original": "it makes for a good time to be sure, but it's smith-schuster's precocious talent and not his outsized personality that has given pittsburgh the biggest boost."}
{"original": "the contributions of haden, bryant and alualu have been less dramatic but in many ways no less important. the steelers will need their stars to be stars."}
{"original": "we expect our guys to win, heyward said. they're drafted here and they're picked because (general manager) kevin colbert and (coach) mike tomlin decided they should be here ... now we have to get back to this tournament we're going to go into."}

{"original": "to be sure, exceeding them has not happened with great frequency. but trump is also benefiting from something else. reflecting the bitter divisions of the campaign, trump's transition (as no doubt will be true of the early months of his presidency) is turning out to be one of the nastiest honeymoons in the history of marriage. yet some of the nastiness directed at the groom is working to his advantage. trump and his entourage have been subjected to relentless salvos of over-the-top criticism — which are having a boomerang effect, discrediting his detractors and building support for their target. an anti-trumper abusing ivanka in front of her children on a jetblue flight is part of a larger pattern."}
{"original": "at the same time, the outgoing administration of president obama is failing so abjectly in core duties that one wonders whether, under incoming president trump, things could possibly get worse. the fall of aleppo, syria, has illuminated a grim and seemingly endless landscape of national security failure. we are witnessing human suffering on a grand scale while simultaneously enduring strategic defeats, with russia and iran making headway in the middle east and a refugee crisis in europe merging with a terrorism crisis to jeopardize the post-war european liberal order. obama's foreign policy legacy is so appalling — and obama and his apologists are so blithe about what they have wrought, while also stopping to shaft israel at the united nations on their way out — that it fosters the impression that trump can only do better."}

{"original": "while it was a clear display of u.s. military might, as well as trump signaling that he had the full support of his team (something that can never be taken for granted in this administration), this carefully choreographed moment sent another message: the only people who can handle this national security crisis are white men."}
{"original": "this message was hammered home again later in the day, when the white house released new photos of trump huddling with his national security team in the situation room, discussing the iran crisis. again, everyone pictured was white and male, with the exception of stephanie grisham, the white house press secretary. it should be noted that gina haspel, trump's cia director and the first woman to ever hold that job, reportedly called in to those meetings, and for whatever reason was not part of the group that stood next to the president during his wednesday speech."}
{"original": "while these tableaus have become standard in the trump administration, it can still take your breath away to see such a complete lack of diversity presented as the public image of the united states in the year 2020. this is especially true when trump hosts foreign leaders like the saudi crown prince or travels to countries where the rights of women and minorities are under assault. instead of setting an example for the rest of the world, the united states, under trump, is sanctioning a worldview that excludes women and people of color from positions of power and influence."}
{"original": "more than taking a stand:diversity is good for business, not just social justice, and colleges should say so"}
{"original": "the problem with their absence isn't just optics. it means the president and his team are not getting the best national security advice available. in november, defense secretary mark esper tweeted a photo of himself with a group of think tank experts, after a discussion with them about china and the opportunities/challenges in the indo-pacific region. all 12 men pictured were white. not to knock their expertise, but if you're going to assemble a group to discuss china and the region, maybe include a few experts from the region? also, some of the top asia specialists in washington are women. excluding them from the conversation is not just esper's loss but the country's."}
{"original": "and having ivanka trump at the table doesn't count. advocating for more diversity in national security decision-making is not about checking a box. the whole point is that there are women and people of color who are just as qualified as the white men who have long monopolized these roles. allowing your daughter (who has a background in real estate and running a clothing brand) to sit in for you or hobnob with world leaders at the group of 20 summit should not be considered an example of empowering women in foreign policy."}
{"original": "with the trump administration, that's usually the best it can do. we've come to expect this of trump, given that he and his political allies are associated with white nationalism."}
{"original": "the u.s. military, however, should do better. there is no good reason why its leaders cannot reflect the racial diversity of their troops, especially at a time when the military is struggling to address problems of white supremacy and far-right extremism in its ranks."}

{"original": "in fact, whether trump wins or loses reelection, his personnel choices (not to mention his policies) will have lasting impacts on diversity long after he's president. for example, about 70% of trump's judicial appointees are white men, meaning they will be shaping the federal court system and making decisions that affect all americans for decades to come."}

{"original": "trump attributes his spectacular rise in politics to the shrewdness of his gut, the power of his bluster and his command of a devoted core of supporters. even though those are the instincts that led him into an impasse with no clear exit, they are still the priorities he extols."}
{"original": "he bragged not about progress toward resolving the standoff but about the unity of republicans behind him in standing firm, although a few gop senators have expressed concern about the extended shutdown. it is poised to become the longest in history on saturday. they all want to see something happen, but they are extremely united, and i don't think i have ever seen unity like this in the republican party, he declared. it's really a beautiful thing to see."}

{"original": "among republicans surveyed, the blame goes to democrats by almost 5-1. trump's rating within his party actually ticked up a few percentage points from before the shutdown, and 84 percent express approval of the job he's doing as president."}
{"original": "since his inauguration, trump has made more efforts to hold the support of those who voted for him than he has to expand his appeal to those who didn't. that helps explains his unyielding stance in a standoff that would have prompted most of his predecessors to seek a settlement and move on."}
{"original": "by all objective standards, it's all downside for him – except for one, mo elleithee, a veteran democratic strategist and executive director of georgetown university's institute of politics and public service, said in an interview. that's his base. his base is loving it. they're eating it up, and it's increasingly clear that's all he cares about. anything else is irrelevant."}

{"original": "i think the president will have problems on his own side of the aisle for exploiting the situation in a way that enhances his power, she said, a reference to concerns expressed by florida sen. marco rubio and other republicans that future democratic presidents would feel empowered by the use of emergency declarations to pursue policy goals. i think he's going to have to answer to his own party on usurping that much power."}

{"original": "he crippled the only constraint on iran's nuclear program by pulling out of a 2015 agreement, imposing severe economic sanctions to curtail tehran's regional aggression. when that didn't work, trump dispatched emissaries to seek talks and boasted that islamic leaders were ready to make a deal."}

{"original": "in the midst of this back-and-forth, trump suddenly — and surprisingly, according to some advisers — ordered the killing of soleimani, who was visiting baghdad. state department officials later said that soleimani was planning imminent attacks and that his killing would de-escalate the iranian crisis."}

{"original": "in tehran, where there had been demonstrations against the regime in november, hundreds of thousands gathered monday to mourn soleimani, united in their hatred of america. and in baghdad, an iraqi parliament angered about a u.s. assassination carried out on its soil, voted to force out 5,000 u.s. troops deployed there to help fight the islamic state terrorist group — a move that, if carried out, would boost iranian influence over iraq's struggling democracy."}
{"original": "administration officials are finally scheduling a meeting with members of congress on wednesday to brief them on the soleimani killing. there are a host of crucial questions: what was the proof soleimani was planning imminent attacks? has the threat ended with his death? and, most important, what's the ultimate goal?"}
{"original": "it's difficult to predict where this is all headed. perhaps the soleimani killing will prove to be a necessary punch in the nose to deter a regional bully. but tit-for-tat actions, driven by notions of national pride and religious fervor, have a way of getting out of hand. iranian leaders said they had 35 u.s. retaliatory targets to choose from. not to be outdone, trump said he has 52 iranian targets in mind, including cultural sites."}

{"original": "likewise, trump has lied about the denuclearization of north korea, has misled the american people about his personal financial dealings with russia (see trump tower moscow) and has been shown to have been manipulated by the leaders of russia (see helsinki), turkey (see syria), saudi arabia (see jamal khashoggi) and others on matters of u.s. security interests. he has disclosed classified intelligence to foreign diplomats in the oval office and has suffered the public rebuke of his own defense secretary, who found the president's national security behavior so unsettling that he resigned."}
{"original": "these are facts we know now. democratic congressional leaders would be smart to consistently define the president by these events with a level of seriousness and unrelenting public indictment worthy of their significance in presidential history."}
{"original": "importantly, neither the southern district of new york matter nor the president's national security actions are part of mueller's investigation into russian interference in the 2016 election. for congressional democrats to defer action on the above until completion of the mueller report is simply a misleading non sequitur born of political convenience and 2020 trepidation rather than acceptance of a sacred constitutional responsibility."}
{"original": "these are extraordinary times. they must be confronted as such. to do otherwise — to deal constructively with this president as a credible political leader — only normalizes for all of history the damage he has already wrought upon the presidency and the nation. traditional oversight hearings are simply insufficient. discussion of impeachment should be seriously presented to the american people now by pelosi and schumer. and in so doing, they will set a narrative that relegates this president to one deserving only dishonor."}

{"original": "cautious politicos warn, often with broad generalization, that the american people would prefer the parties deal constructively with each other as loyal adversaries, that congress and the president find a way to work together, producing policies and oversight measures for the greater good of the nation. in traditional times, that might be true. but that warning sells short the intelligence of voters who worked to restore democratic control to the house last november knowing that these are not traditional times."}
{"original": "voters who went to the polls in november did not expect democrats to successfully enact a progressive agenda if they were to win the house or the senate in 2018. medicare for all, a green new deal, comprehensive immigration reform — they would each be pursued in contrast to the disjointed policies of the president and eventually make up an attainable platform for the party in 2020. but the voters did expect two things from a democratic house: a hard stop to the continued enactment of trumpian policies, and a direct, deliberate and fierce response to the president's known wrongdoing."}
{"original": "voters who turned out in november to usher in a blue wave will not walk away from the cause if democratic leaders demonstrate now, with honest conviction, that trump cannot be trusted with the powers of the presidency, that impeachment is on the table, and that he will not be afforded the credibility traditionally given to his predecessors."}
{"original": "but if democratic congressional leaders miss this opportunity, many voters who were there for them in november likely won't be in 2020."}

{"original": "justino was granted the exemption after a comprehensive review of her medical history involving spironolactone, the banned diuretic for which she tested positive, usada said. she denied using peds and her representative said she took the drug to combat the effects of a brutal weight cut she undertook to fight lina lansberg at a catchweight of 140 pounds in a ufc fight night 95 headliner."}
{"original": "upon notice of her positive test, justino immediately identified a medication prescribed by her physician for the treatment of a common endocrine disorder as the source of the prohibited substance detected in her sample, usada said in its statement. she also participated in multiple interviews with usada's investigative team and consented to usada interviewing her physician as well."}
{"original": "after a thorough investigation of the circumstances that preceded her positive test, which included a comprehensive review of justino's documented medical history, usada accepted justino's explanation that her use of spironolactone began in late september, following her bout at ufc fight night brasilia, and was in accordance with her physician's recommendation for the treatment of a legitimate medical condition."}

{"original": "justino, 31, tested positive for spironolactone, following an out-of-competition urine test conducted on december 5, 2016. spironolactone is a prohibited substance in the category of diuretics and masking agents and is prohibited at all times under the ufc anti-doping policy, which has adopted the world anti-doping agency (wada) prohibited list."}
{"original": "upon notice of her positive test, justino immediately identified a medication prescribed by her physician for the treatment of a common endocrine disorder as the source of the prohibited substance detected in her sample. she also participated in multiple interviews with usada's investigative team and consented to usada interviewing her physician as well."}

{"original": "usada recognizes that over the course of a career, athletes may experience illnesses or medical conditions that require the use of a particular medication for proper treatment. while athletes are educated and encouraged to apply for a tue in advance of using a prohibited substance or method, the ufc anti-doping policy permits athletes to file for retroactive tues where the use of a prohibited substance or method was medically justified. athletes are cautioned, however, that applying retroactively is at their own risk and the only guaranteed way to avoid an anti-doping policy violation for using a prohibited substance or method is by obtaining a tue prior to the use of a prohibited substance or method."}
{"original": "under the ufc tue policy, to receive approval of a tue, athletes must submit medical records demonstrating a verifiable medical diagnosis and legitimate medical need for the requested medication in accordance with the applicable wada guidelines. at least two members of usada's independent tue committee (tuec) – comprised of medical experts with various areas of expertise from around the u.s. – must individually review the tue application, after which a recommendation is made to usada as to whether the tue should be granted or denied."}
{"original": "in the case of justino, the application for a tue was granted because the athlete had an unequivocally diagnosed chronic medical condition for which the use of spironolactone is the appropriate standard of care. further, it was determined that the athlete and her medical team pursued and exhausted all non-prohibited alternatives and that the low dose of the medication is consistent with best medical practice to treat her condition and would return the athlete to a normal state of health without providing a performance-enhancing benefit."}
{"original": "because justino's tue application was granted retroactively, her provisional suspension has been lifted with immediate effect and her positive test will not result in an anti-doping policy violation. however, as a condition of the tue approval, justino will be required to continue to carefully document her medical care and must apply for a tue renewal in advance of tue expiry should she wish to maintain compliance with the ufc anti-doping policy."}

{"original": "whatever that they do in order to secure the borders, i think that's absolutely necessary because that's the only way that they can come in if they want to plot something inside united states, markzar says. i hope they're not crazy enough to do that, but from mullahs (leaders of the islamic republic of iran), anything can go. we cannot rule out anything from them."}

{"original": "it's a human tragedy to be in america, to be struggling for the most basic of necessities, and to watch kids, about 9,000 of them, to be contaminated with lead poisoning, jaime said. i think people have a sense of compassion for the people of flint knowing that a basic right, something we need on a day-to-day basis, has been taken away from them."}
{"original": "even before the water crisis, flint was in crisis. an estimated 41.6% of the city's residents live in poverty, according to the census bureau. the city once known for being a bustling stronghold for general motors' buick and chevrolet divisions took a turn for the worse after general motors closed up shop, leaving flint to take one hit after another. today, it is often referred to as one of the most dangerous cities in america. its decline was the subject of the 1989 documentary roger & me by filmmaker michael moore."}

{"original": "the fundraising includes many smaller donations from ordinary citizens. if these mechanics are reminiscent of president obama's first campaign, there may be a reason for that; dan pfeiffer, vice president of communications and policy for gofundme, is a former senior white house advisor and worked on president obama's campaign."}

{"original": "events and elections this year will tell that ultimate story, and whether it will hold in races without moore and his singular problems. but for democrats who rejoiced wednesday as the brand new senator from alabama was sworn in, we offer the following observations about what our candidate's victory might mean:"}
{"original": "►run everywhere and anywhere. in order to have the chance to exploit first moore's nomination and then his scandal, democrats needed a credible candidate. jones, while never having run for office before, was a successful prosecutor and respected attorney with a broad network of contacts in alabama. we need similar people to step forward to run for office throughout the south, such as senate candidate phil bredesen, the former tennessee governor — but also in the midwest and other supposedly trump or republican strongholds. the wave will reach its full power only if there are plenty of surfers who know what they are doing atop it."}
{"original": "►don't trim your sails. jones is a moderate democrat willing to work across the aisle and find common ground to get things done for alabama and our country. however, he did not alter his support for reproductive rights, immigration or gay marriage — or downplay his role in prosecuting and convicting two of the ku klux klan members who murdered four african-american girls at a birmingham church in 1963 — to curry favor with certain constituencies. not every democrat will agree with every other democrat on policy issues. we have had, and still possess, a big tent. voters would rather you say what you mean and mean what you say than believe you are willing to sacrifice your principles in exchange for a few votes."}
{"original": "►common ground works as a message, even in, and perhaps especially because of, these polarized times. jones' willingness to cross the aisle was an integral part of his message from the beginning of the campaign and became a constant in our advertising. our polling showed that jones won two in five voters who had favored luther strange (the establishment choice) in the september gop runoff, and jones also won independents by nearly 10 points on election day. the truth is that the actions of president trump and his gop majority in congress have made them vulnerable to the charge that they are unwilling to compromise — thus failing to achieve any progress on health care and other key issues. in contrast with jones' strengths, by election eve, 49% of alabamians felt that moore would make things worse in washington."}
{"original": "►we have an energized coalition that can produce electoral magic. african americans, particularly black women, made a heroic demonstration of their political clout in alabama: 96% favored jones. and they punched way above their weight on turnout — exceeding their share of the overall electorate by several points while the white electorate that fueled the 2016 trump win shrank substantially."}
{"original": "college-educated white suburbanites and millennials of all races and ethnicities helped produce the jones victory margin as well. in each case, our campaign and various complementary groups used traditional forms of communication — television, radio and mail — as well as social media and direct voter contact in substantial volume. campaigns must use every medium to communicate urgency to these voters."}

{"original": "one caution: this special election stood alone on the political calendar, with everyone focused on one campaign. that will not be the case next fall, so campaigns won't be able to count on the concentrated efforts of others. they must budget enough money to make the democratic enthusiasm gap pay off in 2018."}
{"original": "finally, we would urge the next wave of democratic candidates to set their sights as high as possible while also keeping a disciplined eye on the electoral prize. the best contenders combine a sweeping vision or campaign strategy with the resolute ability to stay on message, come hell or high water. think bill clinton 1992, barack obama 2008 or, for that matter, donald trump 2016."}

{"original": "waldman's underlying bias — that lsd was and is safe and effective in therapeutic settings and hasn't been all that risky when used recreationally, either — might challenge mainstream thinking. but she produces some very decent data and arguments. it's worth noting that she taught a course on the war on drugs at uc berkeley school of law, so she knows where the good stuff about drugs and policy and vested interest is buried."}
{"original": "in modified diary form, waldman details her use of and reactions to lsd microdoses (two drops, about one-tenth of a typical recreational dose), branching off for sweeping forays into drug history, drug law and some of the most private corners of her life. she was motivated by a lifetime held hostage by the vagaries of mood, and writes that at the worst times she's beset with self-loathing, and knotted with guilt and shame….overtaken by a pervasive sense of hopelessness."}

{"original": "in a cruise industry increasingly dominated by floating mega-resorts that carry thousands of vacationers and are chock full of gee-whiz attractions, royal clipper is an anomaly — and a throwback to a bygone era."}
{"original": "carrying just 227 passengers, it's a true clipper ship of the sort that famously sped across the world's oceans in the 1800s. but it's no relic of the grand age of sail. while it's modeled on an iconic sailing vessel of old, the preussen, it was built just 17 years ago and features such modern comforts as cabins with marble-lined bathrooms, a spa and three deck-top pools."}
{"original": "by far the biggest of star clippers' three ships (the other two are nearly 80 feet shorter and carry just 170 passengers a piece), royal clipper offers a taste of what crossing the world's oceans was like before the arrival of propeller-driven vessels."}
{"original": "in the place of such mega-ship attractions as theater shows and deck-top water parks, royal clipper boasts such allures as lounging in the bowsprit nets that jut out from its sleek bow. climbing the ship's soaring masts is another draw."}

{"original": "later in the cruise, carlson and other passengers will have the chance to help hoist the sails. they also can pop into the bridge to talk sailing with ship officers. the bridge has an open-door policy."}
{"original": "still, the experience is about more than the novelty of traveling on a cruise vessel powered by the wind. just as notable: royal clipper's relatively small size as compared to modern mega-ships allows it to access destinations that often are off limits to bigger vessels."}
{"original": "on this seven-night caribbean voyage out of barbados, royal clipper anchors off such off-the-beaten-path hideaways as terre-de-haut, a tiny french island with fewer than 2,000 inhabitants that's part of the iles des saintes archipelago. tendering to shore on small launches, passengers wander the island's single, picturesque village or strike out down the trail to its hilltop fort, named after napoleon."}
{"original": "other stops include one of the beach-lined coves of les anses-d'arlet, a fishing village along the southwest coast of martinique that sometimes goes months without a ship visit, and the picture-perfect yachting haven of falmouth harbor along the south coast of antigua. located near historic nelson's dockyard, a unesco world heritage site, the latter is far from antigua's more touristy main cruise hub in northerly st. john's."}
{"original": "as compared to cruises on mega-ships, a sailing on royal clipper is much more of a laid back affair. at many of the stops on this itinerary, the vessel offers just a handful of shore excursions. at two of the six destinations on the trip, there are no excursions at all."}
{"original": "indeed, a caribbean sailing on royal clipper has more in common with a yachting trip than a traditional cruise. sailing overnight from island to island, the ship anchors during the day in scenic coves and harbors where the main attraction is basking in the warm caribbean sun, either on royal clipper's top deck or along the nearby shore."}
{"original": "often the ship offers a tender operation to a nearby beach, where its sports team sets up for the day with paddle boards, kayaks and other water toys available at no extra charge. one day even brings a beach barbecue. royal clipper also has a built-in marina at its stern that opens up while the ship is at anchor, offering passengers the chance to swim and kayak directly from the vessel. passengers also can take out the ship's small sailboat."}
{"original": "on board, the diversions are limited. entertainment consists of the occasional after-dinner talent or fashion show (with passengers encouraged to take part). one night a steel drum band comes aboard to play the outdoor tropical bar. but for the most part, passengers are left to make their own fun."}
{"original": "this isn't a cruise for the kind of people who need a lot of (on-board) entertainment like broadway shows, says larry kleiman, 77, of montreal."}
{"original": "speaking moments after snorkeling on his own just off a terre-de-haut beach, kleiman notes royal clipper is full of people who seem to prefer less-programmed vacationing. we'd rather be doing this."}
{"original": "like kleiman, who owned a 30-foot sailboat for years, many royal clipper passengers are longtime sailing fans who know the difference between a jigger staysail and a lower-mizzen topsail. but demographically, the on-board crowd is a diverse lot. a bit over a third of passengers on this voyage (50 out of 136) are americans, but there also are significant numbers of german, french and british travelers on board as well as a handful of italians, swiss, austrians, south koreans and new zealanders. announcements are made in three languages: english, german and french."}
{"original": "the diversity is part of the appeal, says carol donnelly, a 61-year-old psychology professor from chicago who has sailed with star clippers twice before. but there's no getting around the main attraction of the ship: its soaring sails and the wind-in-your-hair, slicing-through-the-waves cruise experience that they allow."}
{"original": "there is something about authentically sailing that makes this very special, donnelly says, pausing to talk at a private reception for repeat passengers. i can't think of another type of vacation that i would rather be doing."}
{"original": "royal clipper sails out of barbados from november through march. a seven-night windward islands itinerary features calls at st. lucia, dominica, antigua, st. kitts, iles des saintes and martinique. also available is a seven-night grenadine islands itinerary that offers stops at grenadine, grenada, tobago cays, st. vincent, martinique and st. lucia. fares for both routes start at $2,200 per person, based on double occupancy."}
{"original": "a smaller star clippers vessel, star flyer, also sails in the caribbean during winters. it operates cruises between havana and cienfuegos, cuba that include stops in cuba and the cayman islands. it also sails to the leeward islands out of st. maarten."}

{"original": "shopping for jewelry for a loved one ahead of valentine's day can be stressful. but learning some tricks should help anyone have an easier time finding the perfect gift. that means understanding a partner's tastes, shopping at reputable jewelry stores and learning what the wording means in terms of how gemstones are graded."}
{"original": "and there's plenty of opportunities to haggle for the best price."}
{"original": "it is a big time to buy jewelry, says amanda gizzi, a spokeswoman at the jewelers of america, a trade association with more than 8,000 retail members. there are some wonderful sales to be had. look for the best pieces for your budget, but don't be dazzled by the discounts."}
{"original": "above all, start researching with time to spare, figure out how much you want to spend, and shop to take advantage of post-holiday sales or limited-time valentine's day deals."}
{"original": "the median price for a piece of jewelry is $350, excluding engagement rings and wedding bands, the trade group says. but there's a wide range of jewelry sellers from target to tiffany. at wal-mart's sam's club, which says its jewelry is priced at a 25 to 40 percent discount over other jewelry retailers, valentine's deals run from jan. 25 to the holiday. macy's jewelry sale, which includes 60 percent off 14-carat and 18-carat gold jewelry, starts jan. 29 and ends feb. 9."}
{"original": "you really do need to shop early if you are budget-minded, said benjamin glaser, features editor at dealnews.com, an online deal comparison site."}
{"original": "look at what your partner is wearing and what's in the jewelry box. if your special someone likes small earrings, don't get big hoops. and if that person is active, don't buy rings with high settings, says gizzi. among the trends this year: updated classics like hoop earrings with diamond chips, or layering rings or bracelets. if you plan to buy diamonds, see if there's a way — subtly! — to find out if your partner would rather sacrifice size over quality or vice versa."}
{"original": "do research and learn the lingo"}
{"original": "check out sites like jewelers of america and online retail sites like blue nile for help understanding key terms like what clarity means when you are talking about diamonds, or want to know more about how gemstones are graded. bluenile.com, which has also begun opening in-person showrooms, offers tools to compare prices from 150,000 independently graded diamonds."}
{"original": "first, be cautious about a store always offering discounts of more than 50 percent. consumers may find the discount price is actually the average retail price elsewhere, says the jewelers of america. buy from a trusted retailer. ask friends for recommendations, or go to websites like the american gem society, which lets you search for reputable jewelry stores by zip code."}
{"original": "as for diamonds, consumers should insist a stone be accompanied by an independent grading report from a respected lab like the gemological institute of america, says josh holland, blue nile's director of brand experience."}
{"original": "also, check out the return policy and find out whether you'd get your money back or would have to exchange an item for credit. and haggle — it's a common practice in the jewelry business, glaser says."}
{"original": "if you want something sparkly but want to avoid gems from conflict zones, synthetic or man-made diamonds are about 20 percent to 40 percent less expensive, according to dealnews. produced in a laboratory, they are chemically the same as mined diamonds, as opposed to simulated diamonds, which are usually cubic zirconia or moissanite. pure grown diamonds, the world's largest distributor of them, has a directory on its website of stores by zip code that offer lab-grown diamonds. while a gemologist wouldn't be able to tell the difference between mined and synthetic diamonds, a jeweler needs to tell buyers the origin."}
{"original": "not interested in spending a lot but still want good quality? consider estate sales. or if you think your partner would want to try out pieces for a while, there's a rental jewelry subscription service called rocksbox.com. it allows shoppers to get three items per month based on their tastes, delivered to their doors. rocksbox.com offers memberships of three months, six months and 12 months with a gift card that can be applied to a purchase. for example, a three-month gift membership plus a $10 gift card is $49. the retail price on the jewelry ranges from $50 to $150 and includes such designers as kate spade and rebecca minkoff."}

{"original": "brigette muller and juliana jules broste will be the company's first global connector bees."}
{"original": "in addition to going on dates around the world, they'll be in search of friendship and business connections – all the while documenting the experiences for bumble through videos, blog posts and social media."}
{"original": "muller and broste will visit designated locations together all over the world for about two weeks at a time, from canada to japan. in addition to free travel, they will also receive a salary (the company didn't say how much)."}
{"original": "they'll showcase their lives while using bumble. following the singapore launch of bumble bizz (the app's networking option), both women will travel to countries such as australia, canada, indonesia, germany, mexico, united kingdom, united states, japan and more."}
{"original": "what is bumble and why this venture?"}
{"original": "bumble is a women-first social network and has 80 million users worldwide. users can choose between three different modes: bumble date (for dating), bumble bff (for friendship) and bumble bizz (for networking). in opposite sex match-ups on bumble, women must be the ones to initiate conversation."}
{"original": "so why go global this way with a once-in-a-lifetime job opportunity? chelsea maclin, vice president of marketing at bumble, tells usa today that it's important for us to advance our on-the-ground research about dating culture worldwide so we can gear our product offerings toward new communities and future generations."}
{"original": "the positions opened to bumble users in summer 2019, and thousands of people applied before the june 14 deadline."}
{"original": "muller came up with an idea to create a travel dating show and wanted to partner with a dating app to do it. then, eight months ago, she got a text message from a friend with a link to bumble's new venture. her plans changed: as soon as i saw the headline i was like, 'no, this is what i want to do,' muller tells usa today."}
{"original": "broste thought she'd be amazing at telling stories and traveling – and since she'd been neglecting dating, she thought she could kill two birds with one stone (as well as make friends and business connections)."}
{"original": "the application process involved many steps: everything from applying within the app to sending a resume to creating and sharing a video talking about bumble and using all three app modes. next came a phone interview and then a visit to austin, where the company is headquartered."}
{"original": "it was originally supposed to be one job, but maclin said in a statement that bumble knew it had to hire both women after meeting them (the two will be traveling together). we felt that it was important to have two people who can speak to their individual experiences of making connections and cultivating their own relationships across cultures, all while traveling together, she added in the statement."}
{"original": "maclin tells usa today that the finalists were made up of all genders and sexual orientations."}
{"original": "juliana and brigette are real, authentic and genuine users of bumble, maclin says. they aren't 'influencers' in the sense that they don't have millions of social media followers or have a ton of brand sponsorships. when we were looking at the global connector bee applications, we really focused on choosing someone who the members of our community could relate to."}
{"original": "muller, 32, of new york was most recently a social media specialist at etsy. she's been a content creator for almost a decade and has nearly 24,000 followers on instagram. broste, 36, is a video journalist who's worked with the travel channel, lonely planet and more, and has about 4,000 followers on instagram."}
{"original": "wait, they'll actually date across the world?"}
{"original": "yes. in addition to canada and japan, the women will head to australia, indonesia, germany, mexico, the united kingdom and u.s., among others, plus singapore."}
{"original": "the company partnered with the singapore tourism board to start the program there; bumble is also launching its bizz option in the country. muller and broste arrive on tuesday."}
{"original": "we're excited to welcome bumble's global connector bees as they start their worldwide journey in singapore and invite them to discover all the possibilities singapore has to offer – from our rich culture, vibrant culinary and nightlife scene, and warm hospitality of our people, rachel loh, regional director, americas for the tourism board said in a statement."}
{"original": "is this job really about dating?"}
{"original": "muller is well-versed in the dating app world and is ultimately looking for a relationship. but that doesn't mean that's all she's looking for (though she is excited to date people in different countries). she wants to live her life and grow, too. i feel like one week of travel is like six months worth of living somewhere else."}
{"original": "she doesn't consider this her own personal dating reality show, either. i'm not viewing this as a dating reality show, it's more just like, this is my life and i get to document it, she says. we all know that reality shows aren't totally real. (tell that to the bachelor contestants.)"}
{"original": "broste is relatively new to dating apps, but is single and ready to mingle."}
{"original": "are they nervous about dating abroad?"}
{"original": "yes, but not about what you might think. while muller and broste will get breaks in between traveling, they're concerned about the physical toll it will take."}
{"original": "muller wants to make sure her body has everything it needs to function at maximum capacity. broste is scared of not sleeping enough. you gotta charge those batteries, you know? she says."}
{"original": "are either nervous about going on dates in foreign countries? both were quick to highlight bumble's safety features as something that alleviates their worries. according to its website, the app (like others of its kind) has block and report features for users to signal red flags, for example."}
{"original": "maclin says: we have a zero-tolerance policy toward racist, hateful language and have partnered with the anti-defamation league to ensure that hate speech is banned from our platform. those who encounter harassment of any kind are encouraged to use our robust blocking and reporting system."}
{"original": "as any solo female traveler knows, you want to have some plans in place so that you're always safe, broste added."}
{"original": "muller is happy broste – who she didn't meet until last week, though they're becoming fast friends – will be by her side, too."}
{"original": "both are open to the idea of making one of the destinations permanent if they find love."}
{"original": "hell yeah, muller says. if you find love, you find love."}
{"original": "will they find love in the hopeless place that is modern dating? we'll have to watch."}

{"original": "more:trump blasts comey as 'total sleaze' in response to fbi probe reports"}
{"original": "it was a great insult, trump said of the times article.it's a very horrible thing they said, and they've gone so far that people that weren't necessarily believers are now big believers because they said that was a step too far."}
{"original": "the times reported that fbi officials first became suspicious of trump's relationship with russia during the 2016 campaign but did not initially act, in part because they were uncertain how to proceed with an inquiry of such sensitivity and magnitude."}
{"original": "but the president's activities before and after mr. comey's firing in may 2017, particularly two instances in which mr. trump tied the comey dismissal to the russia investigation, helped prompt the counterintelligence aspect of the inquiry, the times said, citing unnamed law enforcement officials."}
{"original": "several critics noted that for all his outrage at the report, the president never answered no when pirro asked if he was working for russia."}
{"original": "three white house aides told the associated press that they wished the president had more clearly and forcefully denied being a russian agent when pirro asked him."}
{"original": "trump asserted that i've been tougher on russia than anybody else – probably any other president period, citing increased u.s. oil production, which is, obviously, not great for them, because that's where they get their money for the most part. but many other things."}
{"original": "while trump and his supporters tend to see the report as confirmation of a strong anti-trump bias within elements of the fbi, democrats say it shows how deep the concerns about the president's russian ties run. they assert it underscores the importance of special counsel robert mueller's investigation into russian election meddling."}
{"original": "house minority whip steve scalise argued trump's foreign policy record belies theories he is doing the bidding of russian president vladimir putin."}
{"original": "president trump has taken more steps to stand up against russia than anybody we've seen in a long time, the louisiana republican said sunday on abc's this week. you've seen time and time again with sanctions, with other things, president trump standing up against russia."}
{"original": "look at what he's done with the ukraine. russia was running through ukraine when barack obama was president, and trump approved the sale of tank-busting missiles, which obama had denied, scalise said."}

{"original": "they've put no facts on the table to show there's collusion, he said."}

{"original": "you had trump say only nice things about putin. he never spoke ill about russia. the republican campaign doctrines softened on russia and decreased their willingness to defend ukraine, the virginia democrat said sunday on cnn's state of the union."}
{"original": "i think we all remember when trump, in his bluster, basically said to the russians, if you have got more emails, bring them on, he said. these are not actions of a traditional president of the united states."}
{"original": "the virginia democrat also cited a july 2018 meeting in helsinki between trump and russian president vladimir putin, which he called a frankly, pathetic, embarrassing encounter where trump was kowtowing on the world stage."}
{"original": "warner added that he was troubled by the news that trump's former campaign manager paul manafort shared polling data with a russian agent and that trump wants to lift sanctions on a russian oligarch who is close to putin."}
{"original": "why is he so chummy with vladimir putin? asked sen. dick durbin, d-ill. this man, who is a former kgb agent, never been a friend to the united states, invaded our allies, threatens us around the world, and tries his damnedest to undermine our elections, why is this president trump's best buddy? i don't get it."}
{"original": "durbin and warner both pointed to a washington post report that trump tried to conceal details from his meetings with putin."}
{"original": "when he takes the interpreters' notes and wants to destroy them so no one can see what was said in written transcript, you know it raises serious questions about the relationship between this president and putin, durbin said."}
{"original": "washington – the $20 million that have been donated to a gofundme page to help fund president donald trump's wall along the southern border are going to be refunded."}
{"original": "air force veteran brian kolfage jr., who started the campaign, announced on friday he had formed a non-profit in florida to receive money from gofundme contributions to build the wall himself with a team of officials without the help of the federal government."}
{"original": "we are better equipped than our own government to use the donated funds to build an actual wall on the southern border, kolfage jr. said in his announcement of the new plan. our highly experienced team is highly confident that we can complete significant segments of the wall in less time, and for far less money, than the federal government, while meeting or exceeding all required regulatory, engineering, and environmental specifications."}
{"original": "but gofundme said due to a change in where the money would actually be going, from the federal government to a non-profit, the $20 million will be returned to the more than 337,000 who donated."}
{"original": "this means all donors will receive a refund, said bobby whithorne, a spokesman for gofundme. if a donor does not want a refund, and they want their donation to go to the new organization, they must proactively elect to redirect their donation to that organization. if they do not take that step, they will automatically receive a full refund."}
{"original": "kolfage jr. directed those who donated to a page where they can tell gofundme they're ok with their donation being given to his non-profit. those people have 90 days to take action, he says, before donations will be returned."}
{"original": "he also announced a board of directors for his new non-profit organization, titled we build the wall, inc."}
{"original": "those working on the project include kris kobach, who just lost a bid for kansas governor, and david clarke, a former milwaukee county sheriff and fierce supporter of trump's immigration policy who works at a pro-donald trump super pac."}
{"original": "as part of the rationale to refund money, gofundme cited kolfage jr.'s original statements on the campaign page when it was started, saying that 100% of your donations will go to the trump wall. if for any reason we don't reach our goal we will refund your donation. the campaign has a $1 billion goal listed on its page."}

{"original": "but construction of a wall is at the heart of a contentious disagreement between parties that has been at the center of the partial government shutdown that's now in its 21st day."}
{"original": "homeland security, along with other government agencies, can't simply accept money without the explicit approval of congress. in its policy, the agency cites a federal law that states gifts may not be accepted, used, or disposed of unless specifically permitted by congress."}
{"original": "much of the policy is wrapped around ethical concerns and aims to halt outside money from swaying the agency's decisions."}
{"original": "the college football playoff finale between alabama and ohio state featured two of the most decorated programs in the sport. so just how many national titles has each program won? well, as the kids say nowadays, it's complicated."}
{"original": "the playoff in its current format is only seven years old, of course. an alabama win is its third title in the playoff era, while ohio state has one."}
{"original": "before the playoff was the bowl championship series, and before that was the bowl coalition/bowl alliance that attempted, not always successfully, to match the top two teams in the postseason to create a unified champion."}
{"original": "all of which is a roundabout way of saying that unlike nearly every other collegiate sport, the ncaa has never administered an actual championship tournament in football's top division. for several decades, the so-called national champion was determined by the polls – and they didn't always agree. before the advent of the ap writers' poll in 1936, determining the no. 1 team was even more subjective. it was often done retroactively using mathematical formulas or awarded by various researchers."}
{"original": "so while the ncaa's collection of listed champions in its record book isn't officially official, the organization does recognize 15 seasons crediting alabama with at least a share of a national championship and eight for ohio state before monday's game. there was, in fact, one year when both were voted a share of the title."}
{"original": "since the inception of college football in 1869, there have been 188 national champions crowned. these are the 10 teams who have more than five titles to their names."}
{"original": "here they are by year with a note or two on each."}

{"original": "1926 – the tide went 9-0 in the regular season for a second consecutive year, but this time their rose bowl meeting with stanford ended in a 7-7 tie. both are recognized as national champions by the ncaa."}
{"original": "1930 – wade's third title team again went 10-0 with a rose bowl victory against washington state. notre dame, also 10-0 that year, is recognized as co-champ."}
{"original": "1961 – the first of six championship seasons under the legendary bear bryant concluded with a 10-3 win against arkansas in the cotton bowl. while the tide were voted first in the polls, the football writers association of america chose ohio state."}

{"original": "as with obama, however, trump may also discover his ability to affect events overseas is limited at best."}
{"original": "in expressing support via twitter for anti-government protests that have flared in iran, trump took the opportunity to criticize obama and, in particular, a cornerstone of his predecessor's foreign policy: the iranian nuclear agreement."}
{"original": "the people of iran are finally acting against the brutal and corrupt iranian regime, trump tweeted tuesday, the morning after he returned to the white house from an end-of-the-year vacation at his mar-a-lago estate in palm beach, fla."}
{"original": "bashing the deal the obama administration struck with iran in 2015, trump went on to say that all of the money that president obama so foolishly gave them went into terrorism and into their 'pockets.' the people have little food, big inflation and no human rights. the u.s. is watching!"}
{"original": "the united states and its allies agreed to reduce economic sanctions on iran as it gave up the means to make nuclear weapons as part of the deal. yet trump has accused the iranians of cheating and said he may pull the u.s. from the agreement and revive some sanctions, though those actions risk alienation of allies."}
{"original": "while trump has not made final decisions on how to proceed, white house spokeswoman sarah sanders said, we certainly keep our options open in terms of sanctions."}
{"original": "stressing the difference between this administration's response and the last, sanders also said that president trump is not going to sit by silently like president obama did."}
{"original": "more:everything you need to know about the iran protests"}
{"original": "protesters in iran hit the streets for a sixth straight day tuesday, criticizing the economy and lack of political freedoms from the islamic leadership in tehran. while president hassan rouhani called for calm, iran security forces have arrested people and are vowing further crackdowns. at least 20 people have died and 450 people arrested in clashes between police and protesters."}
{"original": "trump's aggressive approach to iran – he appeared to allude to the possibility of regime change in a new year's day tweet of his own – is in contrast to the more cautious comments made by obama and his aides during their administration."}
{"original": "amid similar protests on iranian streets in 2009, obama did back demonstrators' demands for a more open society, and condemned violence perpetrated by the government. but he did so in a more low-key way, concerned that the iran regime would accuse the united states of meddling in the country's affairs and mount an anti-american campaign to rally its supporters."}
{"original": "it is up to iranians to make decisions about who iran's leaders will be, that we respect iranian sovereignty, obama told reporters in 2009, adding that sometimes the united states can be a handy political football. islamic fundamentalists did that very thing in seizing power from the u.s.-backed shah of iran in 1979, making death to america a theme of their revolution."}
{"original": "despite trump's strong tweets, foreign policy analysts cautioned that his potential to influence what happens in iran is limited – just as past presidents eventually discovered."}
{"original": "our capacity to shape events ... is very, very limited, said aaron david miller, a middle east adviser for past republican and democratic administrations."}
{"original": "david rothkopf, a senior fellow at the johns hopkins school of advanced international studies, said iran presents a moment in which engaged leadership by a u.s. committed to effective, forceful diplomacy is vital."}
{"original": "and yet, rothkopf added, that is tougher in the trump era, given the gutting of the state department and his alienation of allies through policies like the threat to bolt from the iran deal. his tweets may be a show of support for the protesters, he added, but they also reveal the inherent and growing weakness of u.s. foreign policy at the moment."}
{"original": "the protests in iran take place as trump faces a series of decisions on the nuclear deal: the obama-era agreement requires u.s. presidents to certify every 90 days whether or not they believe tehran is in compliance. the next certification deadline is jan. 11."}
{"original": "while international monitors said iran is in compliance, trump said in mid-october he would not certify the agreement, and said he would eventually withdraw unless congress takes steps to strengthen it. during the 2016 presidential campaign, trump threatened to dismantle the disastrous deal with iran, one of several obama foreign policies he pledged to undo."}
{"original": "even as the protests in iran continue, u.s. partners in europe and china remain much more supportive of the nuclear agreement. some of those nations fear that iran may well seek nuclear weapons if the u.s.-backed agreement falls apart."}
{"original": "one country in particular, russia, has sent the united states a twitter warning about iran."}
{"original": "citing a statement by its foreign ministry, the russian embassy in the united states sent a new year's day tweet that said: we express the hope that the situation in iran won't develop under the scenario of bloodshed and violence. this is iran's internal affair. external interference destabilizing the situation is inadmissible."}
{"original": "rothkopf said trump might actually lose influence if he guts the iran nuclear deal. no one else in the international community would go along with it and the u.s. would be isolated, he said. it's possible he could have more influence were he to get involved in a shooting war in the persian gulf but that seems a remote and undesirable possibility at this point."}
{"original": "in the meantime, the trump administration is seeking to put political pressure on the iranian regime. on tuesday, the state department called on iran to stop blocking instagram and other social media sites."}
{"original": "more:iran's supreme leader ayatollah khomeini blames 'enemies' for meddling in protests"}
{"original": "meanwhile in iran, supreme leader ayatollah khomeini has accused the country's enemies of seeking to create problems for the islamic system, though he has not named names."}
{"original": "as he confronts this new challenge, other aspects of trump's foreign policy may make it more difficult for the administration's ability to get other countries to confront iran, analysts said."}
{"original": "trump has heavily criticized international agreements. he has threatened to rip up trade pacts, withdrawn from a global climate change agreement, and recognized jerusalem as israel's capital over the objections of some allies."}
{"original": "the moves, miller said, seem driven by domestic politics and the desire to demonstrate, 'i am not obama.'"}
{"original": "that's one reason building a coalition on the iran front may be difficult, miller said."}
{"original": "and iran isn't trump's only exercise in nuclear diplomacy. he is also trying to get other countries to apply economic pressure to north korea in hopes it will give up its nuclear weapons."}
{"original": "trump himself seemed cautiously optimistic about that challenge on tuesday. sanctions and 'other' pressures are beginning to. have a big impact on north korea. soldiers are dangerously fleeing to south korea. rocket man now wants to talk to south korea for first time. perhaps that is good news, perhaps not - we will see!"}

{"original": "if you're not sure where to start improving your finances, here are 12 things you can do this year -- one for each month of 2018."}
{"original": "according to vanguard's report how america saves 2017, more americans are contributing to 401(k)s because more companies auto-enroll workers, and many auto-enrolled workers make the default contributions set up for them. the tendency to stick to the status quo can be used to your advantage, especially if you set up automatic contributions to a retirement account and to savings accounts."}
{"original": "talk to your human resources or payroll department about setting up a 401(k) and contributing from each paycheck, if you have the option and aren't already doing so. if you don't have a 401(k) at work, set up an ira with a brokerage firm and use your broker or your bank's online features to set up an automatic contribution on payday."}
{"original": "if you're already contributing to a 401(k) or ira, increase your contributions. increasing the amount you contribute by just $1,000 annually -- about $40 if you're paid biweekly -- could give you an extra $110,218 in your 401(k) by age 65, assuming you started at age 35 and earned a 7% return. try to increase contributions over time until they reach around 15% to 20% of income -- though any amount you contribute is better than nothing."}
{"original": "while you're automating contributions, set up an automatic transfer to a savings account for an emergency fund, a house fund, a vacation fund, or any other goal you're hoping to achieve. if you transfer money on payday, you won't spend it and you'll quickly adjust to living without it. you could also use an app like acorns or digit to transfer small amounts automatically to savings without you even thinking about it."}
{"original": "the key is to set up some plan so you're automatically paying yourself first, instead of trying to save what's left over at the end of the month and finding nothing left."}
{"original": "according to the willis tower watson 2017 global benefits attitudes survey, although budgeting and monitoring spending are closely correlated to feelings of financial security, only 35% of workers are budgeters who follow a strict spending plan. by contrast, around 44% of workers are reactive or impulsive spenders, and this group tends to live paycheck to paycheck, have credit card debt, and struggle financially."}
{"original": "having a plan for where your money is going can give you peace of mind and help you use funds wisely. there are a number of approaches to creating a spending plan. you could take a simple approach by allocating 20% of your money to savings, 30% to optional spending on things like entertainment, and 50% to needs, such as housing. you could also create a detailed budget and allocate every dollar to a specific category, such as rent, utilities, savings, debt repayment, groceries, and more."}
{"original": "whichever approach you take, track your spending for at least 30 days to see where your money is going, and make adjustments to create a realistic spending plan that works."}

{"original": "march: tackle your credit card issues"}
{"original": "the average credit card debt for u.s. households is $15,654, according to a 2017 survey by nerdwallet. if you have credit card debt, explore options for reducing your interest rate. there are balance-transfer cards offering special 0% promotional rates -- usually for around 12 to 18 months -- that you could transfer the existing balance on your credit cards to. you'll typically pay a small fee of around 3% of the transferred balance, but won't have to pay interest throughout the year."}
{"original": "ideally, make a plan to have the balance transfer debt paid off by the time the promotional period ends, since the rate typically goes up dramatically after the 0% interest expires. you could also consider consolidating your credit card debt using a personal loan with a lower interest rate."}
{"original": "if you don't have credit card debt but do use cards, make sure you're not among the 20% of people using a card that doesn't match your spending patterns. look for a rewards credit card that gives you the most generous rewards for spending on the things you buy. understand how the rewards work, and claim all you're owed."}
{"original": "and if your card has an annual fee, call and ask to have it waived or reduced. according to a poll conducted by creditcards.com, 82% of people who asked were successful in getting their fees either waived or lowered."}
{"original": "april: get smart about your tax refund"}
{"original": "the average individual income tax refund in 2016 was $2,795, according to the irs. if you receive a tax refund, use the cash wisely."}
{"original": "if you have high-interest debt, putting your refund toward paying it off should be a top priority. if you were making $300 monthly payments on a credit card with a 15% interest rate and a $15,654 balance, using a $2,795 tax refund to pay down this card would allow you to repay the debt in 62 months instead of 86; you'd pay $4,180 less in interest."}
{"original": "if you're not in debt but don't have an emergency fund, start one with your tax refund. you could also put your refund into a retirement account -- with an average-sized refund, you'd be more than halfway toward maxing out an ira -- or invest it to accomplish other goals like buying a house, or taking a course that sets you up for advancement at work."}
{"original": "while there are lots of smart ways to spend a refund, you'd actually be better off if you didn't get a refund at all. don't pay in more than you owe; instead of giving the irs an interest-free loan, you want to keep your money available to invest or pay down debt throughout the year. your employer withholds money based on the w-4 you filled out when you started working, so if you've been getting a big refund, change your withholding information. you may have to update this form due to tax reform anyway, so now's the optimum time to make sure you're getting your money to use when you need it."}
{"original": "may: do some financial spring cleaning"}
{"original": "the arrival of spring is a great time to not only do some spring cleaning at home, but also to get your finances in order by sorting through old paperwork, digitizing as much as possible, and disposing of items you no longer need."}
{"original": "having your paperwork in order ensures you're ready in case of a tax audit. audits can go back around seven years, so keep paperwork that supports your deductions for at least this length of time. as for credit card statements and bank statements, if they're more than a year old they can usually be thrown away."}
{"original": "in addition to sorting through paperwork, take steps to organize the rest of your financial life:"}
{"original": "set up automatic bill payments, so you never have to worry about missing a big payment."}
{"original": "close old bank accounts or investment accounts you no longer use."}
{"original": "roll over 401(k)s from your old job if you're not happy with what they're invested in."}
{"original": "make sure the bank and savings accounts you're using aren't charging exorbitant fees, or paying less in interest than the going rate. if your accounts aren't working for you, shop around to find a different bank."}
{"original": "according to gallup, the average american spends around $100 daily, not counting money spent on a home, motor vehicle, or normal household bills. many of us spend without really thinking about it, buying a coffee before work, grabbing lunch, and picking up a few things from the grocery store on the way home. if we skipped just a few days of spending, they could make a big difference."}
{"original": "to stop mindless spending, try a few no-spend days over the month of june. when you commit to a no-spend day, buy nothing; make do with what you have available. no-spend days get you out of the habit of buying, and force you to find other ways to entertain yourself and solve problems. not only will you save money during each no-spend day, but changing your mind-set could also inspire you to make long-term changes."}

{"original": "electronic toymaker vtech technologies got a costly learning experience monday — a $650,000 penalty for failing to get verifiable parental consent before collecting and using personal information from hundreds of thousands of u.s. children."}
{"original": "the hong kong-based company and its north america subsidiary in arlington heights, illinois were also ordered to comply with a u.s. privacy law, strengthen its data security safeguards, and submit to outside security audits, the federal trade commission said in the federal regulator's first privacy and security case involving electronically connected toys."}
{"original": "as connected toys become increasingly popular, it's more important than ever that companies let parents know how their kids' data is collected and used and that they take reasonable steps to secure that data, acting ftc chair maureen ohlhausen said in a statement issued with the settlement. unfortunately, vtech fell short in both of these areas."}
{"original": "corporate parent firm vtech holdings issued a statement saying it was pleased with the settlement."}
{"original": "following the cyber attack incident, we updated our data security policy and adopted rigorous measures to strengthen the protection of our customers' data. we also took steps to address the technical notice and consent issues,  said allan wong, the company's chairman and group ceo."}
{"original": "the settlement capped a nearly two-year investigation that focused on privacy concerns about collection and safety of children's personal data in the growing digital toy sector. sales of smart toys are projected to reach $15.5 billion in revenues by 2022, tom pahl, acting director of the ftc's consumer protection bureau, said during a conference call with news reporters."}
{"original": "the ftc has received complaints about similar problems with other companies but is barred from discussing ongoing investigations, he said."}
{"original": "vtech facing fallout from data breach"}
{"original": "the ftc started investigating vtech in late 2015 after the company disclosed details of a cyberattack that exposed the name, gender, birth date and other personal data for an estimated 6.4 million youngsters who used the subsidiary companies' interactive easels, online games, electronic tablets, and other popular digital products marketed for children of ages 3 to 9."}
{"original": "although the breach affected data of children in many countries, the u.s. accounted for the largest group of children affected by the breach."}
{"original": "vtech also said the breach exposed identifying data for an estimated 4.9 million adults, including many parents who registered their children for the company's digital toys."}
{"original": "ftc investigators determined that the company violated the federal children's online privacy protection act by failing to provide direct notice to parents or obtain verifiable consent about the vtech's data collection practices."}
{"original": "follow usa today money and tech on facebook"}
{"original": "an ftc complaint filed in illinois federal court said the company collected personal information from parents on its learning lodge navigator online platform, where vtech's kid connect app was available for downloads. the company collected similar information from its now-closed web-based gaming and chat platform known as planet vtech, the complaint charged."}
{"original": "kid connect enables children to communicate with other youngsters who also have the app, or with adults who download the adult version of the app, the complaint charged. parents who wanted kid connect access for their children had to submit their full name, physical address, email address, and password, along with their children's names, birth dates, and gender."}
{"original": "as of nov. 2015, approximately 485,000 u.s. consumers had created kid connect accounts for nearly 638,000 children, the complaint alleged. approximately 134,000 u.s. parents similarly had created planet vtech accounts for 130,000 children by nov. 2015, the complaint charged."}
{"original": "along with failing to get verifiable parental consent about vtech's data collection and usage practices, the company falsely stated that most personal information collected through learning lodge and planet vtech would be encrypted for security purposes, the ftc alleged. none of the information was encrypted, the court complaint alleged."}

{"original": "in a remarkable 11th hour decision, the trump administration designated cuba as a state sponsor of terror on monday, reversing an obama-era decision to remove the communist country from the list as part of its broader rapprochement between washington and havana."}
{"original": "the move, announced by secretary of state mike pompeo comes just nine days before president-elect joe biden takes office. bloomberg first reported the cuba policy decision."}
{"original": "with this action, we will once again hold cuba's government accountable and send a clear message: the castro regime must end its support for international terrorism and subversion of u.s. justice, pompeo said in a statement."}
{"original": "the decision to label cuba as a state sponsor of terror will add to the next administration's already long list of foreign policy challenges, which stretch from iran to north korea."}
{"original": "a biden transition official, who was not authorized to speak about the matter on the record, said the president-elect's team has taken note of this and other recent steps by the outgoing trump administration."}
{"original": "the transition team is reviewing each one, and the incoming administration will render a verdict based exclusively on one criterion: the national interest, said the biden official."}
{"original": "the trump administration has issued a blizzard of sanctions and other policy steps since the nov. 3 election, with many seemingly aimed at stymieing biden's foreign policy priorities or otherwise complicating his first days in office. late sunday evening, for example, the state department announced it would designate an iranian-backed rebel group as a terrorist group, which critics fear could make it harder for aid groups to deliver humanitarian assistance to war-torn yemen."}
{"original": "the cuba policy shift is one final hardline decision that likely will please trump's republican base in florida, where cuban americans overwhelmingly supported him. and it's a slap at biden, who struggled to win over hispanic voters in that key swing state."}
{"original": "rep. gregory meeks, the top democrat on the house foreign affairs committee, said he would urge biden to reverse trump's decision."}
{"original": "for four years, the trump administration's policy towards cuba has been focused on hurting the cuban people – from drastically reducing remittances in the middle of a pandemic to limiting the ability of americans to travel to the island, meeks said in a statement. it is essential that the state sponsor of terrorism list be used judiciously to maintain its seriousness and integrity and that a country is never added to the list unless it meets the legal standard. i urge president-elect biden to add the reversal of today's foreign policy failure to his long 'to do' list when he takes office."}
{"original": "president barack obama moved to take cuba off the terror list in 2015 as part of his historic effort to thaw relations with the island nation after more than 50 years of diplomatic isolation. in a formal notice to congress in that year, obama said a state department review determined that cuba — which was added to the terrorism list in 1982 — met the requirements for removal."}
{"original": "cuba has not provided any support for international terrorism during the preceding 6-month period, and has offered assurances that it will not support acts of international terrorism in the future, obama's 2015 statement said."}
{"original": "in his statement on monday, pompeo said the decision was based in part on cuba's refusal to extradite members of a colombian rebel group, the national liberation army, or the eln. the eln was in peace talks with the colombian government but those ended after the group claimed responsibility for the deadly 2019 bombing of a bogota police academy."}
{"original": "citing peace negotiation protocols, cuba has refused colombia's requests to extradite ten eln leaders living in havana after the group claimed responsibility for the january 2019 bombing of a bogota police academy that killed 22 people and injured more than 87 others, pompeo said in announcing monday's action. cuba also harbors several u.s. fugitives from justice wanted on or convicted of charges of political violence, many of whom have resided in cuba for decades."}
{"original": "the obama administration unveiled sweeping changes in u.s.-cuba policy in 2014, expanding trade with the regime, easing travel restrictions and paving the way for an exchange of embassies in havana and washington."}
{"original": "during his four years in the white house, president donald trump has rolled back many elements of obama's cuba policy. monday's action is a capstone of that and it's likely to provoke the ire of biden, who has vowed to revert to the obama-era policy."}

[in] the west, southwest we're talking largely about mexican americans. if we're looking in florida we're largely going to be looking at cuban americans. if we're in the northeast, we're looking at a larger percentage of puerto ricans, dominicans, other possible variations."}

{"original": "the families also discuss last summer's march on washington. it's one thing to talk to one or two people about your loss and what that person meant to you, melvin says. or in jacob blake sr.'s case, not your loss, but having (your child's) life changed in a dramatic way in a few seconds. but it's another thing entirely when you are surrounded by other people who have similar stories."}
{"original": "in a preview moment shared on the today show, blake sr. can be seen breaking down in tears. melvin approaches situations like these with grace."}
{"original": "when someone is talking about the death of a loved one, or someone's talking about a loved one being injured in an unimaginable way, i never interrupt or stop a mother or father, sister, brother, a child from grieving during an interview, he says."}
{"original": "he has found over the years that for these people, it's cathartic. sometimes i'm just a vessel that allows them to grieve, and to say things that they've been wanting to say, he says."}

{"original": "after his group fell behind, spieth and his playing partners were placed on what golf fans know as the clock. since spieth's group was out of position relative to the group ahead of it, each player in the group was given 40 seconds to hit their shots in an effort to get the group back into position. spieth took more than his allotted time thinking he had enough to spare and was issued a warning for it. if he does it again at anytime during the rest of the tournament, he'll get a fine."}
{"original": "this may seem excessive and the truth is, it's completely reasonable to think the european tour is trying to make an example out of spieth. slow play has been a persistent issue across golf that always culminates in the majors when the pressure is at its highest and players take extra long to hit their shots. and that's hardly the best time for something as ponderous as slow play to at it's height, considering that's when the most eyeballs are on golf."}

{"original": "harkins admits to providing pine tar-like mixtures to both angels and visiting players but his suit contends he did not doctor baseballs, and notes that the club's firing framed him as a turncoat for providing substances both to angels pitchers and opponents – a practice his own club was well aware of."}

{"original": "pelosi has historically appeared to be proper and relied on this grandmother image, but she's actually a very strong, determined woman, said rep. jackie speier, d-calif. her relationship with trump will be a stunning dynamic to watch, speier said, because trump hasn't had to deal with anyone like her before – a mother of five children who knows how to deal with bratty behavior."}

{"original": "washington – president donald trump sought to lower tensions with iran wednesday, a day after tehran fired more than a dozen rockets at iraqi bases hosting u.s. troops, a move that raised fears the two countries were hurtling toward war."}
{"original": "trump used a nine-minute televised address to announce new sanctions on iran and tout the might of u.s. armed services. but just as remarkable was what his address did not include: a direct threat to respond militarily to iran's action, which was a retaliation for a u.s. drone strike that killed top iranian gen. qasem soleimani."}
{"original": "a u.s. official told usa today that there were indications that iran's attack on the bases was intended to send a message rather than to kill u.s. soldiers. iran appears to have fired its missiles into areas of the bases that were unpopulated and where significant damage would be unlikely, said the official, who was not authorized to speak publicly."}

{"original": "but given the limited damage, the u.s. official said the attack appeared designed mainly for a domestic audience to show iranians that the regime was responding to the killing of soleimani. iran has also repeatedly called for the u.s. to leave iraq."}
{"original": "the iranians know how to hit a target when they want to destroy it, said a second u.s. official with knowledge of iranian capabilities who was not authorized to speak publicly. such an attack would have caused grave damage, the official said. it is possible that more moderate elements in the iranian government are pushing for restraint, the official said."}
{"original": "a senior staff member on capitol hill said the iranians appeared to deliberately choose their targets as a warning, not to inflict major damage."}
{"original": "the dizzying series of events this week marked a critical moment in trump's presidency, testing a foreign policy that has rested on unwinding president barack obama's effort to reach out to iran through a multination nuclear agreement that offered sanctions relief in exchange for tehran curbing its nuclear program. trump has long argued that agreement was too lenient on iran."}
{"original": "to underscore the point, trump vowed iran would never be allowed to have a nuclear weapon during his presidency even before he said good morning in his remarks wednesday."}

{"original": "who needs to reach the end zone when you have bell chewing up yards and the clock, and boswell setting an nfl playoff record with six field goals? throw in a stingy pittsburgh defense for most of sunday night, and a multitude of mistakes by kansas city, and the steelers' 18-16 victory sent them into the afc championship game."}
{"original": "the steelers (13-5) needed to hold off a last-ditch threat by the chiefs (12-5) before advancing to face new england next sunday night for a spot in the super bowl. the patriots won at pittsburgh 27-16, but ben roethlisberger was injured and didn't play."}
{"original": "i think it's going to be a showdown, bell said. two great quarterbacks going head to head. two of the best teams in the afc. it's time to settle it next week."}
{"original": "since 2001, the patriots and steelers have combined to win nine afc titles."}
{"original": "spencer ware's 1-yard touchdown run took kansas city within 18-16. the chiefs at first converted the 2-pointer to tie it, but tackle eric fisher — the first overall selection in the 2013 draft — was penalized for holding. the next try failed."}
{"original": "with 2:43 remaining, justin gilbert misplayed the kick return and was tackled at the pittsburgh 5. roethlisberger hit antonio brown for 7 yards on third down and pittsburgh then ran out the clock, securing a ninth straight victory for the steelers. the chiefs have not won a home playoff game since 1994, losing five in a row."}
{"original": "i feel like we left a lot of plays on the field that we should have made, linebacker justin houston said. we didn't; it's the playoffs, every play counts."}
{"original": "the scoring started furiously in the opening minutes, then the game became a kicking exhibition by boswell, who also had six field goals in the regular season against cincinnati. and bell put on a virtuoso running performance, patiently finding holes and then exploding through them. he added a team-record 170 yards rushing to the 167 he had in a win over miami last week."}
{"original": "the coaches put a lot of trust in me to get the job done, bell said of his 30 carries. just run hard. just picked my spots where i could and run hard."}
{"original": "the steelers became the first team to win a playoff game without a td since eventual super bowl champion indianapolis in the 2006 afc divisional round at baltimore."}
{"original": "using a no-huddle attack almost to perfection early on, the steelers drove deep into kansas city territory. but they bogged down inside the 5 and boswell made a 22-yard field goal."}
{"original": "the chiefs were just as efficient on a six-play march capped by receiver albert wilson lining up in the backfield, then slipping uncovered into the end zone for a 5-yard score."}
{"original": "pittsburgh's answer came on a 52-yard heave to all-pro brown, who somehow was covered by houston. that led to boswell's second field goal, a 38-yarder. he added a 36-yarder to cap a 14-play drive on which pittsburgh again barely huddled."}
{"original": "a clean game up until then turned to, well, turnovers, on successive series. bud dupree pounded alex smith, whose pass shot high into the air and was caught by linebacker ryan shazier."}
{"original": "the steelers got to the kansas city 5, where frank zombo leaped to deflect roethlisberger's throw, and all-pro safety eric berry — burned for 26 yards on the previously play — picked it off in the end zone."}
{"original": "boswell's fourth field goal, from 45 yards, made it 12-7 at the half. his 43-yarder, setting the franchise record for a postseason game and tying the league mark of five, came on pittsburgh's first series of the second half. a 43-yarder midway in the fourth quarter gave boswell the nfl record."}
{"original": "it's just about doing my job, boswell said. coming out here, put it through the yellow pipes. don't really think too much. don't think like i'm the guy or anything. i'm just doing my job and doing my one-eleventh for the team."}
{"original": "kansas city's cairo santos got in on the kicking act with a 48-yarder to make it 15-10. at that point, 10 seconds from the end of the third quarter, the chiefs were outgained 333 yards to 150."}
{"original": "switching the game from noon local time to an evening kickoff to avert an ice storm had no effect on the crowd. fans arrived early, tailgated in the rain as the worst of the storm never hit the area. but fog rolled into arrowhead stadium in the second quarter, obscuring some views from on high. not that what was going on was worth watching for chiefs fans."}
{"original": "bell rushed for almost as many yards (101) in the first half as the chiefs gained (106). bell ran for 144 yards vs. kansas city in october in his first game after a three-game suspension for violating the nfl's substance abuse policy.... boswell's four first-half field goals tied the team record for an entire playoff game. ... chiefs all-pro tight end travis kelce had a rough game, including a big drop and a 15-yard roughing penalty in the third period. he did finish with five catches for 77 yards. ... a sign of the steelers' dominance for much of the night: pittsburgh held the ball for 34:13, with kansas city getting 7:06 of its possession time on its final drive."}

{"original": "making contingency plans and bolstering our defenses against this type of retaliation will require the concerted effort of the u.s. intelligence, law enforcement and homeland security communities, and not just a resort to military tools and troop deployments. the nature of this work also requires deft diplomacy and close cooperation with a wide range of allies and security partners in the region and across the globe in the hopes of deterring further escalation of the conflict."}
{"original": "the united states first designated iran a state sponsor of terrorism in 1984. in the decades since, iran has cultivated a network of terrorist organizations, proxies and criminal organizations stretching from afghanistan to west africa and including the western hemisphere. this gives iran a wide range of options in responding to soleimani's death."}

{"original": "here's a look at where things stand:"}
{"original": "judge reed o'connor, a u.s. district court judge in the northern district of texas, ruled in december that the entire aca is invalid. he said the republican tax cut bill knocked the constitutional foundation out from under obamacare by eliminating the penalty for not having coverage. the law, which remains intact during the appeals process, created not just the controversial obamacare insurance plans but also many popular provisions in jeopardy such as protections for people with pre-existing conditions, an expanded drug benefit for seniors and coverage for young adults under their parents' insurance plans."}
{"original": "house democrats joined democratic attorneys general in defending the law. university of michigan law professors nicholas bagley and richard primus argued that the best way for democrats to stop the latest aca challenge is through legislation. congress could make explicit what was implicit in the removal of the penalty for being uninsured – that the aca does not hinge on a mandate to buy insurance."}
{"original": "after congressional republicans failed to repeal the aca, the trump administration tried to write rules on its own. one would dramatically expand the ability of employers to exclude contraceptive coverage in insurance plans for religious reasons. attorneys general from california, pennsylvania and some other states are trying to keep the rule from going into effect jan. 14."}
{"original": "democratic attorneys general, consumer activists and others sued to stop the administration from expanding access to association health plans and to short-term coverage. the administration said consumers need alternatives to obamacare plans, which can be expensive, especially for those who don't qualify for subsidies. opponents said that because the alternatives have fewer consumer protections and benefits, they would siphon healthy customers out of the obamacare market – increasing the premiums for everyone left. in a letter sent to the white house tuesday, congressional democrats asked for more information on the proposed short-term plans – which they argued would not be legal."}
{"original": "following through on trump's promise to reduce the cost of prescription drugs, the administration rolled out various proposals that analyst rachel sachs of washington university in st. louis said range from radical to more modest ideas. most remain in draft form, sachs wrote in a piece for the policy journal health affairs."}
{"original": "house democrats named tackling drug prices as one of their top legislative priorities. proposals include long-standing democratic plans to allow medicare to negotiate for lower drug prices and newer ones that would require the government to make generic medicines. sen. bernie sanders, i-vt., even has a proposal that takes the same approach as a trump administration plan – lowering prices by tying them to what other countries pay."}

{"original": "i think we could have a pretty severe penalty. you've seen other leagues, i can think of the nba specifically, really come down very, very hard on players who have left the bench. some of the altercations that happened 10 or 15 years ago, you just don't see much of that anymore. i think you've got to make the penalty severe enough that it's a hot topic and it's something that even in the most heated moment, it's in the back of that player's mind."}

{"original": "the law provides that such a solicitation is illegal regardless of whether the person soliciting the help receives anything in return. the risks of foreign intrusion in our elections are so great that even asking for help from foreigners without consummation is a crime. but in this case, on or about the same day that trump solicited help from russia, russia made its first attempt to break into servers that hillary clinton's personal office used. that event is laid out in detail in an indictment of russian hackers obtained by special counsel robert mueller."}
{"original": "trump can hardly claim he could not have seen that coming. suspected russian election-related hacking was already much in evidence at the time. nor can he plead ignorance of the law. trump has given sworn affidavits and made other statements that he has deep understanding of campaign finance laws."}
{"original": "trump was warned about foreign solicitation"}
{"original": "indeed, before his july 27, 2016, request of russia, trump had been put on notice that it was illegal for his presidential campaign to solicit support from foreign interests. on june 29 and july 22, 2016, watchdog groups (including one led by one of the authors) filed complaints with the federal election commission and the justice department, respectively, against trump's presidential campaign committee for illegally soliciting financial support from parliamentarians in countries around the world, including iceland, scotland, australia and great britain. multiple news organizations had reported that trump's campaign was violating the ban on foreign solicitations by emailing fundraising solicitations to foreign nationals. the trump campaign did not respond to press requests for comments on the fec complaint."}
{"original": "then-candidate trump, self-described as deeply familiar with campaign finance laws and on notice that his campaign committee was illegally soliciting foreign support, nonetheless proceeded to publicly request assistance from russia to find information to hurt clinton and help his campaign."}
{"original": "some may say trump's invitation was merely campaign rhetoric or hyperbole, which should not be criminalized. but that is to ignore the plain language of the law and its purpose: to protect the united states from the influence of foreign countries in our elections. the statute says, it shall be unlawful for … a person to solicit, accept or receive a contribution or donation … from a foreign national."}
{"original": "in using the word or, the statute makes plain that the act of solicitation in and of itself is a violation. the danger of trump's words can be seen in the fact that russia took them both seriously and literally."}
{"original": "justice department says trump can't be indicted"}
{"original": "if this were an isolated incident, that would be one thing. but the cohen revelations expose a pattern of campaign finance law violations by trump, complete with a tape of him discussing the cover-up: evidence he knew what he was doing was wrong. then there are the many other allegations of illegal conduct, including substantial evidence of obstruction of justice. the president appears to operate with blatant disdain for the nation's laws, and his alleged violation in soliciting campaign help from russia is only one instance."}
{"original": "the president should not be immune from accountability for this alleged misconduct. federal prosecutors should be free to charge him for any campaign finance offenses grounded in probable cause, including, if they see fit, the july 27 solicitation of russia. unfortunately, they are currently blocked from doing so by opinions from the justice department's office of legal counsel that a sitting president may not be indicted. we join eminent experts in disagreeing with those opinions, and this latest possible offense should be one more nail in his coffin."}
{"original": "trump campaign and business could be charged"}
{"original": "even though justice is unlikely to change its mind on charging trump, next best options are available. the trump campaign is legally responsible under principles of vicarious liability for the statements of its head and so could be indicted. the russia solicitation could be included in an indictment featuring other counts, such as charging the campaign and the trump organization for the separate alleged hush money violations described by cohen."}
{"original": "no justice department policy prohibits prosecutors from naming the president as an unindicted co-conspirator in such an indictment. and with a five-year statute of limitations, he could still be prosecuted for these alleged knowing and willful 2016 offenses should he fail to seek or secure re-election in 2020."}
{"original": "campaign finance laws are enacted to protect the american people. they do not exist for candidates to choose whether to comply with the laws or not as they see fit. no one is above the law — not an ordinary citizen and not the president of the united states. president trump must be held accountable for his allegedly illegal activities — for his apparently knowing and willful violations of the nation's campaign finance laws."}

{"original": "melbourne — sloane stephens hasn't won a match in the seven she's played since winning her first grand slam title at the u.s. open last september. nevertheless, the 24-year-old is dismissing that fact as inconsequential as she approaches the start of the australian open."}
{"original": "i think you have to kind of put everything in perspective, evaluate where you are, stephens said. i think personally i had a lot of things going on. it's a new year, new season. i'm hoping not to get injured. there's tons of things to look forward to. i'm not going to dwell too much on that (the losses)."}
{"original": "following her triumphant u.s. open, stephens spent the remainder of 2017 dealing with a knee injury, and lost all six matches played during the remainder of the season, including two at the fed cup final. despite stephens' lacking performance the u.s. increased their fed cup winning record to 18 titles with their 3-2 win over belarus in minsk."}
{"original": "the highlight of the 13th-seeded stephen's autumn came off the court when she graduated with a degree in communications from indiana university east through a discounted online program arranged with the school by the wta."}
{"original": "everyone in my family has a degree. my mom has her doctorate, stephens said. my brother is in college. i have to graduate before him because i'm better than him. i have to prove to him that i'm smarter in everything."}
{"original": "while stephens speaks of hope heading into the new year, she didn't start 2018 on a high note. she lost her first match 6-3, 6-0 to italian qualifier camila giorgi at the sydney tournament earlier this week."}
{"original": "stephens' rise to grand slam champion status played out like a fairytale, which earned her the 2017 wta comeback player of the year honors. sidelined with a foot injury for one month shy of a year, stephens returned to the tour at wimbledon, ranked as low as no. 957 the last week of july, and then went 15-2 in matches played through the u.s. open."}
{"original": "i think it's always a tough transition when you go from not playing tennis for 11 months to winning a grand slam, stephens said. it's never going to be anything you expected. in terms of that, it's a little bit overwhelming."}
{"original": "i thought winning the u.s. open was, like, the hardest two weeks of my life. she said. to win seven matches in a row, to say that's luck? i wouldn't say that. … if it wasn't hard, then everyone could do it, right?"}
{"original": "stephens made her first big impression in the game at the 2013 australian open when she upset serena williams to reach a first major semifinal."}
{"original": "in a position to become the 10th player to win back-to-back titles at the u.s. and australian opens, stephens will play 35th-ranked zhang shuai of china in the first round."}
{"original": "stephens, who was also seeded 13th the only other time she was seeded at the australian open in 2014, is one of four american women with seeding distinction this year. venus williams is the highest-seeded player of the americans at no. 5, coco vandeweghe is no. 10 and madison keys, who lost to stephens in the u.s. open final, is no. 17."}
{"original": "the australian open will definitely not have a repeat champion this year with serena williams remaining on maternity leave after the birth of her first child, daughter alexis olympia ohanian jr., in september. the only past champion in the women's draw is kerber, so there are good odds that the australian open will welcome a new champion in two week's time."}
{"original": "the 37-year-old venus williams arrives here as the closest thing to a defending champion, as it was she who was defeated by her already pregnant sister, serena, in last year's final."}
{"original": "the oldest player in this year's draw, williams reached the australian open and wimbledon finals, and the bnp paribas wta finals, but never won a title last season. this year's australian open has to be considered a wide-open open, and williams' experience, and suitable game style for the hard courts here, could possibly deliver an eighth overall grand slam title, and her first since wimbledon 2008."}
{"original": "she's 37 years old; at her age, winning a grand slam would be a ridiculous achievement, especially as it would be her first australian open title, said martina navratilova, in a column she penned on the wta's official website. last year, williams came so close in melbourne, when she was the runner-up to her younger sister, and now she goes into the tournament knowing she won't have to deal with serena, and that should put some pep in her step."}
{"original": "the women's game is starting the 2018 season in similar fashion to the open-door policy to the world no. 1 ranking that peppered all of last year."}
{"original": "in 2017, five players held the top spot — kerber, serena williams, karolina pliskova of czech republic, wimbledon champion garbine muguruza of spain and simona halep of hungary."}
{"original": "halep, the current no. 1, can be challenged for the top position by five players at this year's australian open. former no. 1 caroline wozniacki of denmark, who won the 2017 year-end title, as well as elina svitolina of ukraine, muguruza, reigning french open jelena ostapenko, and pliskova could all leave melbourne park at the top of the rankings."}

{"original": "since the 2018 elections produced a democratic majority in the house, every discussion about impeachment has begun and ended with the assumption that the republican-controlled senate would brush aside any impeachment, line up behind majority leader mitch mcconnell and exonerate president donald trump. as brookings scholar william galston told the washington post last fall, there's a reason why 'profiles in courage' is a very short book."}
{"original": "this historic moment would be a good time for a new chapter. if we look at individual senators, men and women facing the most consequential decision of their careers, it seems quite possible that trump's presidency does not rest on a strong foundation; rather, it hangs by a slim thread."}

{"original": "►mitt romney of utah. the former republican presidential nominee called trump's pressure on ukrainian president volodymyr zelensky wrong and appalling. this reaction was predictable from romney, who spoke out against trump in 2016 and has continued to be critical. in an october interview with usa today, romney, 72, described himself as free to do entirely what i believe is absolutely right. ... and i hope that my kids down the road will say, 'yeah, you know our dad, our grandfather, our great-grandfather was a person of integrity and honored his oath of office.'  that sounds like a man who is ready to draw a sharp contrast with trump."}
{"original": "►susan collins of maine. collins disappointed many supporters and friends, including me, when she voted to confirm brett kavanaugh to the supreme court, and she faces a very tough reelection campaign this year as a result. but collins has proved her independence in the past. she angered mcconnell by backing president barack obama's economic stimulus in 2009 and opposing repeal of the affordable care act in 2017. collins came to washington in 1974 to intern for then-rep. william cohen, a member of the house judiciary committee, which was then considering president richard nixon's impeachment. she also played an active role in the impeachment trial of president bill clinton in 1999. collins cherishes her position in maine's long line of independent senators — above all, the iconic margaret chase smith, whose statement of conscience attacking sen. joseph mccarthy came more than four years before the senate and the country turned against him."}
{"original": "►lisa murkowski of alaska. murkowski's reaction to trump's treatment of zelensky was instantaneous: you don't hold up foreign aid that we had previously appropriated for a political initiative. period. she has expressed discomfort with mcconnell's outspoken commitment to coordinate trial strategy with trump. murkowski waged an unlikely write-in campaign to win reelection to the senate in 2010 after losing to a tea party extremist in a primary. she stood alone among republicans to oppose the kavanaugh nomination, and she joined collins and sen. john mccain of arizona to block repealing the aca. this headline from alaska public media captures her fierce independence: murkowski, true to form, breaks with gop colleagues on ethical questions about trump."}
{"original": "chuck schumer:the case for witnesses at trump senate impeachment trial gets stronger every day"}
{"original": "virtually every list of potential republican defectors starts with romney, collins and murkowski. here are another three who should keep trump and mcconnell up at night:"}
{"original": "►lamar alexander of tennessee. perhaps the only person in american history who has been a governor, cabinet member, presidential candidate and senator, alexander is probably the most respected republican senator. alexander expressed dismay about the senate' s hyperpartisanship back in 2011 by resigning from mcconnell's leadership team in order to engage in more bipartisan legislating. now, at 79 and retiring after this year, alexander doesn't want to rile the trump base in tennessee. his highest priority may be to ensure that his friend, bill hagerty, succeeds him in the senate. but will that really be enough to align him with tennessee's other senator, marsha blackburn, an extreme conservative who is one of trump's most ferocious defenders? alexander began his storied career as a staffer for the great howard baker in 1967. he should be fully capable of finishing it with the type of courage and independence that baker showed during watergate and the panama canal treaty debate."}
{"original": "►richard burr of north carolina. as chairman of the senate intelligence committee, burr has earned respect for working with democrat mark warner to steer the committee's scrupulously bipartisan investigation of russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. burr has announced that he won't seek another term in 2022. he might be reluctant to break with north carolina's other senator, thom tillis, who is up for reelection and is all in with trump. but few people know better than burr how trump's pressure on ukraine to investigate the bidens detracts from the real steps needed to protect our national security and the integrity of our next election."}
{"original": "senators' choice:trump impeachment trial could be a partisan sham or a master class in civic duty"}
{"original": "►martha mcsally of arizona. perhaps no one faces a more agonizing decision than mcsally, appointed to the senate to fill the late john mccain's seat shortly after she lost an election for arizona's other senate seat. mcsally served 22 years in the air force, rising to the rank of colonel. she was the first american woman to fly combat missions and the first woman commander of a fighter squadron. mcsally also sued the defense department in 2002 over its policy requiring women to wear full body covering when going off-base in saudi arabia. last year, she gave stunning testimony that she had been raped by a superior officer. given her patriotism, courage and outspoken commitment to women's rights, mcsally may have less in common with trump than any living person. will she once again put country first, or decide she has already shown enough courage to take a pass this time?"}

{"original": "wentz's injury was the latest and biggest blow for a team seeking its first nfl title since 1960. the eagles lost nine-time pro bowl left tackle jason peters, versatile running back/return specialist darren sproles, playmaking linebacker jordan hicks, and special-teams captain chris maragos to season-ending injuries."}

{"original": "when an ill-informed, older man at a town hall in iowa accused biden of sending his son to ukraine during the obama administration to sell access to the president, biden could have used the opportunity to calmly but forcefully set the record straight. instead, he attacked the voter as a damn liar."}

{"original": "surely a former vice president, longtime senator and three-time presidential candidate can manage his message better than that."}
{"original": "to be clear, hunter biden's involvement with a ukrainian energy company while his father was vice president is in no way comparable with trump's abuses of power. less a scandal than a family embarrassment, it falls more into the category of billy carter, the ne'er-do-well brother of jimmy carter who hawked billy beer and lobbied for libya, and of neil bush, the son of george h.w. bush who got himself embroiled in the savings and loan crisis while his father was vice president."}

{"original": "federal water managers project a strong possibility — roughly 50-50 — that water levels in lake mead could drop enough in the next year or so to trigger a shortage that would curtail arizona's take of the colorado river through the central arizona project aqueduct. the state draws about 40% of its water from the river."}
{"original": "a deep winter snowpack like what has begun building in the rocky mountains this year could delay the cuts, but experts agree that the system is essentially overdrawn and bold action is necessary regardless of weather."}
{"original": "conservation advocates alarmed by trump's interior pick"}
{"original": "together with nevada and california, the state is negotiating a deal called the drought contingency plan. it would have nevada and arizona cut use of colorado river this year and would commit california to its first-ever surrender of some of its water if the reservoir plunges more in coming years."}
{"original": "until now, california's senior rights to the river have insulated it from any reductions. now though, the states have agreed in principle to collaborate in everyone's interest."}
{"original": "we're all committed to a path forward to protect the lake from crashing, said tom buschatzke, director of the arizona department of water resources."}
{"original": "the plan is an important step but not enough in the long term, according to a new report from western resource advocates titled arizona's water future. as soon as the 2020s, arizona's cities will suffer from a water shortage unless they keep ramping up their conservation and add new tools, such as an ability to store unused shares of central arizona project water in lake mead."}
{"original": "we have to figure out how to thrive with less water supply, said drew beckwith, water policy manager at the environmental nonprofit based in boulder, colo."}
{"original": "the states have not finalized the drought plan because they first must determine internally how to distribute the cuts. arizona is close but needs an expected infusion of federal cash to pay some farmers and tribes to temporarily reduce their share, buschatzke said."}
{"original": "arizona's early offering is 192,000 acre-feet of water that would remain in lake mead. that's enough to support a few hundred thousand households though it largely would come out of agriculture and groundwater replenishment programs; more than two-thirds of the state's water is used for agriculture."}
{"original": "unchecked climate change raising risks of megadrought in the southwest"}
{"original": "an acre-foot is a measure of the volume of water equal to a foot of water over an acre of land, a little more than 325,850 gallons. one acre-foot typically can meet the needs of a three suburban families, including watering the lawn, according to mark leipnik, an associate professor of geography and geology at sam houston state university in huntsville, texas."}
{"original": "arizona's idea is to keep lake mead from dropping to an elevation of 1,075 feet above sea level, which the states agreed back in 2007 would strip arizona of 320,000 acre-feet of water. without action now, that reality appears near."}
{"original": "the water level bounced around the 1,075-foot mark during this past summer's irrigation season but has rebounded during the cool season to almost 1,085 feet tuesday."}
{"original": "though arizona farmers, which rely exclusively on irrigation, would hurt in a cutback, failure to prevent a further 25-foot drop in the reservoir would trigger the loss of 400,000 acre-feet a year because of the 2007 agreement, and a 50-foot decline would make it 480,000, or nearly a third of the central arizona project's allowance."}
{"original": "under the proposed interstate plan, those losses creep higher at every level to prevent a potential total loss if the reservoir keeps plunging."}
{"original": "since the turn of the 21st century through extended drought and overuse, the reservoir's water line has dropped more than 100 feet."}
{"original": "so arizona's internal negotiations actually have sought an even more austere commitment for this year than what the three states have negotiated. it's called drought contingency plan-plus, denoting an extension of the interstate drought contingency plan, and it seeks nearly 400,000 acre-feet from willing participants this year, in a regime that would spread that pain and keep some water flowing to central arizona farmers."}
{"original": "some of the water savings would come from the central arizona project canal operator, as it slows its groundwater replenishment deliveries. others would come from purchases of water from arizona tribes and farmers in pinal county south of phoenix."}

{"original": "the gila river indian community announced a deal with federal officials this week to keep 40,000 acre-feet in lake mead this year."}
{"original": "our agreement with the department of the interior is an essential step toward a plan for comprehensively addressing arizona's pressing drought problem, gila river gov. stephen lewis said in a written statement."}
{"original": "central arizona project customers such as phoenix and tucson understand that they'll likely face higher wholesale water rates because the aqueduct's fixed costs won't change as the amount of water sales supporting them shrinks, buschatzke said."}
{"original": "it's a testament to the fact that people understand how important protecting the lake is, he said."}
{"original": "arizona's envisioned actions alone — without help from other states — would drop the likelihood of mandated shortage to 15% next year, buschatzke said. in combination with the interstate plan, they would hold the risk at 35% in 2019 and 2020."}
{"original": "ultimately, the fear is that a worsening shortage could drop the reservoir below 1,025 feet. that's below the elevations where states have agreed on the consequences, and it would invite radical and unpredictable rationing from the federal interior department."}
{"original": "lake mead drops to lowest level in history"}

{"original": "arizona gov. doug ducey's new budget targets $6 million to the effort over three years. the interior department is expected to kick in $45 million though securing it may take time as president donald trump's administration gets situated in washington. the rest would come from arizona entities committed to the program."}

{"original": "i shoveled the snow from my sidewalk recently, and that got me thinking about masks, the pandemic, and the power of networks."}
{"original": "snow shoveling causes my muscles to scream and my back to shout the loudest, but i do it to make walking safe for anyone who passes in front of my house. up and down the street, my neighbors come out early with shovels and snow blowers to clear their walks, and even clear the sidewalks for our elderly residents. the fact that this happens each time it snows poses an important question of civic responsibility. why should i shovel my sidewalk?"}
{"original": "if each of us acted in our own selfish interest, we would not shovel, and many of us would suffer few consequences, even when local laws require it. for the most part, leaving snow on the sidewalks would only inconvenience regular walkers — those with dogs, and anyone forced to walk on a snowy street with cars. still, if i adhered to a strict code of individualistic self-interest and freedom to act as i want, my convenience would come before that of my neighbors. after all, it helps me very little if the only cleared sidewalk is my own, so why should i shovel?"}
{"original": "instead, i engage another kind of self-interest. i shovel my own walk for the benefit of neighbors and strangers. my actions appear altruistic, but my reward does not just result from doing good. the benefit comes from the power of networks."}
{"original": "the value of my cleared sidewalk can only be realized if my neighbors agree with me and also shovel their own walks. whatever small benefit i gain from a tidy stretch of sidewalk in front of my house grows when my neighbors choose to shovel their sidewalks and connect them into a network of cleared sidewalks. the neighborhood achieves safe and walkable sidewalks because we all inconvenience our individual selves for the collective benefit of our community. together, we gain freedom from the isolation of a snow storm, and from the danger of sharing the street with cars."}
{"original": "in my field of telecommunications, we call such actions network externalities. the greater the number of people connected in a telecommunications network, the greater the value of that network to all of the members, because they each get to connect with more people and benefit from the outcomes of those connections. plus, every time someone joins the network, the value of the network goes up for the rest of us. and, so it is with snowy sidewalks."}
{"original": "covid-19 vaccine rollout:trump, health and human services are throwing away their shot"}
{"original": "each one of us who shovels our own sidewalk joins the network of snow shovelers; and, by doing so, increases the value of the network by adding one more cleared sidewalk. the value of a single cleared sidewalk is small, but the cumulative effect to the neighborhood network is large. as with telecommunications networks, the greater the number of cleared sidewalks in the network, the greater the value to all of us because the network benefits from our individual actions."}
{"original": "after a large snowfall in december, my neighbors and i showed up to shovel wearing masks, and taking extra precautions for each other's safety. in fact, masking up to confront the covid virus offers the same dynamic that takes place when we collectively shovel. the greater the number of people who join the network of individuals wearing masks, the greater the protection offered by mask wearing. likewise, the greater the number of people who join the network of vaccination recipients, the greater the protection offered by vaccines. the power of networks resides in the balance between the freedom to act as an individual and the freedom from harm offered by collective participation."}

{"original": "so, the next time it snows and i trudge out with my shovel to clear a stretch of sidewalk, i will remind myself that i am better off by taking an individual act on behalf of my neighbors. and, when i wear my mask, and line up for my vaccine, i will remember that when we pull together in the same direction, we all go to a better place."}

{"original": "the first bill president obama signed into law his first year in office was, to my great pride, the lilly ledbetter fair pay act. during his final year in office, it is my hope that we can witness a new spate of progress on equal pay for women."}
{"original": "the act that bears my name was a step forward for women, families, and the bedrock american values of fairness and equality. yet on its seven-year anniversary, we still have a gender gap on wages. state legislators and advocates from around the country are launching a week of action to draw attention to that gap and how it can be closed."}
{"original": "when i learned that i had been paid significantly less than my male counterparts at the goodyear plant in gadsen, ala., i filed a federal civil rights lawsuit. yet in its 2007 ledbetter v. goodyear ruling, the supreme court ruled against me because i filed my challenge long after the 180-day statute of limitations had ended. because of the way the law was written, it didn't matter that i was unaware of the wage discrimination during that time window."}
{"original": "two years later, my namesake law restored basic fairness and protections against pay discrimination by clarifying that the wronged employee has 180 days to challenge any paycheck that reflects unequal pay for equal work – not just the first one. this was a major win for women and, i hoped, a precursor of additional progress towards closing the wage gap."}
{"original": "unfortunately, women still make just 79 cents for every dollar paid to their male counterparts, while african-american women make only 60 cents for every dollar white men make and latina women make only 55 cents. today, two of every three american women are the sole or equal breadwinners in their families. yet the workplace and many public policies still haven't caught up with today's america. it's time that finally changed."}
{"original": "to root out pay discrimination, congress should pass the long-overdue paycheck fairness act, updating and strengthening our equal pay laws. in the meantime, however, state legislatures present some of the greatest opportunities to advance the cause of equal pay."}
{"original": "this week, lawmakers in more than 20 states are introducing and highlighting proposals that could help close the wage gap. while equal pay laws are on the books in 46 states and the district of columbia, in almost every state there is more work to do to ensure that pay discrimination is relegated to the past."}
{"original": "among the policy ideas under discussion at the state level are measures that would ensure women are paid as much as men when their job duties are largely the same; bolster salary transparency by, for instance, ending employer rules that prevent workers from sharing pay information with one another; prohibit employers from requiring a job candidate to provide salary history, as reliance on past salary can mean pay discrimination is carried forward from job to job; and require that employers list a salary range in job postings, so women can avoid selling themselves short in salary negotiations."}
{"original": "states are also exploring policies to strengthen enforcement and increase penalties when companies do discriminate. these policies would empower state labor commissioners and regulatory agencies to better enforce the equal pay laws on the books. keeping the price of discrimination high is a powerful incentive for employers to prevent pay discrimination from happening in the first place."}
{"original": "none of these proposals standing alone will end the wage gap. but taken together, they provide a comprehensive approach that will produce meaningful advances toward ending pay discrimination. achieving that long-awaited goal and closing the wage gap would be a win for women and an economic boon for the country as a whole, pumping nearly $450 billion into the american economy."}

{"original": "crimes can happen quickly and without warning. most victims have a split second to react with the best course of action for their survival. by signing sb 175, gov. dewine ensures the law favors victims and not criminals, said john weber, state director for the national rifle association institute for legislative action, in a statement."}
{"original": "while dewine never overtly threatened to veto gun bills, he made clear his priorities."}
{"original": "in a year-end interview, dewine told the dispatch in december 2019, i've kind of made a resolution that i am not going to get into other issues that are related to guns, and i don't think the legislature should, until we pass this (his plan)."}
{"original": "we're focused every single day on passing strong ohio, and that's what i am going to do. that's the commitment i made to the people of dayton and the people of ohio, dewine said of the 4 shooting four months earlier that claimed nine lives in dayton. i believe that next year we'll see the legislature pass our strong ohio bill and there will be a ceremony where i am signing the bill into law."}
{"original": "he echoed those remarks in a 2020 year-end interview."}
{"original": "i've made it very clear, i think, many times going back months that i felt that before the legislature took up other gun bills that they really should focus on what we have sent them, where we know there are things that will absolutely save lives, protect children, protect families, dewine said shortly before christmas."}
{"original": "but monday he said, i have always believed that it is vital that law-abiding citizens have the right to legally protect themselves when confronted with a life-threatening situation. while campaigning for governor, i expressed my support for removing the ambiguity in ohio's self-defense law, and senate bill 175 accomplishes this goal. that is why i have signed this bill today."}
{"original": "the governor had until midnight to sign sb 175, veto it, or let the law changes take effect without adding his signature. with his signature, the law changes will take effect in 90 days."}
{"original": "as originally introduced, sb 175 granted civil immunity to churches, synagogues, mosques and other nonprofit when defensive shootings occur on their premises."}

{"original": "the final bill passed on split votes, with many republicans supporting and democrats and a handful of republicans in opposition. during the final floor debate, sen. hearcel craig, d-columbus, said the bill would inevitably lead to more deadly confrontations and sometimes-violent deaths."}

{"original": "the legislature declined to vote on any of those changes, even after repeated calls to address gun violence from dewine during regular coronavirus briefings."}
{"original": "dewine urged incoming lawmakers, who were taking their oaths of office monday, to act on other gun law changes, including expanded information and alerts in background checks for firearm purchases and increased penalties for the illegal possession, purchase and sale of guns."}
{"original": "everyone who cares about these issues knows that the provisions i am requesting in no way infringe upon the constitutional rights of law-abiding citizens to own firearms, dewine said in his statement after signing sb 175. they know what i am asking for is to make it harder for guns to get into the hands of criminals. these provisions will save lives. these provisions need to become law."}

{"original": "i think we just have to hold ourselves to an extremely high standard, and we have to every day devote ourselves to hitting that goal, said kicker adam vinatieri, who owns four super bowl rings. it's easy to get complacent if you're not striving to get better every single day."}

{"original": "after starting his coaching tenure with three straight 11-5 records and three straight playoff appearances, chuck pagano has gone 8-8 each of the last two seasons. indy was eliminated from playoff contention on the final day of the 2015 season and with one game left in 2016."}
{"original": "no one in this locker room ever accepts losing as the norm or as ok, quarterback andrew luck said. that's absolutely not the fact here, nor will it ever be with the irsay family running this organization. i know that for a fact."}

{"original": "i take full responsibility for all of this stuff, pagano said. i think we've got to be better. have to be better."}
{"original": "and with about $60 million expected to be available in free agency, they need to spend wisely."}
{"original": "here are some things to watch during the offseason:"}
{"original": "helping luck: luck had a career-high completion percentage (63.5 percent) and only threw one more interception (13) in 15 starts than he did in seven games in 2015. he had the league champion in yards receiving (t.y. hilton) and finally worked with a 1,000-yard rusher (frank gore). yet the colts still needed a season-ending win just to avoid a losing season. obviously, the colts need to spend the bulk of their money — and draft picks — on defense. but they also need to put more pieces around luck."}
{"original": "need for speed: four outside linebackers could become unrestricted free agents — erik walden, trent cole, akeem ayers and chris carter — and 35-year-old robert mathis is retiring. walden led the team with 11 sacks and at age 31 could be too expensive to re-sign. mathis was second with five. the rest of the team had 17. so finding a young, dominant pass rusher must be a top priority."}
{"original": "line dance: while the colts allowed 44 sacks this season, there were promising signs from their young offensive line in november and december. center ryan kelly looks like a long-term anchor and two other rookies, swingman joe haeg and tackle le'raven clark, played well when given a chance. indy still needs to see more consistency and more growth, but the colts should feel better about this group heading into the offseason than they did a year ago."}
{"original": "cost cutting: indy needs to get younger on defense and could save some cash in the process. by releasing three players — 33-year-old linebacker d'qwell jackson, 30-year-old defensive tackle art jones and 29-year-old cornerback patrick robinson — the colts could save roughly $13.2 million. jones and robinson battled injuries all season and have not lived up to the billing. jackson was suspended for the final four games for violating the league's performance-enhancing substance policy."}

{"original": "youth have been placed in solitary for actions as insignificant as talking back, moving too fast, or taking candy off a shelf. others have spent months in solitary because they are at risk of self-harm, even though solitary exacerbates mental health problems and suicidality. many youth held in adult jails are placed in solitary to keep them separate from adult inmates for their own safety."}
{"original": "in keeping with the recommendations of justice, mental health and medical experts, the first step act prohibits federal facilities from using solitary as punishment and permits solitary only when youth behavior poses a risk of immediate physical harm that cannot otherwise be de-escalated. youth must be released as soon as they are calm and always within three hours."}
{"original": "the juvenile justice and delinquency prevention act incentivizes states to implement similar reforms. the act requires states to collect and report data to the federal government on restraints and isolation, shedding light on what is too often a hidden problem. it also requires states to describe their strategies to reduce isolation, and provides federal training to support these goals."}
{"original": "critically, the juvenile justice act prohibits states from holding youth in adult jails, except in narrow circumstances. this will make a huge dent in the use of solitary confinement."}

{"original": "abu dhabi – the ufc's anti-doping policy will no longer punish athletes for positive tests for carboxy-thc, the psychoactive ingredient in cannabis."}
{"original": "ufc and u.s. anti-doping agency officials on thursday announced significant modifications in the handling of cannabis and its naturally occurring cannabinoid compounds."}
{"original": "in short, positive tests for carboxy-thc, regardless of levels, will no longer be considered violations to the policy unless additional evidence exists that an athlete used it intentionally for performance-enhancing purposes."}
{"original": "while we want to continue to prevent athletes from competing under the influence of marijuana, we have learned that blood and/or urine levels of carboxy-thc have little-to-no scientific correlation to impairment, ufc senior vice president of athlete health and performance jeff novitzky said in a statement. thc is fat soluble, meaning that once ingested, it is stored in fatty tissues and organs in the body and can be released back into the blood or urine, sometimes long after ingestion."}
{"original": "novitzky said athletes will still not be allowed to compete under the influence of marijuana, but that the ufc and usada will rely on visual evidence of impairment and cognitive behavioral tests to make such determinations rather that any sort of blood level detection, which can often indicate usage well outside of the competition window."}
{"original": "the bottom line is that in regards to marijuana, we care about what an athlete consumed the day of a fight, not days or weeks before a fight, which has often been the case in our historic positive thc cases, novitzky said."}
{"original": "novitzky said he believes the change in policy is simply the latest by the promotion to maintain anti-doping guidelines that are thorough but maintain a sense of fairness for the athletes who must abide by the policy, which was first instituted in 2015."}
{"original": "based on my informal discussion with athletes, there's a significant number of percentage of athletes that choose to use marijuana, many for legitimate reasons outside of recreational, novitzky said. many use it for pain control, anti-anxiety, to sleep, in lieu of more dangerous, more addictive drugs, so hopefully this being the first step to opening that up so that an athlete on wednesday night of fight week instead of going to a vicodin because their knee hurts and they can't sleep can use a little bit of cannabis and get to sleep and have that pain control. it has no affect whatsoever on a competition on saturday night, so it's the right move, and i'm really excited about this revision and that specific policy change."}
{"original": "it is important to note that the change in usada policy does not directly affect regulations by state athletic commissions, so athletes do not have carte blanche with marijuana use following the announcement. however, novitzky is hopeful that the change to ufc policy can ultimately pave the way for similar moves at the state level."}
{"original": "i would caution everybody to temper their enthusiasm about this because we still have the commission factor here, but we are actively working on that, novitzky told mma junkie. we are educating, informing, lobbying them, and i hope not too far in the near future that we can get uniformity across all the rules as it relates to marijuana because i think it would certainly be a benefit to the athletes."}

{"original": "recent news stories have shined a spotlight on presidential power grabs.the supreme court has decided to hear a case challenging president obama's unilateral rewrite of our nation's immigration laws. and a federal judge recently declared that obama cannot assert executive privilege to prevent congress from reviewing documents pertaining to operation fast and furious, which allowed firearms to walk across the u.s.-mexico border into the hands of criminals."}
{"original": "presidents going beyond their constitutional authority is nothing new, and it's imperative that congress fix this to restore our system of government. this week, the house judiciary committee will vote to launch a task force to examine the historic increase in presidential power and executive overreach, which is distorting the system of checks and balances enshrined in the constitution."}
{"original": "the constitution is clear: it is the role of congress to make laws, the judiciary to interpret the laws, and the president to enforce the laws. this system was wisely set in place by the founders well over 200 years ago because they knew firsthand that the concentration of power was a threat to individual liberty and the rule of law. as james madison eloquently wrote in federalist no. 47: the accumulation of all powers, legislative, executive, and judiciary, in the same hands, whether of one, a few, or many, and whether hereditary, self-appointed, or elective, may justly be pronounced the very definition of tyranny."}
{"original": "in recent decades, however, presidents of both parties have aggrandized their power and usurped congress to legislate from 1600 pennsylvania avenue. for example, presidents ronald reagan and george h. w. bush abused their prosecutorial discretion authority to provide executive legalization to tens of thousands of unlawful immigrants. executive overreach has accelerated at an alarming rate under the obama administration. obama has failed on numerous occasions to enforce acts of congress that he disagrees with for policy reasons and has also stretched his authority to put in place policies congress has refused to enact. he has delayed the obamacare employer mandate unilaterally, essentially stopped the enforcement of our immigration laws, provided quasi-legal status to unlawful immigrants, and released terrorists from guantanamo bay without notifying congress as required by law, just to name a few examples."}
{"original": "there are many reasons that this should be concerning to the american people. when a president fails to follow statutory mandates or prohibitions, he reverses the votes of the people's duly elected representatives in congress. and when the president unilaterally refuses to enforce parts of statutes he himself signed into law, he makes a mockery of our system of government and avoids accountability. if this practice is allowed to continue, no longer would presidential candidates running for reelection have to stand on their records, because they could sign one bill into law, and enforce another version of it in practice, and thereby avoid responsibility for their actions at politically opportune times."}
{"original": "the constitution affords congress several remedies to counter the executive branch's power plays, such as the power of the purse. however, the rapid acceleration of executive overreach warrants a deeper congressional review of this threat to the separation of powers and its checks and balances. just last year, a federal judge indicated the obama administration had used federal funds that weren't appropriated by congress to fund obamacare. when the president does that, the power of the purse wielded by congress is empty and other remedies are needed."}
{"original": "the house judiciary committee's specialized task force will study the growing problem of executive overreach and will also look for solutions to prevent the executive branch from continuing to exceed its constitutional authority. it will be part of the task force's mission to study the impact the increase in presidential power has had on the ability of congress to conduct oversight of the executive branch, the lack of transparency that furthers unchecked executive power, and the constitutional requirement of the president to faithfully execute the law."}
{"original": "additionally, the task force will review the tools at the disposal of congress to restore the proper balance of powers and hold the executive branch accountable. it will also make recommendations where there are deficiencies, including legislative solutions."}
{"original": "preventing the executive branch from overstepping the boundaries of its constitutional authority is not a republican or democratic issue. it is an american issue that touches the very core of the constitutional design of our government. the separation of powers and its checks and balances are designed to protect individual liberty and we must ensure that it is preserved for future generations."}

{"original": "football recruits nationwide can sign a national letter of intent on wednesday, but what does the document say? here are 10 things to know."}
{"original": "1. it is not mandatory that a prospect sign a letter of intent"}
{"original": "by signing a players agrees to attend the school listed for one academic year, and the school agrees to award him athletic financial aid for one academic year. a player can sign a financial aid agreement and get basically the same assurance of a scholarship as he would with the letter of intent, but the player does not have to forfeit his ability to go elsewhere without being released by the school. for the letter of intent to be valid, it must be signed by the player and his parents/guardian."}
{"original": "related: more previews of national signing day"}
{"original": "2. more than the letter of intent"}
{"original": "at the time of signing the letter of intent, a player must receive a written offer of athletic financial aid for the academic year. a player and his parents/guardian must also sign the financial aid agreement. that documentation specifies the terms, conditions and amount of the athletics aid award. that document is also often accompanied by a document from the conference that outlines conference policies regarding the nli and grant."}
{"original": "3. penalty for not attending for a full year"}
{"original": "the full year covers two semesters or three quarters as a full-time student. just spending the season with the team does not count as fulfilling the initial terms. if a player leaves a school and enrolls in another school, he cannot play until he fulfills one full year at the second school. by leaving in less than a year, the athlete also forfeits a year of eligibility in all sports."}
{"original": "4. players sign with a college, not a coach"}
{"original": "if the coach for whom the athlete expected to play leaves the school, he is still bound to the letter of intent until released. i understand it is not uncommon for a coach to leave his or her position, the document states. and though that is what's on paper, listen to virtually every recruit and they all talk about the relationships they have formed with coaches during the process."}
{"original": "5. no guarantee of playing time"}
{"original": "there is no mention of playing time in the letter of intent. the letter of intent guarantees a player financial aid, not that he will start or even see the field."}
{"original": "6. once a players sign, recruiting is over"}
{"original": "the nli specifically bans players who signed from contact with other institutions, and other schools are obligated to respect my signing and shall cease contact with me and my family members after my siging this nli, which includes me and my family not initiating contact with athletic staffs at other institutions. the responsbility is on the player to notify the other coach that he has signed."}
{"original": "7. player has to qualify academically for the nli to apply"}
{"original": "the letter of intent is voided if the school notifies the player in writing that he has been denied admission or fails to provide notice of admission before the start of classes in the fall semester. the player is obligated to go through the admission process and provide documents, etc., like all students. the player also must meet ncaa initial eligibility requirements and is responsible for enrolling with the ncaa eligibility center. the letter of intent is voided if a player is an academic non-qualifier."}
{"original": "8. the coach can't be there"}
{"original": "a coach or representative of a school cannot hand-deliver the paperwork off campus or be present off campus when the player signs. and despite all those fax machines, the document can be returned electronically and an electronic signature is allowed."}
{"original": "terms of the letter intent remain in place if a player quits the team or if a player never enrolls in the school that he signed with."}
{"original": "10. how do you get out?"}
{"original": "the document directs players to the nli web site to request a release and review the policies. the letter notes that the nli policy and review committee is authorized to issue interpretations, settle disputes and consider appeals. that decision can be appealed to the nli appeals committee, whose decision is final and binding."}
{"original": "on a september afternoon more than six years ago, robert michel, a consumer finance executive, tried to navigate the grinding gridlock that suddenly appeared on the narrow streets of fort lee near the george washington bridge."}
{"original": "what michel did not realize was that he was trapped in what came to be known as bridgegate — the bizarre plot to punish fort lee's democratic mayor with traffic jams because he refused to endorse the reelection of republican gov. chris christie."}
{"original": "this tuesday in washington, the u.s. supreme court will try to navigate a vexing question that still lingers from bridgegate: does manufacturing traffic jams for political payback constitute a federal crime?"}
{"original": "that the controversy over traffic on fort lee's streets has moved to the nation's highest court is the latest turn in the bridgegate saga. the scandal unraveled christie's presidential ambitions in 2016. it also painted a shocking portrait of the brass-knuckle underbelly of new jersey politics."}
{"original": "but the bridgegate case's advancement to the supreme court leaves motorists like michel confused."}
{"original": "doesn't the supreme court have better things to do? he asked from his office at the empire state building in manhattan. i thought this was over and done with and finished."}
{"original": "michel still has painful memories of the bumper-to-bumper cars and trucks he battled in fort lee during several rush-hour mornings and afternoons in september 2013."}
{"original": "it was just jammed up all over the place, he said. traffic was backed up forever."}
{"original": "although the bridgegate case has become legally complex, the scheme itself was relatively simple. after fort lee mayor mark sokolich declined to endorse christie's reelection in 2013, close allies of the governor cooked up a payback plan: to embarrass the mayor by causing traffic jams on his borough's streets."}
{"original": "just after dawn on monday, sept. 9, 2013 — the first day of public school classes in fort lee — workers from the port authority of new york and new jersey were ordered to block two of the three access lanes from fort lee to the george washington bridge. the port authority did not warn fort lee police or sokolich. later, the port authority tried to cast the lane changes as part of a traffic study."}
{"original": "no matter. the impact was immediate and devastating."}
{"original": "with only one lane — and one tollbooth — linking fort lee to the world's busiest bridge, thousands of cars and trucks were immobilized on the borough's streets."}
{"original": "for hours, traffic was a nightmare. ambulances and firetrucks were delayed. buses carrying students were late to school. police could not respond to emergencies. thousands of ordinary commuters were late for work."}
{"original": "the architect of this scheme was david wildstein, a brash republican operative and a christie appointee at the port authority."}
{"original": "for years, wildstein cultivated a reputation for playing political dirty tricks on opponents. he bragged that he once stole a suit coat from sen. frank lautenberg just before the senator was to walk on stage for a debate."}
{"original": "at the port authority, wildstein saw a chance to build a bigger profile. he later admitted he orchestrated the traffic jams to impress christie and gain a spot on the governor's 2016 presidential campaign."}
{"original": "but christie's hopes for the white house vanished after the traffic scheme was revealed by northjersey.com and other media outlets. republicans nominated donald trump."}
{"original": "christie denied he knew of wildstein's traffic caper, but he could not escape criticism that his bombastic attacks on opponents created an atmosphere that led to bridgegate. christie left office in january 2018 as one of the least popular governors in new jersey history."}
{"original": "wildstein later cooperated with federal prosecutors who targeted two of christie's close allies:bridget anne kelly of ramsey, the governor's deputy chief of staff, and bill baroni, a former state legislator who was tapped by christie's to be the port authority's deputy executive director."}
{"original": "left untouched by federal investigators were christie and his staff, some of whom are believed to be on a list of unindicted co-conspirators that has been kept under seal by a federal judge."}
{"original": "kelly, who is not related to this columnist, sent the now-infamous email to wildstein in august 2013 that gave the go-ahead for the plot: time for some traffic problems in fort lee."}
{"original": "after the email was made public five months later on northjersey.com, wildstein offered to cooperate with federal authorities."}
{"original": "in 2016, kelly and baroni were convicted of fraud, conspiracy, mail fraud and violating the civil rights of motorists after a six-week federal trial in newark and sentenced to prison. wildstein, who testified against them and now runs a website on new jersey politics, cut a deal with prosecutors and received probation after pleading guilty to two conspiracy charges."}
{"original": "what the high court will consider"}
{"original": "a federal appellate court later threw out the civil rights convictions against kelly and baroni but left the fraud convictions for the supreme court to ponder."}
{"original": "baroni, 48, began serving his 18-month prison term last spring, but he was set free after the supreme court announced in june that it would consider the case."}
{"original": "both kelly, 47, who was sentenced to 13 months behind bars, and baroni remain free on bail as they await a supreme court decision on their case. tuesday's hearing — only one hour long — is their last chance to escape prison."}
{"original": "baroni declined to comment, as did wildstein, now 58. but kelly said in several interviews in recent weeks that she is hoping to be vindicated."}
{"original": "a single mother of four, kelly has long argued that she was duped by wildstein into thinking that the plan to realign access lanes to the george washington bridge was really a port authority traffic study. she also said that christie approved the plan, along with several other high-ranking members of his administration."}
{"original": "i've been waiting and waiting for the truth to be told, said kelly, who has struggled financially and personally since her conviction."}
{"original": "i want my life back, she added. i want my kids to have their lives back."}
{"original": "one of her principal regrets, she said, was her attempt to be humorous when she dashed off her time for some traffic problems email to wildstein."}
{"original": "i regret the words that i used, she said. and i regret believing that the person who received it would interpret it otherwise than for what it was meant."}
{"original": "kelly said a large contingent of relatives and friends, including her children — mary kate, 23; conor, 19; liam,16, and anne marie, 13 — plan to join her at the supreme court. baroni is also expected to bring a group of relatives and friends."}
{"original": "what they will likely hear at the court are legal arguments that are far different from those at the contentious trial in newark."}
{"original": "that trial focused on who was telling the truth and whether christie should have been indicted. as the supreme court considers the case, its focus will likely be much different. the high court must consider whether prosecutors overstepped by charging kelly and baroni with fraud."}
{"original": "kelly's attorney, yaakov roth, said the bridgegate caper may have been bad politics — but it was not a federal crime."}
{"original": "roth's entry into the case is significant. he is a noted supreme court litigator, a former clerk for now-deceased justice antonin scalia and a partner at jones day, a law firm with ties to conservative figures on the court and elsewhere in the federal judiciary."}
{"original": "roth opted to take up kelly's case free of charge because he said he believed that her conviction was part of a trend in which aggressive prosecutors used federal statutes to ensnare public officials in political misdeeds."}

{"original": "in his brief to the supreme court, roth accused federal prosecutors in newark of applying vague federal criminal laws — in this case, fraud statutes — to impose standards of good government."}
{"original": "roth claims the federal prosecutors essentially looked to the politics behind the bridgegate plan — to punish fort lee's mayor — to file criminal charges. in his brief to the supreme court, roth wrote that such a precedent was dangerous — and unconstitutional — because it could give prosecutors the opportunity to turn the political motives of government officials into possible crimes."}
{"original": "taken seriously, it would allow any federal, state, or local official to be indicted based on nothing more than the (ubiquitous) allegation that she lied in claiming to act in the public interest, roth wrote. consider a cabinet secretary who appoints a friend to a public post, declaring him to be best-qualified. or a deputy mayor who orders pothole repair to reward her boss' political base, justifying it on neutral policy grounds."}
{"original": "roth wrote that federal prosecutors would then have a playbook for how to prosecute political adversaries that transforms the federal judiciary into a ministry of truth for every public official in the nation."}
{"original": "lawyers for the u.s. solicitor general's office, who are opposing roth at the high court, plan to argue that the fraud laws were appropriate in the bridgegate case because kelly and baroni misused federally funded port authority property to carry out a political scheme."}
{"original": "the solicitor general's office did not respond to a request for comment. baroni's chief attorney, michael levy, also declined to comment."}
{"original": "besides the legal arguments by lawyers for baroni, kelly and the prosecution, other voices have weighed in. additional briefs were filed by the national association of criminal defense lawyers and by sen. sheldon whitehouse, a democrat from rhode island."}
{"original": "whitehouse, a member of the senate judiciary committee, called for the court to uphold the convictions against kelly and baroni. otherwise, whitehouse said, the supreme court could strip prosecutors of their power to investigate political corruption."}
{"original": "the jury box stands as a potent bulwark against tides of public corruption and improper influence, whitehouse wrote."}
{"original": "the association of defense lawyers countered by calling the bridgegate convictions of kelly and baroni the latest example of prosecutorial overreach."}
{"original": "in yet another brief, attorneys for former virginia gov. robert mcdonnell, a republican whose bribery conviction was reversed by the supreme court in 2016, also criticized the convictions of kelly and baroni on grounds that they did not commit fraud."}
{"original": "one issue that will likely not emerge in supreme court arguments but nonetheless lingers as part of bridgegate's legacy is whether christie should have been targeted for prosecution."}
{"original": "kelly's lawyers have long contended that federal prosecutors failed to thoroughly investigate christie because he was a u.s. attorney in newark before becoming governor."}
{"original": "we have a big factual dispute as to what took place, said michael critchley, who was kelly's chief defense lawyer at her newark trial. our position is that the traffic plot was done at the behest of chris christie."}
{"original": "assemblyman john wisniewski — a democrat from sayreville who led a legislative investigation into bridgegate with state sen. loretta weinberg, a democrat from teaneck — said he believed that christie should even have been investigated for tampering with evidence. wisniewski pointed to reports that christie deleted a series of text messages from his cellphone as a prime reason to question him."}
{"original": "wisniewski also wondered why federal investigators never ordered christie to turn over his cellphone. under withering criticism over bridgegate, christie gave his cellphone to his attorney at the time, christopher wray, who now heads the fbi."}
{"original": "no matter how the supreme court rules, bridgegate will likely still hold a place in history as an example of politics gone bad."}

{"original": "president trump has directed me to rebuild our offshore oil and gas program in a manner that supports our national energy policy and also takes into consideration the local and state voice, zinke said in a statement released by his office. i support the governor's position that florida is unique and its coasts are heavily reliant on tourism as an economic driver. as a result of discussion with governor scott and his leadership, i am removing florida from consideration for any new oil and gas platforms."}

{"original": "i have spent my entire life fighting to keep oil rigs away from our coasts. but now, suddenly, secretary zinke announces plans to drill off florida's coast and four days later agrees to 'take florida off the table'? i don't believe it, nelson said in a statement. this is a political stunt orchestrated by the trump administration to help rick scott, who has wanted to drill off florida's coast his entire career. we shouldn't be playing politics with the future of florida."}
{"original": "the drilling proposal, announced last week, includes 47 potential lease sales in 25 of the 26 planning areas — 19 sales off the coast of alaska, seven in the pacific region, 12 in the gulf of mexico, and nine in the atlantic region."}
{"original": "the five-year plan, covering 2019 to 2024, was initiated by the america first offshore energy strategy directive president trump signed in april that could eventually open up arctic waters and millions of coastal acres off u.s. shores to oil and gas drilling."}
{"original": "our country is blessed with incredible natural resources including abundant offshore oil and natural gas resources, but the federal government has kept 94 percent of these offshore areas closed for exploration and production, trump said at the time. this deprives our country of potentially thousands and thousands of jobs and billions in wealth."}
{"original": "when he announced the five-year plan last week, zinke said his agency would work with states and members of congress who represent potential drilling areas to allay concerns. but the move already was getting pushback from a number of florida officials including scott, a trump confidante, who said he would oppose drilling off florida's coasts where tourism and coastal military installations are important to the state's economy."}
{"original": "after meeting with zinke tuesday, scott issued a statement headlined gov. scott fought to protect florida's coastline."}
{"original": "by removing florida from consideration, we can now focus on how we can further protect our environment, including our proposal for record funding for the everglades, our springs, our beaches and our state parks, scott said. i will never stop fighting for florida's environment and our pristine coastline."}

{"original": "i'm not picking a bottom here. who knows what it would be, hamm said of oil prices. but the lower it goes, the shorter time it will be there. that's the way it works."}
{"original": "on the face of it, hamm's outlook appears especially bullish, considering that brent, the international benchmark for oil prices, and west texas intermediate, the u.s. marker, both plunged below $35 a barrel last week."}
{"original": "but he says he's all the more confident of a recovery since congress lifted 40-year-old restrictions on exports of oil from the u.s. to other countries last month."}
{"original": "there's a new world order now for oil markets, he said in an interview. even though we could export oil up to 1975, it's different now. the big game changer is that we have the resource that we didn't have then. we have the supply due to the horizontal drilling that nobody anticipated earlier."}
{"original": "the combination of horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing has enabled u.s. producers like continental resources to squeeze oil from tight shale formations in texas, north dakota and other states that were all but impenetrable until a few years ago. the breakthroughs in technology drove domestic oil production to 9.6 million barrels a day last april, the highest level since 1970."}
{"original": "the surge in u.s. oil production has begun to taper off, however, thanks to the downturn in prices. the u.s. energy information administration predicts that production will continue to decline through september, ending the year at an average of 8.8 million barrels a day, compared to 9.3 million barrels a day in 2015."}
{"original": "whether oil prices will rise much at that point, and stick, is subject to all kinds of speculation. but regardless, hamm said he's certain that freeing u.s. oil companies to compete in world markets will make a big difference."}
{"original": "we're certainly on a level playing field in the world of competition now, said hamm, whose oklahoma city-based company is one of the biggest shale oil producers in the country. it's not a panacea but it's certainly something to build on."}

{"original": "we'll be in the mix at some point, hamm said of continental resources. but it's a go now. we're beginning to see it take off rather quickly because we've got premium quality light sweet crude that refineries need, primarily in europe and other places."}

{"original": "if the pace of covid-19 vaccine delivery into people's arms stays the way it has been for the past few weeks, it could take years rather than months to vaccinate americans, and the outbreak will continue to dominate lives."}
{"original": "federal officials overestimated the speed at which vaccines could be given, making delivery a disappointment in an otherwise successful vaccine development effort."}
{"original": "doses have been distributed behind the government's initial schedule – 15 million, instead of the 20 million doses promised to be delivered by the end of 2020. about 70% of those doses are sitting on pharmacy shelves, according to government data, and only about 14% of doses destined for nursing home residents and caregivers have been injected."}
{"original": "although vaccination is off to a rough start, it's not too late to turn the situation around, according to experts such as kelly moore, deputy director of the immunization action coalition, an education and advocacy group."}

{"original": "operation warp speed, the federal program tasked with developing and delivering covid-19 vaccines, promised to vaccinate 20 million americans in december."}
{"original": "three weeks after shipping began, the program has distributed 15 million doses to hospitals and nursing home providers, but only 4.5 million people have gotten the first of the two-shot regimen. that means 30% of available doses have been used."}
{"original": "among nursing home residents and caregivers, 365,000 shots have been delivered out of more than 2.5 million distributed – a 14% usage rate."}
{"original": "the numbers may be somewhat better than they appear because of a lag in reporting, but there's no question that fewer shots are being given than was planned or expected."}
{"original": "federal officials have focused on getting the vaccine onto hospital shelves, but to get them off the shelves requires an enormous human element, moore said."}
{"original": "there are always bugs when you translate from paper to practice, she said, and federal plans didn't give enough consideration to the need for scheduling and organizing clinics, educating patients and caregivers and resolving the small problems that crop up."}
{"original": "hospital workers and public health officials are exhausted after 11 months of fighting the virus."}
{"original": "and now they're being asked to ramp up the most ambitious vaccine program the country has ever seen, said dr. howard koh, a former assistant secretary for health at the u.s. department of health and human services and now a professor at the harvard t.h. chan school of public health."}
{"original": "the protocols for this vaccine are different from those for the seasonal flu vaccine, for which a nurse can wheel a cart through hospital hallways, delivering shot after shot."}
{"original": "people who receive a covid-19 vaccine have to be watched for 15 minutes to ensure they don't have an allergic reaction. this requires hospitals to set aside space and personnel – both of which are at a premium."}
{"original": "the process is further slowed as caregivers have to think about who should or shouldn't be vaccinated."}
{"original": "all of those things are just part of the not-unexpected challenges we face in implementing such a complex program with a new vaccine based on a new platform in the midst of the height of the pandemic with exhausted health care workers who are at the end of their rope after all the work they've been doing for the past year, moore said."}
{"original": "by the time there is enough vaccine to distribute outside hospitals and other care facilities to the broader community, vaccinators will have worked out some of the kinks in the system, she said."}
{"original": "it may get easier to vaccinate large numbers of people when shots can be delivered at neighborhood pharmacies and health care facilities."}
{"original": "cvs is ready to deliver vaccine at all 10,000 of its pharmacies nationwide and expects to be able to give 20 million to 25 million doses a month once enough vaccine is available."}

{"original": "it took 52 clicks on each person's digital medical record before the patient was ready to receive a shot. that was after yai had managed to get consent forms signed by family members and guardians for those who couldn't sign for themselves."}
{"original": "it was just freaking endless, wolf said of the paperwork."}
{"original": "he and two others were able to vaccinate 40 people in three hours, far fewer than he anticipated."}
{"original": "ten caregivers refused to receive the vaccine. some wanted to talk it over with family members. others wanted more people to go first, while some repeated conspiracy theories about the vaccine."}
{"original": "wolf said he considers himself a pretty persuasive person, and he was armed with lots of facts about the minor side effects and major benefits of the vaccine, but he said he and his colleagues couldn't persuade those 10 to get vaccinated."}

{"original": "there's no right way to prioritize who should get the vaccine first, second and third, moore said, but having each state choose its own path is too confusing. the right way to do this is to pick one way, she said."}
{"original": "these problems are all solvable, moore said, and it's realistic to think they will be fixed within the next month, and the number of vaccinations will reach 1 million a day nationwide, as fauci suggested."}
{"original": "surgeon general jerome adams, speaking on nbc news' today show, agreed that the state delivery systems have been uneven, some distributing 75% or more of available doses and others not even 25%."}

{"original": "he came out of the bullpen sunday for the first time in his 18-year nfl career, and the result could not have been better for the denver broncos, who emerged with home-field advantage throughout the afc playoffs."}
{"original": "but let's not book them for a trip to santa clara, calif., just yet. manning clearly gave denver and its fans an emotional lift. but let's not forget he completed five of nine passes for 69 yards – hardly sublime numbers. manning's ability to hand off beat the san diego chargers, whose 27th-ranked rush defense was ground up for 212 yards by ronnie hillman and c.j. anderson."}
{"original": "no matter how spry the five-time mvp is feeling -- and the bye week should further heal him -- he can only hope to regain rhythm with the starters in practice and obviously still won't be more mobile or have a better arm than brock osweiler in two weeks. and is the broncos' sometimes transparent o-line really going to stop j.j. watt, justin houston or cam heyward when one of them shows up in the divisional round? finally, the specter of manning's 11-13 playoff record -- and he's 2-5 in his last seven postseason games – still hangs over him."}

{"original": "rb deangelo williams went down with an ankle injury in week 17, and his availability for saturday is unclear. we saw what happened exactly a year ago when le'veon bell -- williams was signed as his insurance policy -- was injured in the regular-season finale. pittsburgh was reduced from offensive juggernaut to an unbalanced and predictable outfit that went one and done in postseason."}
{"original": "and though they're likely to draw cincinnati bengals backup qb aj mccarron, who struggled against pittsburgh in a 33-20 week 14 loss at paul brown stadium (mccarron's first substantial nfl action), let's not forget that in their most recent outings, steelers were beaten by ryan mallett -- after his crash course with the baltimore playbook -- and struggled for three-plus quarters to put away the smoldering cleveland browns and third-string qb austin davis."}

{"original": "my takeaway from wolff excerpts is what isn't said: when everyone else in the west wing is busy fighting amongst themselves, where is mike pence? he was busy stocking administration with hoosiers and ideological allies, trying to ensure long term success of conservative policy, tweeted trevor foughty, a former spokesman for the indiana republican party."}
{"original": "what wolff does include about pence is likely to continue the debate over how he has been able to stay largely unscathed by the chaos and dysfunction in the white house, particularly in its early months. is pence canny enough to navigate the roiling waters, or is his profile low because he's a non-entity?"}
{"original": "wolff offers this favorable assessment from katie walsh, a former deputy chief of staff to trump, who saw the vice president's office as a point of calm in the storm. pence's aides returned calls quickly, accomplished tasks easily, liked each other and were dedicated to eliminating as much friction as possible around the vice president, according to the book."}
{"original": "pence himself, wolff wrote, used extreme self-effacement to solve the riddle of how to serve as the junior partner to a president who could not tolerate any kind of comparisons."}
{"original": "pence, walsh is quoted as saying, is not dumb. (walsh has said she did not make statements in the book attributed to her.)"}
{"original": "while pence's stay-in-the-shadows approach may work with trump, his extreme submissiveness struck some as suspicious, wolff wrote in a section on how the ivanka trump and jared kushner faction in the white house viewed pence."}
{"original": "those allied with former chief of staff reince priebus liked that pence was one of the few west wing figures who treated priebus as if he actually was chief of staff. yet, wolff adds this dig from that side: pence often seemed like a mere staffer, the ever present note taker in so many meetings."}
{"original": "and the third competing faction in the early white house — steve bannon, the chief strategist who the white house says gave wolff access to the administration — had only contempt for pence, according to the book."}
{"original": "pence is like the husband in ozzie and harriet, a nonevent, the book quotes one bannonite saying."}
{"original": "after bannon observed a hapless pence, in a lot of wrong meetings regarding the russia investigation, he helped to bring nick ayers in as pence's chief of staff and get pence — our fallback guy — out around the world to look like a vice president."}
{"original": "although many saw him as a vice president who might well assume the presidency someday, he was also perceived as the weakest vice president in decades, wolff wrote, and, in organizational terms, an empty suit who was useless in the daily effort to help restrain the president and stabilize the west wing."}
{"original": "a note: wolff himself said that the details in the book are in conflict with one another and that many are baldly untrue. in some cases, he said the reader would be allowed to judge the versions told to him. for other details, he settled on a version of events i believe to be true."}

{"original": "johnny c. taylor jr.: congratulations on your upcoming graduation! first, i want to applaud you for thinking ahead. informational interviews can be a great way to learn about an organization's culture and values from someone who knows it best."}
{"original": "your concerns are valid. reaching out to someone you've never met before can feel a bit awkward. but my best tip for feeling confident is being prepared."}
{"original": "before you do anything, i recommend familiarizing yourself with the company you're interested in. start by checking out their website and social media platforms to explore the content they share. is there an initiative or project you personally connect with? what questions might you have about the work and culture? read articles that feature the company or include quotes from the members of their team. those stories can provide you with insight into their priorities and the way they work."}
{"original": "because that first step is often the hardest, i'll ask this: do you have a mutual connection with anyone working at the company? maybe it is a friend or someone who went to the same school as you. if so, you could respectfully reach out and see if they can make a virtual introduction, if appropriate."}
{"original": "once you make plans to meet for an informational interview, map out and rehearse your questions ahead of time. identify a couple of areas you want to learn more about, such as what a typical day in the office looks like or the kinds of services the business offers. this can provide guideposts for your discussion and keep you on track."}
{"original": "also, you should be prepared to share a little bit of your personal background, such as what you're studying, why you're interested in working in the advertising industry, and any relevant experience you have that you could apply to the field."}
{"original": "if you're respectful and prepared, the people you interview with will likely be impressed by your initiative. just remember to do the following: take a deep, relaxing breath, ask your questions, and be yourself. and last but not least, don't forget to follow up with a thank you email or handwritten note. i hope you found this helpful. best of luck!"}

{"original": "taylor: thanks for your timely question. if i have learned anything in 2020, it's that the pressures of the past year have impacted employers and employees in a million little ways. to put it simply, balancing work and personal responsibilities in the middle of a pandemic and economic downturn is hard."}
{"original": "during a time when many of us are not physically in the office, practicing empathy with in-person and remote employees – who may feel isolated and overwhelmed – is especially important."}
{"original": "i would go a step further and say empathy isn't a soft skill, but a business skill – it's what helps people work with others who have different stories, styles, and perspectives. it's a trait that is truly needed in today's workplaces."}
{"original": "i've seen first hand how employers and hr professionals are working hard to build more empathetic workplaces. as a manager, you're in a unique position to help people on your team who may be facing work and personal stressors. if you aren't already, i suggest having regular check-ins – keeping a close eye on workload, body language, and nonverbal cues – and having an open-door (or open-zoom) policy where your team can touch base with you regularly or as needed. the importance of honest communication and frequent engagement cannot be overstated."}
{"original": "i also want to stress this: empathy is a two-way street. employers are navigating some of the toughest challenges they've ever faced. managers and hr are working furiously to meet both employee and business needs. listening, showing compassion and instilling empathy in company culture can't be done by employers alone. it takes employee buy-in, too."}
{"original": "the ability to have and display empathy is, and will remain, a critical part of leadership – before, during, and after this pandemic. when you practice empathy, you are setting a strong tone for the organization's culture and a roadmap for success. thanks for reaching out – we're all in this together!"}

{"original": "if you've been working for a couple of decades or more, then you're probably thinking about the day when you'll be able to clock out for the last time and start living life on your own terms. retirement represents a huge change in your lifestyle and your financial situation, so if you want to enjoy it to the fullest, you'll need to do some serious planning and saving before you make the leap."}
{"original": "if you're near the finish line and thinking of retiring within the next five years, then first make sure you can answer yes to the three questions below."}
{"original": "1. are your retirement savings on track?"}
{"original": "if you have been saving diligently for many years and have reaped the growth of the stock market over that time, then you should have a sizable balance saved in your retirement accounts. if your savings are minimal or nonexistent, then you will probably need to continue working for more than five years -- and ramp up your retirement savings as well."}
{"original": "so how do you know when you have enough money saved up? start by figuring out how much annual income you'll need in retirement (for most people, it's about 70% to 80% of their pre-retirement income). then subtract the yearly income you expect to receive from social security (you can get an estimate by creating an account at ssa.gov), a pension, or any other income source besides your retirement savings. what remains is the amount of income your retirement savings will have to provide. if you have enough money saved up to provide that income for as long as you expect to live, then you're in pretty good shape. for context, if you plan to retire around age 65, many experts say your savings should be sufficient to provide at least 25 years' worth of income."}
{"original": "it is wise to enlist the help of a financial planner when estimating your future income needs, as planners can take all of your financial information and plug it into a sophisticated program that incorporates historical market returns and other factors such as your tax bracket, social security and pension benefits, investment objectives, risk tolerance, and time horizon."}
{"original": "2. is your portfolio allocated correctly?"}
{"original": "if you are nearing retirement and your portfolio is invested almost exclusively in stocks, then it's probably time to start moving some of that money into safer alternatives such as bonds or annuities. stocks can provide a greater rate of growth over time, but they can also result in large losses when a bear market hits. and this is something that you can't afford if you plan to retire in five years, as it may take longer than that to recoup your losses (as many investors have discovered since the bear market in 2008). a good rule of thumb is to subtract your age from 110, turn the result into a percentage, and allocate at least that much of your portfolio to bonds and similarly safe investments. for example, if you're 65, then you should have at least 45% of your portfolio invested in safer investments."}
{"original": "that said, no matter your age, you'll want at least 25% of your portfolio in equities in order to maintain a hedge against inflation."}
{"original": "3. are you prepared to pay for long-term care expenses?"}
{"original": "although this issue won't likely arise in the next five years, it is still something you need to prepare for before you retire. long-term care expenses can devastate even the best-laid retirement plans if you lack insurance coverage or dedicated funds to pay for them. although the cost of long-term care can vary considerably depending upon the level of care you need and where you live, it can easily cost $50,000 to $100,000 a year or more.and the average stay in a nursing home generally lasts about two-and-a-half years."}
{"original": "one of the latest innovations in the life insurance industry is the introduction of policies that have accelerated benefit riders allowing the policy holder to access some or all of the death benefit in order to pay for expenses related to disability or long-term care. this can be a more economical way to insure yourself against the high cost of this form of care."}
{"original": "these are just some of the questions you'll need to be able to answer if you would like to retire in the next five years. if you are unsure of whether you are prepared to retire in the next five years, find a financial advisor who can provide you with advice on when you can safely retire and what you need to do to prepare."}

{"original": "it weighs on you driving home after a night shift and someone didn't make it, knowing society could have intervened and helped, said bobby redwood, an emergency and preventive medicine physician."}
{"original": "medication-assisted treatment is a proven method for successfully treating substance abuse disorders by combining anti-craving medicines such as buprenorphine or methadone with supportive counseling and behavioral therapy."}
{"original": "anti-addiction drugs such as buprenorphine, a narcotic also referred to as suboxone, can diminish withdrawal symptoms for a patient in detox — an otherwise uncomfortable and challenging experience."}
{"original": "a lot of the work we're doing is figuring out: what does a community need to become buprenorphine ready and medication-assisted treatment ready? said redwood, a former president of american college of emergency physicians's wisconsin chapter."}
{"original": "more people died nationwide of drug overdoses in 2017 than ever before — a staggering 10 percent increase in deaths compared to 2016. a high concentration of those deaths occurred in mid-atlantic states and midwestern ones like wisconsin."}
{"original": "wisconsin saw a 35 percent increase in fatal opioid overdoses between 2015 and 2016. emergency department visits for overdoses were the highest in the nation, with an astounding 109 percent increase between 2016 and 2017, according to the centers for disease control and prevention."}
{"original": "but tough obstacles and many miles often separate those suffering with opioid addiction from reaching outpatient programs that provide medication-assisted treatment or a clinician who can prescribe buprenorphine."}
{"original": "for those vulnerable and in underserved areas, the er is often the only access to health care, said gail d'onofrio, a professor of emergency medicine at yale school of medicine, in a statement."}
{"original": "d'onofrio and her team received a grant of nearly $820,000 last year to develop a way for ers to administer buprenorphine and overcome bureaucratic and medical barriers to implementation."}
{"original": "in a landmark study in 2015, d'onofrio found patients who started on buprenorphine out of the emergency room were twice as likely to stick with treatment — and therefore twice as likely to avoid overdose —compared to those who received only references to local clinics."}
{"original": "more:opioids kill kids, too – through accidental overdose, suicide and homicide"}
{"original": "wisconsin also has a significant shortage of substance abuse disorder counselors, which has resulted in treatment programs and clinics unable to fill jobs, according to the pew charitable trusts, an independent research organization."}
{"original": "prior to 2017, only physicians could prescribe buprenorphine and similar mat drugs."}
{"original": "to close this gap, gov. scott walker signed a measure into law allowing physician assistants and nurse practitioners to prescribe buprenorphine if they completed additional training."}
{"original": "opponents of medication-assisted treatment point to the controversy of treating drug addiction with other drugs. critics say mat focuses on substituting one drug for another rather than advocating abstinence and that anti-addiction drugs have potential for abuse."}
{"original": "as a schedule 3 drug, there is a fairly low chance people will become addicted to buprenorphine, according to toni simonson, executive director of hshs western wisconsin and prevea behavioral care."}
{"original": "it's different than prescribing for pain, simonson said. it's prescribing for addiction."}
{"original": "physician assistants and nurse practitioners have a unique opportunity to identify people with substance abuse disorders who come into their primary care offices or emergency rooms, according to sam spencer, a pa working in addiction medicine."}
{"original": "there's a lot of little towns and physician assistants in the er who understand addiction and want to do the best for their patients, which is starting them on suboxone, spencer said."}
{"original": "although some states are experimenting with buprenorphine as an emergency service, implementing something similar in wisconsin may take longer."}
{"original": "to administer medication-assisted treatment, emergency departments must follow clinical protocols to ensure patients receive the behavioral or counseling component of treatment."}
{"original": "on its own, buprenorphine is not as effective at treating addiction if a patient can't follow up with a behavioral health counselor."}
{"original": "i think a lot of our workforce feels hamstrung because they don't have those behavioral health and primary care follow up resources, said redwood, the emergency and preventive medicine physician."}
{"original": "not because they're not motivated, but because it doesn't exist in their county."}

{"original": "a patient in withdrawal at oconomowoc's er was assessed and started on medication-assisted treatment with a dose of suboxone. he was referred to a program at rogers memorial hospital the next day."}

{"original": "the videos begin without audio as the police suv pulls up to a sidewalk and pauses. standley can be seen approaching the right-hand side of the vehicle, from the sidewalk. standley appears to touch the car, and the driver appears to start the vehicle. standley falls down out of view, and the driver stops the car and walks around to the other side."}
{"original": "girl aint nobody hit you like that, the driver says as he looks down at standley, who lies motionless on the road, her leg under the front right tire and blood pooling around her head. the officer begins exclaiming in curses and yells, squad can i get an ems over here."}

{"original": "bodycam video from a second officer in the vehicle appears to show the first officer pace near standley, periodically prodding her. several more police vehicles arrive, and officers block off the area with caution tape. officers tell standley to remain still and tell her that an ambulance is on the way."}
{"original": "standley was rushed to the university of chicago medical center in critical condition. she spent time in the icu and was transferred to a rehabilitation research hospital."}
{"original": "people said it was like the sound of a gunshot – her head smashed on the ground, stroth said. to this day, a year and several months later, she's still undergoing therapy and treatment for her injury. martina standley will never be the same person she was prior to this accident. she hasn't been able to go to work. she's still getting rehab. and that's due, we believe, to the head trauma."}
{"original": "stroth filed suit against the city and the two officers involved within days of the incident and received the bodycam videos in september. the case is in discovery, and standley was expected to give her deposition next week, stroth said."}
{"original": "in the wake of the incident, community organizer william calloway – who along with independent journalists led the push to get chicago officials to release the video of the police shooting of laquan mcdonald – filed a freedom of information act request for the videos. he received them in november, when a cook county judge ordered the department to satisfy the request."}
{"original": "the incident took place in my community, our neighborhood of south shore. i was getting conflicting reports, so i took it upon myself to file the request, calloway said. it took about a year. the city of chicago did make us fight for the release of the bodycam video. it wasn't something they willfully did. they claimed a four-year exemption that did not meet the criteria, and the judge agreed with us."}
{"original": "the civilian office of police accountability, the police department's civilian oversight agency, opened an investigation into the incident on nov. 21, 2019. the agency initially determined that standley approached the officers in their vehicle and that the officers were not engaged in police action and the incident did not involve a use of force, meaning the video was not authorized for release under city policy, the agency said in a statement."}
{"original": "stroth, however, argues the officers did use force. an officer with the chicago police department weaponized his 4,700 pound patrol vehicle and ran over martina standley, an unarmed and innocent 32-year-old black woman, he said."}
{"original": "the copa investigation is ongoing. the officers involved in the incident remain on full-duty status while the investigation continues, the chicago police department said, offering no further comment."}
{"original": "asked about the incident in a press conference tuesday, chicago mayor lori lightfoot said she was unfamiliar with the matter."}
{"original": "the video release tuesday comes as lightfoot's administration faces scrutiny for its handling of a february 2019 police raid at the home of anjanette young, an innocent social worker who had just returned home from work and undressed when police officers executing a search warrant entered the wrong home and handcuffed her. last month, city lawyers attempted to stop the release of bodycam video of the incident."}
{"original": "lightfoot has faced criticism for her changing narratives around what she knew about the young case and when. she had a private meeting with young last week and said she had apologized to her."}
{"original": "similar to the anjanette young case, it took the city of chicago several months to release the video evidence, stroth said. it's imperative that mayor lightfoot, supt. david brown and the law department take steps to make sure videos are released in a timely fashion and that chicago police officers are trained to value the sanctity of life."}
{"original": "stroth said standley wanted people to see the video of the incident so that the officers involved would be held responsible."}
{"original": "when it comes to foreign policy, it's already clear that one of the biggest differences between the outgoing trump administration and the incoming biden team will be iran. in contrast to the current u.s. policy of maximum pressure toward the islamic republic, president-elect joe biden and his advisers have already promised a more conciliatory approach centered around a revival of the 2015 nuclear deal with tehran."}
{"original": "but what about iran's role as the world's leading state sponsor of terrorism? that's a title the iranian regime has held since the u.s. government began formally keeping track of terrorist trends since 1984. nevertheless, american attention to the issue has waxed and waned over the years in tandem with the priorities of successive administrations in washington. the present white house, though, sees it as a major issue — and, in its final days in office, is working to make sure that the next one does as well."}
{"original": "that was the broader context behind secretary of state mike pompeo's tuesday address at the national press club, in which the trump administration's top diplomat outlined the deep and ongoing connections between iran and al-qaida. these connections, pompeo contended, reflect a partnership that has provided strategic benefits to both parties and has been a major reason behind al-qaida's continued relevance in recent years."}
{"original": "over the past half-decade, he noted, iran's notorious ministry of intelligence and security as well as its feared clerical army, the islamic revolutionary guard corps, have provided safe haven and logistical support to the bin laden network, and as a result the group's leadership has now become centralized in the islamic republic. indeed, it was precisely this arrangement that made it possible for al-qaida's second-in-command, abu muhammad al-masri, to gain sanctuary in tehran, where he was targeted and killed last august, ostensibly by israeli operatives."}
{"original": "middle east:biden's defense pick is no civilian. but maybe he could help us leave the middle east."}
{"original": "the end result is nothing short of a game changer in counterterrorism terms. for american allies in the region, who could be targeted by iran and al-qaida working in tandem, the implications of this development are undoubtedly dire. but the iran-al-qaida partnership also represents a danger to the nascent normalization wave between israel and the arab states — the momentum of which could be blunted if al-qaida, with iranian backing, takes serious steps to destabilize the region anew."}
{"original": "shiite and sunni radicals work together"}
{"original": "at bottom, though, the contention outlined by pompeo is hardly new. for years, counterterrorism experts have questioned the conventional wisdom that shiite and sunni radicals simply cannot and do not cooperate. as proof that the opposite is true, they have pointed to things like past collusion between al-qaida and lebanon's terrorist powerhouse, hezbollah, as well as shiite iran's longstanding sponsorship of hamas, the islamist group that serves as the palestinian branch of the sunni muslim brotherhood movement."}
{"original": "yet the idea that iran doesn't make common cause with sunni extremists has proved to be a stubborn one and still holds sway in many corners — much to the detriment of a proper understanding of iranian regime behavior. in the wake of pompeo's presentation, which included reference to official intelligence assessments as well as publicly known instances of iran-al-qaida cooperation, that fiction should become more difficult to sustain."}
{"original": "biden and the middle east:joe biden should go slow on afghanistan. we need patience in this peace process."}
{"original": "the main thrust of the presentation, however, was undoubtedly political. the revelations put forth by pompeo create some hard choices for the biden camp. short of simply disregarding these connections, the new white house will be at pains to explain why it remains eager to restart negotiations with iran — and how it can do so without empowering precisely this sort of continued rogue behavior on tehran's part."}
{"original": "we ignore this iran-al-qaida nexus at our own peril, pompeo urged. we need to acknowledge it. we must confront it. indeed, we must defeat it."}
{"original": "it's clear, though, that such an effort is no longer within the power of the trump administration to prosecute. the onus now falls to its successor to tell us whether it will — and, if so, how."}

{"original": "former vice president joe biden and sen. bernie sanders of vermont, who built their campaigns appealing to opposite ends of the democratic voter spectrum, sharpened their focus on world affairs after a u.s. airstrike killed top iranian gen. qasem soleimani in iraq."}

{"original": "biden delivered a special address tuesday in new york on the situation with iran. standing in front of american flags, biden said the airstrike proved trump to be dangerously incompetent. he accused the president of a haphazard decision process and a reckless disregard of the consequences that would surely follow. he added that trump has failed to provide a sober-minded explanation for the airstrike, which he said has put the u.s. and iran on a collision course."}

{"original": "since october, sanders has separated himself in polls from sen. elizabeth warren, the other top democrat in the liberal lane, solidifying himself in second in recent national polls behind biden. he overcome a heart attack that month and pundits who had written off his campaign. if the democratic primary is as drawn out as it was in 2016, sanders could set up his foreign policy differences with biden as an issue for the months ahead as both men battle for votes."}

{"original": "days after alex rodriguez signed his 10-year, $252 million contract following the 2000 season, ramirez signed a mega-deal of his own – $160 million with the red sox. it may have been the greatest free agent signing of all time, as ramirez earned every single penny during his eight seasons in boston."}
{"original": "his .996 career ops is eighth in history. he ranks 16th all time with 1,122 extra-base hits,19th with 1,831 rbi and 15th in home runs with 555. ramirez is seventh in career war among left fielders, trailing five hall of famers, barry bonds and pete rose."}
{"original": "the case against: while others have been excluded from the hall of fame based on the assumption of ped-usage, voters actually have the concrete proof that ramirez violated the league's policy. other than rafael palmeiro, ramirez is the only player – up to this point – with real hall credentials to be suspended under mlb's drug policy, which began in 2004."}
{"original": "x-factors: in his first year on the ballot, ramirez got 23.8% of the vote – an encouraging sign at first glance, considering that palmeiro only received 11.5% in his debut on the ballot back in 2011. however, ramirez's initial showing is on par with the 23.5% for mark mcgwire's first year. mcgwire's support tapered off over his time on the ballot, finishing with 12.3% in his final year."}
{"original": "it's certainly possible that ramirez will trend upwards in coming years, seeing as barry bonds and roger clemens have each gained about 17 points of support since 2013. still, that could very well be the ceiling for both of them."}

{"original": "you're reading our view, one of two perspectives in today's debate. for the opposing view, read cabinet picks are missed chance for change."}
{"original": "some presidents hire teams of rivals. president-elect joe biden is assembling a team of retreads. and thank goodness for that."}
{"original": "biden completed his cabinet nominations two days after the deadly assault on the u.s. capitol by a pro-trump mob — a tragic and all too appropriate coda to the trump era. boring is the new thrilling, cnn commentator van jones said a few days after biden won the election. as president donald trump incites his supporters to violence and becomes increasingly erratic in his final days, not to mention making history as the first president to be impeached twice, boring is still an elusive goal."}
{"original": "but biden holds out promise for duller days ahead. and by dull, we mean steady, professional and aligned with american values."}
{"original": "it's hard to overstate the importance of experience and expertise, both in policy areas and in the workings of government, for the team that will confront the floor-to-ceiling, wall-to-wall havoc inflicted by trump and his administration. biden's nominees not only know what they're doing, some of them have literally done it before."}
{"original": "agriculture secretary-designate tom vilsack and surgeon general-designate vivek murthy held the same jobs in the obama administration. biden's secretary of state pick antony blinken and secretary of homeland security choice alejandro mayorkas were deputy secretaries in those departments during the obama years."}
{"original": "attorney general nominee merrick garland, a judge on the u.s. court of appeals for the district of columbia, will return to the justice department, where he supervised several high-profile cases during the clinton era. michael regan, secretary of the north carolina department of environmental quality, would head the environmental protection agency, where he previously served under the clinton and george w. bush administrations."}
{"original": "some of biden's picks have never been part of an administration, but they make sense. education secretary nominee miguel cardona, a former public school teacher, principal and assistant superintendent of schools, has been connecticut's education commissioner through the covid-19 crisis. boston mayor marty walsh, biden's labor secretary nominee, joined a union at age 21 and as mayor fought for labor causes such as the $15 minimum wage and paid family leave. rhode island gov. gina raimondo, the commerce secretary nominee, led her state out of one of the nation's worst unemployment crises and earlier had founded the first venture capital firm in her state."}
{"original": "none of this should be noteworthy, and yet it is, because it is such a stark departure from trump's scattershot cabinet selection criteria: do well on fox news? look like a statesman? pledge loyalty? eager to weaken and disrupt their agency? never met an obama policy they wanted to keep?"}
{"original": "this is how you end up with an oil ceo as secretary of state, a neurosurgeon as secretary of housing and urban development, an acting director of national intelligence with no national intelligence background, an education secretary with little knowledge of (and seemingly even less interest in) public education, and a centers for disease control and prevention director who seemed to forget for months that his primary, most essential job was to convey clear, science-based information and guidance on covid-19 to states, the health sector and the public."}
{"original": "democrats might want to remind their republican colleagues of all this when they go after nominees such as transportation secretary designate pete buttigieg. the 38-year-old former mayor of south bend, indiana, served in the military, was a mckinsey management consultant and ran a creditable race for the 2020 democratic presidential nomination. that background stacks up nicely against team trump's john mcentee, 30, the presidential personnel director in charge of purging officials deemed disloyal, fired by the administration in 2018 for online gambling but brought back last year, and james bacon, the college senior he hired as his director of operations."}
{"original": "like most of his cabinet appointees, the white house staff biden has chosen is also squarely in the category of been there, done that — starting with incoming chief of staff ron klain, who was vice presidential chief of staff for both al gore and joe biden, and later served as president barack obama's ebola response coordinator."}
{"original": "one reason you need old hands is the old hands know where the old bodies might be buried, biden said last month. he himself, at age 78, with decades of service in the senate and as obama's vice president, is the old hand in chief. by giving him the democratic nomination and electing him president, voters made clear what they wanted."}
{"original": "progressives are dismayed by some of biden's nominees, particularly the corporate business they did between stints in government. but as trump continues to ignore a pandemic that has killed hundreds of thousands of americans — and stokes the lies and violence that led to terror, gunfire, vandalism and death at the capitol — biden's focus on experience is not surprising."}

{"original": "the reckless decision to kill iranian commander qassem soleimani, along with several other iraqi and iranian officials, cannot be undone. but it can be an impetus for the belated exit of u.s. forces from iraq, who may still avoid needless trouble."}
{"original": "iraq's parliament passed a resolution calling for the u.s. military forces (along with other foreign units) to be expelled. washington should accept the invitation."}
{"original": "even critics of killing soleimani note he was a murderer, who had u.s. blood on his hands. while this is true, it's largely beside the point. u.s. foreign policy does not exist to dispense global justice by punishing the wicked. it exists to serve u.s. security and prosperity, and protect our liberties here at home. talk of justice distracts from consideration of consequences. soleimani's death is likely to lead to bad ones, possibly including broader war, especially if we insist on leaving relatively small numbers of forces nearby to absorb the trouble this week's strike set off."}
{"original": "soleimani was not a rogue outlaw, but a military official of a sovereign government we were not at war with, making his killing an assassination. his actions, however evil, served iranian policy. even iranians with no love for his ilk now bridle with nationalist outrage. iranians rally around the flag, too. adding to the outrage will be saturday's news the u.s. strike was a long-planned punitive measure aimed at punishing iran for actions taken by the kataeb hezbollah militias it supports in iraq — and not a means to stop an imminent attack on u.s. forces as trump administration officials claimed."}
{"original": "an iran with nuclear weapons is a real, frightening possibility"}
{"original": "iran is unlikely to directly attack u.s. forces, given the consequences. but they are now substantially more likely to resume their nuclear weapons program. that is not only because of the political boost u.s. action has given to hardliners there, but also because of president donald trump's bellicosity. subjecting iranians to taunts and threats to destroy their cultural heritage — with u.s. forces stationed around them in iraq and afghanistan — reminds them of their weakness and the deterrent value of nuclear weapons."}
{"original": "the more direct consequences are likely to take place in iraq, where the iran-linked popular mobilization forces (pmf) militias are likely to escalate their attacks on u.s. military forces and other personnel. that could spark a broader conflict with iran, given the trump administration's belligerence."}
{"original": "u.s. forces should have left iraq already. once the islamic state (is) terrorist group's caliphate was defeated, the u.s. military mission in iraq became murky. and as the trump administration pulled out of iran deal and ratcheted up economic pressure on iran over the last several years, u.s. forces became a magnet for trouble, more bait for a disastrous war with iran than a means to u.s. security."}
{"original": "the right decision:donald trump showed restraint, then resolve, in killing of iran's qassem soleimani"}
{"original": "with the drone strike, which killed not only soleimani but mahdi al muhandis, deputy commander of iraq's pmf and several of his colleagues, stationing u.s. forces in iraq became even less tenable. the pmf forces are a collection of shi'ite militias, officially but in fact loosely subordinated to the iraqi government, that include as many as 500,000 fighters by some estimates. many of those militiamen, who recently and quite brutally helped fight is, as did soleimani, are now likely to turn on the u.s. forces — especially if they are kept in iraq in the face of iraqi demands they go. whatever their quality, the militias manpower makes them a formidable threat."}
{"original": "the people of iraq don't and will not want us there"}
{"original": "popular anger against the united states in iraq, not only from the drone strike, but the airstrikes days before, which iraq's government opposed — not to mention to the botched occupation and civil war it set off — is inescapable now. that makes it difficult for any iraqi government to back the u.s. force presence or work energetically to suppress renewed shi'ite resistance to u.s. forces."}
{"original": "violence directed against u.s. forces in iraq is not likely limited to there. trump officials insist they will blame militias attacks on iran, even when it's not clear they are doing tehran's bidding. however unintentionally, they have created a circumstance where u.s. forces in iraq and syria face increased attacks, which might then draw them into war with iran. that is the policy that has brought us to this precipice. no u.s. security goal justifies that risk."}
{"original": "this is personal:war with iran is terrifying prospect for americans with family in the middle east, like me"}
{"original": "the idea that u.s. forces have to remain in iraq to defeat the remnant of is ignores the evident will of iraqis to do that themselves, the historical lesson that u.s. forces have helped spark rather than quell renewed insurgency, and the ability to return to strike is in extremis. continuing the mission would be a bad idea, even if didn't risk a massive and utterly counterproductive war with iran."}
{"original": "rather than send more u.s. forces to the region where they will join in vulnerability with those already there, the united states should remove its forces from iraq and begin exiting the broader region. as the events of the last two weeks underline, the smattering of u.s. forces in the region are not accomplishing anything useful, but are enough to pull the united states into another needless war."}

{"original": "when most of us start planning for retirement, we think about things like what our living costs will be and how much money we'll have access to. many of us, in fact, get so focused on how much we are or aren't saving that we fail to make one critical move: creating a will or living trust."}
{"original": "in a recent caring.com study, 58% of american adults admitted to not having either type of crucial document in place. even scarier, among adults with children under the age of 18, that figure climbed to 64% of folks without a formal estate plan."}
{"original": "now the good news is that older americans are more likely to have a will or trust than their younger counterparts. here's how the data breaks down:"}
{"original": "age group 18 to 36 percentage of people with a will or trust 22% 37 to 52 36% 53 to 71 60% 72 and older 81%"}
{"original": "though it's not surprising to see that almost 80% of younger americans don't have a will, it's an attitude that can hurt millennials as easily as it can folks 20 or 30 years their senior. and while you might think you have plenty of time to draw up a will, or that not having one isn't such a big deal, it's a mistake that could be far costlier than you might imagine."}
{"original": "it's easy enough to come up with a reason for not putting together an estate plan. among those surveyed by caring.com, the most common excuses for neglecting a will or trust were not having enough assets or just not getting around to it. and then there's the reason some of us don't want to share out loud: contemplating mortality can be a disturbing process, and many people can't bring themselves to sit down and face it."}
{"original": "but if you don't create a formal will or trust, there's no guarantee that your wishes will be carried out once you pass. and even if you don't have a ton in the way of assets, that can still cause the loved ones you leave behind an undue dose of anguish during an already trying time."}
{"original": "one of the most significant arguments for having a will is that without one, there's no telling what might happen to your minor children once you're no longer around. but if you do create a will, you'll be able to appoint a guardian for your children so you know they'll be well taken care of."}
{"original": "a will can also help ensure that your assets are distributed equitably among your heirs. furthermore, if you die without a will, your assets will be distributed based on the laws of your state – laws that won't necessarily match your actual wishes. for example, the laws of your state might dictate that in the absence of a will, your assets will automatically be divided among your children. but if you'd rather leave a chunk of cash to your nieces and nephews, your desired beneficiaries might never see that money if there's no will to spell that out."}
{"original": "in addition to creating a will, you might also consider establishing a trust, the exact type of which will depend on your specific needs and level of assets. while trusts can be costly to set up, in many circumstances, the benefits they offer far outweigh the expense."}
{"original": "a revocable living trust, for example, gives you the flexibility to manage your assets during your lifetime while ensuring that your wishes are carried out once you pass. these trusts also allow you to avoid the costly, time-consuming process that is probate. irrevocable trusts offer less flexibility during your lifetime, but they can be a smart solution for larger estates."}
{"original": "because there are several trust fund options to choose from, your best bet is to sit down with an estate planning attorney and get help identifying the one that's right for you. keep in mind that without a trust, you could subject your heirs to a larger estate tax bill than is necessary. though most americans don't have to worry about estate taxes, they're a concern among wealthy families looking to preserve more of their assets for future generations."}
{"original": "that said, you don't need to be wealthy to establish a trust, and you certainly don't need to be wealthy to create a will. even if you have few assets and no dependents, it still pays to set up an estate plan -- if not for your own sake, then for that of the people who are most important to you."}
