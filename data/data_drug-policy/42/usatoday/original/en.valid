Lightning killed fewer Americans last year than any year on record, marking a steady downward trend that experts attribute to more awareness, better lightning-proof construction and fewer people working in farms and fields.\n\nLightning killed 16 people in 2017, the fewest deaths since accurate records began in 1940, the National Weather Service said. This broke the previous record low of 23, set in 2013, weather service meteorologist John Jensenius said.\n\nThe number of people killed by lightning in recent years a far cry from annual lightning deaths decades ago: In the 1940s, for instance, hundreds of people were killed each year by lightning. In 1943 alone, 432 people died.\n\nIn 2001, the weather service launched a lightning safety campaign, which included the now well-known phrase when thunder roars, go indoors. At that time, the nation recorded about 55 lightning deaths a year.\n\nOver the past decade, an average of 27 Americans were killed each year from lightning strikes, Jensenius said. While we don't like to see any lightning deaths, the continuing downward trend in yearly fatalities is encouraging, Jensenius added.\n\nJensenius said increased awareness prompted better lightning safety policy for outdoor sports and recreational organizations.\n\nAnd when lightning does strike, Jensenius said, better medical treatment and access to automatic external defibrillators has helped save the lives of lightning strike victims. Roughly 90% of people struck by lightning survive.\n\nThe highest number of lightning deaths occurred in Florida, which recorded five fatalities. Alabama followed with three and Colorado, Texas and North Carolina had two each. The other two lightning deaths occurred in Ohio and Puerto Rico. All but one of the victims were male. On average, 79% of lightning victims are male, based on data from 2006 to 2016.\n\nThe sharp drop in lightning deaths over the past 75 years  coincides with a shift in population from rural to urban regions, wrote meteorologist Ronald Holle in an article in the Journal of Applied Meteorology.\n\nIn the 1940s, there were many, many more small farmers who were out working in fields, which meant many more chances to be struck by lightning, Jensenius said.\n\nIn addition to better lightning safety awareness and medical advances, all phones were corded decades ago, leading to quite a few deaths due to people speaking on the phone. Additionally, there has been better lightning protection, suppression and grounding in electrical and phone lines, he said.
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo laid the blame for the escalating hostilities between the U.S. and Iran on former President Barack Obama, accusing the previous administration of trying to appease the theocratic regime and arguing that the deal aimed at delaying Iran's development of nuclear weapons only succeeded in funding regional terrorism.\n\nWe're trying to correct for what was the Obama administration's appeasement of Iran, Pompeo said Sunday on the ABC News' This Week.\n\nThis is a regime that has been acting against America for an awfully long time. And we are suffering from eight years of neglect and we're trying to push it back. We're trying to contain them, he said.\n\nIran has vowed to retaliate for a U.S. airstrike that killed Gen. Qasem Soleimani, the well-known leader of Iran's elite Quds Force, near the Baghdad airport last week.\n\n'I want to have peace':How Trump went from a vow to avoid conflict to an order to kill Iran general\n\nThe attack that killed Soleimani came after Iran-backed militias stormed the U.S. Embassy in response to an earlier U.S. airstrike that killed at least two dozen militia fighters in sites in Iraq and Syria. The U.S. said that strike was in retaliation for a rocket attack in Iraq that killed an American contractor and left four U.S. service members wounded.\n\nSpeaking on CNN's State of the Union, Pompeo said the administration is prepared for anything the Islamic Republic of Iran may do in response to Soleimani's death.\n\nHe referred to the developing conflict as a war, which he said began when Obama and the European Union adopted the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). Under that deal, Iran agreed to scrap its nuclear weapons program for at least 10 years in exchange for sanctions relief and the release of previously frozen funds.\n\nFrankly, this war kicked off – people talk about the war – this war kicked off when the JCPOA was entered into, he said.\n\nPompeo said that under the terrible nuclear deal, which President Donald Trump pulled the U.S. out of, hundred of thousands of people died in Syria and Shiite militias grew more powerful.\n\nThese are things that were ongoing activities, resourced and funded by the trade and the money that was provided under the JCPOA, he said on This Week.\n\nThat was the deal we inherited. It's a place we found ourselves, and we're working diligently to execute our strategy to convince the Iranian regime to act like a normal nation, he said.\n\nCritics of Trump's Iran policy dispute Pompeo's take on who is to blame for the current state of affairs, arguing Trump set the U.S. on the path to conflict with Iran by pulling out of the nuclear agreement.\n\nFormer Obama adviser Ben Rhodes said Iran had been complying with the nuclear deal and that Iran did not launch any rocket attacks on U.S. interests after the deal took effect.\n\nTrump pulled out and Iran resumed nuke program and rocket attacks, Rhodes tweeted.\n\nPompeo said the U.S. strategy to contain Iran included a diplomatic, economic and military components, as well as an enormous coalition of regional allies.\n\nDespite the secretary of state's belief that Trump's Iran strategy is absolutely working and that the world is a safer place with the killing of Soleimani, critics said the actions further destabilized the region and risk an all-out war with Iran.\n\nI really worry that the actions the president took will get us into what he calls another endless war in the Middle East. He promised we wouldn't have that. And I think we're closer to that now because of his actions, said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., on This Week.\n\nMore:Iraq votes to expel U.S. troops after Iran Gen. Qasem Soleimani's killing\n\nSchumer did not think Soleimani's death made the world safer and he questioned whether Trump was prepared for the Iranian response.\n\nAnd let's face it, this president has made a mess of foreign policy. North Korea, they're much stronger than they were when he started. In Syria, he messed up. Every encounter he has with Putin, he loses, Schumer said. And so, I am really worried, and that is why Congress must assert itself.\n\nDemocrats in the House and Senate have introduced a resolution barring the administration from taking military action against Iran without further congressional authorization.\n\n‪Let's not mince words: the assassination of Qasem Soleimani was an act of war undertaken without Congressional authorization, in violation of the Constitution of the United States of America, wrote Reps. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., and Barbara Lee, D-Calif., in a statement announcing the House resolution.\n\nPompeo said the administration had all the authority we need to do what we've done to-date and promised it will continue to do things appropriately, lawfully, and constitutionally.\n\nBut Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., who sits on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said Sunday on CBS News' Face the Nation that Trump does not have authorization from Congress to go to war with Iran and the killing of Soleimani – which he called an assassination – potentially sets us on a course to do just that.\n\nMurphy said the Trump administration's Iran policy has been a disaster from the very beginning, arguing Iran was more powerful now than when Trump took office. He said Obama and former President George W. Bush also had the opportunity to kill Soleimani but did not act on it despite the fact that he was carrying out attacks on U.S. forces, because they believed ultimately that would get more Americans killed.\n\nThe Democratic senator said the negative consequences of Soleimani's death were already being felt as Iraq's prime minister and Parliament have called for U.S. troops to leave the country after nearly two decades.\n\nHe also accused Trump of violating the War Powers Act by not consulting with congressional leaders before the strike. The administration has justified the attack on Soleimani on the grounds that he was plotting future attacks on U.S. troops and interests. But Murphy said the burden of proof is on the administration to show lawmakers that the Iranian general represented an imminent threat.\n\nSen. Mark Warner, D-Va., the ranking Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, was one of the Democratic lawmakers to be briefed after the attack.\n\nI accept the notion that there was a real threat, Warner said on NBC's Meet the Press. The question of how imminent is something that I need more information on.\n\nHouse Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., agreed it was accurate to say Soleimani was plotting against American interests.\n\nBut it's also true that Soleimani has been plotting against the United States for decades. The question is, did the plotting here rise to the level that required his elimination from the battlefield? Schiff said. I don't think the intelligence supports the conclusion that removing Soleimani increases our security.\n\nSchumer called the information he had seen from the administration very unsatisfying.\n\nSen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., who sits on both the Foreign Relations and Intelligence Committees, said Trump's actions had been defensive.\n\nHe is not saying Congress, I need 100,000 American troops to invade Iran. That's why all this talk about war powers and congressional authority is so silly, Rubio said. The president's not talking about invading Iran. He's talking about responding to anything Iran may do in the future. And the president has not only the full authority to do that, but an obligation to do that.\n\nRubio said Trump was forced to act in the face of information that there is an imminent and credible threat that could cost the lives of potentially hundreds, if not thousands, of American servicemen and women and other personnel in the region.\n\nAny president would have an obligation to act. And this president did, Rubio said.
USA TODAY\n\nThe partial government shutdown entered its 12th day on Wednesday, as congressional leaders planned to meet with President Donald Trump.\n\n'Hoping for the best, planning for the worst'\n\nBy Ernest Johnson\n\nEveryone affected by the shutdown is a real person, including myself. I have bills, just like everyone. And while I'm just a single guy, others are single parents, have families, are caring for elderly parents, among others. The shutdown has created 800,000 permutations of this example. Just like many Americans, I'm struggling to make ends meet.\n\nNot knowing how long the shutdown would last — and anticipating it might last more than two weeks, and that if we get back pay, it might not be for a couple weeks, as well — I chatted with Ally Auto Finance and asked whether my account was in good enough standing to request a deferment due to the furlough and not having income. Ally allowed it, but a deferment is a pay the interest in January and February is the difference of a full payment, so I'm still paying $160 this month, but next month it'll be about $360.\n\nTalker:Is Warren the candidate Democrats have been waiting for? Some doubt it\n\nThose of us affected by the shutdown are your friends and neighbors, our children go to the same schools, we attend the same religious centers, and we are all focused on providing for our families and the communities in which we live. We do not go to work waving flags with Go Team Red or Go Team Blue. My co-workers and team members have common goals of providing the most efficient, quality service to the public who depend on our services.\n\nI'm still waiting on unemployment insurance to be approved, then I can know how much I'll need to borrow from friends come Feb. 1 for rent and bills due early that month.\n\nWhen you see our #ShutdownStories, please understand that we are regular people. We are nervous, stressed, afraid, worried and concerned about all this, and we are simply expressing our feelings. Personally, I would be fine working with no pay (knowing I will get back pay), just so I can keep my services, responsibilities and commitments to the public. I do not know how all of this will end, all I know is that I will just put one foot in front of the other and make it through another day. Hoping for the best, planning for the worst.\n\nErnest Johnson is a federal employee in Wyoming. You can follow him on Twitter: @SciFiCowboy_v2.\n\nWhat others are saying\n\nThe New York Times, editorial: For the workers directly affected, among those facing the greatest economic uncertainty are contractors, who make up more than 40 percent of the government work force. This includes not only white-collar positions but also thousands of blue-collar jobs, such as janitors and security guards. Unlike regular government employees, many contractors may not be compensated for lost time. They could simply lose the income. Even for regular, noncontract employees, who have eventually been granted back pay after past shutdowns and can reasonably expect the same this time, the grinding anxiety and financial costs of scraping by in the meantime mount with each passing day. Many of these workers live paycheck to paycheck, with little wiggle room.\n\nJonathan Bernstein, Bloomberg: What President Donald Trump has been doing so far is, as political scientist Dave Hopkins points out, following the lead of the House Freedom Caucus. But Freedom Caucus radicals don't have plans for either policy gains or public-relations wins. What they care about is proving that they're True Conservatives by differentiating themselves from mainstream Republicans. In practice, that means finding irrational but tough-sounding tactics to endorse. That's this shutdown in a nutshell. Instead of making a deal last year, when Republicans held unified control of government, Trump has chosen to negotiate from a position of relative weakness as Democrats take over the House majority.\n\nThe Washington Post, editorial: In the name of securing the border and keeping out illegal immigrants, President Trump has opted for a partial government shutdown. Irony of ironies, that shutdown has paralyzed the nation's immigration courts, shuttering many of them and allowing several hundred undocumented immigrants to dodge deportation orders each day the shutdown continues. They are among many hundreds of others whose cases will be postponed for years — or, in effect, indefinitely — for every day the closure lasts.\n\nWhat our readers are saying\n\nWhy is border security any more critical now than it was two years ago when Donald Trump became president? Has Trump made it worse over the past two years? Republicans had two years to get Trump his wall and they didn't.\n\n— John Bertelson\n\nSenate and House Democratic leaders Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi have no incentive to end the shutdown. As long as they think the shutdown will hurt Trump politically, they could not care less how much the shutdown hurts the country and its people.\n\n— Robert Johnson\n\nIn two years, Trump couldn't get a dime out of a Republican majority Congress for his silly wall. So now he tells his true supporters it can magically happen by constitutionally mugging the nation?\n\n— Dannie Leroy Porath\n\nTo join the conversations about topics on USA TODAY or provide feedback to this newsletter, email jrivera@usatoday.com, comment on Facebook, or use #tellusatoday on Twitter.
WASHINGTON – While the nation was watching how Attorney General nominee William Barr would answer questions on his record and views on policies, an 8-year-old boy in the audience seemed to steal the spotlight.\n\nBarr's grandson, Liam, caught the attention of lawmakers, both Republicans and Democrats alike, who offered him snacks, a chance to sit with them and even a bit of career advice.\n\nBefore the hearing began Tuesday morning, Sen. John Kennedy, R-La., sat down with the 8-year-old, who donned a green tie and dress shoes, in the chairs of lawmakers and chatted about making snowballs in snow-covered Washington and flying on Air Force One.\n\nI had a great conversation with Liam this morning, Kennedy wrote on Twitter. I'm looking forward to getting to know his grandfather, William Barr, during the Attorney General hearing today.\n\nAs William Barr walked into the hearing room to start hours of questioning, he stopped in front of Liam and jokingly tried to take his nose. He started off his testimony in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee by introducing his family. His three daughters are attorneys and both of Liam's parents work as lawyers for the Justice Department.\n\nBarr, while listing the list of attorneys in his family, introduced Liam as a future Justice Department employee to a crowded room of laughter.\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C. and chair of the committee, interrupted Barr, telling the 8-year-old boy, Think about medical school, Liam. Somebody needs to make money in the family.\n\nSen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., gave a little different career advice to Liam, given how many of his relatives had worked in the Justice Department.\n\nHe ought to consider, at least for some balance, being a public defender, Durbin said.\n\nLawmakers continued to poke fun at Liam's future throughout the hearing and commended him for sitting patiently through hours of questions about Barr's thoughts on special counsel Robert Mueller, Russia, counter-intelligence investigations, torture, gun policies and President Donald Trump.\n\nHis feet dangling in the air, unable to reach the ground, Liam sat in the front row of the audience and used a pen and notepad to get through the all-day affair.\n\nHe wrote a sweet letter to his grandpa, telling him, I love you so much. You are doing great so far. Liam wrote that he was having so much fun.\n\nLiam ended the letter to his grandpa with a misspelled last thought on how things had been going thus far: P.S. I think Rusha's people are fine. It is the government is the problam.\n\nAfter six hours on the Hill, Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., paused before resuming questioning to say she was sending a care package from the dais that included a bag of chips, a Snickers candy bar and a granola bar to Barr's grandson for making it so far into the hearing.\n\nHe deserves a medal, Feinstein said.\n\nThose online joked that Liam had become the star of the hearing and more attention was being paid to the 8-year-old boy than to Barr's policy decisions in the past.
Mark Mellman\n\nOpinion contributor\n\nEnforce the norms is not exactly a captivating bumper sticker, but it is a compelling rationale for removing President Donald Trump from office, immediately.\n\nWe are a nation of laws. We are also a nation of norms, and those norms undergird our democracy. Without them, our laws and institutions would be insufficient to protect the republic our Founders bequeathed us.\n\nSince 1950, there have been well over 200 successful coups worldwide, not because those countries had weak anti-coup laws, but rather because they suffered weak democratic norms.\n\nIt is not against the law for a president to knowingly and repeatedly lie to the country, even though regular and extensive dishonesty from a president makes a mockery of democratic decision making.\n\nUntil President Donald Trump spent his term making 30,000 false and misleading statements, strong norms dictated honesty. Recall the Republican obsession with Ambassador Susan Rice correctly quoting an incorrect early intelligence community assessment of the events at Benghazi. As far as the GOP was concerned unknowingly repeating an inaccurate statement supplied by executive branch agencies, was sufficiently egregious to render her unfit for membership in the president's cabinet.\n\nNorms are as important as laws\n\nPresident Trump rightly claimed that the law governing conflicts of interest specifically exempted him. The importance of the norm against presidents using their official positions to enrich themselves was articulated by no less than President Trump's favorite Supreme Court Justice, Antonin Scalia, who, as a Justice Department official, wrote that it would obviously be undesirable as a matter of policy for the president or vice president to engage in conduct proscribed by conflict of interest rules, whether or not they technically apply.\n\nNo law, strong norm.\n\nWhile federal law does proscribe candidates from receiving anything of value from a foreign national, no law prohibits a president from asking foreign powers with whom the United States is in conflict to intervene on his behalf in U.S. elections.\n\nBefore President Trump begged Russia and China, as well as Ukraine, for electoral help, the norms against such behavior were so strong that no candidate would have dreamed of making such requests.\n\nLawyers continue to debate whether the president ordering a state election official to find 11,780 votes, the number he needed to change the result in Georgia, constitutes a crime, but the widespread condemnation of the conversation by Republicans makes clear it violated a strong norm. No law prevents a president from employing hate speech, though until Trump, presidents didn't.\n\nBut even strong norms erode if they are not enforced.\n\nSen. Jon Tester: Members of Congress who incited Capitol riot must be held accountable\n\nDuring impeachment, Republican senators hid behind irrelevant legalisms. Their argument that Trump's behavior was not criminal altered, perhaps permanently, the Founders' intent in defining high crimes and misdemeanors as grounds for removal from office.\n\nWhen the Senate exonerated Trump, they made it more likely that he and potentially, future presidents would ignore the norms that enable our democracy to function. And what was the result? More of the same, but worse. This time the president incited political violence, leading to homicide.\n\nTrump retains too much power to stay\n\nRepublicans claimed Trump would be chastened by impeachment, even absent a conviction. They were wrong. Instead Trump was emboldened, and every senator who voted to acquit bears some responsibility for the Trump's ensuing attack on democracy, culminating in last week's coup attempt.\n\nNow they're arguing it's too late to take action, and besides, this time, Trump really has learned his lesson.\n\nIt is not too late to enforce the norms. It is not too late to make a clear and unambiguous statement about the limits of presidential behavior. Failure to do so could damage democracy for decades to come.\n\nBipartisan path: Pence should threaten the 25th Amendment and Congress should impeach to purge Trump stain\n\nPresident Trump abused his office for personal gain, sowed hatred, lied to America, attempted to subvert the electoral process, and finally incited insurrection and violence. He deserves to be punished for each of those violations of the moral order, even if they are not violations of criminal statutes. But more important, we the people deserve the protection afforded by the norms that ensure our democracy — protection we can only secure by removing Trump, thereby enforcing those norms.\n\nIf instead we just wait out the next week until Joe Biden is inaugurated, what will Republicans say if Trump uses his last minutes in office, acting within his legal limits, to pardon the very insurrectionists arrested for attacking the capitol, further eroding democratic norms?\n\nThen, it will be far too late.\n\nMark Mellman, president of The Mellman Group and past president of the American Association of Political Consultants, has helped elect 30 senators, 12 governors and dozens of House members, and was pollster to Senate Democratic leaders for more than 20 years.

Susan Tompor\n\nDetroit Free Press\n\nWe're looking at a quirky new year for financial aid applications for college. Parents and students face the prospect of filing two FAFSAs in 2016. Yes, two times the bury-your-head-in-paperwork fun in one year.\n\nIt's a one-time blip because of an upcoming change in the rules for the Free Application for Federal Student Aid. The new rules kick off for the 2017-18 school year when filling out FAFSA forms will start on Oct. 1, 2016.\n\nFor students heading to college in the 2016-17 school year, though, the timetable remains the same as in past years when the FAFSA filing season starts Jan. 1. So it's time to get moving on the first FAFSA round for the year.\n\nFiling the FAFSA is one of those headaches that's a necessary part of college life. And let's face it, when you mix the federal government with academics, well, let the jargon fly.\n\nBut filing the FAFSA is essential to receiving financial aid from the federal government, state government and most colleges and universities. It's a free form that covers one school year at a time.\n\nHow much aid you can receive, though, can vary considerably even within the same family each year.\n\nSmall changes in income, student assets and the number of children in college can have a big impact, said Mark Kantrowitz, a financial aid expert who is now publisher and vice president of strategy for Cappex.com.\n\nHere are five things to know about FAFSA:\n\nNo. 1: File as early as possible once the forms are available.\n\nYou can file the forms online now for 2016-17. Do not drag your feet and say, maybe, wait to file until you've actually completed your tax returns. Do not wait for an acceptance email or letter from a given college, either. See Fafsa.ed.gov.\n\nThe actual deadlines vary by state. If your legal residence is Michigan, for example, the deadline for the 2016-17 school year is March 1. A chart at the FAFSA site lists deadlines by state. Iowa, for example, lists July 1 by midnight central time. Earlier priority deadlines might exist in Iowa for certain programs.\n\nKaren McCarthy, senior policy analyst for the National Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators, said the biggest mistake that parents and students make is that they wait until the last minute possible fill out the FAFSA form, instead of filing as soon as possible.\n\nThey do not file early enough because they think they have lots of time to do it, McCarthy said.\n\nBut some financial aid is awarded, for example, on a first-come, first-served basis. Some schools have earlier deadlines.\n\nOne tip: Many states offer College Goal Sunday programs in January, February and March. Such sessions provide free help to complete the FAFSA form.\n\nSee collegegoalsundayusa.org. Or see MICollegeGoal.org for a list of events across Michigan, most of which run in February. Or you can call 800-832-2464 on weekdays for information on the Michigan programs.\n\nAnother good resource: U.S. Department of Education's toll free hotline is 800-433-3243.\n\nSome local high schools also hold financial aid nights or other events to help parents and students learn about FAFSA.\n\nNo. 2: Don't over-inflate your investments.\n\nWhen it comes to FAFSA forms, money in a retirement plan, including a 401(k) and IRA, is not counted as part of your assets or investments, Kantrowitz said. You also do not need to include the net equity in your primary home. You would count equity in a vacation home or rental property on the FAFSA form.\n\nIf you take a distribution from your 401(k) plan that year, of course, that money would be counted as income for the FAFSA form.\n\nMillennials get an extra boost to save for cars and homes\n\nKantrowitz said one of the big mistakes people make involves listing money in retirement plans among assets, thereby inflating your wealth and possibly reducing the student's chances for financial aid.\n\nIn general, it can help to gather your paperwork before trying to sit down and complete the form. You can file estimated figures in advance of actually filing your 2015 income tax return. So you'd need your final pay stub for 2015, W-2 forms and 1099s.\n\nIf you use estimated tax information to fill out a FAFSA, you must correct that information after you file your tax return. You can use the Internal Revenue Service Data Retrieval Tool, which is available within the online FAFSA, to access IRS tax return information needed to complete the FAFSA and transfer the data directly to FAFSA from the IRS.\n\nYou'd need records of other taxable income, including unemployment benefits, too.\n\nIf you've filed the 2015 tax return early or you wait to file the FAFSA form until you do, you'd gather that 1040 tax form too.\n\nThe FAFSA will require Social Security numbers. And for dependent students, the FAFSA will also require the parent's Social Security Number. A student's driver's license is optional -- and recommended -- to provide a way to verify the student's identity.\n\nNo. 3: Take time to read the instructions carefully.\n\nUnfortunately, it can be easy to plug in an answer online when you really don't know the answer. But this isn't like some standardized testing. You don't get extra points for guessing.\n\nCatherine Berrahou, director of financial aid and scholarships at Walsh College in Troy, said the online form for FAFSA does give helpful hints and tips, if you don't understand a question.\n\nWhat's a common error? One question involves what you paid in federal taxes, she said, but sometimes a parent or student will fill in the adjusted gross income. That's not correct, as income tax is not the same as income, according to a warningon a U.S. Department of Education blog.\n\nOr some could mistakenly leave blank the area to report a parent's income from work.\n\nBerrahou recommends that students go back within a day or two after filing the form to make sure the application was not rejected. If it is rejected, she said, take extra care and provide the necessary information soon.\n\nAnother common mistake? Take care to fill out the exact name that's listed on the student's Social Security card. If you're daughter's birth name is Jane and that's what's on Social Security records, don't fill out Jenny if that's what she calls herself now. Do not use nicknames.\n\nDid you just win a college scholarship? Or not? Marketing can be deceptive\n\nOther tips: Do not forget to sign the FAFSA forms. If you're a dependent student, you also need to report information relating to your parents.\n\nNo. 4: Divorced? Some families first must determine what parent to list on FAFSA.\n\nFamily life can add a different twist to the FAFSA mix.\n\nAnita Myles, senior vice president for Edvisors.com, said it's essential to review the rules in cases when parents are divorced or when there are other special family situations.\n\nFor example, if the student's grandparent legally adopts the student, the grandparent will be required to complete the FAFSA, according to the Filing the FAFSA book that's free online at www.edvisors.com.\n\nIf the student only lives with the grandparent -- and was not adopted by the grandparent -- the grandparent is not considered to be the parent when filing the FAFSA form. But at the same time, any financial aid provided by the grandparent to the student should be reported as untaxed income to the student on the FAFSA, Kantrowitz said.\n\nIn the case of a divorce, the dependent student would need to review which parent he or she has spent the most time with in the past year. If time was split evenly, Myles said, the parent for FAFSA would be the one who provided the most financial support.\n\nNo. 5: Be prepared come October to have all this fun again.\n\nA new start time for the FAFSA season hits for the 2017-18 school year when filling out FAFSA forms will start in October.\n\nThe strategy is twofold: High school seniors and others could apply for financial aid in the fall around the same time as they fill out applications for colleges. Plus you'd have the 2015 tax return to use when filing the FAFSA for the 2017-18 academic year.\n\nRick Castellano, a spokesperson for Sallie Mae, said the October kick off could take some of the mystery out of getting appropriate tax information so early in the year. The earlier kick off could encourage some families to take time to file the FAFSA.\n\nThe last thing you want to do is miss out on free money for college, Castellano said. You don't want to leave that free money on the table.\n\nContact Susan Tompor: 313-222-8876 or stompor@freepress.com. Follow Susan on Twitter @Tompor.

While the vaccine meets the threshold for regulatory approval, it's a disappointing descent from early results that showed it was 78% effective.\n\n►Los Angeles County is asking residents to wear masks at home if they go out for work or to get groceries, the Los Angeles Times reported, as the region nears 1 million virus cases. In addition, the L.A. City Council approved a motion Wednesday instructing city departments to prioritize issuing citations during normal duties to people not wearing masks.\n\n📈 Today's numbers: The U.S. has more than 23 million confirmed coronavirus cases and more than 384,000 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University data. The global totals: More than 92 million cases and 1.97 million deaths.\n\n📘 What we're reading: U.S. hospitals are on the brink – but COVID-19 isn't slowing down. Absolutely, it's what we feared, the chief health care officer for the Association of American Medical Colleges told USA TODAY. Read more here.\n\nAs virus rampages through Southern California, many health workers reject vaccine\n\nEven as the coronavirus is running rampant through large swaths of Southern California, a substantial number of health care workers -- who are first in line for the vaccine -- are rejecting the shots.\n\nAbout half the hospital workers offered the COVID vaccine in Riverside County, southeast of hard-hit Los Angeles County, have turned it down. With a population of 2.5 million, Riverside County on Tuesday became the eighth county in the nation to exceed 200,000 coronavirus cases.\n\nSome of them are saying, 'You know, not yet,' that they just want to see how things go, Public Health Director Kim Saruwatari told the Palm Springs Desert Sun. Some are just not giving any type of reason on why they're not taking it.\n\nOperation Warp Speed chief Moncef Slaoui resigns but will stay on through Biden transition\n\nMoncef Slaoui, who has helped lead the Trump administration's vaccine development effort, is resigning but has agreed to stay on in an advisory role for 30 days to support the transition to the Biden administration.\n\nSlaoui has long said that he would resign as head of Operation Warp Speed around the end of 2020 or early 2021 when he felt like he had contributed as much as he could to the vaccine development. The emphasis has now shifted to distribution and delivery, which is under the purview of General Gus Perna.\n\nLast week, Slaoui said he would stay longer than initially planned to ensure the success of three more large clinical trials underway, testing candidate vaccines from Johnson & Johnson, AstraZeneca and Oxford University and Novavax.\n\n– Karen Weintraub\n\nWhat will COVID-19 look like in the future? Possibly another common cold, study says\n\nSARS-CoV-2 could join the ranks of mild, cold-causing … human coronaviruses in the long run, according to a model developed by Emory University and Penn State University scientists.\n\nThe model, published Tuesday in the peer-reviewed journal Science, compares the deadly virus to four common cold coronaviruses plus the SARS and MERS viruses, which surfaced in 2003 and 2012, respectively.\n\nResearchers determined from the model that if the coronavirus continues to circulate in the general population and most people are exposed to it from childhood, it could be added to the list of common colds.\n\nStudy authors concede the model makes some assumptions about the coronavirus and common colds that are not known yet, but a take-home message is the critical need for broad-scale vaccination may wane in the near term, said study author Ottar Bjornstad, who teaches entomology and biology at Penn State University.\n\nSome states speed up vaccine distribution while others push back on federal changes\n\nFacing a slower-than-hoped coronavirus vaccine rollout, officials around the nation shifted gears Tuesday to accelerate the elivery of shots to more people. The U.S. government is asking states to speed up COVID-19 vaccinations to people over 65 and others at risk instead of holding back vaccines for a second dose.\n\nThe change had immediate effects in New York, where Gov. Andrew Cuomo expanded the vaccine eligibility requirements to follow the new CDC guidelines. Idaho will implement the guidelines Feb. 1, Gov. Brad Little said. Pennsylvania and New Jersey have also said they're immediately expanding vaccination guidelines to include patients 65 and older.\n\nHowever, other states are pushing back on federal guidance, citing supply concerns. Rhode Island Department of Health spokesman Joseph Wendelken referenced those in saying the state does not plan to expand vaccinations to people 65 and older. Iowa's health department said the state may consider adopting new guidelines once we have reasonable confidence that supply meets the demands of this broader eligibility criteria.\n\nHospitals face COVID-19 surge, staff shortages and rising deaths\n\nFour states with the largest share of hospital beds occupied with COVID-19 patients – California, Arizona, Nevada and Georgia – are struggling to keep pace with the unprecedented surge.\n\nIn Los Angeles, public hospitals are preparing to shift to crisis mode, and the county has instructed ambulances to not send patients to overburdened hospitals if they can't be revived in the field. More than two dozen Georgia hospitals have no available beds in intensive care units, according to U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nWhile public health officials are optimistic widespread vaccination will provide a glimmer of hope this spring, there's no respite now for doctors and nurses in overburdened emergency rooms and intensive care units.\n\n– Ken Alltucker\n\nContributing: The Associated Press
The venue was packed with more than a thousand people waiting to see Pete Buttigieg, and a chant had broken out for the Democratic presidential candidate a few minutes before he took the stage.\n\nKasey Peters, inside the hall, did not chant along. He did not hold up a sign for the former South Bend, Indiana, mayor, like some around him, or outwardly applaud Buttigieg's remarks. The 31-year-old compliance analyst was there just to listen.\n\nThe Saturday event was only Peters' second time seeing a candidate in person this Iowa caucus cycle. He saw Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts nearly a year ago, when she first announced her bid for the Democratic presidential nomination. Peters had effectively tuned out the crowded race since then, and he's still undecided.\n\nThings will change in the weeks ahead, as Peters goes to other candidate events and reads up on policy proposals.\n\nNow that we're getting closer to caucus, I'm diving in, he said.\n\nWith a month to go before the Feb. 3 caucuses, Iowans like Peters appear to be everywhere. Multi-candidate events draw large turnouts from fervent supporters, but there are also those in the first-in-the-nation caucus state who are not sure which candidate to support. They're only now beginning to venture out to see the candidates in person, despite the inundation of political ads on television and nearly 2,000 public events candidates have hosted in Iowa in 2019.\n\nI am one of the undecided, declared Jenny Burton, a social worker who attended the West Des Moines Buttigieg event. Burton noted that she had met author Marianne Williamson in Des Moines a few days earlier. Burton is actively considering multiple candidates, including Williamson and Warren.\n\nI'm trying to get in with anybody who's coming to the community, Burton explained about her caucus strategy in the weeks ahead.\n\nBurton added about the candidates: I respect all of them, almost equally. That's why it's so difficult for me to narrow it down to one.\n\n'Undecideds' spark hope for low-polling candidates\n\nIn September, a Des Moines Register/CNN/Mediacom Iowa Poll showed just one in five likely Democratic caucusgoers said their minds were made up, while 63% said they could still be persuaded to support a different candidate.\n\nAn Iowa Poll released in November showed an uptick in decision-making: More respondents — then at 30% — said they had a first choice and their minds were made up. But 62% who said they had a first choice also said they could still be persuaded.\n\nThat indecision has been a lifeline for several presidential hopefuls in the lead-up to the Iowa caucuses, despite a shrinking debate stage that has limited some candidates' exposure.\n\nDave Waters of Boone saw Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey speak in Adel on Dec. 20. The senator, who failed to make it onto the debate stage in Los Angeles the day before, was on Waters' list of possible picks.\n\nWaters said he has usually decided which candidate to caucus for by now.\n\nThere's too many good ones, Waters said about his dilemma this time.\n\nSome likely caucusgoers are in no rush to figure things out.\n\nJim Oxendale, who saw Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota at a Dec. 22 event in Ida Grove, said he won't make a final decision until the last 15 minutes before the caucuses.\n\nI think this is a very serious thing, said the 70-year-old Oxendale, who also lives in Ida Grove. And it makes me nervous to commit to somebody too early because we're a long way from February.\n\nAfter hearing former Vice President Joe Biden speak in Tipton on Saturday, West Liberty resident Faye Petersen said she is beginning to think that perhaps he's the one.\n\nEven so, Petersen added, she is still undecided — she also likes Klobuchar, Booker and entrepreneur Andrew Yang — and she fully expects to change her mind at least a few more times before she attends her caucus.\n\nI will make it up before then, she said, dismissing any pressure to choose.\n\nEvery darn one of them is way better than what we have, Petersen said.\n\nStill a lot of candidates to choose from\n\nPeters, who attended the Buttigieg event in West Des Moines, said he tuned out for most of last year because there were so many candidates in the race. That number has dropped only a little, from a high of more than two dozen to 15 candidates.\n\nPeters said while his interest in Warren has subsided, he likes Buttigieg. He is also intrigued by former Rep. John Delaney from Maryland.\n\nHe's someone I'd like to look a little more into, Peters said of Delaney. … He's kind of been someone I've paid attention to the whole time he's been in the race.\n\nPeters said he knows several friends who are undecided like him. He said some have expressed interest in Sen. Bernie Sanders from Vermont and Yang.\n\nEverybody is still exploring, he said.\n\nRachel Foubert is also undecided, but that wasn't always the case.\n\nThe 25-year-old teacher had committed to caucus for Kamala Harris. Now that thesenator from California is out of the race, Foubert is actively looking for the next person to support. She attended a Biden event in Williamsburg on Dec. 27, in part because it was close to her home in North English, about 30 miles away.\n\nBut Foubert has found no favorites yet that resonate with her the way Harris did. So she plans to see as many candidates in person as she can. The Biden event was the first for her. She said she was drawn to Biden's experience with foreign diplomacy.\n\nI just want someone who can beat Trump, Foubert said.\n\nSometimes the decisions come unexpectedly.\n\nMathew Kelly came to see Buttigieg at a town hall in Knoxville on Sunday with his young daughter. Kelly said he liked Buttigieg and Klobuchar, and he planned to give himself some time to make a decision.\n\nI think I just need to hear them speak and do more research, he said before Buttigieg addressed the crowd.\n\nAfter the event, Kelly signed a card committing to caucus for Buttigieg.\n\nRegister reporters Brianne Pfannenstiel and Austin Cannon contributed to this report.\n\nBarbara Rodriguez covers health care and politics for the Register.

Michael O'Hanlon\n\nOpinion columnist\n\nWhat should America's next president, Democrat or Republican, do about Afghanistan? With an electorate tired of forever wars and a new Pentagon strategy focusing on great-power rivalry with Russia or China, the temptation for presidential candidates to promise a complete U.S. departure is palpable.\n\nInstead, candidates should propose a path to downsize and then stabilize the U.S. military mission in Afghanistan so that it is roughly on the scale of the current U.S. deployment in Iraq. That would allow the United States a good chance of achieving its core counterterrorism goals in Afghanistan, as well as Pakistan. The slogan 5,000 troops for 5 years would be a reasonable distillation of the chief military elements of this approach. That time horizon would also give peace talks a realistic chance — unlike recent proposals that fancifully imagined a power-sharing accord between the Afghan government and the Taliban by the end of 2020.\n\nBy the time America's next president is inaugurated on Jan. 20, 2021, America's role in the Afghanistan War will be approaching its 20th anniversary. Afghans themselves will have been at war continuously at least twice as long, if one dates the beginning of the modern conflict to the Soviet invasion there in 1979.\n\nWe may be exhausted with war, but that doesn't mean our part is over\n\nAmericans are understandably tired of this war. It has by any measure been a frustration, especially when measured against the more ambitious nation-building goals of the first Obama term.\n\nHowever, the recent Washington Post story alleging that officials engaged in Pentagon Papers-like deception of the American public about the mission is badly misleading. Whether it was the initial Bush administration strategy on Afghanistan, the McChrystal review early in the Obama years, or any of the subsequent Obama/Trump efforts to find an exit strategy in what became a virtual annual review process, almost everyone has been acutely aware of — and vocal about — the limits of the possible in this beleaguered and weak country.\n\nNonetheless, the mission has not been an abject failure. The Afghan government continues to hold all major and midsize cities as of this writing. Even more to the point for Americans, the United States has not again been attacked by a group that plotted or organized its aggression from within Afghan borders. The United States probably has the ability to do its part to sustain these modest, yet real, accomplishments at far lower cost in blood and treasure than before.\n\nThe bad news is that there is likely no near-term exit strategy; this reality should be faced head on. The good news is that, in strategic and military and budgetary terms, the cost of the mission is sustainable.\n\nA future force of 5,000 U.S. troops in Afghanistan, aided by 2,000 to 3,000 other NATO military personnel, would contrast with the late-2019 figure of 13,000 GIs there. It would be 95% less than the 100,000 U.S. troops commanded there by Gen. David Petraeus and then Gen. John Allen at the peak of the American presence in 2010-11. This lower level could probably achieved by 2022, though the glide path could be slowed if conditions required.\n\nThe advantages of this approach go well beyond the reduction in force numbers. By laying out a plan designed to last for several years, Washington would be avoiding the drama and the huge consumption of policy bandwidth associated with annual Afghanistan policy reviews that have typified the latter Obama and Trump years.\n\nThe number of U.S. forces could decline even further if a peace deal eventually were struck — in which case it might even wind up near zero eventually. The size of the deployment could also be reduced further if the Afghan military started to develop greater strength and battlefield momentum. But for planning purposes, 5,000 for 5 would be the core premise.\n\nPeace process:U.S. presidential hopefuls owe Afghan women their support\n\nThis idea for a smaller but enduring U.S. military presence in Afghanistan will go against much of the preferred sentiment of the Democratic base. But Democrats do not have the luxury of sweepingly opposing long-term military missions while castigating President Donald Trump for ending them recklessly in the way he just nearly did, yet again, in Syria.\n\nOf course, Trump administration policy could change dramatically before Election Day as well. Absent a comprehensive peace deal with the Taliban by next fall that also involves the Afghan government — an extreme long shot, given the lukewarm interest that the Taliban as well as their sometimes-sponsor Pakistan likely have in the idea — President Trump will face a dilemma. He will have to choose between his original campaign promise to end forever wars and leave Afghanistan, on the one hand, or his promise to defeat global terrorism and protect America on the other.\n\nAl-Qaida remains present in Afghanistan and just over the border in Pakistan, where drones flying from bases in Afghanistan can help keep a watch on things. The presence of the Islamic State terrorist group in Afghanistan has been growing, too. Neither has provided the capability or bastion that extremists would need to strike the United States.\n\nEven so, their capacities could, and almost surely would, grow in the absence of America's and NATO's extensive capabilities in intelligence, air power, unmanned systems and special forces. Thus, Trump would be wisest to claim partial credit for a partial drawdown while maintaining enough capacity to check al-Qaida and ISIS.\n\nWe cannot fight without boots on the ground\n\nSome will say terrorism in and near Afghanistan can be checked even without an American military presence on the ground, even if our departure leads to all-out civil war and/or a victory by the Taliban. Perhaps any future al-Qaida or ISIS presence on Afghan soil could be handled with long-range strikes or occasional commando raids that emanated from ships in the Indian Ocean. Or perhaps we could be confident that such groups have no substantial future interest in basing themselves in Afghanistan.\n\nBut that latter argument ignores history, as well as the geographic suppleness of global extremist movements in general. Few saw the ISIS caliphate coming in Iraq and Syria before 2014 but then, all of a sudden, it was there. And the former argument shows a poor appreciation of how counterterrorism intelligence is developed — usually by cooperation with partners on the ground — as well as an unrealistic appreciation for the geographic remoteness or ruggedness of the Hindu Kush. Standoff counterterrorism is generally an oxymoron.\n\nWith 5,000 American troops (and some additional civilians and contractors) in Afghanistan, the United States could maintain two or three major airfields and hubs of operations for intelligence, air power and special forces/commandos — at Bagram near Kabul in the nation's center, near Kandahar in the south, and perhaps around either Khost or Jalalabad in the east. It also could maintain a modest military advisory and training presence in Kabul, to help the Afghan army and police carry out the bulk of the fighting against extremists.\n\nIt's time to leave Afghanistan:Take the deal, President Trump; 18 years is enough\n\nThe annual cost of this presence would be perhaps $7 billion to $8 billion — not trivial, but only 1% of the defense budget. It would require several billion dollars more in annual assistance to the Afghan government, to maintain its army and police and to pursue modest development goals, though other donors could be expected to provide most funds for the latter purposes.\n\nCommitting to such a presence for half a decade would also signal to Pakistan and the Taliban that the new U.S. president would not be expecting a Hail Mary peace deal as a viable near-term exit strategy. Perhaps such a promise would even improve the seriousness with which one or both might then engage in peace talks.\n\nThe United States needs a policy that recognizes Afghanistan for what it is — a significant, but not a top-tier, U.S. strategic interest — and builds a plan accordingly. That overall strategy should still seek peace, but in the meantime its military element should be modest, yet steady and stable.\n\nMichael O'Hanlon, a member of USA TODAY's Board of Contributors, is a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and author of Beyond NATO: A New Security Architecture for Eastern Europe.

WASHINGTON, D.C. – Boy Scouts of America faces mounting legal liability as lawsuits alleging sexual abuse by leaders and volunteers continue to roll in, thanks in part to loosening statutes of limitations across the country.\n\nToday, lawyers with Abused in Scouting filed suit in Washington, D.C., on behalf of eight men who say they were abused as kids by Scout leaders and volunteers. The District in May eliminated time restrictions for sexual abuse survivors to pursue civil litigation and opened a two-year window for survivors under the age of 40 to file suit regardless of the date of the incident.\n\nSeparately, attorneys Gilion Dumas and Ashley Vaughn plan to file suit in California on behalf of 14 plaintiffs with similar claims. That mass action suit comes days after California's Assembly Bill 218 took effect, allowing victims of child sexual assault to file suit until age 40 and opening a three-year window for those abused as children to sue for past incidents.\n\nAttorney Paul Mones, who along with Dumas won a landmark $19.9 million verdict against the Scouts in 2010, said he expects a flood of litigation in California.\n\nWith the advent of all this consciousness of abuse in Boy Scouts, and all the things that happened in the last few years, there's going to be a tidal wave of cases against them.\n\nMones filed suit on behalf of a 17-year-old client in December in San Bernardino County Superior Court and estimates his firm has an additional 75 suits filed against Boy Scouts and as many as 200 more in the works.\n\nMore:Nearly 800 accuse Boy Scouts of failing to protect them from sex abuse as new lawsuit is filed\n\nMore:Boy Scouts, Catholic Church, more face new lawsuits as NY Child Victims Act window opens\n\nIn a statement, Boy Scouts expressed outrage that there have been times when individuals took advantage of our program to abuse innocent children.\n\nThe Boy Scouts of America is committed to fulfilling our social and moral responsibility to fairly compensate victims who suffered abuse during their time in Scouting, the statement reads. The BSA has a multi-layered process of safeguards informed by experts, including the following, all of which act as barriers to abuse: a leadership policy that requires at least two youth-protection trained adults be present with youth at all times and bans one-on-one situations where adults would have any interactions alone with children – either in person, online or via text; a thorough screening process for adult leaders and staff, including criminal background checks and the prompt mandatory reporting of any allegation or suspicion of abuse.\n\nCalifornia and D.C. join a wave of states and territories that are extending time for survivors of child sexual abuse to press charges and seek civil damages. Since 2009, lawmakers in 38 states have introduced such bills, according to a USA TODAY analysis. Twenty-nine states have enacted laws, including New York, where at least a dozen cases have been filed against the Scouts since the new law took effect in August.\n\nThe push to extend statutes of limitations or eradicate them altogether came about in part through better understanding of how long it can take survivors grappling with trauma to come forward. The average age of disclosure is 52, according to CHILD USA, a think tank that focuses on preventing child abuse and neglect. Some people never disclose what happened to them.\n\nGrooming is very powerful. The predators who learn how to groom know how to isolate people and know how to do it very well, said Dave Henson, one of the eight John Does in Monday's suit in D.C.\n\nHenson, now 39, said he was abused by an assistant Scout leader over a span of five years, starting when he was 11. The grooming was so meticulous, Henson said, that he didn't realize the late-night touching that turned into penetration was abuse until years later, when he told his high school sweetheart.\n\nI wanted to be open and honest with her, and said, 'Hey, I've had a homosexual relationship, and she kind of looked at me weird. I explained to her what kind of happened, she again looks at me and said, 'You didn't have a homosexual relationship; you were abused.'\n\nEven after her revelation it didn't really sink in. I didn't really understand why I had all these emotions of shame and guilt, which led to drinking, a lot of drinking, Henson said. That's why these windows and statutes of limitations are so important, because it takes so long sometimes to come to that realization.\n\nHenson's attorneys are hoping to set a new precedent for survivors who live in states that have not opened so-called look-back windows or changed their statutes. The group, which has been running TV and Google ads encouraging victims to come forward, says it has signed more than 1,600 clients since last spring, many of whom live in states with restrictive statutes of limitations.\n\nAll eight of the plaintiffs in Monday's suit, including Henson, live in states that have not yet opened windows.\n\nThe problem with Boy Scouts is this is a national organization, and it's really a national problem, said attorney Aitan Goelman of D.C.-based Zuckerman Spaeder, an Abused in Scouting member firm. To have such disparate treatment of survivors based on an arbitrary geographical factor is not fair. It's not just.\n\nGoelman says D.C. is a proper venue for the suit because a congressional charter incorporated Scouts in the nation's capital in 1916. The charter also required an annual report to Congress on the activities of the organization.\n\nThe suit, along with nearly all reviewed by USA TODAY, alleges that Boy Scouts knew it had a rampant child sexual abuse problem as far back as the 1920s but concealed the issue to protect its wholesome image. In several cases, survivors accuse the Scouts of failing to stop known abusers from returning to their ranks and abusing again.\n\nDumas said her firm has successfully brought cases in Montana, Iowa, Idaho and Oregon on claims that Boy Scouts committed fraud by concealing their knowledge of the threat of sexual abuse within the organization.\n\nA suit filed in Arkansas in November alleges abuse against two former Scouts who say they were assaulted by a leader who had previously been reported to the Boy Scouts of America for abuse in Georgia. According to the suit, the leader had been added to the ineligible volunteer files but was later allowed to become a leader in Arkansas.\n\nBoy Scouts could have gotten ahead of this early on but literally chose not to, said Mones, who says his client in San Bernardino was abused up until 2018. I believe they've been trying to look at that problem, but the problem is that it's a day late and a dollar short.\n\nThe organization has begun to show the strain of mounting legal bills. Last year, reports began to emerge of a potential bankruptcy filing. Boy Scouts has denied a filing is imminent but said it is exploring all available options.\n\nIn October, the organization raised annual membership fees from $33 to $60, and last month it confirmed it had mortgaged the Philmont Scout Ranch in New Mexico, one of its most prized properties where troops from across the country go for days-long treks. It said similar liens are in place for other properties, according to the Associated Press, including its headquarters in Irving, Texas, and bases in Florida, Minnesota and West Virginia.\n\nOn Jan. 1, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints followed through on its plan to pull hundreds of thousands of Mormon youth out of Scouts in favor of its own program. That withdrawal means an 18% drop in already declining membership for Scouts, predicted to dip below 2 million for the first time since World War II.\n\nCara Kelly is a reporter on the USA TODAY investigations team, focusing primarily on pop culture, consumer news and sexual violence.

Reddit has banned a popular subreddit used by supporters of President Donald Trump, as more tech companies crack down in the wake of riots at the U.S. Capitol.\n\nIn a statement, Reddit confirmed the subreddit r/donaldtrump was banned for repeated policy violations in recent days regarding the violence at the U.S. Capitol.\n\nAccording to a cached version of the subreddit, the channel had more than 52,000 members.\n\nReddit's site-wide policies prohibit content that promotes hate, or encourages, glorifies, incites, or calls for violence against groups of people or individuals, said the social media platform in a statement. In accordance with this, we have been proactively reaching out to moderators to remind them of our policies and to offer support or resources as needed.\n\nSocial media:President Trump blocked from posting to Facebook, Instagram 'indefinitely'\n\nMichelle Obama:Former first lady calls for Trump to be permanently banned from social media\n\nDetails of the ban were first reported by Axios.\n\nIn the aftermath of riots in D.C. during which a mob stormed the U.S. Capitol, social media companies have taken a more aggressive approach to statements from Trump. Facebook said it is planning to block Trump from the social network and Instagram indefinitely.\n\nWe believe the risks of allowing the President to continue to use our service during this period are simply too great, said Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg in a post Thursday.\n\nTwitter temporarily blocked access to Trump's account, requiring him to delete tweets related to events at the Capitol. Meanwhile, video game streaming site Twitch disabled Trump's account. TechCrunch reports Snapchat also disabled Trump's account.\n\nFollow Brett Molina on Twitter: @brettmolina23.
AP\n\nLAKE FOREST, Ill. (AP) — The Chicago Bears might be ready to split with quarterback Jay Cutler.\n\nTop receiver Alshon Jeffery's future is in question. Change could be coming to the coaching staff, too.\n\nThe Bears have a big task ahead of them after finishing their worst season in decades last in the NFC North with a 3-13 record. They got shredded by injuries, suspensions and poor play overall.\n\nNow, it's time to regroup.\n\nIt was all bad, linebacker Pernell McPhee said. I'm happy we're out of 2016.\n\nThe Bears are 9-23 in two seasons under John Fox, and they just posted their lowest win total in a non-strike year since the 1973 team went 3-11.\n\nIt didn't help that 19 players finished the season on injured reserve, including Cutler and guard Kyle Long. Jeffery and linebacker Jerrell Freeman also served four-game suspensions for violating the league's policy on performance-enhancing drugs.\n\nIt added up to the Bears finishing with their highest loss total since 1969 and missing the playoffs for the ninth time in 10 years.\n\nI want to go to the playoffs, Long said. I want to have 10 wins before we get to the playoffs and have an opportunity to have home-field advantage. A frickin' playoff game in Chicago — can you imagine that?\n\nIt hasn't happened since the 2010 team lost to Green Bay in the NFC title game. The Bears enter this offseason with the No. 3 pick in the draft and some big issues to address on their roster.\n\nWHO'S THE QB?: The biggest question facing the Bears? That's easy.\n\nThe Bears' all-time leading passer, Cutler has no guaranteed money left on the seven-year contract extension he signed in 2014. At 33, he was limited to five games because of a thumb injury and then a torn right labrum that led to him being placed on injured reserve.\n\nThen again, the Bears have no logical long-term replacement on the roster. That's an issue they need to address, whether they keep Cutler or bring in another veteran.\n\nJEFFERY'S FUTURE: Though it's not clear if he will still be with them, Jeffery guaranteed a Super Bowl championship for the Bears next year. He even compared them to the New England Patriots.\n\nWe're just like them, the only difference is just a few plays here and there, he said.\n\nJeffery played for the $14.6 million franchise tag this season. The Bears could tag him again if they don't agree to a multiyear deal, though that would be an expensive option to use on a receiver with a PED suspension and a history of injuries.\n\nIt would be easier to part with Jeffery if the Bears knew what they had in Kevin White, the No. 7 overall pick in 2015. But he was limited to four games because of a fractured left fibula after missing his rookie year with a stress fracture in his left shin.\n\nI'll be just fine, said White, who hasn't started running. Just about getting my mobility back, getting my strength back.\n\nON STAFF: While Fox said last week he wasn't planning to make changes to his staff, he didn't quite slam the door on it, either.\n\nMaybe he and general manager Ryan Pace will provide more clarity on the status of defensive coordinator Vic Fangio and offensive coordinator Dowell Loggains when they meet with the media on Wednesday.\n\nThere was a report of friction between Fangio and Fox a few weeks ago. Fangio might also get interviews for head coaching jobs.\n\nLoggains came under scrutiny in his first season as Chicago's offensive coordinator.\n\nGETTING HEALTHY: The Bears might need to determine if the organization can do anything to prevent another rash of injuries.\n\nCutler, Long, White, nose tackle Eddie Goldman and linebackers Lamarr Houston and Danny Trevathan all wound up on IR. Other important players shuffled in and out of the lineup because of injuries.\n\nI think I'm just going to put those packing peanuts and bubble wrap all over myself next year, said Long, who is recovering from ankle surgery and will undergo a less invasive shoulder operation.

The bright orange Kenneth Cole suitcase circled the baggage claim carousel at Dallas Love Field with what looked like an antenna.\n\nA piece of wire was all that remained of the retractable handle on the hardside bag.\n\nI pushed it into the Southwest Airlines baggage claim office to file a claim, short on time and unsure of what came next. It was the first time an airline damaged my bag. Delayed bags, I knew the drill. Lost bags, too, as an airline permanently lost a bag of mine several years ago.\n\nHere's what I learned: Travelers have options when it comes to damaged bags, and knowing your rights will put you in a better position to resolve the claim.\n\nIf you have a claim, that is. An airline's definition of damage, backed by the U.S. Department of Transportation, may differ significantly from a passenger's definition. Normal wear and tear, including scratches, scuff marks, stains, dents and dirt, are not covered.\n\nEvery airline damaged bag policy has a disclaimer about normal wear and tear. And it applies even if you bought the suitcase the night before your flight or are checking a designer bag.\n\nIf you have a Louis Vuitton (bag) and it goes through the (conveyor) belt system, it is not white glove service,'' said Lisa Ouimette, an analyst in American Airlines' central baggage services office. These are belt loaders. If you have a brand new bag, expect it to have normal wear and tear.''\n\nAirlines also reserve the right to deny claims to passengers with damage caused by overstuffed bags, such as broken zippers, as well as poor quality bags and bags that were damaged when checked in.\n\nSo what is covered?\n\nDamage to luggage components including wheels, handles, straps and other glaring problems, such as holes or a cracked hardside bag, are covered. The latter is a big problem in cold weather, Ouimette said. (So are removable straps, which regularly get stuck in the bag loading systems, so take them off, she said.)\n\nWe anticipate damage and when it does happen, we have a plan in place to take care of our customers,'' she said.\n\nPassenger rights if an airline damages your bag\n\nMore than 87 percent of U.S. travelers don't file claims against airlines following an issue with lost, damaged or delayed luggage, according to a survey earlier this year by AirHelp, a service that helps passengers get compensation for claims against airlines. The three main reasons: They didn't think they would be entitled to compensation, they were not aware of their rights and they did not know how to file a claim.\n\nAirlines are responsible for repairing or reimbursing a passenger for damaged baggage and/or its contents when the damage occurs while the bag is under the airline's control, according to the U.S. Department of Transportation's Aviation Consumer Protection division.\n\nThe cheapest option for airlines is a bag repair. Many use Dallas-based Rynn's Luggage, which bills itself as the largest airline luggage repair and replacement service in the country.\n\nIf a bag cannot be repaired, it will be replaced with a like bag or passengers will be reimbursed. The reimbursement is based on the value of the bag and its depreciation, the DOT says, subject to liability limits.\n\nFor flights within the United States, the maximum liability for a lost, delayed or damaged bag is $3,500. The limit on international flights, per the Montreal Convention, is about $1,600, the agency says.\n\nAirlines are free to pay more but there is no requirement to do so, according to the DOT.\n\nThat doesn't mean you're going to get $3,500 or anything close to it if a wheel fell off your bag or your handle was destroyed. (The higher limits generally apply to a lost suitcase full of pricey personal belongings.)\n\nMy suitcase wasn't new and had plenty of scuffs, but the broken retractable handle was clearly a big problem. I worried that Delta Air Lines, which I was flying the next day out of Dallas, wouldn't accept it, or would have me sign a waiver absolving them of any liability should it get further damaged.\n\nSouthwest baggage representatives in Dallas were friendly and apologetic and didn't doubt I needed a new bag. But they were clearly trying to limit their liability. (I never identify myself as a travel reporter for fear of getting special treatment, a violation of our ethics policy.)\n\nThey asked how old my bag was, where I purchased it and how much I paid for it. They took photos and went to a back room computer to search for a similar bag online. They couldn't find one, or only found heavily discounted bags. I didn't recall how much my bag was or where I purchased it but estimated it at between $150 and $200. A repair never came up.\n\nThen, in a move that surprised me, they wheeled out a couple new bags about the same size as my bag. One was a hardside bag, the other a traditional suitcase, and both had spinner wheels and a retractable handle, like mine. The hardside bag wouldn't fit all of my stuff and both bags looked relatively cheap, so I initially passed.\n\nAmerican's Ouimette said airlines keep so-called stock bags on hand for cases where passengers immediately need a new bag. She ordered a bunch for American for the busy holiday season. Many passengers love them because their damaged bag is older and they are thrilled to get a new one.\n\nI was pickier and wanted something decent for the hassle.\n\nSouthwest said they would reimburse me if I bought a new bag and brought a receipt for a similar bag on my way out of Dallas the next morning. I didn't have time to shop during my 24-hour visit and needed a suitcase, so eventually decided to take them up on the stock bag.\n\nIn the middle of the baggage claim office, I unpacked my broken bag and transferred everything to the new softside bag.\n\nI wheeled it out of the office and into the corridor heading to the airport's Uber pick-up area. I didn't make it. The wheels kept circling, sending me a couple steps back for every step forward.\n\nI fumbled my way back to the baggage claim office and told them the bag didn't work. They were apologetic, again. I repacked everything into the broken bag and pushed it through the corridor and headed out.\n\nSouthwest said they would reimburse me for whatever bag I bought, never setting a price limit. I didn't buy one in Dallas; a generous friend I was staying with gave me a big suitcase they were no longer using.\n\nJust before Christmas, enticed by the offer of free expedited shipping, I bought a bag I'd had my eye on, a $245 Away carry-on bag . It was nowhere near as big as the Kenneth Cole one Southwest broke, but my friend's bag took care of my big-bag needs and I was in desperate need of a sturdy new carry-on bag.\n\nMy claim was finally resolved the day after Christmas in Phoenix. I landed at Sky Harbor International Airport after midnight and headed to the baggage claim office while waiting for bags to arrive after my flight from Providence.\n\nI submitted my receipt for $260, which included taxes. It took the agents time to find my claim because I didn't have my damage incident report'' and they were having computer issues.\n\nA supervisor offered $200, a figure noted in my report by the Dallas agents. I told her they said to buy any bag and bring the receipt, no money figure mentioned, due to my hassles with the stock bag.\n\nWe'll split the difference, how's that?'' she asked.\n\nAt 1 a.m., I walked out of the office with a check for $225.\n\n5 things to do if an airline damages your bag\n\n1. Head to the baggage claim office immediately if possible. You have up to 24 hours to report a claim for domestic flights and seven days for international flights on most carriers, though policies vary by airline. Southwest and JetBlue require claims within four hours; Frontier, 12 hours. It's easiest to do in person, having everything documented on-site instead of spending time on the phone and uploading claim documents online. Plus, you might be offered a replacement bag on the spot if you're not picky about a new bag.\n\n2. Don't rip off your baggage tags. The airline will need them.\n\n3. Be calm and courteous. A banged-up bag is a bad way to begin or end a trip, but blasting the baggage claim representative for a missing wheel or hole in your bag isn't going to help your claim or get it resolved more quickly.\n\n4. Know the approximate value of your bag and where you purchased it to give you some negotiating leverage in case of reimbursement.\n\n5. Jot down names of airline representatives and details discussed and stay on top of the claims process if it's not resolved immediately. Airlines issue a claim number and updates can be found online. Not getting the answers you want? Ask to talk to someone in the airport office where you submitted the claim or a representative in the airline's central baggage services office.\n\nMajor airline policies on damaged bags:\n\nAlaska Airlines\n\nAllegiant Air\n\nAmerican Airlines\n\nDelta Air Lines\n\nFrontier Airlines\n\nJetBlue Airways\n\nSouthwest Airlines\n\nSpirit Airlines\n\nUnited Airlines\n\nMore:Travel nightmares: What to do if you miss your flight
WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump walked out of a negotiating meeting with congressional leaders Wednesday and said he might declare a national emergency at the border after Democrats refused to yield to his demands for money for a border wall.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., said Trump abruptly ended the White House session after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said she did not support his border wall.\n\nHe just got up and said we have nothing to discuss, and he walked out, Schumer said. He just walked out of the meeting.\n\nSchumer called Trump's behavior unbecoming of a president.\n\nVice President Mike Pence and Republican lawmakers disputed the Democrats' account and said the meeting ended after Democrats refused to offer a counterplan to reopen the government.\n\nTrump gave Schumer and Pelosi the floor to state their case, but they want to argue, said House GOP leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif.\n\nTrump treated the Democrats politely, McCarthy said, but they reacted with embarrassing behavior.\n\nTrump confirmed that he walked out of the session, writing on Twitter, Just left a meeting with Chuck and Nancy, a total waste of time. I asked what is going to happen in 30 days if I quickly open things up, are you going to approve Border Security which includes a Wall or Steel Barrier? Nancy said, NO. I said bye-bye, nothing else works!\n\nThe end of what was supposed to be a new round of bipartisan talks came on the 19th day of a partial government shutdown – the second-longest in history – that was triggered by Trump's demands for $5.7 billion to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexican border and Democrats' refusal to give him the money.\n\nEarlier Wednesday, Trump said he was still considering declaring a national emergency on the border if negotiations with Democrats fail to yield a deal on funding for the wall.\n\nI think we might work a deal (on the government shutdown), and if we don't, I may go that route, he said. I have the absolute right to do (a) national emergency if I want. … My threshold will be if I can't make a deal with people that are unreasonable.\n\nAn emergency declaration theoretically would allow Trump to use military money to build the wall. Democrats and some Republicans have questioned the legality of such a move, saying an emergency declaration would be challenged in court.\n\nBefore Wednesday's failed bipartisan meeting, Trump and Pence traveled to the Capitol for a closed-door luncheon with Senate Republicans.\n\nAfterward, Trump reiterated that he might pursue a national emergency declaration to get funding for his wall if Democrats don't agree with the fact that our country really has problems with crime.\n\nTrump portrayed a sense of unity among Republicans, though some have suggested opening portions of the government while negotiations over the wall continue.\n\nThere was no discussion about anything other than solidarity, Trump said. The Republicans are totally unified.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., also stressed that Republicans remain solidly behind Trump in the budget standoff. But at least three GOP senators – Cory Gardner of Colorado, Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska – have publicly said the Senate should at least consider a House plan to reopen the government.\n\nThe operations of the Department of Interior and the National Park Service or the operations of the IRS and whether or not tax refunds go out don't have anything to do with border security, Murkowski said Tuesday. So let's bifurcate these issues. Let's set them aside. Let's allow for the operations, these governmental functions in these six other departments, allow for them to continue.\n\nThe House of Representatives voted 240-188 Wednesday to approve a bill that would fund the Treasury Department and the IRS so Americans' tax refunds wouldn't be delayed because of the shutdown. Eight Republicans voted with Democrats to pass the bill.\n\nThe House will take up three bills to fund the remaining shuttered departments this week. None of the measures is likely to get a vote in the GOP-controlled Senate.\n\nThe White House threatened to veto all four bills, saying they are unacceptable without a broader agreement to address the situation on the border.\n\nContributing: Deborah Barfield Berry, Christal Hayes and Trevor Hughes
WASHINGTON – The warnings about climate change are dire: bigger floods, larger fires, larger storms.\n\nMost experts agree there's little to prevent these catastrophes without swift action on climate change.\n\nEnter Rep. Kathy Castor, the Florida Democrat that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has chosen to chair the new Select Committee on the Climate Crisis.\n\nA Capitol Hill veteran and clean energy champion with a background as an environmental lawyer, the Tampa Democrat plans to shine a light on the very climate issues many Democratic candidates ran on in November to win back the House.\n\nOver the next 15 months, the panel will make policy recommendations, push for legislation and cast a spotlight on the growing dangers of man-made global warming that's spelled out in a chilling a federal report released in November.\n\nWe are in a race against time, Castor, 52, told USA TODAY recently.\n\nThe committee already faces obstacles:\n\n• Republicans, who have consistently downplayed the effects of climate change, say the panel is unfairly partisan (nine Democrats vs. six Republicans).\n\n• Progressives, who support a comprehensive approach known as the Green New Deal, worry the committee won't be aggressive enough.\n\nThe panel will only be able to do so much.\n\nIt won't have the power to subpoena documents or depose witnesses. It ultimately will have to rely on standing committees to adopt its recommendations. And any ambitious measures are unlikely to win passage in the Republican-held Senate or be signed by President Donald Trump who has dismissed global warming as a hoax and made environmental deregulation a cornerstone of his economic agenda.\n\nCastor spoke with USA TODAY about the charge of her committee and the challenges it faces:\n\nQ: Much of the information on climate change is out there. So what do you hope to accomplish with this new committee?\n\nCastor: We're going to press for dramatic carbon pollution reduction. We want to win the clean energy future to defend the American way of life and avoid catastrophic and costly weather events that have dire impacts.\n\nQ: What are some of the issues you want to pursue and how will you work with the standing congressional committee to achieve them?\n\nCastor:Right off the bat, we will tackle fuel economy standards, make sure the Commerce Committee and the (Transportation and Infrastructure Committee) are focused on that. The Financial Services Committee has to do a flood insurance reform bill. We will be involved in that as well.\n\nQ: You mentioned flood insurance. Representing a coastal district, you know what flooding and storms can do. Should we rebuild along the shore?\n\nCastor: We shouldn't be insuring at taxpayer expense homes and businesses that have been destroyed repeatedly on the shore. Folks know full well that they're in hurricane's path or flood's path and they do that on their own. I'm concerned the (flood) maps are not up-to-date, that states and local communities are not acting fast enough to adopt policies to revise maps.\n\nQ: Is there a concern you may getting in the way of standing committees who are already charged with environmental protection and climate change issues?\n\nCastor: No, we're going to be complimentary. This is a collaborative effort. It's just being elevated because the threat to our way of life is at stake. It's all hands on deck.\n\nQ: What's your response to Republicans who say the panel will be stacked with Democrats and have too much latitude to go after issues beyond its scope?\n\nCastor: Look, we've had so much delay and Republicans have had their heads in the sand here in the Congress. I've just been through a time in the minority on (the) Energy and Commerce (Committee) where they refused to have even one hearing on the climate or hear any legislation dealing with the escalating cost of climate of extreme weather events. And I do see our jurisdiction as being very broad. We're talking about the planet.\n\nQ: How will the committee go about highlighting the consequences of climate change?\n\nCastor: We intend to tell the stories of communities that are taking action despite the inaction from the Congress and the Trump administration. There are some conservative, rural areas that are going renewable and reducing carbon pollution and we're going to shine a light on their good work. And for bad actors that know better, we intend to make sure they're famous as well.\n\nQ: Even if the House passes ambitious measures, their chance of becoming law is slim given the positions of the president and the Senate. So why try?\n\nCastor: We don't have time to wait. Whatever we can press to accomplish as soon as possible, we will do that.\n\nThe politics:Climate change: Democrats see Trump, GOP inaction as 2020 opportunity\n\nRelated:Once Democrats take charge of the House, addressing climate change will become top priority again
WASHINGTON — A presidential candidate is accused of arranging hush money to conceal a mistress in a sensational story ripped straight from the tabloids.\n\nSound familiar?\n\nSix years ago, federal prosecutors put two-time Democratic presidential contender John Edwards on trial for just that and ended up failing to convict the North Carolina politician. Now, the Common Cause watchdog group wants the Justice Department, the Federal Election Commission and Congress to investigate a $130,000 payment that President Trump's lawyer is alleged to have arranged weeks before the 2016 election for a former porn actress in an attempt to cover up her purported affair with Trump.\n\nCampaign-finance experts say these cases are tricky to prove, and Washington politics — the Justice Department, the Federal Election Commission and Congress are all controlled by the president's party — seem likely to doom any probe into whether federal laws were violated.\n\nI have real doubts that the Department of Justice has the independence and the fortitude to go after this, said Peter Zeidenberg, who served as a prosecutor in the Justice Department's Public Integrity Section during George W. Bush's administration.\n\nAttorney General Jeff Session's decision to recuse himself from a federal investigation into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russian government in the 2016 election already has caused a deep rift in his relationship with Trump.\n\nMore:Attorney General Jeff Sessions interviewed by Mueller's team as part of Russia investigation\n\nI think Jeff Sessions is scared to death about losing his job, Zeidenberg said. He's trying to curry favor with the president at every turn, and I think that he would think that this a bridge too far for his agency to investigate the reported payment.\n\nIn its complaints to the Justice Department and the Federal Election Commission (FEC), Common Cause argues that the alleged payment to Stephanie Clifford, whose stage name is Stormy Daniels, likely violated federal campaign-finance laws as an unreported, in-kind donation to Trump's campaign.\n\nCampaign contribution limits in effect during the 2016 election capped direct donations to a candidates at $2,700 for a primary or general election. In addition, corporations are prohibited from giving campaign donations to congressional and presidential candidates.\n\nOn Tuesday, Common Cause also sent a letter to the House and Senate Judiciary committees, asking them to take up the matter.\n\nJustice Department officials did not immediately respond Tuesday to an inquiry about the Common Cause request. An FEC spokesman said agency officials cannot comment on complaints.\n\nMichael Cohen, Trump's longtime lawyer identified by the Wall Street Journal as having arranged the payment to the actress through a limited liability company, said the complaints lack merit.\n\nThe Common Cause complaint is baseless along with the allegation that President Trump filed a false report to the F.E.C., Cohen said in an emailed statement.\n\nIn an earlier statement, Cohen has said the president vehemently denies a relationship with Daniels. Cohen also released a statement from Daniels denying an affair or the receipt of a payoff from Trump.\n\nThe Journal unearthed a corporate document showing that Cohen created a limited liability company, Essential Consultants LLC, in Delaware on Oct. 17, 2016, less than a month before the election. A bank account linked to that company sent the payment to the client-trust account of Daniels' attorney, the newspaper reported.\n\nLast week, gossip magazine In Touch Weekly ran a previously unpublished interview with Daniels from 2011 who described an affair with Trump that began in 2006, a year after he had married Melania Trump.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported that the alleged payment to Daniels came in October 2016 as Trump's campaign grappled with release of an Access Hollywood tape in which Trump talked about groping women. Daniels also had been in talks with ABC's Good Morning America that fall to discuss Trump, the Journal reported.\n\nThe timing of this payment is strong evidence that this was payment for the purpose of influencing an election, rather than concealing the affair from Trump's family, said Paul Ryan, Common Cause's vice president for policy and litigation.\n\nIt was a decade-old relationship he had with her, Ryan said of the alleged affair. So, why then?\n\nMore:Porn star Stormy Daniels' alleged affair with Trump takes new twist with old interview\n\nMore:Analysis: Why the latest allegations of a Trump affair are unlikely to hurt the tabloid president\n\nIn Edwards' case, his lawyers argued $1 million in secret payments to Edwards' pregnant mistress by Edwards' donors were aimed at shielding his wife, Elizabeth, who died of cancer in 2010, not hiding the information from voters.\n\nThe six-week corruption trial against Edwards ended with acquittal on one count, and the jury deadlocked on five other charges.The Justice Department opted not to retry him.\n\nThese are fact-sensitive cases that are tough to prove, Kenneth Gross, a veteran campaign-finance lawyer, said Tuesday. You have to get to the bottom of where the money came from and what was the intent of the payment.\n\nAt the Federal Election Commission, which often deadlocks along party lines, commissioners would have to vote to open a campaign-finance investigation. And a vacancy on the commission has left Republicans in the majority.\n\nEven as Ryan argued for the investigations, he acknowledged that the politics make this tough.\n\nThe FEC has been for years mired in dysfunction and now has a Republican majority of commissioners, he said, and the DOJ (Department of Justice) is within the executive branch of government headed by the president.
Maurie Backman\n\nThe Motley Fool\n\nCorrection: An earlier version of this story cited the wrong source for data about anxiety Americans face over finances. The original data came from MoneyLion.com.\n\nAll things considered, now is a pretty good time to be an active participant in the U.S. economy.\n\nJobs are plentiful. The market has been on a winning streak. And while rising interest rates are a mixed bag, savers can at least rest easy knowing their emergency cash will soon start to earn just a bit more.\n\nIt's somewhat surprising, then, to learn that despite all of these factors, more adults have a negative financial outlook than a positive one. In a recent GOBankingRates report that cited MoneyLion.com data, 28% of Americans say they feel anxious about their finances, compared with just 19% who feel optimistic. And that's a pretty startling pill to swallow, especially since most Americans also believe they'll earn more money in 2018 than they previously did.\n\nWhy are Americans so anxious? In a previous GOBankingRates survey, the reasons boiled down to never being able to retire, always living paycheck-to-paycheck, and being in debt forever. But if those are the issues at play here, there are some solutions that can help.\n\nNever managing to retire\n\nAfter a lifetime of hard work, the last thing you want to worry about is never getting to call it quits. But a huge chunk of working adults are risking that very fate by not saving for retirement appropriately. In fact, nearly half of U.S. households have no money set aside for the future, according to the Economic Policy Institute. And that's a problem, because Social Security alone won't be enough to pay the bills in retirement. Or, to put it another way, if you don't save on your own, you'll probably end up working forever, or landing in a precarious financial situation when you're old. Neither is ideal.\n\nThe solution? Start saving now, even if in small increments. The beauty of investing your retirement savings (which both IRAs and 401(k)s allow for) is that you have the ability to turn a series of relatively modest contributions into a rather impressive sum over time.\n\nCheck out the following table, which shows what saving just $300 a month consistently can do for your nest egg:\n\nIf you start saving $300 a month at age: Here's what you'll have by age 65 (assumes an average annual 8% return): 25 $932,000 30 $620,000 35 $408,000 40 $263,000 45 $165,000 50 $98,000\n\nData source: author.\n\nOf course, the sooner you begin socking away money for retirement, the better your chances of actually getting to leave the workforce when you want to. Keep in mind, however, that the $300 figure above doesn't even come close to maxing out an IRA or 401(k). For the former, you can contribute up to $5,500 a year if you're under 50, or $6,500 if you're 50 or older. For the latter, these limits just increased to $18,500 and $24,500, respectively. Max out for even a couple of years while contributing smaller amounts consistently, and you stand a much better shot of retiring than you'd think.\n\nLiving paycheck-to-paycheck\n\nA big reason Americans are stuck living paycheck to paycheck is their tendency to save too little and spend too much. If you'd rather break that cycle, then here's what you need to do. First, create a budget, which will help you see where your money is going and how much room for savings your expenses allow for. Only once you have that budget in place will you be in a good position to identify which bills to slash.\n\nAnd that leads to the second thing you'll need to do, which is start cutting expenses if your current budget doesn't allow you to save at least 10% of your paycheck month after month. Whether you choose to reduce one major expense, like your home, or a series of smaller ones, like your cable bill and takeout habit, is up to you. But you will need to lower your spending if you're tired of the paycheck to paycheck routine.\n\nOne additional option you can also consider is picking up some sort of side hustle. Though it's not easy swinging a second gig on top of a full-time job, if you're willing to put in the effort, you can boost your income and use that extra money to pad your savings account. Furthermore, working that extra job might give you the flexibility to cut fewer expenses, thus contributing to a better quality of life.\n\nMore: Only 39% of Americans are ready for a $1,000 unexpected expense\n\nMore: Millennials: 1 in 6 now have $100,000 socked away\n\nMore: Retirement planning: 18 frequently asked 401(k) questions\n\nDying in debt\n\nNever managing to get out of debt is a valid concern, especially since the average household carrying a balance is on the hook for a whopping $16,000. Still, there's no need to resign yourself to taking that debt with you to the grave, especially if you're willing to make an effort to pay it off.\n\nHow? It's simple -- just employ the same tactics. Trim expenses from your budget, work extra, and free up cash to apply to your debt. From there, pay the bills that are costing you the most in interest, and work your way down. You can also look into a balance transfer, which may be a good option if your credit itself is relatively strong despite your debt.\n\nIf you're starting 2018 with a relatively negative financial outlook, here's your chance to turn things around. You can salvage your retirement, stop living paycheck-to-paycheck, and break free from the evil cycle of debt. You just need to shift your priorities a little and start making changes for the better.\n\nThe Motley Fool has a disclosure policy.\n\nThe Motley Fool is a USA TODAY content partner offering financial news, analysis and commentary designed to help people take control of their financial lives.

Kim Tong-Hyung\n\nAssociated Press\n\nSEOUL, South Korea – North Korea's acting ambassador to Italy, Jo Song Gil, went into hiding with his wife in November, South Korea's spy agency told lawmakers in Seoul on Thursday. A high-profile defection by one of North Korea's elite would be a huge embarrassment for leader Kim Jong Un as he pursues diplomacy with Seoul and Washington and seeks to portray himself as a player in international geopolitics.\n\nSouth Korean lawmaker Kim Min-ki said an official from Seoul's National Intelligence Service shared the information during a closed-door briefing. Kim did not say whether the spy agency revealed any information about Jo's current whereabouts or whether the diplomat had plans to defect to South Korea. Kim said the NIS said it has not been contacted by Jo.\n\nKim said the NIS official said that Jo and his wife left the official residence in early November, weeks before his term was to end in late November. Kim said he couldn't confirm whether the NIS official revealed whether Jo and his wife were accompanied by any children. The NIS earlier said it couldn't confirm a South Korean media report that Jo was under the protection of the Italian government as he seeks asylum in a Western nation.\n\nNorth Korea has not yet commented on Jo's status.\n\nAn official with the Italian Foreign Ministry said the North Korean hadn't requested asylum from Italy. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity in line with standard practice, said Jo no longer held diplomatic status in Italy. That presumably refers to his government's ending his diplomatic assignment to Italy and his being recalled.\n\nNorth Korea, which touts itself in its propaganda as a socialist paradise, is extremely sensitive about defections, especially among its elite diplomatic corps, and has previously insisted that they are South Korean or U.S. plots to undermine its government.\n\nNorth Korea may publicly ignore Jo's possible defection or hold back harsh criticism to avoid highlighting the vulnerability of its government as it pursues diplomacy with Washington and Seoul, said Koh Yu-hwan, a North Korea expert at Seoul's Dongguk University.\n\nThe last senior North Korean diplomat known to have defected is Thae Yong Ho, a former minister at the North Korean Embassy in London, who fled to South Korea in 2016.\n\nWhile not identifying him by name, the North's state media then described Thae as human scum and claimed he was trying to escape punishment for serious crimes.\n\nThae, who has been an outspoken critic of Kim Jong Un while living in South Korea, denied the accusations and said he defected because he didn't want his children to live miserable lives in the North.\n\nIt's possible that Jo is trying to defect because of similar reasons, said Koh, who is a policy adviser for South Korean President Moon Jae-in. It could be difficult for some diplomats to accept being called back to the North after enjoying years living in the free West.

Jeffrey Ball\n\nOpinion contributor\n\nIt seems a sensible solution: To slash emissions of the greenhouse gases dangerously warming the planet, force polluters to pay for what they cough out. Slapping a price on carbon, the argument goes, should prod companies and consumers to go green, from electric cars to renewable energy to diets lower in meat.\n\nBut mounting evidence suggests that carbon prices are like unicorns and fairy dust: dazzling in concept and all but meaningless in practice.\n\nMore states, regions and countries than ever are putting prices on carbon emissions. Europe has done it, certain U.S. states have done it, Canada is doing it, and China, the world's biggest emitter, is moving to do it. Yet global emissions are surging to new highs.\n\nOUR VIEW:Greenhouse gases blowing the wrong way for America\n\nOne-fifth of all global emissions, the World Bank says, are now subject to a carbon price — either a tax or a market in mandatory pollution permits known as cap-and-trade. Nevertheless, energy-related carbon emissions jumped 1.6 percent in 2017, according to the International Energy Agency, and they likely rose more in 2018.\n\nWhy aren't carbon prices curbing global warming? They tend to constrain emissions only in certain parts of the economy. And even there, politicians tend to lack the guts to set the prices high enough to change much. Little wonder that, according to World Bank figures, less than 1 percent of global emissions are subject to a carbon price that economists believe is high enough to change much.\n\nSo carbon prices aren't just ineffective; they're counterproductive. By providing the illusion that they're effectively dealing with climate change, they reduce pressure for tougher policies that could meaningfully curb emissions, such as phasing out coal as an electricity fuel except where it's paired with carbon-capture technology; maintaining existing nuclear plants; and making renewable energy cheaper.\n\nClimate change, an existential challenge, deserves a massive response. In the future, perhaps carbon pricing will work. So far, it looks like a diversion.\n\nJeffrey Ball is scholar-in-residence at Stanford University's Steyer-Taylor Center for Energy Policy and Finance.

Philip Reed\n\nNerdwallet\n\nCar shoppers are often pressured into buying an extended auto warranty — so-called because it kicks in to cover repairs after the new-car warranty expires — even though they don't know their odds of using it or what it really costs.\n\nFor those with buyer's remorse, there's good news — most warranties can be canceled and you'll get a prorated amount refunded.\n\nThe question then becomes, do I need that extended warranty I bought? And, if not, how do I get my money back?\n\n'An expensive gamble'\n\nExtended warranties, often called vehicle service contracts, are sold by the finance and insurance manager while creating your sales contract. These warranties cover repair costs for varying lengths of time or miles driven after the manufacturer's bumper-to-bumper warranty ends.\n\nThere are factory warranties, backed by the carmaker, with repairs made using original manufacturer parts, as well as third-party warranties that often require you to request a reimbursement and use after-market parts.\n\nConsumer Reports, calling extended warranties an expensive gamble, found the median price for coverage was just over $1,200. The results of the 2013 survey, its most recent, showed that 55 percent of owners who purchased an extended warranty didn't use it. And those who did use it spent hundreds more for the coverage than they saved in repair costs, on average, the survey found.\n\nMore:These 6 vehicles were the hottest-selling cars of 2018: Jeep, Toyota, Tesla make the list\n\nAndy Meisler, a retired journalist in Los Angeles, was offered an extended warranty when buying a Toyota Prius but he decided not to take that bet.\n\nAfter driving the car for 10 years, Meisler said, That car never needed more than routine maintenance. And our warranty-less state never cost us a bit of sleep.\n\nReasons to cancel\n\nAlthough an extended warranty is portrayed as protection against costly future repairs, here are a few scenarios that might make you decide to cancel it:\n\nNonagreement : Some buyers discover that an extended warranty was slipped into their car financing contract without their knowledge or agreement. Then, the term of the loan is extended to hide the extra expense.\n\n: Some buyers discover that an extended warranty was slipped into their car financing contract without their knowledge or agreement.

After reading the fine print, some car owners decide the coverage doesn't justify the cost. Postponement: If you bought a new car, the extended warranty doesn't kick in for at least three years.

Here's how it works.\n\nHow to get your money back\n\nYou can cancel an extended warranty at any time and you'll get a prorated refund for the unused portion of your policy. If the warranty was included in your loan, your car payment won't drop, but you may pay off the car sooner after the refund is deducted from your balance.\n\nConsider these tips to make the cancellation process as smooth as possible:\n\nRead the fine print . Find the paperwork for your policy to see whom to contact and if there's a cancellation fee. If you recently bought the extended warranty and don't yet have the contract, call the finance manager who sold it to you.

PHOENIX — The same week the Trump administration opened a hotline in April to support victims of crimes by immigrants, Elena Maria Lopez called to report a complaint against her ex-husband.\n\nAt first, Lopez kept getting a busy signal.\n\nBut finally someone answered. For the next 20 minutes, Lopez provided a detailed account, accusing the Dutch immigrant of marrying her to get a green card and then threatening to harm her if she contacted immigration officials.\n\nWhat happened next shocked Lopez.\n\n► Jan. 19:The worst states economically for Hispanics and Latinos\n\n► Jan. 17:Deportation of Ohio woman was in error, appeals court says\n\n► Jan. 16:Can courts stop deportation of disabled boy's caregiver? Yes.\n\nNot only did Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the agency that operates the hotline, decline to take action, but immigration authorities also released much of the private information she provided. This includes a confidential Internet phone number she fears will now make it easier for anyone to locate her in New Jersey, where she has a protected address set up for domestic-violence victims.\n\nLopez is one of hundreds of people whose private information was inappropriately released by ICE when the agency posted call logs to the hotline on its website, a clear violation of the agency's own policies against divulging private information as well as privacy laws intended to protect individuals who provide sensitive information to the government.\n\n► Jan. 13:Chicago pays tribute to its Haitian founder after Trump vulgarity\n\n► Jan. 13:Federal government begins accepting DACA renewals\n\nThe agency also released some of the same information to The Arizona Republic in response to a Freedom of Information Act request.\n\nLopez contacted the newspaper after ICE officials notified her through telephone calls and emails that private information she provided in confidence was inadvertently released to the newspaper.\n\nI was very upset because I do my best to protect my privacy for my safety and I was especially upset that it was the Department of Homeland Security that gave out my personal information, she said. The same agency that claimed it had to protect my ex-husband's rights just destroyed my privacy and my safety.\n\n'This is a serious problem'\n\nThe agency's release of private information underscores problems that have surfaced since ICE launched the Victims of Immigration Crime Engagement office, or VOICE, to serve the needs of crime victims and their families who have been affected by crimes committed by individuals with a nexus to immigration.\n\nThe office includes a telephone hotline that was not intended to report crimes but to answer questions from victims, according to the VOICE website. Instead, callers have treated it has a crime hotline, using it largely to accuse people of being in the country illegally or of violating immigration laws, according to telephone logs the agency released The Republic.\n\nThis is a serious problem and obviously will further discourage people from attempting to interact in any way with the federal government on immigration matters, said immigration policy analyst David Bier at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank.\n\nVictims and witnesses of crimes already are hesitant to provide information to the government because having that information out in the public could pose a serious threat to them and to their family, he said.\n\nPresident Trump called for the creation of the VOICE program in an executive order on immigration in January 2016, which directed the Department of Homeland Security and ICE to take a tougher stance on illegal immigration and immigration-law violators.\n\nIn a written statement, ICE officials admitted that the agency erred in divulging private information protected by policy and law.\n\nWhen the agency receives evidence suggesting that non-releasable information is unintentionally available, immediate actions are taken to ensure proper mitigation both to correct and to prevent further disclosures, the statement said.\n\nThose action include temporarily removing and reviewing the entire contents of ICE's Freedom of Information Act library, the statement said. The library contained thousands of pages of data and documents the agency previously had released in response to requests.\n\n► Jan. 8:Trump orders 200,000 Salvadorans to leave U.S.\n\n► Jan. 5:Man gets 9 months in deaths of 5 Mexican immigrants in basement\n\nThe contents of ICE's Freedom of Information Act library were restored Oct. 16, the agency said.\n\nThe agency also offered identity-threat monitoring services to people affected because of the improper disclosure of private information, the statement said.\n\nLopez said ICE offered her two years of identity-theft protection and credit monitoring.\n\nIn truth, that does nothing for me, Lopez said.\n\nClaims of immigration fraud\n\nLopez said she became hopeful when Trump said he was creating the VOICE office.\n\nFor more a decade, she said she has tried unsuccessfully to get immigration authorities to investigate her ex-husband, Erik Niehof, a Dutch immigrant. He disputes her allegations accusing him of marriage fraud and domestic violence.\n\nLopez is also the creator of a website, immigrationfraud.com, which provides a forum for victims of marriage fraud.\n\nIn March, Lopez testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee during a hearing into marriage and fiancé visa fraud, describing how she was tricked by the love of my life into getting married.\n\nThen out of the blue, on the night of our second anniversary, he coldly announced we were divorcing. I assumed we were just having marriage problems, suggested counseling.\n\n\n\nHe flat out refused. And then came the cruelest words I've ever heard: … He said our marriage was nothing but a practicality so he could get a green card.\n\nLopez further testified that her ex-husband became violent after learning she had filed for separation and planned to withdraw her immigration sponsorship for his green card.\n\nHe tried to strangle me and threatened to kill me if I ever contacted immigration officials, she testified.\n\nShe also accused her husband of being involved in criminal activity in the Netherlands and claimed he never should have cleared Department of Homeland Security background checks and allowed into the United States.\n\n► Dec. 6:Illegal crossings at U.S.-Mexico border hit historic low\n\n► Nov. 30:Undocumented immigrant not guilty of murder in polarizing case\n\nAfter reporting the allegations to the VOICE hotline, she said she received a call from a caseworker who told her they could not do anything.\n\nThey concluded they couldn't get involved in order to protect his privacy rights, Lopez said, adding that the caseworker suggested she call a Department of Homeland Security tip line.\n\nReached in Pennsylvania, where he works selling cars at a luxury auto dealership, Niehof strongly disputed Lopez allegations. Now remarried, with a child, he accused Lopez of continuing to pursue false claims of marriage fraud and domestic violence against him and inventing stories about his nonexistent criminal past in the Netherlands out of vengeance after their marriage fell apart 16 years ago.\n\nBasically, this was just a marriage that ended up really bad, and, 'I am going to get back at you and I am going to do that through immigration service,'  Niehof said of Lopez. This is her vengeance.\n\nNiehof said originally he didn't want to move to the U.S. but agreed to apply for a visa and get married after his ex-wife visited him in the Netherlands when they were dating but didn't want to live there.\n\nHe said immigration authorities have sworn affidavits from mutual friends that their marriage was entered in good faith.\n\nHe also said immigration authorities have investigated Lopez's claims against him several times and concluded they were unfounded when he applied for permanent residency in 2002 and then to renew his green card 10 years later, pointing out that he was approved both times.\n\nIn 2016, Niehof said U.S. immigration officers briefly detained him upon returning from a vacation abroad with his family after his immigration record was flagged because of his ex-wife's allegations. While he waited, immigration officers looked into his record, then welcomed him back into the U.S., which he said would not have happened if any of her allegations were true.\n\nThat is probably why (immigration authorities) haven't made a case of this because there is no validity in any of it, he said. She is out for vengeance.\n\nRecords inadvertently released\n\nAmong the private information included in the database ICE released to The Republic was Niehof's personal immigration identification number, known as an A number, along with the name and address of the auto dealership where he works.\n\n• On July 31,The Republic filed a Freedom of Information Act request request for any and all criminal activity reported to the VOICE hotline.\n\n• On Sept. 8, in response, Immigration and Customs Enforcement provided a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet via email containing ICE call logs of 643 people who called the VOICE hotline.\n\n• On Oct. 4,The Republic received a clawback response letter from Erin Clifford, chief of ICE's government information law division, alerting the newspaper that records released contained personally identifiable information of third parties, law enforcement sensitive information, and potentially deliberative information.\n\nThe letter concluded by asking the newspaper to confirm that you have returned, destroyed or sequestered all copies of the record and to provide ICE with a list of any disclosures that have been made.\n\nConfusion over hotline's purpose\n\nA review of the call logs released shows that many people contacted the hotline to turn in acquaintances, spouses, relatives, neighbors, and business owners they suspected of being in the country illegally or of having committed crimes.\n\nHowever, ICE's webpage describing the purpose of the VOICE program explicitly states that the hotline is not to report crime. It directs callers to report crimes to local police or ICE's designated crime hotline.\n\nSummaries of the call logs that ICE released included names of crime victims, addresses, and phone numbers as well as names, addresses, places of employment, phone numbers and A-numbers of immigrants being accused of crimes or of being in the country illegally.\n\nFor example, one summary reads: Caller requested to report a possible illegal immigrant who may have an order of deportation. Caller stated the illegal immigrant abuses her children. Caller stated the illegal immigrant is his neighbor and she lives at (street address), Perth Amboy, NJ.\n\nAnother summary reads: Caller requested to report business who hires undocumented aliens. Caller claims there are approximately eight undocumented aliens at this farm located at: (street address), North Olmstead, Ohio. 44138.\n\nThe call logs also show the hotline has received numerous prank calls such as this one: Caller requested to report an alien outside his house and has green skin color.\n\nAnd this one: Caller identified himself as a victim. Caller then requested assistance reporting an illegal alien. Caller provided the name Gabba Tha Hut and address as 1600 Pennsylvania, Washington, D.C. That is the address of the White House.\n\nDoes program have ulterior motive?\n\nBier of the Cato Institute said he supports government efforts to provide more information about cases to crime victims as well as informing them of other services available.\n\nI was torn about the program in general when it was first announced because I honestly believe we treat victims in the United States of crimes very poorly, he said. We give them very little information about what's happening in the case. As a general rule, we as a society need to treat victims much better than we do now.\n\n► Nov. 23:MS-13 gang member arrested after murder victim stabbed over 100 times\n\n► Nov. 3:Islamic State claims responsibility for NYC terror attack without evidence\n\nBut the program's problems and its narrow focus only on victims of crimes committed by immigrants suggests the program has ulterior motives, he said.\n\nThe administration says the motive of the program is to provide more information to crime victims, Bier said. I think if that was the case, it would apply to all crime victims, not just crime victims of immigrants. So I think the motivation is the effort to portray unauthorized immigrants, and immigrants more generally, as a threat or a potential threat to Americans rather than to actually provide meaningful aid to victims of crimes.\n\n► Oct. 30:Man deported by ICE after helping Detroit cops\n\n► Oct. 28:No Social Security number? No electricity\n\nFor her part, Lopez said she now completely has lost faith in ICE after the agency declined to look into her case and then released private information she provided.\n\nThis is just one more example of how dysfunctional the Department of Homeland Security is, Lopez said.\n\nContributing: Ryan Santistevan and Agnel Philip, The Arizona Republic.

PROTECTING THE SHIELD: Read our investigative series\n\nPhilip Seidle hates being called a killer cop.\n\nThe former Neptune police sergeant spends his days mostly alone, locked in a maximum-security cell at New Jersey State Prison, the facility for the state's toughest inmates.\n\nIt is true I killed and I was a police officer, Seidle wrote in an online message to the Asbury Park Press following a November court hearing in which a headline termed him a killer cop.\n\nINTERACTIVE GRAPHIC: Scroll towards the end of the story to explore the chain of events between Seidle and police officers during the shooting.\n\nThat particular phrase chaffed him. The term is unnecessary, Seidle wrote. It feels a bit like an attempt to disparage me.\n\nOnce entrusted with a badge and a gun to protect the town he called home, Seidle, 53, is no longer trusted with a real pen.\n\nIn evenly spaced, all-capitalized letters, Seidle wrote his life story on 27 yellow sheets of legal-size paper after being contacted by the Press in the summer to discuss his crime. The prison allows him to write with a flex pen – a crude ink tube with a rudimentary ballpoint used by inmates. The floppy writing tool is designed to not become a weapon in lockup.\n\nI killed my wife, and the mother of my children, the most horrific thing, Seidle wrote. I destroyed my children's lives. What I did is absolutely unacceptable. I can't forgive myself, and don't hold out any hope they ever will.\n\nExclusively for Insiders: Philip Seidle's thoughts - Inside the mind of a killer cop\n\nSeidle also spoke exclusively to the Press through phone calls facilitated by his one-time mistress. They still tell each other I love you on the calls.\n\nSeidle said he doesn't remember fatally shooting his ex-wife, Tamara Wilson-Seidle on June 16, 2015, in the middle of an Asbury Park street, in front of their 7-year-old daughter.\n\nI just think I had a mental breakdown. I just – because of all the stress that I was under and the anger that I had, Seidle said. I just blacked out that day.\n\nSigns of domestic problems in the Seidle home were long known to Seidle's colleagues, his supervisors, his chief, neighboring police departments, and the Monmouth County Prosecutor's Office, documents and interviews show.\n\nSeidle's department grew concerned enough to confiscate his service weapon in 2012 and again in 2014. His .40-caliber Glock, though, was returned to him. It was the weapon he used to gun down Tamara.\n\nIn his 22-year career, Seidle was the subject of 26 internal affairs reports conducted before the shooting.\n\nHis secret internal affairs file tops 600 pages.\n\nThe Press is suing Neptune to make the file public. A judge could decide the matter next month.\n\nWhat is known is that police responded to at least nine domestic incidents between the Seidles and 10 custody disputes – with police providing an escort during at least one custody confrontation.\n\nSeidle shared his psychologist's notes that detail the emotional devastation he said he felt during the custody battle with his ex-wife. Both Seidle and his ex-wife filed for domestic violence restraining orders, alleging past abuse.\n\nThis is a story about the two Phil Seidles.\n\nIn the community, Seidle was known as an upstanding officer – respected by citizens, looked up to by colleagues, a loving father of nine.\n\nBut beneath that public persona, Seidle's stress and frustration were no secret to his colleagues and supervisors. Both he and his ex-wife made claims of domestic violence.\n\nSeidle denied claims that he abused his ex-wife.\n\nTamara did not become a victim until I killed her that day, he wrote.\n\nThe Seidles' multiple domestic disputes were handled by authorities as isolated incidents, not looked at as a continuing pattern, public police records show.\n\nThe domestic issues caused Seidle to be suspended from his department at least twice and disarmed at least once, records show. Seidle said he was also disarmed a second time. He was sent by his department for psychological review at least three times.\n\nYet Seidle returned to duty, armed and frustrated.\n\nTamara's death at age 51 left their nine children without parents, prompted a multimillion-dollar legal claim by the kids and tainted the careers of two responding officers.\n\nBorn in Munich, West Germany, Tamara Wilson-Seidle often reminisced about milking cows and wearing traditional dirndl dresses as a child, her obituary said. She was a cheerleader and Neptune High School homecoming queen in 1982. She coached soccer. She was a devout Catholic, serving as director of religious education for the Mother of Mercy Parish.\n\nWhen Seidle was sentenced to 30 years in prison after pleading guilty to aggravated manslaughter, their eldest daughter described Tamara as the soul and the light of their family.\n\nHer killing shocked those in the community who knew Seidle as a police officer, a father of a large family, a teacher of Catholic faith and a kids' soccer coach.\n\nMonmouth County Prosecutor Chris Gramiccioni said the killing couldn't have been anticipated. He issued a report he touted as comprehensive and extensive. But that report excluded the Seidle divorce and police escorts during their custody dispute, a conflict that drove Seidle to kill.\n\nSeidle said he began to unravel during Tamara's pursuit of child custody, which he felt rose to criminal interference. The day he killed her, he shouted about his kids as he stood in the street with his pistol to his head.\n\nI'm tired of it! I'm tired of it! I got nine f------ kids she stole from me! Seidle ranted, all of it picked up on a police dash camera recording.\n\nSeidle said he was devastated by his fraying relationship with his children and the warming relationship between Tamara's new boyfriend and the Seidle children.\n\nAfter two years of fighting for your children, they don't want to be with you, Seidle wrote in an online message. You continue trying, but nothing works. Everyone acknowledges you're legally within your right to get them back, but nothing gets done. Then after 3 1/2 years of crying and wanting just to be a part of your children's lives, to talk to them, to see them, to know what's going on in their lives, to go to church, and do the things you used to. Then one day you find out they've been given away to someone else. Perhaps you take it lightly? Maybe you think I'm exaggerating? I'm not.\n\nYou tell me Mr. Ford. Tell me that isn't enough to bring someone to violence? I'm not saying it's right! I'm saying nothing stirs violence like a child. That's all I'm saying. I want this narrative of me being inherently violent to stop. Period. I want this idea that I was the one who needed to be stopped to cease. Tamara should have been stopped! Period. All I wanted was to share in my children's lives. If I had been allowed to, I'd have been fine. It was my right under every law on this earth, and I shouldn't have had to wait until she felt like abiding by the law.\n\nSeidle said he struggled to deal with stress at home. He said he should have been on medication, maybe an antidepressant or antianxiety drug. He should have moved away from the situation with his ex-wife.\n\nSeidle's chief acknowledged investigations uncovered major problems with Seidle, according to a court document.\n\nOne police internal affairs expert said the repetitive domestic tensions between the Seidles should have sent warning signs to his supervisors.\n\nBetween the work issues and the domestic violence complaints and the 911 calls to his house, someone, someone has to take the responsibility and tying all that together and saying there's a significant concern, said Michael D'Angelo, a retired police captain who served 23 years in South Miami Police Department, including performing internal affairs duties, and now works as a consultant on civil cases involving police.\n\nMore than three years before the shooting, Tamara filed for a domestic violence civil complaint and restraining order, court documents provided by Seidle show. She claimed Seidle put a gun to her cheek, gave her a black eye and kicked her stomach while pregnant. Seidle said in an interview those allegations were false. Tamara's quest for a restraining order was denied.\n\nThree years before the shooting, ongoing domestic incidents were discussed by a lieutenant in Neptune and a sergeant in Tinton Falls when they handled a confrontation between the Seidles, according to a police report. Higher ranking officers in both departments were notified of the incident.\n\nLess than a year before the shooting, Seidle tried to retire from the force in a fit of frustration over friction with his ex-wife and his deteriorating relationship with his children. He handed in his badge and gun. But Seidle said his colleagues encouraged him to return. He was put back on the job and rearmed.\n\nLess than four months before the shooting, Seidle filed for a domestic violence civil complaint and restraining order of his own. He claimed in court documents that Tamara once threatened to kill him after he declined to have sex with her, she once threw items around their house, she involved the police in personal matters to embarrass him and in the past poked him in the chest and face, pushed him and slapped him. His restraining order wasn't granted either.\n\nTwo months before the shooting, Seidle filed a criminal complaint alleging that Tamara violated a judge's custody order by preventing Seidle's visits and phone calls, the court document shows.\n\nSix days before the shooting, a letter shows Bradley Beach Municipal Court Judge Richard B. Thompson found no probable cause for Seidle's criminal complaint, saying the issue was a civil matter.\n\nThen on the morning of June 16, 2015, Seidle learned Tamara's new boyfriend had been spending time alone with the Seidle children.\n\nSeidle said he doesn't remember chasing Tamara's car through the streets of Asbury Park with his 7-year-old daughter in his passenger seat. He doesn't remember running Tamara's car off the road in front of bewildered residents. He doesn't remember firing 13 rounds at close range in two volleys two minutes apart.\n\nHe does remember confronting his ex-wife in a church parking lot.\n\nThen he remembers staring at her limp foot hanging through the shattered glass of her car window.\n\nI realized I had shot her, Seidle said.\n\nSeidle was born to unmarried parents in April 1964 in Philadelphia.\n\nHe wrote that he felt his father abandoned the family.\n\nAfter high school, I didn't believe myself to be disciplined enough to go to college. Wanting to travel, I enlisted in the U.S. Navy in July of 1982 at 18, he wrote.\n\nI met Tamara in Oct. of '89 through a mutual friend of ours, with whom I'd been stationed with onboard both (U.S.S) Nitro and the Philly commissary. We talked on the phone for several months and began dating in February of 1990. She became pregnant in April 1990…\n\nThey were both 26. They married in August 1990, in St. Peter Claver Church in Asbury Park, court documents show. That's about half a mile from where Seidle shot Tamara.\n\nSeidle was honorably discharged from the Navy and hired by Neptune Township Police Department in July 1993.\n\nWithin a year of his hire, the department knew about Seidle's trouble at home. In March 1994, Seidle called Neptune police after Tamara allegedly threw a chair at him, according to a prosecutor's office report. But then, as it would happen several more times in the future, neither Seidle nor Tamara filed a criminal complaint.\n\nYou know, there were a lot of problems, Seidle said in a prison phone call. But we didn't believe in divorce and so we stayed together.\n\nBound by Catholic doctrine, the Seidle marriage was a cycle of faith, sin and reconciliation. For decades, there were showdowns documented by police and later in court between the Seidles, with each making allegations of domestic violence against the other.\n\nInternal affairs expert D'Angelo reviewed the special report on the Seidle shooting issued by Prosecutor Gramiccioni in 2016, a year after the shooting.\n\nSomewhere in here, there just reads of a complete – I don't know if it was a conscious decision – but just a complete disregard for her well-being, D'Angelo said. You investigated your officer several times. If you think that your obligation has ended when you complete that investigation and dish out whatever punishment that the higher ups have deemed fair to him, I mean, when there's domestic violence, the department knows that their obligation hasn't ended.\n\nEven Seidle acknowledged the repeated calls should have warranted further scrutiny, though he contends that his ex-wife was lying to the police.\n\nThe thing is that after all these complaints someone should have stepped in and done some kind of investigation and said: what is going on here? He said. Why is she constantly calling the police? Why does she continue to call the police for these matters?\n\nGramiccioni's report underscores a failing in New Jersey police policy.\n\nThis review and analysis disclosed a critical flaw in the domestic violence policies and procedures that currently exist statewide, the report stated. The report also raised concern with officers who are the subject of numerous internal affairs complaints.\n\nGramiccioni has since established an early warning system in which Monmouth County departments are required to report to the prosecutor's office if an officer meets criteria like being involved in a domestic violence incident.\n\nGramiccioni's report was produced by his office after the New Jersey Attorney General's office found no conflict of interest with the prosecutor's office investigating. The report largely absolves those who oversaw Seidle, including the prosecutor's office.\n\nWhile the law enforcement response to this matter had its flaws in some regard, none of them caused the death of Tamara Seidle. Philip Seidle did, Gramiccioni said at his 2016 press conference. With hindsight being 20/20, the unfortunate reality is that no alternative or additional police action that could have prevented Seidle from brutally killing Tamara Seidle on that fateful day in Asbury Park. It's simply a crime of passion that could not be anticipated.\n\nSeidle wrote from prison that Gramiccioni was protecting his office from legal liability.\n\nThat declaration was for the civil suit, Seidle wrote. And basically, their investigation covered all of the allegations made by my children in the suit. They cleared themselves in a case where they are my co-defendants. I think there's something wrong with that, and cannot understand why the Attorney General's Office allowed it.\n\nIn an interview, the prosecutor's office limited its comments on Seidle, pointing to the children's lawsuit.\n\nMany people surrounding the Seidles didn't respond or declined to comment, including the attorney representing the Seidle children in the lawsuit, the Seidles' priest, the Catholic Diocese of Trenton, the Seidles' divorce attorneys, the Neptune police chief, and former police director.\n\nDespite trouble at home, Seidle worked his way up the police ranks eventually earning $140,000 a year as a sergeant. He was the breadwinner, providing his family with a 2,286-square-foot home with a large yard on a quiet cul-de-sac in a recently-developed subdivision.\n\nI had a few bumps the first couple years, he wrote of his career. I had a number of car accidents (minor), and fell and cut my eye open. I studied on and off the job hard to learn the law, and how to survive on the streets as a proactive officer. I earned a reputation for being very knowledgeable in the law, and for making good arrests.\n\nSeidle worked in patrol, later as a detective and as a sergeant. He was credited for police work in Asbury Park Press stories. He helped make arrests in a car theft ring in 1995, he was among officers who booked several people after a shooting in 1997. While patrolling in an unmarked car in 1998, he arrested a man who tried to sell him cocaine. He received a commendation from the 200 Club of Monmouth County – an organization that supports the police – in 2007 for his role as a detective on the department's quality of life team.\n\nHe provided letters of support citizens wrote on his behalf.\n\nIn the last week I had occasion to be in touch with your Patrolman Philip Seidel (sic) on three occasions and I wanted to let you know that I found him to show good judgment and professionalism on each occasion, Ruth E. Buck, proprietor of The Shelburne Hotel, wrote in June 1994.\n\nSeidle wrote often about his children. He was there for each of the nine births, he wrote. He coached sports, chaperoned class trips and attended their parent-teacher conferences and religious sacraments. Seidle's younger half-brother provided photos of Seidle with his kids at a wrestling match, a soccer game, in an ice cream shop.\n\nThere were many good times, Seidle wrote. To most people on the outside, we had the perfect family, because we were always together. We did everything as a family…But the marriage was dysfunctional.\n\nAnd his department knew about that dysfunction.\n\nIn 2001, police responded to a screaming match that escalated to Tamara pushing Seidle, according to the prosecutor's report.\n\nProblems persisted, and worsened, Seidle wrote.\n\nTamara stopped working to stay home with the kids after their sixth child was born, Seidle wrote. She nearly died during the birth of their seventh child and underwent a gall bladder surgery in 2002, Seidle wrote. She lost her mother and father within a year.\n\nShe shut down and stopped tending to her responsibilities, Seidle wrote.\n\nTheir problems deepened, but still they stuck it out.\n\nI grew impatient over the next couple years, and in the later part of 2004, I had an extramarital affair, Seidle wrote. It lasted three months. I ended it because I knew it was wrong, and did not want to continue to mislead my wife, and commit adultery.\n\nSeidle wrote that he believed Tamara also had an affair.\n\nThey went to marital counseling.\n\nSeidle considered a separation in 2006, he wrote, but Tamara was opposed to it. Neptune police came to their home in March that year for a verbal dispute, according to the prosecutor's report.\n\nBy April 2010, I'd decided to leave, Seidle wrote. I had told myself I would stay for the kids, and being a Catholic, divorce was frowned upon. I was making an effort to live my faith. But I reached the point I resented being around her, and even living in my home.\n\nHe planned to leave in January 2011, wanting not to spoil the holidays. But in October 2010, Tamara told him she had breast cancer.\n\nSeidle helped Tamara with her treatment, feeding her, helping her in and out of bed, to the toilet and shower, taking her to surgeries and chemotherapy and radiation treatments, he wrote. Seidle was photographed standing with his family for the high school graduation of their eldest son, with Tamara wearing a head covering consistent with the hair loss that comes with cancer treatment.\n\nBut after an ordeal that might draw couples closer together, the Seidles grew further apart.\n\nAnd then came more calls to the police.\n\nSeidle began seeing Gloria Patricia Chavarriaga. A divorce document filed on Tamara's behalf claimed this happened during her cancer treatment, which ended in June 2011.\n\nChavarriaga told Tinton Falls police she suspected Tamara once flattened four tires on Chavarriaga's car because of who Chavarriaga was dating, according to a December 2011 report. But Tamara denied it and Chavarriaga later told police she wasn't sure who caused the damage.\n\nSeidle met Chavarriaga through church. Chavarriaga, 54, knew Seidle for years professionally before they were involved romantically, she told a reporter. She was a single parent and Seidle helped with her daughters. She admired the way Seidle loved his children.\n\nThey walk straight, Chavarriaga said of the children. They are good kids. That says a lot when children behave because obviously, someone is teaching them the right thing.\n\nSeidle mentored Chavarriaga's daughter, Samantha Rittman, who is now 24 and living in Virginia Beach.\n\nSeidle was stern with Rittman when she got in trouble as a teenager, Rittman recalled. He was supportive of Rittman when she struggled later in life following the birth of her first son.\n\nHe never turned his back on me, she said. Ever.\n\nShe recalled that Seidle was distressed about not being with his children.\n\nHe was constantly a mess over his kids, Rittman said. That's one thing, he always tried to be there for his kids.\n\nRittman never expected violence from Seidle, she said. Seidle didn't seem like that kind of person.\n\nI was angry for a while, I was really angry, she said. Angry because Seidle hurt Chavarriaga. He made Chavarriaga happy and Rittman thought they'd have a future together.\n\nI just feel like what he did was selfish, she said.\n\nSeidle left Tamara in January 2012, he wrote.\n\nPrior to doing so, I took the six oldest (children) and spoke to them, telling them I was leaving because I was unhappy, and that their mom and I were not getting along, he wrote. I did nothing to embarrass either of us, and wanted to do nothing to make the children feel responsible, or be in the middle.\n\nThen there were two reports of domestic incidents involving Seidle in January and February that year, according to the prosecutor's report. Tinton Falls police responded to a confrontation between Seidle and one of Chavarriaga's daughters, according to the prosecutor's report. Seidle provided the Press with a letter showing the girl recanting her statement to police that Seidle put his hands on her.\n\nSix days later, Neptune Township police responded to a confrontation at the Seidle home. Seidle said he showed up to get a training document, the prosecutor's report shows the couple got into an argument. When police arrived, Tamara made allegations of past abuse similar to claims she would make when she filed for divorce and for a restraining order. Seidle said these were lies.\n\nSeidle said Tamara wanted to get back at him.\n\nShe wanted revenge for me leaving, he wrote. She knew there were two things important to me… my children and my reputation. She wanted to take away both of those things to hurt me the way I had hurt her by leaving.\n\nSeidle was suspended for two days in February 2012 because his department felt he interfered with the police response. Seidle said he was trying to make sure proper protocol was followed. Seidle was sent to a police psychologist. Seidle was deemed unfit for duty.\n\nSeidle said he told the doctor that I was extremely upset by Tamara's lies, and did not want to be at work during this time, as I would have trouble focusing.\n\nHe wrote that he was found unfit because he asked to be. His unfitness was not on any finding of psychological dysfunction, or disorder, Seidle said.\n\nHe remained off duty until May 2012.\n\nI was ordered by my chief to 'stay away' from Tammy for my 'own good,' he wrote of his return to work. Then-police Chief Robert Adams could not be reached for comment.\n\nTamara filed for divorce in June 2013, claiming abuse. Seidle denied those claims in court and interviews.\n\nTamara's allegations were made in publicly available documents that were later obtained by the Press, but the Monmouth County Prosecutor's Office ignored them in its final report.\n\nAllegations made by Philip and Tamara Seidle in the context of their divorce or any other civil actions were not a part of this analysis, as those fall outside the purview of any law enforcement agency and cannot be verified, the prosecutor's report stated.\n\nTamara sought sole custody of the children. At the time, six were younger than 18. Seidle was ordered in October 2013 to pay $3,000 in alimony and $2,606 in child support each month, based on earnings in 2012 worth $11,930 before taxes, according to a court document.\n\nSeidle said the fight over child custody hurt him deeply.\n\nI couldn't cope, he wrote. I couldn't sleep, I couldn't concentrate. I suffered from depression, anger, anxiety, high blood pressure. I was a mess. My emotional well-being spiraled out of control.\n\nPolice reports show Neptune officers acted as escorts for two incidents involving the Seidles, including a custody dispute. Both Seidles and the Seidle children made note in publicly available legal filings of the practice of officers making escorts.\n\nBut Gramiccioni's report made no mention of police escorts and set aside the calls for custody disputes, saying they do not constitute incidents of domestic violence.\n\nSeidle explained how the fight over the children led to the ultimate tragedy.\n\nIt went wrong from day one, from the minute she was allowed to keep the children away from me, Seidle said. That's where it went wrong. It was just a continuum. There was a buildup and a buildup and a buildup… I love my children, my children were everything to me, they were my life. More than anything in the world I cared about my children and it was important for me to be a father to them. I wanted to be the father that I never had.\n\nSeidle provided notes from a psychologist, Raymond Hanbury, who counseled Seidle and documented his struggle starting in 2012, after he was found unfit for duty by a department psychologist. Hanbury didn't respond to calls seeking comment.\n\nHe does get emotional when he talks about his lack of contact with the children because Tammy makes it difficult, Hanbury wrote in an entry dated March 28, 2012.\n\nHanbury wrote in May 2014 that Seidle's issues with Tamara, the children and the divorce appeared to be affecting the officer's performance at work. Hanbury shared findings with another psychologist, who worked for Seidle's department, according to legal testimony from current Neptune Police Chief James Hunt.\n\nSeidle was very emotional and tearful when he was talking about his relationship with the children, Hanbury wrote in November 2014.\n\nDivorce is finalized, Hanbury wrote in an entry two weeks before the killing. However, he was upset with Tammy because she reportedly threw his personal items out. They include Navy papers, training certificates and personal items that meant something to him.\n\n\n\n'But they're gone,' the psychologist wrote, apparently quoting Seidle. 'I need to focus on the children.'\n\n\n\nIn an undated final entry, Hanbury wrote: On June 16, Phil shot his ex-wife, fatal, and was arrested. There were no indications or signs of something like this to happen. He denied in sessions that he would do anything to jeopardize his being with the children, especially the younger ones.\n\nSeidle dismissed the effectiveness of the therapy.\n\nSending me to counseling was stitching up a wound week to week, to have her rip it open every time, Seidle wrote. I would go to counseling to talk about what she did, and how it upset me, to leave the sessions and have her do the same thing through to the next session. So where was the healing to take place? Tell me? Every day I missed being a part of my children's lives was a day neither her, nor anyone else could give me back. There was no amount of money, or anything else she could compensate me with for the loss of that time. Missing my son's first communion, because she couldn't have the courtesy to tell me, because she couldn't swallow her gall, couldn't ever be gotten back. Having people constantly tell me about events my children participated in, that I missed simply for her inability to be civil, or of accomplishments they had, that she wouldn't tell me about for her spite, couldn't in a lifetime be made up for. My children would never be able to say, 'my dad was always there.' Not because I left, but for her malice.\n\nThe dispute over child custody led to more police calls to the Seidle home, departmental discipline for Seidle and rising tension between the Seidles.\n\nIf they say that when you find out someone's cheating on you – your husband or your wife is cheating on you, you can be driven to violence – you can't be driven to violence when your children are taken away from you and kept away from you until the point where finally, one day, you just snap? Seidle asked. Doesn't matter whether I was a cop or not, any man would have done the same thing, would have felt the same way.\n\nLocal law enforcement – from fellow officers to the prosecutor's office – were long aware of problems in the Seidle household.\n\nSeidle said his colleagues knew of his troubles.\n\nCapt. Lawrence Fisher was there for me in every way during this whole ordeal, Seidle said. He saw me crying and things that went on with me emotionally when nobody else was around. Fisher could not be reached for comment\n\nSeidle said department supervisors knew of his problems.\n\nThe line supervisors, they were all aware, Seidle said. They knew what was going on, they knew that there were problems…you know there were times that I came to work late. I reported late because I had to be, I was in court. I had to be in court. And then just all the police reports that I made. And I spoke to them constantly.\n\nOver a period of two years, my performance suffered, and I received poor evaluations for what was described as poor decision making (lack of focus). On the evaluations they repeatedly indicated I was an outstanding officer with a good reputation, but my performance was suffering due to personal problems.\n\nSeidle's chief knew.\n\nPolice Chief Hunt took over in September 2014 from Chief Adams, who retired.\n\nIn legal testimony, Hunt said he became aware of Seidle's issues before the shooting.\n\nHe didn't disclose in depth that he was having – it was kind of everyone knew he was having problems, Hunt said. He was close to certain officers in the police department, but he didn't come to me and say hey, Chief, I am having major league problems.\n\nHunt said in the deposition: Just through our investigations into this and internal affair investigation is where we learned what the major problems were.\n\nHunt described three issues with Seidle at work: one in which he screwed up with evidence, one in which he screwed up the readings on a breathalyzer test, causing the department to dismiss a DWI case, and the incident in which he argued with township police officers who responded to a custody dispute between him and Tamara.\n\nFor those issues, Seidle agreed that he would take a 30-day suspension, Hunt said in the deposition, spreading that time off over one week per month for six months. Seidle agreed that he'd keep seeing his psychologist and that his psychologist would report back to a township doctor.\n\nThe prosecutor's report acknowledged the incident in which Seidle argued with officers, and his suspension, but didn't mention the issue Seidle had with evidence or the botched DWI case.\n\nPunitive measures like suspensions and disarmament compounded the stress he was under, Seidle said. The punishments hindered his ability to pay child support, alimony and his own bills because suspensions cut his six-figure pay, he said. He said he leaned on Capt. Fisher for sympathy and, at one point, to pay the rent.\n\nHis department's reactions didn't address the real problem, he said from prison – stress related to his troubled access to his children.\n\n\n\nThe chief thought the answer was to punish me, Seidle said. You know, if I forgot to do something or he saw me under stress – and he knew why – but his answer was: punish Phil and then that's going to make him, you know, somehow magically not, or make me perform or do better; when the problem wasn't with me not wanting to do it or not being able to, it was the fact that I was under stress and I was just having trouble coping. Having trouble with what was going on in my personal life. And he knew that, he knew that.\n\nIn one incident about 11 months before the shooting, Seidle approached two of his children at their job at a snack stand on the Ocean Grove boardwalk. He said one of his daughters hadn't been returning his calls. He told the Press that he told the 16-year-old he wanted her to call him, and if she didn't there would be consequences.\n\nThe teen's employer called police, according to the prosecutor's office report. Police interviewed the children, who said they didn't want a relationship with Seidle, according to the report.\n\nSeidle said he was called into Hunt's office to talk about the incident and that the chief told Seidle his daughter accused Seidle of harassing her at her job. Seidle felt the kids had been put up to this by Tamara.\n\nSeidle became frustrated.\n\nI'm tired of being intimidated and threatened by my wife every time we have a disagreement or something goes on between the kids, he recalled telling the chief.\n\nSo, he said he was retiring.\n\nI gave him my badge and my gun and I told him: 'that's it, I'm going to resign because I'm just fed up,' Seidle said.\n\nAfterward, he said he talked to two colleagues, Capt. Fisher and Sgt. J. Hunter Ellison. Ellison also couldn't be reached for comment. Fisher would later respond to the scene the day Seidle shot Tamara.\n\n…They all tried to convince me not to leave, they told me it wasn't a good idea, Seidle said.\n\nSeidle was cleared by a psychologist after an evaluation in August 2014.\n\nHe returned and the department gave him back his .40 Glock.\n\nTrouble spread beyond Neptune.\n\nIn Tinton Falls one night in 2012, Tamara admitted she had been drinking and followed Seidle to the gym because she thought he was headed to see his mistress. Seidle called the police, she left by the time they arrived and Seidle declined to file a complaint.\n\nThe responding Tinton Falls officer contacted Sgt. Doug McEntegart. McEntegart spoke by phone with a Neptune Township lieutenant, a police report shows.\n\nHe informed me that there has been ongoing domestic incidents with the Seidles, and after a brief discussion on that, I assured the lieutenant that a report for harassment would be written documenting the incident, McEntegart wrote.\n\nBoth McEntegart and the Neptune lieutenant notified higher-ranking officers. McEntegart also briefed an assistant Monmouth County prosecutor. In an interview, First Assistant Prosecutor Lori Linskey said this was a police officer asking for legal advice, which doesn't mean a case was opened by the prosecutor's office.\n\nIn Asbury Park the year before the shooting, Seidle said he and Tamara got into a custody dispute at Our Lady of Mount Carmel, a church and school where Seidle would later confront Tamara the day she died.\n\nThe argument prompted an Asbury Park police response, according to Seidle. He provided a copy of a report showing a custody dispute at the school on the date Seidle claimed it happened, though the report doesn't name who was involved in the dispute. The city denied having access to the document.\n\nThe next day, Seidle filed for a domestic violence civil complaint and temporary restraining order, detailing the custody dispute and alleging past abuse by Tamara.\n\nAt least three times, the Seidle drama reached as high as the Monmouth County Prosecutor's Office, the top law-enforcement agency in the county.\n\nIn addition to being notified about the Tinton Falls incident, the prosecutor's office was notified of the 2012 argument at the Seidle home in which Tamara alleged past abuse and they signed off when Seidle was later rearmed.\n\nThe prosecutor's office was notified of a 2014 incident in which Tamara reported to police that Seidle was harassing her, then Seidle began screaming profanities at the officers who responded, according to the prosecutor's report.\n\nTheir report shows Seidle wasn't disarmed after this incident. Seidle told the Press that his gun was taken away again around this time.\n\nNeptune township officials refuse to release documents showing what they knew about Seidle's problems and when they knew it.\n\nThe township denied the Press access to the 682-page internal affairs report on Seidle on the grounds that it was a confidential employee record. Seidle's internal affairs history was not released in Gramiccioni's report.\n\nThe Press sued, saying the public deserves to see the documents to examine how Seidle's case was handled by police in the years leading up to the shooting.\n\nIn a Nov. 3 hearing, Monmouth County Assignment Judge Lisa P. Thornton remarked on the number of internal affairs incidents.\n\nAs a lay person, it seems to me like an excessive amount, she said.\n\nWhile his IA file remains secret, documents did emerge publicly showing two citizens complained in 2004 that Seidle used excessive force during arrests, according to documents attached to a lawsuit alleging excessive force during a 2015 arrest. That lawsuit was dismissed by a federal judge and Seidle was cleared by his department in the 2015 incident.\n\nOne complaint in 2004 claims Seidle threw a man on top of the police cruiser then punched him in the jaw and kicked him in the ribs. The second claims he hit a man on a bicycle with his police car then kneed and kicked him. The official outcomes of those complaints remain obscured by Neptune's denial of records. These complaints aren't mentioned in Gramiccioni's report.\n\nI never, you know, was written up or had any incidents where I abused my authority or where I used excessive force against someone, Seidle said generally about his discipline. I never was punished for anything like that.\n\n\n\nA reporter sought official copies of documents provided by Seidle and his half-brother, though many were denied by the government.\n\nIn addition to denying the hundreds of pages of Seidle's internal affairs history, Neptune also denied access to 15 police reports naming Seidle, including 11 which also name Tamara, saying they are criminal investigatory reports. The purported criminal investigations were dated within the last four years of Seidle's career. Seven of the police reports correspond with short incident reports the township did provide which indicate the obscured documents relate to custody disputes.\n\nSeidle insists he didn't plan to kill his ex-wife.\n\nThe morning of June 16, 2015, Seidle said he drove past the family's house. He had a few hours before he had to report to duty that day and he was going to take his girl to buy a dress for a father-daughter dance on Father's Day.\n\nHe was supposed to pick up their youngest daughter at the family home on Heritage Court but she didn't come outside. Tamara was already at work.\n\n\n\nA congratulations banner was still over the door. The family threw a party the weekend before for two of the eldest children. They were the first in Seidle's lineage to graduate from college.\n\nSeidle, though, was suspicious of a car with Georgia plates in the driveway. He jotted down the license plate number. He assumed it was her boyfriend.\n\nHe called Tamara.\n\nWhose car is that in the driveway? He asked.\n\nNone of your business, he recalled Tamara saying.\n\nIt is my business. If this guy is living there, that's a problem, Seidle said.\n\nHe said she wasn't supposed to have someone living there if he's paying alimony. And he was concerned about another man around their children.\n\nSeidle's eldest daughter dropped his youngest daughter off at his home on Walnut Street in Neptune. Seidle deduced that a man had been spending time with Tamara and the children. The kids had mentioned his last name before, his parents spent time with the kids. He was at the graduation party.\n\nThen all of this started just hitting me, Seidle said. That was where the emotion started spiraling out of control.\n\n\n\nSeidle left his home with his 7-year-old daughter and his gun belt. The off-duty 6-foot-4, 230-pound police sergeant was dressed in a peach polo shirt, navy shorts and brown sandals on the sunny day. He wore a Bluetooth earpiece.\n\nHe called Tamara as he was walking out of his home.\n\nIs this guy living there? He asked.\n\nShe was busy and couldn't talk, Seidle recalled.\n\nIf he's living there, there's going to be a f------ problem, Seidle said.\n\nI've got to go, Tamara replied, he said. She told Seidle that one of their children would have a father with or without you.\n\nSeidle was shocked and hung up the phone.\n\nTamara told her boyfriend and her eldest daughter that Seidle threatened to kill her, according to grand jury testimony Seidle provided to the Press.\n\n\n\nSeidle said he drove up Route 18 in his silver Honda Pilot, heading toward Monmouth Mall.\n\nHe spoke to his daughter, who confirmed Tamara's boyfriend had been staying at the house for two weeks.\n\nSeidle slid into an emotional tailspin because her boyfriend was being left alone with Seidle's kids, taking over the role of the father, Seidle said.\n\nSeidle thought he would never get his kids back.\n\nI believed she was jeopardizing my children's safety, as well as my ability to repair my relationship with them, he wrote.\n\nHe said he called Tamara several times.\n\nShe texted him back: What do you want.\n\nSeidle cut off the highway at Route 66 and drove to the church.\n\nShe didn't answer the phone, Seidle said. I said 'OK, well if she won't answer the phone I'm gonna go to the job and I'll talk to her and get her to talk to me and see what's going on.'\n\nHe said he didn't expect to find her in the parking lot. When he saw her there, he thought they would talk, but she pulled away in her car.\n\nEverything just went downhill from there, Seidle said. I just blacked out. Spiraled. My emotions were – I just got overloaded with the emotions.\n\nSeidle said he doesn't remember what happened next.\n\nJust emotionally it all just piled up on me, he said. And I just broke down and just, I don't know, just flew off the handle and just lost my mind.\n\nHe chased her west on First Avenue, south on Central and west on Asbury Avenue, grand jury testimony shows. His car struck her car near Jimmy's Restaurant, knocking off the front license plate of Seidle's SUV.\n\nThree people lingered on their home porch on Sewall Avenue in Asbury Park. A worker ate a sandwich in his nearby car. An employee at a plumbing supply company down the street retrieved tools from a truck.\n\nResponding to a fender bender on the corner, Asbury Park Patrol Officer Ahmed Lawson followed the routine procedures, asking for driver's license, insurance and registration.\n\nThen a car horn, screeching tires. The two Seidle cars tore around the corner of Ridge Avenue, nearly hitting Lawson as he jumped out of the way.\n\n\n\nSeidle's SUV smashed into the rear of Tamara's black sedan, ramming it into another parked car.\n\nOnce he exited the vehicle, he began shooting, Lawson told investigators.\n\n\n\nThe camera on Lawson's patrol car recorded the sounds of the shooting. Eight shots can be heard in the video in quick succession, then a ninth shot.\n\nLawson can be seen in video ducking behind his patrol car, away from Seidle.\n\nProsecutor Gramiccioni said Lawson was too far away to effectively shoot Seidle.\n\nLawson recognized him. He begged for Seidle to drop his weapon.\n\nHey Phil! Drop that gun Phil! Lawson yelled before ducking back behind his patrol car.\n\nSeidle's voice can be heard on the video.\n\nNow what!? Seidle shouts.\n\nLawson gave the location over the radio, shouting for backup, noting that Seidle had the gun to his head and that he was a sergeant from Neptune. Seidle's daughter ran to responding officers and Asbury Park police Capt. Marshawn Love. Love had been their neighbor for more than a decade and recognized the cars as belonging to the Seidles. He drove Seidle's daughter away from the scene.\n\nSeidle fired another volley of four shots through the front window two minutes after the first.\n\nHe fired all but one round in the magazine of his Glock.\n\nWith his left hand, Seidle held the gun to his head. For about 45 minutes, officers held their fire, trying to coax Seidle into surrendering. He shouted profanity, furious about being kept apart from his nine children.\n\nWith his right hand, he typed a text message to the children:\n\nYour mother is dead because of her actions…\n\nGoodbye forever.\n\nNearly 70 officers from four agencies surrounded Seidle within minutes.\n\nOfficers begged Seidle to put the gun down, many calling to him by his first name.\n\nA Monmouth County prosecutor's detective, Asbury Park Detective Lt. David DeSane and another officer removed Tamara from her car, the grand jury testimony shows.\n\nShe was pronounced dead minutes later at Jersey Shore University Medical Center.\n\nNeptune Capt. Fisher pleaded with Seidle to drop his gun, the grand jury testimony shows. Fisher had worked with Seidle for years. Seidle said Fisher had seen him cry.\n\nHim and I were very close over the years, Seidle said. And I wanted to kill myself. But at that moment I just felt like I couldn't do it because him and I were very close and I didn't want to leave him with that memory.\n\nYou owe me that much, Seidle recalled Fisher saying at the scene.\n\nOfficers told Seidle if he dropped the gun he would get to see his kids.\n\nDeSane left the scene to get Seidle's kids, sending a photo of them to another detective who remained at the scene. That detective slid his phone to Seidle.\n\nThey said they'd take his kids to a prosecutor's satellite office in Asbury Park. Ten minutes later, they showed him another photo of the children.\n\nSeidle lowered his gun. He placed it on the ground.\n\nSeidle and Fisher embraced.\n\nWhen it was all over, I just felt like falling out, like collapsing, Seidle said. And I remember when he came, when he came into the street I just, I don't know, I fell into his arms.\n\nSeidle was taken to the prosecutor's outpost in Asbury Park and escorted into a conference room, grand jury testimony shows.\n\nThe prosecutor's detective explained that he would let Seidle speak to the children, but Seidle couldn't mention what he did to their mother.\n\nSeidle agreed.\n\nHe was placed in a chair and given a bottle of water. They led his children into the room in two groups.\n\nFor years, Seidle had fought in court to get more time with his kids. The custody disputes with Tamara derailed his career. The thought that another man was moving into their lives triggered a breakdown.\n\nSeidle had wanted to be the father figure he never had.\n\nBut there he was, arrested on a murder charge the week of Father's Day.\n\nSeidle and the children exchanged few words.\n\nI just told them that I love them and that I only wanted to have a relationship with them and that I was sorry, he said.\n\nThen he was led away to jail.\n\nThat was their last conversation.\n\nSeidle was taken to the Monmouth County Jail a few miles away in Freehold. His clothing, his photograph and his fingerprints were taken. It was a process the veteran cop had performed on detainees many times, but now Seidle was on the other side. Besides training at the police academy, he said that was the only day he had been in handcuffs.\n\nAll of it was unbelievable, he said.\n\nAs reality sank in for Seidle in his cell, shock and outrage radiated from Sewall Avenue, making headlines across the region.\n\nThe first thing he did in jail was to ask for a priest. Seidle said he confessed his sin and asked for absolution.\n\nThe week after the shooting, hundreds of people attended Tamara's Catholic funeral, where her nine children followed her casket out of a church about a mile from the crime scene. The children later filed a lawsuit alleging negligence by the law enforcement agencies responsible for overseeing Seidle and responding to the shooting. A notice of claim showed they are seeking $10 million in damages. Neptune, Asbury Park and Monmouth County Prosecutor's Office have filed motions to dismiss the lawsuit.\n\nThese days, Seidle is locked alone in a prison cell. He is let out for a few hours each day to perform tasks as a runner, passing out juice and hot water to inmates, collecting their trash after dinner, picking up their laundry. He takes an antidepressant. He gets recreation time with other inmates, indoors, separated in individual cages with a port through which they can play cards or chess.\n\n\n\nHe telephones Chavarriaga, who he called his partner, in the morning and evening. He sleeps well at night. He thinks about his children, especially on holidays and birthdays.\n\nHe unsuccessfully appealed his sentence. He said he didn't deserve 30 years, but declined to say what would have been an appropriate sentence.\n\nThis firm defended Phil Seidle under extremely difficult circumstances to the very best of our ability, said his attorney, Edward Bertucio. He avoided a murder conviction with a possibility of a sentence he could not outlive. Instead we negotiated aggravated manslaughter and the sentence he received was lengthy. We appealed it. We did everything we could for him. I wish him the very best.\n\nSeidle found fault in how many people treated him. He said his ex-wife's abuse claims were lies, he dismissed his first divorce attorney, he felt the divorce judge merely warned Tamara for violations of orders, he described how his police chief's punishments just created more stress for him.\n\n\n\nBut he doesn't pass blame for the killing.\n\nI carry the guilt every day of what I've done, the life I've taken, and the lives I've ruined, he wrote. I know I've written a lot about how I was wronged, and what I went through. I can sound like I'm trying to justify what I've done. That's not at all true. I want you to know I hate what I did. I am horrified and deeply saddened. It is reprehensible, and unjustifiable. I killed the woman who at one point I loved, and even though I hated what she did to me, I didn't hate her. I still cared for her as the person who I spent almost twenty-two years raising nine beautiful children with. Although our marriage failed, there were many good times.\n\nSeidle hopes someday he can apologize directly to his children.\n\nI don't expect them to forgive me, he said. But I just want them to know how sorry I am.\n\n\n\nHe said he does believe in an afterlife.\n\nI believe that God forgives us for all of our sins, especially when we ask him, he said. And I think that one day, you know, I will have the opportunity to tell Tamara, hopefully, how sorry I am for what I did to her.\n\nSeidle will become eligible for parole in December 2040, when he'll be 76.\n\nHe plans to make it there.\n\nThere's no doubt about it, Seidle said. I will walk out of these walls one day.\n\nDesign and development by Felecia Wellington Radel.

James S. Robbins\n\nThe clear message to Iran and other rogue states seeking nuclear weapons from North Korea's claimed test of a hydrogen bomb is, go for it. No one is going to stop you.\n\nOn Wednesday, Pyongyang announced that it had successfully tested a hydrogen weapon which it called the H-bomb of justice. Seismic sensors confirmed that some sort of event had happened, though the U.S. government has not confirmed that it was a hydrogen bomb test. If true, the test would demonstrate a deadly quantum leap in North Korean nuclear technology and send a destabilizing message worldwide. In any case, another nuclear test of any sort is an affront to global order.\n\nFor decades, United States policy has been that a nuclear North Korea is unacceptable. Yet Washington keeps on accepting it. Prior to its first surprise nuclear test in 2006, the U.S. said it would not permit North Korea to have a nuclear weapon. After the test, the policy became to not let the Kim regime have any more nuclear weapons. And after subsequent tests in 2009 and 2013, the government played the same tape over and over. The White House says it is deeply concerned; the North Koreans say, you should be.\n\nIt is not as though the international community has done nothing, it has just done nothing effective. North Korea has been placed under a barrage of strong economic sanctions related to its nuclear program in the last few decades. It has been the subject of numerous multinational talks and several important agreements. But these measures failed. One of the poorest, most technologically backward countries in the world now seems to have joined the most elite, most deadly club on the planet. North Korea has proved that talk is cheap and sanctions are useless against a country determined to go nuclear.\n\nNorth Korea has bedeviled more presidents than just Obama: Column\n\nThe rogue world is watching. Iran in particular must be taking note of the international response to North Korea's latest provocation. The two countries have allegedly cooperated on nuclear development. The al-Kibar nuclear facility in Syria that the Israeli Air Force bombed in 2007 was purportedly funded by Iran and built and maintained by North Koreans. Iran's nuclear mastermind Mohsen Fakhrizadeh-Mahabadi was reported present for North Korea's 2013 nuclear test.\n\nTehran is counting down to Implementation Day for the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, a.k.a. the Iran nuclear deal, when tens of billions of frozen dollars will be released and sanctions will be lifted. There are no restrictions on how this money can be spent, and administration officials have admitted that it may be used to further destabilize a region in the grip of sectarian war. North Korea's example shows Iran that they might as well invest it all in banned nuclear programs and push ahead for the bomb.\n\nAmerica between a Shiite and a Sunni place: David Andelman\n\nPOLICING THE USA: A look at race, justice, media\n\nThe Obama administration has already shown its weakness in responding to Iran's deal-breaking behavior. In October Iran tested an illegal ballistic missile, and on the last day of 2015 Iran's President Hassan Rouhani ordered accelerated missile production in violation of numerous U.N. Security Council resolutions. None of this is covered by the new nuclear deal and should trigger a harsh response. However, the White House chose to delay punishing Iran for these violations, though Reuters reported that spokesman Josh Earnest said President Obama would not stand in the way if U.S. officials deemed such measures useful and if they would benefit U.S. national security. This frank abrogation of presidential leadership tells Tehran that anything goes.\n\nHow President Obama and other world leaders respond to the H-bomb of justice will send signals far beyond the Korean peninsula. If history is any judge, there will be some angry statements and expressions of concern, followed by inactivity until North Korea pushes the envelope again. And Tehran knows that if it tests an atomic weapon, it will get away with it just like Pyongyang.\n\nJames S.

Martin Rogers\n\nUSA TODAY Sports\n\nLOS ANGELES – Jurgen Klinsmann's player selection policy for the United States national team is seriously flawed, unfair, and affects the squad's quality of play, according to Major League Soccer midfielder Benny Feilhaber.\n\nFeilhaber, who scored the winning goal for the USA in the 2007 CONCACAF Gold Cup final and now plays for Sporting Kansas City, has been frozen out by Klinsmann despite Feilhaber saying he is in the form of his life.\n\nThe 31-year-old insisted that he and several other players – many of them from MLS – are not given an opportunity to prove their worth by Klinsmann, no matter how well they perform at club level.\n\nAlex Morgan went on 'The Bachelor' and tried to teach everyone to play soccer\n\nI don't know what that reason is, Feilhaber told reporters on Tuesday. I don't know if Jurgen doesn't like these players, he doesn't like their attitude, he doesn't like their faces, he thinks they are ugly. I don't know.\n\nFeilhaber continued: If you ask me it can't possibly be based on on-field performances. There are plenty of guys in MLS that have had better seasons than other guys, in MLS or other countries, that are getting opportunities for the national team.\n\nKlinsmann has been criticized in some quarters for relying heavily on naturalized players who grew up and developed their soccer talent overseas, such as Germany-raised Jermaine Jones, Fabian Johnson and Timmy Chandler, and Scandinavia-raised Aron Johansson and Mix Diskerud.\n\nHowever, Feilhaber was adamant he has no problem with the head coach's policy regarding foreign imports, merely the way he says Klinsmann rules out certain individuals regardless of their current form.\n\nMix Diskerud responds to Abby Wambach's criticism of USMNT playing 'foreign guys'\n\nI've accepted the fact that Jurgen's not going to call me, said Feilhaber, who has made 41 appearances for the USA, played in the 2010 World Cup, but has not figured since 2014. If I play the year that I played this last year, and I'm not getting a call, then I'm not going to get an opportunity under Jurgen.\n\nIn regards to how a coach should approach a team … there are two duties – one is making the best possible team that you can possibly make with the players that are available to you. And two, try to continuously improve that team so that team doesn't stall in any way and continues to improve.\n\nFor me, Jurgen seems to try and do the second one without doing the first one. He would rather put young guys on the team that potentially could become somewhat important on the team and he leaves out players that could make the team better right now.\n\nThat's the number one job of a national team coach. Not to make the team as good as he can make it in five years, to make it as good as he can make it now and continuously improve it. (In that way) he doesn't do his job. There are players in the player pool that do not get called in that have performed well enough on the field to get an opportunity.\n\nFeilhaber highlighted MLS players such as midfielders Sasha Kljestan and Dax McCarty of the New York Red Bulls, and defenders Matt Hedges of FC Dallas and Eric Lichaj of Nottingham Forest in the English Championship as examples of candidates whose form has not been rewarded by Klinsmann.\n\nAn example … I can see how Dax can help the national team, Feilhaber said. He plays in his position that in my opinion would help (USA captain) Michael Bradley become a better player.\n\nDax is a guy that can sit in that pocket and allow Michael to operate in front of him and I think that he does it in a way that is better, or at least competes, with people who are tying to do the same thing on the national team right now.
Paul Singer\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nIt was a line buried in an Office of Congressional Ethics report that tipped me off to members of Congress and staff receiving more than 200 improper trips overseas from groups tied to a Turkish cleric now accused of launching a failed coup in Turkey.\n\nUnder the new rules House Republicans approved late Monday then abandoned Tuesday, I never would have seen the report.\n\nThe 2015 OCE report on a May 2013 trip to Azerbaijan by 10 members of Congress and 29 staffers concluded that the travel was not in fact paid for by the non-profit groups that had invited everyone, but by a foreign oil company, which is a violation of House rules. But the report also included an admission from the non-profit groups that they regularly relied on a Turkish organization to provide free travel for Capitol Hill VIPs on trips to Turkey. That allowed me to track down 200 other trips these groups had sponsored over the past decade that had probably all violated House rules.\n\nBut the House Ethics Committee didn't want this report released. The committee had ordered OCE in March 2015 to drop its probe of the Azerbaijan trip, saying it had its own investigation under way, despite the fact that the committee had originally approved the trip for the entire congressional delegation, including Rep. Yvette Clarke, D-N.Y., who was a member of the Ethics Committee. But OCE refused and proceeded to publish its report over the objections of the Ethics Committee.\n\nUnder the rules changes pushed by House Republicans on Monday night, OCE would have had to stand down.\n\nRead more:\n\nHouse Republicans drop plan to gut ethics office\n\nHouse Republicans move to slash powers of ethics watchdog\n\nHouse ethics board drives transparency, controversy\n\nIt is not the first time OCE has provided information to the public that the Ethics Committee could not or would not release. In 2010, then-congressman Nathan Deal, R-Ga., resigned while the Ethics Committee was reviewing allegations that he had used his congressional office to pressure state officials in Georgia on a vehicle policy that would help his family's auto-salvage business. His resignation meant that the Ethics Committee lost jurisdiction over him, but OCE decided to issue the report anyway, saying it had a right to release to the report on its own. Under the new rules, it would have lost that right.\n\nIn fact, with a handful of exceptions, the only information the public has had about House ethics cases during the past seven years has come from OCE reports. The rules as currently written require that once OCE has referred a matter to Ethics for further review — since OCE has no ability to rule on violations or issue punishments — the Ethics Committee has to publicly release the report even if it has made no decision on guilt or innocence. The most common action by Ethics is to release the report and declare that they are still looking onto the matter ... and no conclusion is ever announced. The new rules proposal raised questions about how much of the OCE work would still be public.\n\nSince the OCE was created in 2008, it has publicly released about 70 reports on investigations of members of Congress and staff. By comparison, in 2007, before the OCE was created, the Ethics Committee announced reviews of conduct of four members of Congress. Two cases involved lawmakers who were facing charges in court; the other two were for improper trips taken four years earlier.\n\nOn the Senate side, with no similar independent ethics review body, the Senate Ethics Committee has not publicly announced a single investigation against a senator in nearly 5 years.\n\nIt is not clear exactly how the new proposed rules would have affected ethics investigations, but it is almost certain that the net result would have been that the public would learn less about allegations of ethics violations by their elected officials.\n\nThis is also not the first — and probably not the last — attempt by lawmakers to make it harder for OCE to investigate them. Two years ago, Republicans pushed through a late-night amendment that underscored the need for OCE to protect the due process rights of accused lawmakers. It is not clear that rules change had much impact.
Aubrey Cohen\n\nNerdWallet\n\nAfter an accident, you might think it would be obvious what's wrong with your car and what repairs are necessary. But it turns out auto insurance companies and repair shops routinely disagree over repairs, and you should pay attention to such disputes.\n\nIn many cases, insurance companies do not accept a body shop's estimate of what a repair will cost, industry officials said. In other cases, the insurer will generate the original estimate, and a repair shop might disagree.\n\nIn either case, we work with shops to come to an agreed-upon price to repair the vehicle, says Thomas Hambrick, assistant vice president of media and public relations at insurance company The Hartford. The Hartford has applied for a patent on an automated system to review such estimates.\n\nMichael Barry, vice president of media relations for the industry group Insurance Information Institute, notes people can disagree on several variables, adding, In most cases these are resolved after an amicable negotiation.\n\nIt's not in an insurance company's interest to put an unsafe car back on the road, Barry says.\n\n11 States Where Drivers Can Save the Most on Car Insurance\n\nPoints of contention\n\nWhat do insurance companies and repair shops disagree about? Here are the five most common sticking points, according to insurance and auto repair officials.\n\n• Whether a part can be fixed or needs to be replaced. For instance, a garage's estimate might call for replacing a body panel, but an insurer might want the body shop to try repairing it first, says Dan Risley, president of the shop owners group Automotive Service Association.\n\n• What kind of replacement part to use. Sometimes an insurer will not pay for a part from the original manufacturer, insisting a used part or cheaper aftermarket version is good enough. Some high-end insurance policies guarantee use of original manufacturer parts.\n\n• How long repairs should take. A repair shop might estimate a dent in a door will take six hours to fix, but an insurance company will think the work should be done in four, Risley says. Each extra hour is more labor cost. And each extra day adds to the insurer's bill for a rental car, if the policy pays for it.\n\n• The labor rate. A garage might have a per-hour cost that's more than an insurer is willing to pay.\n\n• Whether there are errors in the estimate. An estimate might call for replacement of a part that isn't damaged or omit something that does need repair.\n\nWhere you fit in\n\nDisagreements tend to be resolved fairly quickly, Barry says. It generally goes pretty smoothly, because the auto insurers and the auto body repair shops are going to be seeing one another again frequently, he notes.\n\nBut such situations are considerably more rare for the rest of us, who might also have opinions about how our cars should be fixed. Your influence will depend on your insurance policy and state regulations. For instance, the contract might spell out what kind of parts can be used.\n\nMost states require repair shop estimates to identify where non-original parts would be used, and nine states require customer consent for use of aftermarket crash-repair parts, at least in certain cases, according to the Insurance Information Institute.\n\nSo find out what your preferred auto shop thinks needs to be done, ask if there's any disagreement from the insurance company and make your wishes known.\n\nI think the consumer has a vested interest in seeing that the process runs smoothly and that the car is returned to a state of good repair, Barry says. It's a process that a consumer should watch closely.\n\nMORE: The States Where Drivers Can Save the Most on Car Insurance\n\nMORE: How Texting While Driving Can Affect Car Insurance Rates\n\nMORE: NerdWallet Tool: Compare Car Insurance Rates\n\nAubrey Cohen is a staff writer at NerdWallet, a personal finance website.

Tom Nichols\n\nOpinion columnist\n\nWhy can't this administration just tell the truth about the U.S. strike on Iranian terror boss Qasem Soleimani?\n\nThe truth, after all, should be enough. Soleimani helped organize and plan attacks that killed thousands, and he helped to turn entire regions of the Middle East into a charnel house. He was an avowed enemy of the United States and its allies who was directly responsible for the deaths of hundreds of American and coalition troops.\n\nPrevious administrations did not kill him only because the risks of further conflict with Iran were too high. The Trump administration — whether wisely or foolishly — took its shot and killed him. This is a clear enough narrative that administration officials should be able to go out and tell it to Congress, the American people and the international community without shooting themselves in the foot over and over.\n\nBut no. The truth is never enough for this administration. Every moment must be a heroic thriller, an action movie starring Dona­­­ld Trump and SEAL Team Six. It is not enough to be a responsible steward of the nation's security, a role that requires patience and prudence, for which Trump is unprepared and has failed repeatedly.\n\nA Hollywood script about attacks\n\nInstead, President Trump must portray himself the way his base sees him, as a forceful avenger riding an American eagle into battle. He cannot bear to think of himself as Jimmy Carter, who agonized over risks and deliberated too long about the Iranian hostage crisis of 1979, nor can he stand to think of himself as Barack Obama, the much more popular president he clearly envies, who created the terrible and defective Iran nuclear deal.\n\nNow, inquisitive members of Congress, nosy reporters, disloyal Democrats and all the other people Trump thinks of as his enemies have asked obvious questions about U.S. policy. Rather than answer them, Trump has sent his national security officials out with a Hollywood script about an imminent attack that he says involved four U.S. Embassies but refuses to explain to anyone, not even to his trusted surrogates at Fox News.\n\nThe story began to unravel as soon as it hit the street. Apparently, the threat was so severe that it was worth killing Soleimani and courting war with a country of 80 million people. It's unclear, however, whether it was severe enough to actually warn any U.S. Embassies that they were in peril. National security adviser Robert O'Brien dodged the question when it was asked. (Republican members of Congress might consider that such laxity was why they grilled then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton for 11 hours about Benghazi, Libya, in 2015.)\n\nWorse, Defense Secretary Mark Esper has said that he saw no such evidence. Making the rounds of the Sunday shows, Esper said only that the president believed the attacks were possible, and that therefore he believes the president. It is inconceivable such intelligence would have been kept from Esper, and his admission that he has not seen any such thing raises justifiable suspicions that this exquisite intelligence does not exist.\n\nRoll of the dice:Trump crisis mismanagement on full display on Iran, Iraq, Soleimani\n\nEsper's honesty, especially in an administration whose hallmark is daily dissembling, is refreshing. But again, it raises the baffling problem of why the Trump team didn't just make the case that Soleimani, like Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi and others before him, was a legitimate target and that U.S. forces finally had a clear shot at him. Why lie when the truth is compelling? Why create a story that will fall apart in a matter of hours?\n\nThis is all reminiscent of Trump's embroidering of the killing of the leader of the Islamic State terrorist group, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, an action that is to his credit and will be one of the few unarguably positive additions to this administration's foreign policy record. Trump couldn't leave it at a stoic and confident proclamation that the United States killed a ghastly terrorist; instead, he had to pile on ridiculous details about al-Baghdadi crying and pleading, things he could not have known and which remain unverified.\n\nSecurity for America or Trump?\n\nWith both al-Baghdadi and Soleimani, as with so many other moments with this president, Trump can't seem to stick to one coherent story. And so we end up talking not about policy, but whether there is something deeply wrong with the commander in chief and whether he can be trusted with American national security.\n\nThe more ominous problem here is that the Trump team's deceptiveness looks much more like wag the dog than the elimination of a clear and present danger. It might well be true that any day when Soleimani is taken out of action is a good day. But Trump — like Bill Clinton ordering an airstrike on Iraq the day after the Republican House accused him of high crimes and misdemeanors in 1998 — is arguing that military necessity forced him to act.\n\n52 targets:Trump threats to Iran culture sites were illegal, bad strategy and a break with tradition\n\nBy refusing to provide any details to anyone, and instead sending his briefers out to tell members of Congress, in essence, to shut up, the president looks like he is trying to cover up a strike whose purpose had more to do with the security of Donald Trump than the security of the United States.\n\nIn every presidential tenure, there are important moments that reflect the personality of the chief executive, especially in times of crisis. Trump is a man who cannot tell a simple story without dishonesty, even when the facts are on his side. This deficit of character is bad enough in a single leader, but when it spreads to an entire administration, it is dangerous to national security and destructive to trust in democracy.\n\nTom Nichols is a national security professor at the Naval War College, a member of USA TODAY's Board of Contributors and author of The Death of Expertise: The Campaign Against Established Knowledge and Why It Matters.

Andy Slavitt\n\nOpinion columnist\n\nThis new year brings brings fresh choices and fresh controversies in health care. President Trump and Republicans tried last year to repeal the Affordable Care Act and, when that failed, to chip away at the law in other ways. But in the end, with no legislation passed, the principal result was to galvanize a once ambivalent public.\n\nNow we enter 2018 with health care as a top concern of American voters and the ACA as popular as ever. More importantly, Americans recognize the ACA's flaws and by large margins just want them to be fixed.\n\nMore:Tax bill is just another way to repeal health care. Will coverage ever be safe?\n\nMore:Republican tax law is not a win. Take it from me, the backlash is coming.\n\nThere is plenty about the ACA that isn't working as well as it could. Seven years of no improvements and the peeling away of key elements will do that to any law.\n\nSerious proposals from both sides should be listened to. Republican ideas for more flexibility, more innovation and the role of personal responsibility have a place in any debate about how to improve health care. Democrats want to address drug costs. But instead of considering those ideas, the 2017 dividing line was over cuts —specifically, cutting Medicaid and the ACA to pay for corporate and personal tax cuts.\n\nSubstantive policy debates won't be any more likely in an election year like this one. But in four critical areas there are decisions ahead that will have major ramifications for millions of Americans — and potentially for what happens in November, when control of Congress is at stake.\n\nMedicaid cuts: Republicans failed in their attempts to cut health spending last year in various repeal bills, but that didn't stop them from going ahead with the sizable tax cuts the repeal was intended to fund. That created a $1 trillion-plus IOU. Now House Speaker Paul Ryan wants to pay it off — arguing that with less revenue coming in, it's even more important to cut spending on Medicaid and Medicare.\n\nBut there's less appetite for deep Medicaid cuts in the Senate and even less in the electorate. If Ryan is serious about reforming Medicaid, his best bet would be a bipartisan panel to recommend solutions that reduce long-term costs while improving care. I partnered with a Republican from the first Bush administration, Gail Wilensky, to propose such an approach last year. It would be a smart move now.\n\nACA repeal: Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C. still burns a candle for repealing and replacing the ACA. He and Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., last year proposed a system of block grants to states, with fewer strings attached to the money and fewer protections for sicker or older people.It didn't have the support to pass then.Should Congress take it up again, it will be sure to aggravate a very active and alert public in an election year. Perhaps more to the point, the Republican majority in the Senate is narrower than last year, and moderates and many conservatives aren't excited to live through the last year again.\n\nACA fixes: If there's a way for Trump and the Republicans to score a win of sorts, it is simply by undoing some of the damage they did to the ACA in 2017. The administration stopped paying Cost-Sharing Reduction payments to insurers, designed to keep insurance affordable for low-income people, and repealed the individual mandate that encourages broad participation by both the healthy and the sick. Those steps collectively raise premiums by as much as 30% for families.\n\nMore:It's now or never for Paul Ryan and his quest to remake America's safety net\n\nPOLICING THE USA: A look at race, justice, media\n\nCongress should pass a permanent program allowing insurance companies to buy reinsurance to offset the risk of their most expensive cases. That would reverse some of that damage and decrease rates across the country, according to an analysis by Oliver Wyman. This would be a smart political move as these premium decreases would come out right before the election. You can imagine Trump's tweets on how he's fixed things. No matter that he would be only partially fixing what he just broke.\n\nTrump's actions: With his executive order last year, Trump signaled that he would undermine the ACA's protections by allowing insurance plans that don't have to cover even the basics. Trump calculated that would bring the Democrats to the table, but Democrats are wise to stay away on those terms. Early in 2018, the administration has to decide if and how to implement this executive order as well as whether to approve requests from states to impose work requirements or require drug testing for Medicaid beneficiaries. These decisions are likely to draw a range of legal challenges and protests. Trump may welcome the controversy, and if he proceeds with more unilateral action, he and the entire party will certainly get it.\n\nHow Republicans decide to handle the Children's Health Insurance Program as part of the 2018 budget process this month will set a clear tone for the year. Not renewing this program serving 9 million children was one of their biggest blunders of 2017. Now they have a chance to pass a long-term renewal without any of last year's poison pills in the form of House proposals to cut Medicare and ACA coverage.\n\nThe action starts immediately and triggers a series of important choices. The overall path that helps the most Americans is, as it usually is, also the path that makes the most political sense.\n\nAndy Slavitt, a member of USA TODAY's Board of Contributors, is a former health care industry executive who ran the Affordable Care Act and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services from 2015 to 2017.

Kim Komando\n\nSpecial for USA TODAY\n\nQ. I keep seeing posts on Facebook about Mark Zuckerberg giving away money. Is this true?\n\nA. Mark Zuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla Chan, did announce after the birth of their daughter that they would be giving away 99% of their Facebook shares. However, the couple said nothing as to when, or how, these shares would be handed out. This opened the door for online hoaxes, and there have been several going around. Such as one that claims you could get $10 million just for sharing or liking, and another that has people posting a magical unicorn. If you see them, it's best not to click, like or share. You know what they say, If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.\n\nNeighborhood safety\n\nQ. My family is relocating to a new city. I'm unfamiliar with the area, and am concerned about crime. How can I see my new neighborhood?\n\nA. The website My Local Crime is a great resource for anyone who is thinking of moving into a new neighborhood. It allows you to enter an address and see what crimes have been committed recently in the area. You also can listen to police scanners anywhere in the nation using free software called Police Radio Scanner. Keep in mind, every city will have its fair share of crime, but research will at least give you some insights into what's going on.\n\nWindows 10 privacy settings\n\nQ. I've heard rumors that Microsoft collects information about what I do online. Is that true, and what can I do about it?\n\nA. If you use Windows 10, then the answer probably is yes. Many consumers are worried about some of the details in the Windows 10 privacy policy, which allows Microsoft to collect a lot of information about you and your online activity. Naturally, Microsoft claims this information is used only to make improvements to their products' functionality, but this tactic still doesn't sit well with many. What's worse is that the steps to update your privacy settings are confusing and tedious.\n\nUsing Twitter for a small business\n\nQ. I run a small business, and everyone says I need to set up a Twitter account. Is that really necessary?\n\nA. Social media has truly transformed the way customers interact with companies, and it can be a valuable marketing tool for any business. Most companies benefit from having well-managed Facebook and Twitter accounts, but you need to know how to use them. Posting too much or too little can hurt you. The best tip is to use each platform for a specific purpose that benefits your business. For example, use Facebook to share events, photos and customer testimonials, then use Twitter to share coupon codes, news and special discounts.\n\nComputer security\n\nQ. I received a new laptop for Christmas. What should I do to make sure my browsing is secure?\n\nA. One of the first things every new computer should have is a good anti-virus. But, beyond that, there is one critical computer setting that can really keep your computer more secure. It has to do with Adobe Flash. Since Flash is so widely used, it's also a prime target for hackers who are looking to hide malware. If Flash can run ads and videos automatically, you may pick up a virus without intending to.\n\nSlow Internet\n\nQ. I've noticed that sometimes my Internet seems slower than other times. What causes this?\n\nA. It could just be your Internet connection acting up ... or someone could be stealing your line, sucking up valuable bandwidth. Luckily, you can check to see what devices are connected to your network. And, if you do find unauthorized devices, there are steps you can take to ensure they won't return.\n\nOn the Kim Komando Show, the nation's largest weekend radio talk show, Kim takes calls and dispenses advice on today's digital lifestyle, from smartphones and tablets to online privacy and data hacks.

And if so, will they be any good?\n\nThis has happened before, like when Toys R Us went out of business in late 2018 and had liquidation sales.\n\nWhile you might expect steep discounts on popular items before a company closes its doors for the last time, that may not be the case. Depending on how a store gets rid of leftover merchandise, you could actually end up paying more than what the same items cost at a competing retailer.\n\nHere's how to shop at a going out of business sale without getting fleeced.\n\nKnow who you're buying from\n\nCredit: Getty Images Big stores often sell their wares to a professional liquidator.\n\nIf a retailer is only closing a few locations, don't expect to find the best merchandise sitting around in a store that's soon to be shuttered. Chances are it will have been moved to a location that's staying open, where it might have a better chance of selling.\n\nThings are different if the entire chain is folding, however, and shoppers should be aware of the difference.\n\nLiquidation sales are very different from regular, ordinary sales going on in the store, said Dr. Tony Gao, an associate professor of marketing at the University of Massachusetts Lowell's Manning School of Business.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThat's because most major retailers use professional liquidation companies to move merchandise. These liquidators—like Great American and Tiger Direct, who handled HH Gregg's liquidation—often buy remaining merchandise outright. So even if the retailer's name is still on the front of the store, you're buying that new camera or laptop from a liquidator.\n\nAs a result, the store's ordinary return policy may not apply, or coupons may not be valid. Make sure to read the fine print before you buy.\n\nDon't get psyched out\n\nCredit: Getty Images These signs are down to a science.\n\nEven those red-and-white signs that proclaim, EVERYTHING MUST GO! are there for a reason. Liquidators have done thousands of going out of business sales, and they know what works.\n\nThey understand the consumer's buying psychology, and they know when to start the sales, how long they'll last, and they'll also move around inventory from store to store, Gao said. They operate on the assumption that consumers are attracted by liquidation sales.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIndeed, it's not uncommon for liquidators to warehouse merchandise from closed retailers, and move it to wherever they think it might sell. Anything left behind goes back in the warehouse until it's time to liquidate another retailer—which is why you might see discount furniture at an electronics store, or outdated fashions at a clothing store.\n\nLiquidation companies do that—they have patience, said Gao. Many of them have more patience than the retailers being closed themselves.\n\nTo avoid getting sucked in, ask yourself if you actually need what's going on sale. If you do, check prices from other retailers on your phone to make sure you're getting a good deal.\n\nShop small and save\n\nCredit: Getty Images Smaller retailers sometimes offer better deals.\n\nAlthough major retailers tend to rely on liquidators to empty stock, shoppers can still sometimes find deals when smaller stores or specialty retailers go out of business.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe larger stores play more games than the little stores, said Bob Nelson of Power Retail, a Phoenix, AZ-based liquidation consultant.\n\nMany of the smaller customers Nelson works with are shutting down due to an illness or retirement. They've often been fixtures in a community, and want to maximize the value of their inventory without upsetting loyal customers.\n\nThe larger stores play more games than the little stores.\n\nThe smart ones want to get out of there clean. It's only the desperate ones that would sell it to a liquidator, he said. Working with the smaller retailers, we always tell them they have to keep their integrity.\n\nAccording to Nelson, some of the best deals can come from specialty stores that carry unique merchandise—like high-end clothing. In that case, he said, you want to get there early, not late, because late everything's picked over.
Anti-mask protests and videos of altercations over face mask requirements at businesses across the country continue to go viral even as coronavirus cases surge.\n\nOn Saturday, Burn the Mask protesters blocked the entrance of a Fresno, California, Trader Joe's, causing the grocer to close in the afternoon, the Fresno Bee reported.\n\nIn Los Angeles County, where nearly 1 in 5 people are testing positive, a group of protestors stormed a Ralphs grocery store Sunday, argued with customers over masks with one protester calling a fellow shopper a mask Nazi, according to the Los Angeles Times.\n\nMeanwhile, outside a Houston café, protesters waved American flags over the weekend after some customers were upset over having to wear face masks. Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner tweeted in response and support of the restaurant, saying he heard Miller's Cafe has pretty good burgers. I will patronize them Monday and I hope you patronize them this week.\n\nNew Starbucks menu:Starbucks releases winter menu with new Pistachio Latte, Honey Almondmilk Cold Brew, Red Velvet Loaf and more\n\nA way to help meet New Year's resolutions? Chipotle launches Cilantro-Lime Cauliflower Rice, four new lifestyle bowls in time for New Year's resolutions\n\nAnd at an H&M in Hanover, Maryland, on Friday, a shopper recorded another shopper refusing to put on her mask and their disagreement. An employee also asked the unidentified shopper to wear a mask.\n\nYou don't care about people? You want people to die? People are dying of COVID, said Ronald Harper in the video he recorded at the Arundel Mills Mall store, WBAL-TV 11 News, an NBC affiliate, reported.\n\nMask compliance has sparked debates throughout the pandemic after Americans received mixed messages from authorities early on over whether they should wear face coverings in public places.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said for months that wearing masks slows the spread of COVID-19, but meanwhile, some politicians, including President Donald Trump, have been called out for not wearing one. As the nation edged further into the stay-at-home era, viral videos of conflicts over mask requirements at businesses have become common to see.\n\nA flurry of videos started in late June as more stores started asking shoppers to adhere to mask policies. Many of the viral disagreements have happened in cities and states already mandating masks.\n\nOften, law enforcement is called to help, but the CDC has advised retailers to not argue with shoppers over masks.\n\nTrader Joe's closed Fresno store early\n\nTrader Joe's has been asking shoppers to wear masks for months, and California started requiring masks or face coverings be worn inside businesses statewide back on June 18. Several parts of the state required masks before then.\n\nIn late June, a woman without a mask at another California Trader Joe's called employees and shoppers Democratic pigs and screamed profanities because she said she felt threatened when a fellow customer cursed her out for not wearing a mask.\n\nRegarding the incident at the Fresno store, Kenya Friend-Daniel, Trader Joe's national director of public relations, told USA TODAY that safety and well-being of its staff and customers is, and always has been, our top priority.\n\nAs such, since the pandemic was declared, Trader Joe's has prioritized creating a safe working and shopping environment every day, developing effective procedures that meet or exceed CDC guidelines, inclusive of mask requirements, Friend-Daniel said in a statement Monday, adding the company will continue to do the right thing ... with all of our decisions focused on putting their health and safety first.\n\nOn its website, the grocer says it requires customers wear a face covering that meets the standards of applicable health authorities while shopping in our stores. Unless otherwise directed by local rule or law, this does not apply to young children and those with medical conditions who are not able to wear face coverings.\n\nHowever, for California, during current regional stay home order, Trader Joe's says all customers are required to wear a face covering that meets the standards of applicable health authorities while shopping in our stores, without exceptions.\n\nDr. David Abrams, professor of social and behavioral science at New York University, told USA TODAY in October after Trump got COVID-19 that there should be consequences for not wearing masks when required like seat belt rules and needing a shirt and shoes to enter a business.\n\nRetail stores have every right to say if you are not wearing a mask please leave, he said. This is a life-and-death issue. Masks, physical distance and hand-washing are the three things we have to reduce the spread of the virus in the absence of a vaccine.\n\nMask wearing seen as a political issue\n\nAround mid-July, the nation's largest retailers including Walmart, Kroger and Target announced mask requirements would be implemented until further notice at all stores throughout the country.\n\nYet, even though signs are posted at store entrances, there isn't always compliance and there have been confrontations with maskless shoppers.\n\nBoth the Retail Industry Leaders Association and National Retail Federation have encouraged mask policies to protect shoppers and employees.\n\nRetailers are alarmed with the instances of hostility and violence front-line employees are experiencing by a vocal minority of customers who are under the misguided impression that wearing a mask is a violation of their civil liberties, Brian Dodge, the retail association's president, said in a July letter to the National Governors Association.\n\nRecent surveys show more consumers are complying with retailer and local mandates, but that it is often seen as a political issue.\n\nThe Kaiser Family Foundation found in a recent poll that 87% of Democrats and 55% of Republicans say they are wearing a mask every time they leave the house and are around other people.\n\nA recent Ipsos poll had similar results with 74% of Americans agreeing that masks are an effective tool to prevent the spread of COVID-19 but that 90% of Democrats agree with the statement versus 61% of Republicans.\n\nMollyann Brodie, executive director of the foundation's Public Opinion and Survey Research Program, said the difference is part of partisan beliefs about whether masks are protective and necessary.\n\nI think that's what we are seeing in these continued protests is that belief that was set in stone very early on in the course of the pandemic, Brodie said in an interview with USA TODAY.\n\nPresident-elect Joe Biden has said he plans to ask all Americans to wear masks during the first 100 days of his administration.\n\nBiden said that where he has authority, he will issue an order mandating that masks be worn in places like federal buildings, airplanes, and interstate transportation like buses.\n\nBrodie thinks the results of Biden's plan could be mixed.\n\nMany people will be happy to see that type of leadership on taking public health precautions and trying to help limit the spread and certainly the surge we're seeing in the coronavirus, Brodie said. But some people and particularly those who are more likely to be Republicans will react negatively to such a call.\n\nIf you're planning to shop, know the answers to these FAQs:\n\nCan stores and restaurants require masks?\n\nYes. Local governments can decide what safety measures to impose on businesses, but individual businesses can institute further restrictions. Many governors instituted or renewed orders requiring people to wear face coverings in public. Most of the orders require people to wear masks in both indoor and outdoor public spaces where social distancing isn't possible, but some apply to only specific places or age groups.\n\nShould kids wear masks?\n\nAccording to the CDC, cloth face coverings should not be worn by children younger than 2. Older children can and should wear masks, experts say. Schools across the nation are requiring masks when social distancing isn't possible.\n\nAre people with disabilities required to wear masks?\n\nAccording to the Southeast ADA Center in Atlanta, which provides training and guidance on access, if a person with a disability is not able to wear a face mask, state and local government agencies and private businesses must consider reasonable modifications to a face mask policy so that the person with the disability can participate in, or benefit from, the programs offered or goods and services that are provided.\n\nWhen should masks be worn and what kind?\n\nThe CDC recommends wearing masks in public settings around people who don't live in your household and when you can't stay 6 feet away from others to help stop the spread of COVID-19 to others.\n\nThe agency's mask recommendations for types of face coverings include:\n\nWear masks with two or more layers to stop the spread of COVID-19.\n\nWear the mask over your nose and mouth and secure it under your chin\n\nMasks should be worn by people 2 years and older\n\nMasks should not be worn by children younger than 2, people who have trouble breathing, or people who cannot remove the mask without assistance\n\nThe CDC does not recommend the use of gaiters or face shields and says evaluation of these face covers is on-going but effectiveness is unknown at this time.\n\nContributing: Savannah Behrmann, USA TODAY\n\nFollow USA TODAY reporter Kelly Tyko on Twitter: @KellyTyko
Abu Muhammad al-Masri, the No. 2 leader of al-Qaeda was killed in Iran last summer, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo confirmed on Tuesday, though he did not say if the U.S. ordered his assassination or had a role in carrying it out.\n\nToday, I can confirm for the first time his death on August 7th of last year, Pompeo said in remarks at the National Press Club in Washington, D.C.\n\nThe New York Times reported in November that al-Masri was gunned down in Tehran by Israeli agents at the behest of the United States. He was on the FBI's Most Wanted List for his role in the U.S. embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania in 1998, which left more than 200 people deal, including 12 Americans.\n\nPompeo confirmed al-Masri's death in a broader speech that cast Iran as the new home base for al-Qaeda – without offering direct new evidence.\n\nIran is indeed the new Afghanistan, as the key geographic hub for al-Qaeda, Pompeo said. They're partners in terrorism, partners in hate. This axis poses a grave threat to the security of nations and to the American homeland itself.\n\nHis provocative remarks come just days before President-elect Joe Biden takes office with promises to revive U.S.-Iran diplomacy, including the 2015 multilateral nuclear deal, aimed at curbing Tehran's nuclear program, which the Trump administration withdrew from in 2018.\n\nPompeo, an Iran hawk, has made it clear he opposes Biden's plans to return to nuclear negotiations with Iran. Although he did not mention Biden by name on Tuesday, he denounced the appeasement of Tehran as naive.\n\nLet's not lie to the American people about Iranian moderation and pretend the appeasement will work, he said.\n\nPompeo said Iran's ministry of intelligence and security and other agencies have provided safe havens and logistical support, such as ID cards and passports, that enable al-Qaeda activity. As a result of this assistance, al-Qaeda has centralized its leadership inside Tehran, he said.\n\nIran experts cast doubt on Pompeo's allegations.\n\nIt's just not believable at this point, said Trita Parsi, an Iran expert and executive vice president of the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft, a Washington, D.C. think tank. This is an administration that is doing everything it can to create conflict inside of the U.S., and now it's doing everything it can to make sure that no diplomacy can take place between the U.S. and Iran after it leaves.\n\nParsi said Pompeo's claims amounted to complete nonsense and questioned why he waited until the waning days of the Trump administration to announce such potentially explosive allegations.\n\nAlireza Miryousefi, an Iranian diplomat attached to Tehran's mission to the United Nations in New York, described the State Department's claims as preposterous, false and nothing new.\n\nIran has long maintained that al-Qaeda's chief backers in the Middle East are countries with whom the U.S. has good relations, such as Saudi Arabia.\n\nMax Abrahms, a terrorism expert and professor at Northeastern University, noted that al-Qaeda is first and foremost associated with Saudi Arabia, not Iran. The Trump administration has forged extremely close ties with the Saudi kingdom and made isolating Iran a cornerstone of its foreign policy agenda over the last four years.\n\nIn a tweet after Pompeo's speech, Abrahms said it's true that Iran has had some shady ties with Al Qaeda. We have know this for many, many years.\n\nBut, he added, if you're looking to Iran rather than Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Qatar & Pakistan to understand state sponsorship of Al Qaeda then you have been duped and lost the plot.\n\nBarbara Slavin, director of the Future of Iran Initiative at the Atlantic Council think tank in Washington, also questioned Pompeo's motives in making Tuesday's speech.\n\nIt's just more of an effort to justify a failed policy toward Iran under the Trump administration. What more mud can they possibly throw? Slavin said. Iran has had a relationship with al Qaeda for a long time. If that relationship has gotten closer, then Mike Pompeo should just look in the mirror.
AP\n\nCOLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) — After winning their last two games in overtime, the Columbus Blue Jackets went up by three goals in the third period Sunday night against the New York Rangers and appeared ready to hit cruise control.\n\nIt wasn't going to be that easy, though.\n\nThe New York Rangers scored two quick goals later in the third to turn a rout into a tight game down the stretch. It wasn't until Nick Foligno scored a wrap-around goal with 1:21 left that Columbus had some breathing room on the way to 7-5 victory.\n\nFoligno scored twice and Sergei Bobrovsky returned from a team suspension to stop 22 shots for the Blue Jackets, who have won four of the last five and jumped Pittsburgh to move into second place behind Washington in the Metropolitan Division.\n\nIt's a weird game when you're up 6-3 and they're pushing and pressing and get some flukey ones, Foligno said. But we stuck with it and did the right things and found a way to get the job done. That's what you have to do — you don't care how it gets done, just get those two points.\n\nCam Atkinson and Artemi Panarin each had a goal and an assist, Ryan Murray had two assists and nine other Blue Jackets picked up points in the offensive explosion. Columbus had 19 shots in the first period and outshot the Rangers 40-27 for the game.\n\nWe had the puck all night long, Columbus coach John Tortorella said.\n\nMats Zuccarello had two goals, and Ryan Stome, Chris Kreider and Jimmy Vesey also scored for New York, which has lost six of the last seven and is languishing near the bottom of the Metro.\n\nAlexandar Georgiev, spelling regular starter Henrik Lungqvist on the second night of a back-to-back, had 33 saves.\n\nRangers coach David Quinn channeled the salty Tortorella in his postgame comments, referring to his team's effort as a freakin' joke. The Rangers, he said, lacked what he called a bit of a snarl.\n\n(Columbus is) a team that competes hard on pucks and tests your mettle, and we failed miserably tonight, Quinn said. Miserably. Our lack of determination on one-on-one battles, fishing for pucks. You do that in this league, that's what happens ... .\n\nAnthony Duclair, Lukas Sedlak and David Savard also scored for the Blue Jackets. Bobrovsky — who had been benched for Thursday's game for violating a team policy and didn't play in Saturday's overtime win over Washington — wasn't terrific, but held off the Rangers after they pulled the goalie for a sixth skater late in the game.\n\nThe team didn't release details of what happened with the two-time Vezina Trophy winner, but Bobrovsky acknowledged he let his emotions run away him. He said he spoke to the team and cleared the air.\n\nWe'll move ahead, said Bobrovsky, who hasn't been able to come to terms with the team on a contract extension and may be traded. I'll get back to work and do my thing, try to do my best to help this team win.\n\nNOTES: Columbus' 19 shots in the first were the most in a period for the team this season. ... Blue Jackets D Zach Werenski played in his 200th NHL game. He had the assist on Atkinson's second-period goal. ... Rick Nash, who was the first star of the Columbus franchise, did the ceremonial puck drop. The 34-year-old Nash retired because of concussion issues after 15 seasons. ...

Jason Margolis\n\nPRI's The World\n\nAfter you collect your cans, bottles and paper, then put them out by the curb, do you ever think about where everything goes after the truck picks things up? Largely, it goes to China.\n\nEvery day, nearly 4,000 shipping containers full of recyclables leave U.S. ports bound for China. China sends the U.S. toys, clothes and electronics; in return, some of America's largest exports back are paper, plastic and aluminum.\n\nBut that equation is changing as of Jan. 1 — China is enforcing its new National Sword policy, which bans 24 types of solid waste, including various plastics and unsorted mixed papers, and sets a much tougher standard for contamination levels.\n\nChina notified the World Trade Organization about the ban in July, essentially saying the country would no longer act as the world's trash dump. Currently, China consumes 55% of the world's scrap paper and is a major destination for other recyclables.\n\nThe National Sword policy follows China's Green Fence, a 10-month policy the country enacted five years ago, which set initial standards for lower contamination levels for recycling.\n\nThe ban will undoubtedly hurt recycling operators in China that rely on the import of raw materials. But delivering a cleaner China is paramount for Communist Party politicians.\n\nThe National Sword is also already being felt throughout the U.S. About a 45-minute drive west of Boston in the city of Westborough, Massachusetts, bales of paper are stacking up in a parking lot.\n\nWe're looking at 150 to 200 tractor trailer loads of paper. It's stacked approximately 12 feet high, and it goes for quite a distance, says Ben Harvey, president of E.L. Harvey & Sons, a family-run business since 1911.\n\nTo be clear: This situation is not normal.\n\nNo, our business is to bring it in, process it and move it out as quickly as we can, says Harvey.\n\nHarvey can't sell the 2,000-pound bales to China because the contamination levels — the trash that's accidentally mixed in, something like the remnants of a greasy pizza box that gets thrown in with the recycling — almost certainly exceed China's rigorous new standards. If he had continued putting bales on ships a few weeks ago, they wouldn't have reached China until the ban would've already been in effect on Jan. 1.\n\nHarvey is hoping that China and the U.S. can work out a deal or he can find other processing mills in Vietnam or Thailand. Selling the material in the U.S. simply isn't an option.\n\nBecause everything was going offshore, the mills have been slow to develop in the United States to handle this material, Harvey says. With the tightness in the marketplace, there might be mills that will be built, but that takes four to five to six years to put in a mill that will handle the capacity that we're currently looking at.\n\nIn the meantime, he's growing increasingly concerned as the bales of paper take over more and more of his parking lot.\n\nIf this stuff doesn't move, and we don't know what to do with it, we can't keep it forever, he says. At some point, it's going to start to degrade. The other thing that could happen is that if we can't find outlets — and I'm not talking about just E.L. Harvey & Sons, I'm talking about the industry as a whole — we're going to stop bringing material into our facilities. And that's going to impact recycling programs throughout the country.\n\nIn other words, trucks could stop collecting our curbside recycling.\n\nThis is not a little disruption, says Susan Collins, president of the Container Recycling Institute, a research organization based in Southern California. This is a big disruption to a bigger industry than most people would think it is, because it's sort of an invisible process. You put your stuff out at the curb, and it goes away — nobody thinks about it as being a multibillion industry in this country.\n\nCollins says China's crackdown presents something between a challenge and a crisis for U.S. recyclers.\n\nWe've already put things on ships that may be coming back, says Collins. The U.S. recycling industry has asked for some relaxation of the rules, but there are ongoing negotiations right now in the hopes of making this not quite as drastic a move.\n\nCollins says U.S. recyclers are willing to adjust, but they need time.\n\nChina has already relaxed the rules in the past few months, shifting acceptable fiber contamination rates from 0.3% to 0.5%, still a near impossible standard for U.S. recyclers.\n\nBen Harvey says he can't come anywhere close to that. That's largely because American consumers are making it hard on recycling collectors.\n\nInside his plant, streams of cans, bottles and paper roll by on conveyor belts. A machine sorts things first, then workers do a second, manual sort — they pick out a lot of trash from the bottles and cans. About 15% of the recycling that E.L. Harvey & Sons collects in its recycling trucks is unusable rubbish.\n\nMore:Trump's dangerous America First path: This is how empires crumble\n\nMore:China: U.S. should curb demand for opioids, not blame us\n\nMore:China hits back at Trump tweet accusing it of selling oil to North Korea\n\nWe call it 'wishful recycling,' Harvey says. The general public says, 'Hey, let's put it in (the) recycling barrel; they'll figure out something to do with it.'\n\nHarvey says through sorting, he can get contamination levels down to between 1% and 2%, but no further, unless better machinery is developed and/or he can expand the line of workers doing manual sorting. But that's a risky proposition for a business that relies on thin margins and volatile commodity prices.\n\nHarvey estimates that he can continue storing bales of paper in his parking lot for another three to six months. If a solution isn't found by then, it could mean shuttering the processing facility and layoffs, perhaps getting rid of 50 people.\n\nAnd that could also translate into more bottles, cans and paper being sent straight to the landfill.\n\nThis article was originally posted on PRI.org.

AP\n\nMOSCOW (AP) — A new generation of young, talented and, above all, clean Russian athletes will compete at next month's Pyeongchang Olympics, according to Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko.\n\nThe Russians must compete under the Olympic flag in South Korea after the International Olympic Committee ruled the country operated a sophisticated doping and cover-up program when it hosted the 2014 Sochi Games.\n\nMutko — who was sports minister at the time — has been banned from the Olympics for life along with 43 athletes, though he and all but one of the athletes have filed appeals.\n\nThose bans, which include 14 medalists, have helped clear the way for younger talent in Russia, Mutko said. While there would usually be about 40 percent changeover in the Russian team between Olympics, he said, this time 80 percent of athletes will not have competed in Sochi.\n\nIn practically every event it's an absolutely new, young team, Mutko said in an interview Saturday in a VIP box at the European figure skating championships in Moscow.\n\nAlthough Mutko is no longer sports minister, he is still in overall charge of sports policy and the government's preparations for soccer's World Cup.\n\nDespite the Olympic bans, Russian officials expect about 200 athletes to compete in Pyeongchang, though not all would have normally been the country's first choice. That's fewer than in Sochi in 2014, but more than in Vancouver in 2010.\n\nIt's not yet clear which Russians will go to the Olympics — where they will compete as Olympic Athletes from Russia because the country's team is formally banned. The IOC is vetting lists of athletes submitted by Russian officials before issuing invitations.\n\nIn every sport we have a lot of interesting young athletes with potential and we hope they can realize their potential, Mutko said. We'd like them to compete in equal conditions. We're trying to abstract them from all these political scandals, though it's extremely difficult because we see the date on the calendar and it's not clear if (a particular athlete) is going to the Olympics or not, because each of them needs to receive an invitation.\n\nMutko said Russia's young stars who could break through in Pyeongchang include 15-year-old European figure skating champion Alina Zagitova, ski jumper Sofia Tikhonova and speedskater Pavel Kulizhnikov.\n\nSo far, the IOC says it has cut a preliminary list of 500 down to 389, but hasn't revealed names.\n\nIt's likely that any decision will be followed by a rush of last-minute appeals by athletes who aren't invited, particularly because the IOC wants to exclude all Russians with previous doping offenses — potentially including Kulizhnikov — not just the 43 banned from Sochi. Mutko said that condition had been added absolutely illegally.\n\nHe said the Court of Arbitration for Sport, which is hearing various Russian appeals, was biased toward the Olympic officials and the World Anti-Doping Agency.\n\nIt's basically tame for the IOC and WADA. It's tame, he said, adding that Russia still rejected the findings of IOC and WADA investigations which detailed widespread doping. Why does everyone tell us to accept the report? We won't accept any report.\n\nThe Russian government insists it never supported dopers or covered up for them. Mutko painted WADA's star witness, former Moscow and Sochi laboratory director Grigory Rodchenkov, as untrustworthy and erratic, and said the Russian government wasn't responsible for any malpractice in the state-funded Sochi drug-testing lab during the Olympics. Instead, he laid the blame at the feet of the IOC and WADA.\n\nI look at the ruling on myself and ... I don't understand it. I'm being accused of being a minister who did not ensure quality anti-doping at the Olympics. But I wasn't supposed to do that. It's their work, understand? Mutko said, blaming WADA. They didn't control a damn thing — excuse me — and what, should we answer for that?\n\nAhead of last month's IOC decision to force Russians to compete under a neutral flag, some officials said that option would not be acceptable. However, no boycotts ... were ever considered, Mutko said Saturday.\n\nRussian athletes are appealing against certain conditions of eligibility, but no appeal has been filed by Russia against the central point of the IOC sanctions, banning the Russian team from competing with its own flag and anthem. Mutko said that was because he believed the Court of Arbitration for Sport would dismiss any appeal.\n\nMutko's position as deputy prime minister gives him oversight of all government sports policy in a country with a vast state-run system of sports academies and where most top coaches are government employees. However, he has taken a step back in recent months, leaving his posts as president of the Russian Football Union and chairman of the organizing committee for the World Cup.\n\nMutko said he continues to have a key role overseeing the government's multi-billion-dollar investments in World Cup stadiums and infrastructure. Leaving the organizing committee, he said, was simply not to give any extra reason for criticism of Russia from abroad.\n\nIn the government now, the president and prime minister, they've decided that I will continue to do all of this and finish this project, Mutko said. So we're doing it and everything will be at a high organizational level. I'm absolutely sure.
From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nHayneville: A teenager admitted to fatally shooting a sheriff who was attempting to disperse loiterers at a gas station, a state investigator testified Monday. Lt. Shawn Loughridge of the State Bureau of Investigation testified in a preliminary hearing that 18-year-old William Chase Johnson admitted after being arrested that he shot Lowndes County Sheriff John Williams Sr. Johnson is charged with capital murder in the sheriff's death. Store security video showed the sheriff arriving at a gas station and attempting to disperse a noisy crowd that was blocking gas pumps, the investigator said. He said witnesses indicated Johnson first approached Williams in an aggressive manner, and the sheriff told him to return to his vehicle. The sheriff was shot after approaching Johnson's black Silverado truck, Loughridge testified.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: One of the longest-serving members on the state Supreme Court plans to retire later this year. The Alaska Judicial Council is accepting applications for the seat held by Justice Craig Stowers, who plans to retire effective June 1, according to Mara Rabinowitz with the state court system. Stowers, a former Superior Court judge, was appointed to the Alaska Supreme Court in 2009 and later served as a chief justice. Of the current justices, only Daniel Winfree has served on the Supreme Court longer. Winfree was appointed in 2007. The judicial council plans to meet in May to interview applicants. The names of finalists advanced by the council will be sent to Gov. Mike Dunleavy, who will make the appointment.\n\nArizona\n\nTucson: Like many city libraries, the one in downtown Tucson is a refuge for homeless people looking for a bathroom, a computer or just a respite. But staff at the Valdez Main Library want to be even more of a resource for men and women having a hard time. For more than a year now, the librarians here have been holding monthly meetings as part of the On the Streets program. Those experiencing homelessness can once a month get a meal and connect with services. The program has helped temper friction that can develop when library staffers have to approach people who are sleeping, bathing or bringing in multiple items. An average of 50 people show up for the monthly sessions. They receive a meal prepared by a local food bank and can choose to stay for the meeting. They get to shape the topics of discussion, too.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: State officials announced Monday that the closure of a hog farm near the Buffalo River has been completed, months after striking a deal with the facility's owners. Arkansas Parks, Heritage and Tourism Secretary Stacy Hurst announced that the terms of the state's agreement with the owners of C&H Hog Farms Inc. are complete. The shuttered hog farm's owners have received $6.2 million in state and private funds that was held in escrow since last August, and the state in return now holds a conservation easement for the property. Under the agreement, the state will be responsible for the closure of the waste ponds at the property. Gov. Asa Hutchinson in June announced the settlement with the 6,500-hog farm in Vendor, about 95 miles northwest of Little Rock, which had been the source of controversy since it was permitted several years ago. The Nature Conservancy provided $1 million of the funding.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Diego: A team of eye experts has operated on an unusual patient – a gorilla. A cataract was removed Dec. 10 from the left eye of a 3-year-old western lowland gorilla who lives at the San Diego Zoo Safari Park, the park announced Monday. The gorilla, named Leslie, was given a muscle blocker to keep her still while a team that included vets along with anesthesiologists and an ophthalmology team from UC San Diego Health removed the cloudy lens and replaced it with an artificial lens that should last for life. The operation was performed at the San Diego Zoo Global's Paul Harter Veterinary Medical Center. Cataract surgeon Chris Heichel, who led the team and has performed thousands of operations, said it was his first on a gorilla.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: An initiative to reintroduce gray wolves to the state has qualified for the November ballot. The secretary of state's office said Monday that backers of the proposal turned in sufficient valid voter signatures to qualify the measure. The gray wolf has been successfully reintroduced to a number of U.S. states. It was eradicated in Colorado in the 1940s. Colorado ranchers and other interests strongly oppose the initiative, saying it would threaten livestock as well as elk, moose, deer and other animals. The Rocky Mountain Wolf Action Fund is campaigning for the plan. It says voters have the opportunity to decide for themselves whether to introduce the wolf, whereas efforts in other states are directed by federal wildlife officials. If passed, the initiative would direct the Colorado Parks and Wildlife Commission to devise a plan to introduce wolves on public land west of the Continental Divide before 2024.\n\nConnecticut\n\nWestport: Gov. Ned Lamont is scheduled to appear at a public meeting this weekend to discuss his proposed transportation plan, which could include highway tolls. The town hall-style meeting is planned for Sunday at a school in Westport, where the Democratic governor is expected to be joined by Transportation Commissioner Joseph Giulietti. It will be hosted by state Sen. Will Haskell and state Rep. Jonathan Steinberg, both Democrats. A transportation forum that originally was planned for Tuesday evening in Westport had been postponed. Improving our infrastructure is a top concern for my district. That's why I'm so excited to host Gov. Lamont and leaders from his administration to hear directly from my constituents at this town hall meeting, Haskell said.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: An 18-year-old man has been charged with throwing an incendiary device at a Planned Parenthood location in the state, a federal prosecutor's office announced. Samuel James Gulick, of Middletown, was charged Monday in federal court. Security video recorded Gulick spray-painting the phrase Deus Vult, a Latin expression meaning God wills it, in red letters across the Newark building's exterior Friday, the U.S. attorney's release said. Gulick then stepped away, lit an object and threw it at the front window before running for cover. The object exploded, and a fire burned for a minute before going out, the court documents said. Gulick was arrested by the FBI on Saturday after investigators identified his car through the security video and found social media posts under his name containing the same phrase he scrawled on the building, as well as several anti-abortion messages.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The viral art phenomenon known as Infinity Mirrors is returning to the Hirshhorn Museum on April 4. The Hirshhorn announced Monday that a mini exhibit of Yayoi Kusama's work, One with Eternity: Yayoi Kusama in the Hirshhorn Collection, will be on display through Sept. 20, WUSA-TV reports. The exhibit includes two Infinity Mirror rooms, including Kusama's 1965 installation Phalli's Field and a new room that will be announced soon. An early painting, photographs of Kusama and the 1964 sculpture Flower Overcoat will also be part of One with Eternity. The Japanese artist has created more than 20 of the mesmeric mirror rooms, allowing visitors to physically partake in the infinite repetition for which her paintings are known.\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee: The state's environmental cops fine polluters today less than half as much as they did a decade ago, before former Gov. Rick Scott took office and shifted state regulators to a more pro-business posture, state data shows. Through the first week of December, the Florida Department of Environmental Protection assessed 352 penalties in 2019, totaling $4.4 million in fines for violating air, water, sewer, petroleum tank and other state environmental regulations. By comparison, in 2010 DEP assessed 1,249 environmental penalties in Florida, totaling $10.2 million – more than 3 1/ 2 times as many penalties and double the fines assessed this year. DEP holds that the lower figures prove the success of the agency's mission to help businesses, utilities and other polluters to clean up their acts. But the agency's critics say the steep drop in fines reflects an ever-softening stance.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: The city's police chief has ordered a halt to all police car chases after crashes that killed or injured people. I don't want to see us cost someone their life in pursuit of an auto theft person or burglar when the courts aren't even going to hold them accountable. I mean, how can we justify that? Chief Erika Shields said at a news conference. Two men were killed last month in Atlanta when their car was hit by a stolen car evading authorities, police said. The chief said the order will stay in effect while she reviews a chase policy that has been in place since 2018. Changes might include allowing only highly trained officers to take part in chases, Shields said. I have not heard of any department totally restricting pursuits without some exception for extreme situations such as active shooters or terrorists, said Jack Rinchich, president of the National Association of Chiefs of Police in Titusville, Florida.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Road crews are working to repair a section of highway that collapsed into the ocean as some residents question the state's actions to fight road deterioration. Repair crews began working Sunday on Kamehameha Highway in Hauula after coastal erosion caused the collapse of the shoulder and part of a lane. An area north of Pokiwai Bridge will remain closed until further notice, the Hawaii Department of Transportation said. Ed Sniffen, the state deputy director for highways, estimated the repairs would cost about $120,000 and take about a week to complete. The collapsed area of road is 12 feet long and 6 feet above the beach. Inspectors found the shoulder had been undercut for approximately 20 feet in both directions, the department said.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Gov. Brad Little says education funding will be his top priority for the state budget, continuing a theme from his just-completed first year in office. The 65-year-old Republican governor delivered his second State of the State address to lawmakers Monday in what is considered the kickoff to the legislative session. I am committed to working with you to invest in education, continue reducing regulatory burdens, and increase all Idahoans' prosperity and quality of life, Little declared. His budget limits general fund spending growth to 3.75%, a reduction from recent years. His budget leaves a surplus of $60 million and increases the state's rainy-day funds by $102 million as protection against a possible economic slowdown. The state spends about half its budget on K-12 education, or about $2 billion annually. Little's budget increases that by about 4%. In particular, Little is keen on increasing the reading ability of young students.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: Several recreational marijuana dispensaries in the state were closed Monday, with some owners saying strong demand has caused a shortage in supplies and staff exhaustion. The legal sale of recreational cannabis began Jan. 1 in Illinois, with customers spending about $3.2 million on the first day and more than $10.8 million over five days. By comparison, Michigan, which made recreational marijuana legal Dec. 1, generated $3.1 million in the first two weeks of sales. Neal McQueeney of Midway Dispensary in Chicago said the shop stopped selling recreational product Sunday and doesn't expect to resume sales until Friday. Jason Erkes said Cresco Labs shut its Sunnyside shops in Chicago, Rockford and Champaign to all customers to reset and give his staff a break after working five consecutive 14-hour days.\n\nIndiana\n\nEvansville: A recently retired University of Southern Indiana professor already has a new job, as the state's newest poet laureate. The Indiana Arts Commission says Matthew Graham of Evansville began his two-year term as state poet laureate last week. He succeeds Adrian Matejka, an Indiana University professor. Graham's duties will include making public appearances at poetry readings or literary events and promoting poetry. Graham is the author of four books of poetry, including The Geography of Home, released in 2018. He's received a number of national, regional and local awards, including a Pushcart Prize, an Academy of American Poets Award and two grants from the Indiana Arts Commission. Graham co-founded and co-directed The Ropewalk Writers' Retreat in the historic southwestern Indiana town of New Harmony.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: To keep up with a sharp increase in passengers, Des Moines International Airport is adding gates to its planned new terminal years before construction even begins. Planned with 14 gates when it opens in 2028, the terminal will instead need 18 to handle the additional load, airport officials said Monday. The extra four gates hadn't been slated to be built until 2040. The airport will have a combined $60 million in additional capacity-boosting projects, including the $40 million cost of the extra gates. But because the growth in passenger traffic has generated additional revenue, the shortfall in funding for the $500 million project remains at $194 million – similar to two years ago, when airport leaders were looking at scaling back the project to cut costs.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly proposed Monday that the state give itself more breathing room in its budget by slashing annual payments to its pension system for teachers and government workers, offering a new version of a plan that the Republican-controlled Legislature spiked last year. Kelly's proposal would give the state an extra 10 years to close a long-term gap in funding for the state pension system. The move would free up tens of millions of dollars each year for more than a decade, money that could be used for schools and social services. But it's not clear if her new plan will fare any better than last year's proposal – which was dead from almost the moment she presented it to lawmakers. The Kansas Public Employee Retirement System projects Kelly's proposal would increase the cost of closing the gap by a total of $4.4 billion – comparing it to extending the length of a home mortgage.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: The Kentucky Humane Society had its largest adoption year on record with about 6,902 animal adoptions in 2019. The Humane Society said it was the first year that cat adoptions outnumbered dogs. In total, 3,424 cats found new homes compared to 3,398 dogs. Adoption officials said cat adoptions have been increasing over the past few years. Humane Society spokeswoman Andrea Blair said cats are popular with seniors, busy families, renters and people who travel for work. Blair said 1,583 cat adoptions took place at Purrfect Day Café, which opened in August 2018. The cafe serves coffee, snacks and cocktails while patrons interact with adoptable kittens and cats. Total adoptions were up 816 from 2018.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: Residents who had real Christmas trees to celebrate the holidays are being asked to help the state's fisheries. Jefferson Parish is seeking volunteers to help with its annual Christmas tree recycling program. It's the parish's 30th year doing the project. Volunteers, especially people with shallow draft boats, are needed Feb. 1 to help move the trees out to Goose Bayou, according to Seamus Riley with the parish's Coastal Management Department. The staging area is at Cochiara's Marina in Lafitte and begins at 9 a.m. The parish collects trees from residents and uses them to protect Louisiana's coastline. The trees are used to build wave-reducing fences and to fill in man-made canals, The Times-Picayune/The New Orleans Advocate reports. In 2019, more than 6,000 Christmas trees were collected in Orleans Parish and airlifted by the Louisiana National Guard into the Bayou Sauvage National Wildlife Refuge.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: Biologists with the state Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife are getting ready to round up some moose. Starting this week, biologists will be capturing and collaring 130 moose as Maine's moose survival study enters its sixth year and focuses on a new study area. The study began in the winter of 2014 in western Maine, and a second study area in northern Maine was added in 2016. Over five years, 475 moose were captured by helicopter-launched nets and fitted with a GPS collar. This year, the program will include a new area north of Moosehead Lake. The collars enable staff to remotely track moose locations and movements over time and to be notified if a moose dies. Adult cows are monitored each spring and summer to determine birth rates and survival rates of calves. For each collared moose, biologists collect detailed health information, including a blood sample, parasite loads, body condition and winter tick loads.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: A newspaper's review of state court records has found an apparent loophole that allows documents filed electronically to be kept from the public. The Capital reports court documents filed through the state's electronic record-keeping system can be made secret by attorneys, judges and clerks and their staffers without a court order or public notice. In contrast, attorneys who want a record kept secret must obtain an order from a judge when filing by paper. That process requires notice and an opportunity for any interested party to intervene. The newspaper reports it's unclear how many records have been so easily sealed across the state. In the case of the man accused of opening fire in the Annapolis newsroom in 2018, killing five employees, the newspaper learned through a public records request that almost 70% of the documents were designated confidential, keeping them from public view.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: The City Council swore in the most diverse group in its history Monday. The council made up more than half by women and people of color was ushered in by Mayor Martin Walsh during a ceremony at Faneuil Hall, the Boston Herald reports. The mayor swore in 13 members who included four new faces, which is an unusual amount of turnover for the council. Voters in November also elected the council's first Latina member, Julian Mejia, as well as district councilors Ricardo Arroyo, Kenzie Bok and Liz Breadon, the first openly gay woman to serve on the council. City Councilor Kim Janey will also make history as the third woman of color to serve as the body's president. The council was a white male bastion for decades, but Boston is now a majority minority city where whites comprise roughly 47% of the population.\n\nMichigan\n\nMidland: It's not what the Egyptians had in mind, but it worked: A group of high school students made a pyramid out of toilet paper – 27,434 rolls. It took 16 hours for students to assemble the pyramid at Bullock Creek High School in Midland County. They are hoping to be recognized by the Guinness Book of World Records and sell the toilet paper as a fundraiser for the 20-member robotics team. There was a lot of excitement when we got to the last few layers, but the final roll at the top was actually pretty anti-climactic, Maxton Herst told MLive.com. Every single roll you place, you want it to be in the correct spot. It was just kind of mind-numbing work. Herst got the idea three years ago after seeing a similar pyramid on YouTube. The students built the pyramid during holiday break. Rolls of the two-ply toilet paper have since been placed into 96-count boxes for purchase.\n\nMinnesota\n\nWinona: An employee has been fired after tweeting criticism of his firm's holiday gift to its workers. A branch manager for Fastenal in Canada was fired just before New Year's Day after he posted a tweet chiding the company about its gift choice of barbecue sauce and a wooden grill scraper. Fastenal says the tweet violated the company's policy on social media posts. CEO Dan Florness said the policy about acceptable standards of conduct is given to every employee and posted on the company website. News of the firing has been widely shared on social media and prompted a backlash, including several website posts and phone messages that were deleted immediately because they were vulgar or threatening, Florness told the Star Tribune. Fastena'l, based in Winona, says it's the largest fastener distributor in North America.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Prisoner advocates are calling on the federal government to investigate the state's prison system for possible civil rights violations, saying the violence of recent days highlights deliberate violations of inmates' constitutional right to be free from cruel and unusual punishment. The Southern Poverty Law Center and other groups said they were sending the letter Tuesday to the U.S. Department of Justice. The letter warns that it is no exaggeration to say more lives will be lost absent immediate intervention. U.S. Rep Bennie Thompson, Mississippi's only Democrat in Congress, called Sunday for a federal investigation after inmates were killed by fellow prisoners across three prisons and an unknown number of inmates were injured in disturbances. Mississippi prison officials, who called in state troopers and a special team of prison guards from Tennessee to help regain control of the situation, have said four of the deaths are related to violence between gangs.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: Gov. Mike Parson says he's not convinced that unregulated and untaxed video gambling terminals in the state are illegal, even as investigators in his administration work to halt their spread. The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports that Parson, the former Polk County sheriff, said he is monitoring a Platte County court case that could provide legal guidance to the state's prosecutors on what constitutes a game of chance versus a game of skill. The video gambling terminals, which work in a fashion similar to slot machines, have been rolled out in truck stops, gas stations and convenience stores across the state. Opponents argue that slot machines are only allowed in casinos. But backers say the machines give players the option of viewing the outcome of a wager before placing a bet. The governor's stance is in contrast to the Missouri State Highway Patrol, whose leaders have made a decision.\n\nMontana\n\nGreat Falls: A Native American tribe has planned a celebration after recently gaining federal recognition. The Little Shell Tribe of Chippewa Indians of Montana has announced plans to host a celebration Jan. 25 in Great Falls. The celebration comes about a month after President Donald Trump signed the National Defense Authorization Act containing an amendment giving the Little Shell Tribe federal recognition, officials said. The free celebration will be held at the Holiday Inn from 5 to 10 p.m. and is open to the public, tribal council members said. The celebration includes dinner, traditional music played by fiddlers, and speeches by dignitaries and council members. Other tribes are expected to be represented at the event, councilmembers said. The public is also invited to attend a pipe ceremony the same day at 1 p.m. at the Shawn Gilbert Event Center, tribal members said.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: The City Council is cracking down on illegal dumping at recycling collection sites. The council voted unanimously Monday to make it illegal to put recyclables anywhere but in the proper containers at the 19 collection sites available to residents. The new ordinance also bans dumping at the sites or in the recycling containers anything that can't be recycled. People have left garbage and other objects at the sites, including hot tubs, tires, beds, televisions, wood pallets and pianos – all items that can't be recycled. Cleaning up the resulting messes fell to the businesses hosting the sites, Lincoln transportation and utilities assistant director of utilities Donna Garden told the council last month. The ordinance also applies to recycling processing centers, salvage operations and commercial composting operations. Violators face fines of up to $500 for the misdemeanor offense.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: An Australian mining company has agreed to a moratorium on new activities at a planned lithium mine in the state in exchange for conservationists dropping a lawsuit to protect a rare desert wildflower they say doesn't exist anywhere else in the world. The Center for Biological Diversity filed notice in U.S. District Court in Las Vegas that it was voluntarily withdrawing its lawsuit against the Trump administration seeking a ban on all drilling and road building at the site on federal land as a result of the newly reached agreement with Ioneer USA Corp. The center filed an emergency petition with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in October to list Tiehm's buckwheat as an endangered species. The lawsuit filed weeks later accused the Bureau of Land Management of illegally dividing the mining operations into two separate projects so as to bypass its own regulations for any land disturbances larger than 5 acres.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nManchester: Monks at a Catholic college faced off in court Monday against the school's board of trustees in a dispute over an effort to limit the the monks' power – a move some worry could lead to increased secularization. A judge heard motions in Hillsborough Superior Court related to a lawsuit filed against the Saint Anselm College board last year. The unusual clash was set in motion when the board moved to take away the monks' ability to amend the school's bylaws. Michael Tierney, representing the monks, said the school's charter dictated that they retain the power to amend laws governing the school. The school was set up and run by Benedictine monks for 130 years. The board has argued that it has the authority under state law on nonprofit organizations to amend the bylaws. It argues the move is necessary to ensure it has the required independence for reaccreditation.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: The state could see a significant increase in the number of electric cars traveling on local roads under a bill gaining momentum that would expand the state's network of charging stations and give motorists a sizable rebate on a purchase or lease. The measure is seen as a cornerstone of efforts to reduce air pollution, including greenhouse gases, in a state that continually receives failing grades for smog. The bill was approved by two Assembly committees Monday as lawmakers push to pass it before the legislative session comes to a close next week. To achieve those clean air reductions, motorists will be given one of the best incentive packages in the nation to buy an electric car. At the center of the bill is a rebate of up to $5,000 intended to lower an electric vehicle's sticker price to make the sector more competitive with gasoline-powered cars.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: The Legislature's lead budget-writing committee on Tuesday recommended a 6.5% increase in state general fund spending and endorsed plans to stash away a portion of New Mexico's windfall from oil production in trust funds to ensure future financial stability. The Legislative Finance Committee that operates a year-round policy and accountability office recommended a $464 million increase in sustained spending to about $7.5 billion for the fiscal year that begins July 1. Another $325 million would be set aside in an investment trust to underwrite early childhood schooling and services, alongside smaller trusts dedicated to college affordability and rural libraries. Legislators expect the state will receive an $800 million surplus in general fund income next year, in excess of the $7 billion in current spending obligations.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: The country's busiest train station would get new tracks, expanded terminals and better access for commuters under a plan announced by the governor Monday. Gov. Andrew Cuomo said he will propose acquiring the block south of Penn Station to add at least eight new underground tracks, which he said will create new, larger terminals and boost track and train capacity by 40%. More than 600,000 people pass through Penn Station daily on trains run by Amtrak, New Jersey Transit and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, operator of the Long Island Rail Road and the New York City subway system. The station has 21 tracks and operates at full capacity during peak periods, leading to rippling delays when trains or infrastructure break down. The more than century-old station was considered an architectural masterpiece in its day, and its demolition and repurposing in the 1960s provoked a public outcry.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nWilmington: A popular ferry route has closed for three months to allow crews to perform repairs. The StarNews reports the N.C. Department of Transportation closed the Southport-Fort Fisher ferry beginning Monday to update ramp equipment at both ferry terminals. The department's ferry division said contractors expect work on the approximately $3 million project should be done by early April. The work comes after a failure of the ramp system on the Southport side of the ferry shut down the route for five weeks in August and September. The ferry closure will be a headache for tourists and commuters. What was a 30-minute trip over the water could take an hour-plus by road. Nearly 200,000 vehicles make the Southport-Fort Fisher crossing each year, the StarNews reports, citing state statistics.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: A county commission that recently voted to limit how many refugees it would accept voted Monday not to put the issue before voters in a nonbinding straw poll. The Bismarck Tribune reports the five-member Burleigh County Commission voted 3-2 against a potential ballot question relating to future refugee resettlement. The vote breakdown was the same as the commission vote last month not to accept more than 25 refugees in 2020. That vote came after a four-hour meeting where several refugees, in often emotional testimony, urged the commission to continue accepting new arrivals. Had the commission voted a total ban on refugee resettlement in Burleigh County, home to about 95,000 people and the capital city of Bismarck, refugee resettlement groups said they believe it would have been be the first local government to do so since President Donald Trump gave states and counties that power.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Gov. Mike DeWine has asked the state's Medicaid official to look into what can be done in response to the recent increase in the number of children without health insurance. The governor's directive came after a recent report showed Ohio's uninsured rate for infants, toddlers and preschoolers is now the third-highest in the nation, with nearly 12,000 more children without coverage in 2018 than in 2016, the Columbus Dispatch reports. DeWine said he asked Medicaid Director Maureen Corcoran to see what steps that we can take to deal with this and to see if there is a way to make re-enrollment easier so that it is not a hurdle for those looking to get insured. The number of children without health insurance coverage climbed to 5% in 2018 from 3.6% in 2016, according to report released in December by the Georgetown University Center for Children and Families.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Two days of meetings and new searches are planned this week for two 16-year-old girls missing and presumed dead for more than two decades, authorities said Monday. Investigators with the Craig County District Attorney's Office and the Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation will be joined by the U.S. Department of the Interior's Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement for Lauria Bible and Ashley Freeman in and around the former town of Picher, about 85 miles northeast of Tulsa, said district attorney spokeswoman Michelle Lowry. Lowry said a request from Republican U.S. Sen. Jim Inhofe of Oklahoma late last year prompted the federal agency's involvement. The OSMRE will use an underground camera and, if needed, lighting to examine the floors and walls of mine shafts in the area. Picher, which no longer exists as a town, was included in a federally funded buyout after a 2006 Army Corps of Engineers study revealed abandoned lead and zinc mines beneath the area had a high risk of caving in.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: Lagging snowfall early in the season could mean a tough, dry summer for farmers and ranchers around the state. The U.S. Department of Agriculture Resources Conservation Service says the amount of water from snow that's fallen in Oregon right now is just 45% of normal statewide, the Capitol Press reports. Water from melting snow is crucial for replenishing streams and reservoirs for farms and fish, particularly in eastern Oregon where the climate is drier. Every water basin is measuring below average for snow except for the Owyhee Basin in southeastern Oregon, which stands at 117% of normal. The lowest totals are in the Hood, Sandy and Lower Deschutes basins at 25% of normal and the Willamette Basin at 26%. The water year, as defined by hydrologists, begins Oct. 1 and runs through Sept. 30 of the following calendar year.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Voters in three Pennsylvania House districts will choose new state representatives during special elections scheduled for March, the state House speaker announced Tuesday. A top aide to Speaker Mike Turzai, R-Allegheny, said the March 17 date was chosen to fill seats that became vacant because the incumbents were elected in November to other offices. The seats were most recently held by Rep. Tedd Nesbit, R-Mercer; Rep. Gene DiGirolamo, R-Bucks; and Justin Walsh, R-Westmoreland. Nesbit and Walsh were elected to become county judges, and DiGirolamo is now a county commissioner. Rep. Tom Murt, R-Montgomery, will succeed DiGirolamo as chair of the Human Services Committee, and Rep. Gary Day, R-Lehigh, will chair Aging.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Nonprofits in the state have been awarded grants totaling nearly $300,000 for outreach to boost participation in the 2020 census. The Rhode Island Foundation announced the grants Monday from the Rhode Island Census 2020 Fund, a statewide, collaborative funding initiative. The goal is to protect the $3.8 billion a year Rhode Island receives in federal funding for education, health care, transportation and housing based on census data, the foundation said. Twenty-six organizations received funding for programs to reach hard-to-count communities, including the Alliance of Rhode Island Southeast Asians for Education in Providence, Progreso Latino in Central Falls, and Meals on Wheels in Providence. Nonprofits, municipalities, houses of worship, and public agencies including libraries and schools can apply for grants in the second round of funding.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nCharleston: The Citadel is evaluating the college's existing buildings, infrastructure and landscapes to create a long-term plan that will guide future building projects and campus renovations. The campus master plan will create a vision of what the public military college could look like 15 years from now, The Post and Courier reports. Once we have a plan in place, it will guide all of our facility decisions going forward, said Jeff Lamberson, vice president of facilities and engineering. The college finalized a $450,000 contract with Ayers Saint Gross, an architectural design firm spearheading the project, in October. College officials have talked with hundreds of students, faculty and staff in more than 35 focus-group meetings.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Legislators have invited the Crow Creek Sioux tribal chairman to deliver the annual State of the Tribes address after some tribal leaders threatened to boycott a planned address by a member of Gov. Kristi Noem's Cabinet. Lawmakers on Monday invited Lester Thompson Jr. to deliver the address next week. The move is a switch from plans to have Secretary of Tribal Relations Dave Flute give it. The annual speech is supposed to promote cooperation between the state government and the tribes but instead became a point of friction when tribal leaders objected to having a state employee give the speech. Last week, some tribal leaders said they would hold their own event called the Great Sioux Nation Tribal address. That event will still happen in Fort Pierre across the Missouri River from the Capitol but has been rescheduled for after the State of the Tribes address.\n\nTennessee\n\nTownsend: One of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park's most popular sites has been closed to all vehicles until repairs to a main access road tunnel are finished. The Cades Cove closure started Sunday night and is expected to last until March. Major repairs are needed for the internal drainage system in the 121-foot long Bote Mountain Tunnel on Laurel Creek Road, according to the National Park Service. The tunnel hasn't undergone significant work since it was built in 1948. The cove's campground also will be closed until March. The nearby Elkmont Campground and the Smokemont Campground in North Carolina will remain open year-round to accommodate displaced cove campers, according to WATE-TV.\n\nTexas\n\nDallas: A contempt of court charge has been dropped against the Dallas County district attorney over a television interview he gave on the eve of a high-profile murder trial involving a police officer. Both sides filed a motion to drop the contempt charge against Dallas County District Attorney John Creuzot, who gave an interview before the start of former officer Amber Guyger's murder trial despite a gag order by Judge Tammy Kemp. The white officer was convicted of murder for the shooting death of her unarmed black neighbor, Botham Jean, inside his own apartment. Kemp said in an order that the interview, in which Creuzot explained why he thought Guyger was correctly charged with murder rather than manslaughter, was a direct violation of the gag order she'd issued in the case.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: The state Department of Transportation has started making safety improvements near a homeless resource center where cars killed three men, officials said. The department has installed electronic message signs to urge drivers to be cautious and alert for pedestrians near the South Salt Lake center, The Salt Lake Tribune reports. Salt Lake City leaders called for immediate pedestrian safety improvements after three men were fatally struck while trying to cross the street near the center. Police believe all three men were homeless and seeking shelter at the center. Four crashes, including those involving the fatalities, have occurred in the area since the November opening of the 300-bed men's resource center, police said.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: A bakery is hosting a raffle to find the lucky person who gets to tear down a gingerbread village. In a first for Birchgrove Baking, the sweet treat establishment is selling customers tickets for the chance to win the right to destroy the village. Initially, after the holiday season was over, the bakery struggled to find a creative way to raze its gingerbread village. Birchgrove co-owner John Belding says the owners have in the past resorted to destroying it themselves, getting out their own tension from the hectic year. Sales from this year's raffle will go toward the Central Vermont Humane Society, an ongoing collaborator with Birchgrove Baking. Winners will be announced Friday.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: More people earned bachelor's degrees in the state last year than ever before. Data from the State Council of Higher Education for Virginia shows that a record number of degrees were awarded in science, technology, engineering, mathematics and health fields. During the 2018-19 school year, public and private nonprofit colleges and universities awarded 122,168 degrees and certificates – an increase of nearly 50% from a decade ago. In-state students accounted for 86,325, or more than 70%, of those awards. Bachelor's degrees accounted for 46% of the total, while graduate degrees made up 25%. Associate degrees made up 16%, and certificates made up 13%. The three most popular bachelor's degree programs remained unchanged from previous years: business administration and management; psychology; and biology/biological sciences. Those three majors accounted for 19% of all bachelor's degrees.\n\nWashington\n\nOlympia: The state Supreme Court on Monday swore in a new chief justice, as well as its first-ever Native American justice. The Spokesman-Review reports Justice Debra Stephens became the court's 57th chief justice. A former Appeals Court judge and adjunct professor of law at Gonzaga University, she called it the greatest privilege I can imagine. Raquel Montoya-Lewis, a former Whatcom County Superior Court judge who is a member of the Pueblo Iselta tribe of New Mexico, was sworn in at the same ceremony. Montoya-Lewis is the first Native American to serve on Washington's highest court and only the second to serve on any state supreme court in the nation. Stephens called it a historic day. Gov. Jay Inslee said Monday was a day when a daughter of Spokane ascends to chief justice, and the court gets Lewis-Montoya, a judicial superstar who is a good listener, decisive, caring and compassionate.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The Department of Natural Resources says anglers should expect trout stocked in state waterways during the winter months to be smaller than usual. A long dry spell across the state from late summer through fall is thought to have affected the average catchable size of the fish, Jim Hedrick, the division's hatchery supervisor, told the Charleston Gazette-Mail. When the drought broke in October, the hatcheries' water supplies were replenished and allowed workers to begin feeding trout at the normal rate. But winter weather soon slowed the growth rate again, Hedrick said. The growth rate is expected to return to normal as the weather gets warmer, he said. The division is also adding feed to try to increase trout size. Hedrick said each of the 31 streams and 30 lakes designated for January stockings will receive as many pounds of fish as last year.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Republicans decided Tuesday to place only President Donald Trump's name on the state's primary ballot this spring, setting up obstacles for any long-shot candidates to challenge him in the state. A committee made up of Republicans and Democrats met with state election officials in the Capitol to decide which candidates will be placed on the April 7 primary ballot. The Republican committee members submitted only Trump's name; he was approved on a unanimous voice vote. The Democratic committee members submitted 14 candidates. The Republican move will make it more difficult but not impossible for other GOP hopefuls such as former Massachusetts Gov. Bill Weld and former Illinois Rep. Joe Walsh to get on the GOP primary ballot. They could still be included if they each collect 8,000 signatures by Jan. 28.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: A school district has paid off more than $4,000 in student lunch debt after a crowd-sourced check bounced. The Casper Police Department has opened an investigation into the Feed Casper Students fundraising campaign on GoFundMe aimed at paying off the Natrona County School District's student lunch debt, The Casper Star-Tribune reports. The district accepted about $19,000 in fundraising donations in April, the same month the check bounced, school officials said. The district paid off the lunch debt for about 250 students out of its general fund, rather than reopen the outstanding debt for the students, officials said. A school district administrator made several attempts to reach the woman who started the fundraiser, Brittny French, authorities said. Multiple attempts by the Star-Tribune to contact French were unsuccessful last week, including through GoFundMe. Police asked anyone who had donated to the campaign to get in touch with police.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports
In between helping the Los Angeles Lakers win an NBA championship. LeBron James spent his energy on the NBA's quarantined campus speaking out on systemic racism.\n\nSo imagine James' feelings when Kenosha County District Attorney Michael Graveley announced that no charges would be filed against the police officer that shot Jacob Blake, a Black person who was then left paralyzed.\n\nTo hear what happened in Kenosha today was a blow to the heart and to the gut, James said following the Lakers' 94-92 win over the Memphis Grizzlies on Tuesday night. Not only to that community, but to us and to every Black person that has been a part of this process and seeing these outcomes for so long. Not only in the Black community, but in the white community as well who see moments like this happen.\n\nThe NBA restarted the season last summer partly to salvage its television revenue during the pandemic and partly to use that platform to address systemic racism. Then, players and coaches routinely spoke out against recent cases of police officers killing unarmed Black people, including George Floyd and Breonna Taylor. Teams and players also launched varying voting and community programs aimed to reduce racial inequality.\n\nIt sucks. We as a community tried to support the family and do everything we can to get justice for him, Lakers forward Anthony Davis said. For that to happen, it sucks for us. It feels like we let the family down.\n\nFor James, he took on a heightened role both because of his star power and his initiatives. He also launched More Than A Vote, an organization that reduces voting suppression and increased voting turnout in the Black community.\n\nIt's a blow to our community once again, James said. We've been here before. It sucks. We feel sorry for his family and that community itself. We want better. We believe we can get that.\n\nPICTURE PERFECT:Becky Hammon's historic moment as Spurs coach captured with great photo\n\nSPORTS NEWSLETTER:Sign up now to get top sports headlines delivered daily\n\nThe NBA's players believed the same thing after the Milwaukee Bucks walked out on their scheduled playoff game against the Orlando Magic after video showed police officers shooting Blake seven times in front of his family. The Bucks had conference calls with local politicians in hopes to enact police reforms. Following a passionate discussion among players about whether they should resume or cancel the rest of the season, James spoke with President Barack Obama, who urged them to keep its platform intact.\n\nThen, the National Basketball Players Association received more commitments from the NBA. They pledged to have each teams' arena or practice facility open as a voting site before and on Election Day, a commitment 23 out of 30 NBA teams fulfilled. The NBA's Board of Governors and NBPA also formed the NBA Foundation with an initial $300 million contribution dedicated to creating greater economic empowerment in the Black community. Teams have pledged to donate $30 million each year to the foundation for the next 10 years.\n\nNo wonder Lakers forward Wesley Matthews considered Tuesday's ruling to be truly disheartening, especially with all the work everybody had put in.\n\nWe can't lose our heads. We can't start rioting. We have to be calculated. We have to continue to keep our foot on the gas, said Matthews, who played with the Bucks last season when they staged the walkout. The flame is already lit. It just has to continue to keep burning and burning the right way. Not where anything can be sidetracked; not where we're damaging anything so that all the media attention can go to look at what is happening over here. Look at the facts and let's address the issues head on.\n\nStill, the NBA and NBPA tried to address these issues already.\n\nThe NBA and NBPA formed a social justice coalition consisting of players, coaches and owners to promote civic engagement and advocate for police and criminal justice reform. The NBPA also hoped teams could leverage relationships with local and state officials with passing legislation aimed at these issues.\n\nI'm sure and am very confident that (owner) Marc Lasry and the Milwaukee Bucks are doing their due diligence right now, especially with it happening in their own backyard, Matthews said. I'm very confident in that. It really is just tough. It really is disheartening. But leaders have to be leaders. Everybody has to take ownership in their own community. It can't just be those that have the platform. It's got to be everybody.\n\nThe Bucks released a statement on Tuesday, saying, the organization remains firmly against excessive use of force by law enforcement. Graveley defended the police officers' reaction, saying it was incontrovertible that Blake was armed with a razor blade-type knife when he was shot seven times.\n\nReoccurring instances of excessive use of force and immediate escalation when engaging the Black community must stop, the Bucks' statement read. We will continue to work to enact policy change so these incidents no longer exist. As an organization, we remain strongly committed to address issues of social injustice and anti-racism and to make meaningful change for African Americans and all marginalized members of our community.\n\nJames vowed to remain just as committed.\n\nMore than a Vote partnered with the NAACP Legal Defense Fund to recruit 40,000 poll workers and helped register Florida voters with felony records so long as they were unrelated to murder or sexual assault. It also oversaw voting turnout initiatives for the Georgia runoff elections held on Tuesday. And James added, we're not going to stop; we're always looking for opportunities to continue to grow not only in my community, but all over the world.\n\nThe best thing we were able to do in the bubble is we were able to stand together in strength and numbers with everything that was going on in America and everything that was going wrong in America, James said. We were able to voice those opinions and voice those facts every single day. I hope to continue that now being outside the bubble.\n\nMathews said the Lakers did not have a formal discussion about Tuesday's ruling before their game. But after speaking for only 84 seconds about the Lakers' win over the Grizzlies, James spoke for seven minutes about various social justice causes. James plans to speak out more regardless of any backlash he receives and any frustrated feelings he has regarding Tuesday's ruling.\n\nIt's unfortunate we have some people out there that would rather see hate than love, James said. It's something we won't ever be able to change. That's how life is built unfortunately. But if we can get the majority on one side and on the side of love than hate, we can do some special things.\n\nFollow USA TODAY NBA writer Mark Medina on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.

Roughly 80% of all Latinos living in the USA are American citizens, but media coverage of Hispanics tends to focus on immigration and crime, instead of how Latino families live, work and learn in their hometowns. Hecho en USA tells the stories of the nation's 59.9 million Latinos – a growing economic and cultural force, many of whom are born in the USA.\n\nLOS ANGELES – Preschool teacher Rosa Ramirez has a special way of asking her students to line up for playtime outside.\n\nPueden pararse si llevan puesto algo de color amarillo, como una abeja, she tells them.\n\nIn English, Ramirez would say, You can stand up if you are wearing yellow – like a bee. But this is the half of the school day in which she teaches exclusively in Spanish.\n\nHer students are not confused by her language choice. Most of the 4-year-olds wearing even a smidgen of yellow stand up as instructed.\n\nBilingual education programs can help children from all backgrounds become better students Research shows that dual-language programs where children learn both Spanish and English are especially helpful for Latino English-language learners. Editors note: Video has been updated to remove a student who opted out of appearing in photos and video. Harrison Hill, USA TODAY\n\nThe preschool dual-language program at Gates Street Early Education Center in Lincoln Heights, one of Los Angeles' oldest neighborhoods with dense populations of Latino and Asian residents, is part of a growing number of bilingual education models taking root in California and across the country. Many of them are designed to serve students from Spanish-speaking families, as well as students from other cultures, under mounting evidence that learning two languages can help people from all backgrounds become stronger students.\n\nRoughly 3.8 million students in U.S. schools are native Spanish-speakers who are not proficient in English. They make up the bulk of the approximately 5 million students nationwide identified as English language learners, the fastest-growing demographic in schools – and the lowest-performing, as judged by achievement tests and graduation rates.\n\nSixty-seven percent of students with limited English skills graduated high school after four years in 2016, compared with 84% of all students, according to federal data.\n\nLanguage experts recommend how to improve those outcomes: More high-quality, long-term dual-language programs can close the achievement gap in literacy between English learners and native English speakers after five to six years, according to research.\n\nCopy text Copy this quote's text The quote has been copied Tweet Facebook LinkedIn Share this article on LinkedIn Reddit Share this article on Reddit Email Email this story Share Share this story Tara Fortune, immersion program director at the University of Minnesota's Center for Advanced Research on Language Acquisition If we can make children feel more whole and more ready and more accepted and welcomed and validate their prior knowledge and prior learning experiences, then we've gone a long way to making them ready to learn over the course of a lifetime. Quote icon\n\nThe programs can be tough to implement. Hurdles include a debate over the best way to teach English learners, public hostility against those who speak a native language other than English, shortages of bilingual teachers and even the fact that dual-language programs often grow fastest in areas where upper-income parents ask for them. That's good for children who participate, but it worries advocates who want to see language-minority students have equal access.\n\nPressure is mounting in states where numbers of Latino English learners have surged. Mississippi, South Carolina, Kentucky, Kansas and Maryland have seen the number of English learners more than double from 2005 to 2015, according to federal data.\n\nIf we can make children feel more whole and more ready and more accepted and welcomed and validate their prior knowledge and prior learning experiences, then we've gone a long way to making them ready to learn over the course of a lifetime, says Tara Fortune, immersion program director at the University of Minnesota's Center for Advanced Research on Language Acquisition.\n\nRosa Ramirez is a preschool teacher at Gates Street Early Education Center in Los Angeles and teaches a class through a bilingual education program. Harrison Hill, USA TODAY\n\nWhat's the best way to teach language skills to students?\n\nFrom 2000 to 2015, the percentage of Latino students enrolled in public elementary and secondary schools swelled from 16% to 26%. The percentage of white students fell from 61% to 49%, according to the National Center for Education Statistics.\n\nFederal law requires districts to identify students with limited English skills and to serve them with an equitable, research-based program. Practices vary widely between states and districts.\n\nSome schools use transitional bilingual programs, which teach academics such as science, math and social studies in Spanish for a few years before transitioning students to mainstream classes.\n\nMany use English as a Second Language instruction, a set of methods and techniques originally developed to teach English to foreign diplomats and university students. Instruction happens in English, and teachers have to be certified.\n\nThen there are English-only models, which call for separating language-minority children and having them learn all subjects only in English.\n\nIt's very political because the public doesn't really understand the process of second language acquisition, says Maria Coady, an associate professor of bilingual education at the University of Florida, a state where almost 300,000 students are learning English.\n\nBut the research is really clear on what works, she says. Students learning English benefit from high-quality, long-term bilingual instruction programs.\n\nNationwide, there were about 3,000 dual-language programs as of 2015, says Santiago Wood, executive director of the National Association for Bilingual Education. That's a big increase over about 300 operating around 2001, he says, but not enough to help the surging numbers of English learners.\n\nIn some districts, the popularity of dual-language programs has led to concerns that English learners, who often come from lower-income families, will be pushed out by native English speakers from more affluent families.\n\nAt Oyster-Adams Bilingual School in Washington, for example, just 24% of students are English learners, according to school data.\n\nOyster's program was created to serve the Latino population, but gentrification over the past 40 years drove low-income families from the neighborhood, says Vanessa Bertelli, co-founder of a grassroots organization that advocates for more dual-language programs.\n\nThere are more than 10,000 students learning English in D.C., and even if every one of those students enrolled in a dual-immersion school, there wouldn't be enough seats for them, says Bertelli of the DC Language Immersion Project.\n\nThere's a lot of energy wasted on trying to allocate the pie, when what we should be doing is making more pies, she says.\n\nYou might also like: Google Assistant gets bilingual and responds in the language pair you use\n\nSonya Bertini, a bilingual special ed teacher at Vineland High School in New Jersey, works with a student on Sept. 30, 2019. Adam Monacelli, USA TODAY Network\n\nLearning 'English by osmosis' does not work for most students\n\nThe USA has a complicated history when it comes to Spanish in public schools.\n\nThe country does not have an official language, but for many decades, some states made English the law of their land by embracing practices that restricted or punished children for speaking a language other than English in schools.\n\nThe idea was time on task: put 'em in there, and they'll learn English by osmosis, Coady says. Sometimes that works for very young kids. But for a 10th grader coming into high school only speaking Mandarin who needs to graduate in three years? There's no way that child has equitable access.\n\nIn the late 1990s and early 2000s, a focus on English-only instruction became more pronounced as a wave of anti-immigrant sentiment led to ballot initiatives in several states that effectively outlawed teaching in multiple languages.\n\nCalifornia voters approved a ban on bilingual education in public schools in 1998. Known as Proposition 227, the policy barred many children of Latino immigrants and Latino immigrant children from bilingual education, says Ramon Martinez, an assistant professor at Stanford University's Graduate School of Education in California.\n\nLed by California businessman Ron Unz and supported by the lobbying group ProEnglish, which favors English-only classes and the adoption of English as the official language of state and national government, similar restrictive bans passed in Arizona and Massachusetts.\n\nCopy text Copy this quote's text The quote has been copied Tweet Facebook LinkedIn Share this article on LinkedIn Reddit Share this article on Reddit Email Email this story Share Share this story Maria Coady, an associate professor of bilingual education at the University of Florida It's very political because the public doesn't really understand the process of second language acquisition.

Quote icon\n\nRamirez, the Gates Early Learning preschool teacher, was a student in East Los Angeles during the ban in California. She was taught in Spanish and English through second grade before Proposition 227 went into effect when she was about 8. After that, she struggled.\n\nI remember my third grade, I just kind of shut down because I had an idea and comprehended English, but I didn't feel confident to speak it, Ramirez says, holding back tears. Now coming back and working where I grew up, I feel like many years ago I was where my kids are now. I want to make sure they don't go through the lack of confidence I faced because of the language.\n\nCalifornia voters repealed the state's ban on bilingual education in 2016. Massachusetts overturned its English-only instruction law in 2017. Arizona officials, many of whom fought fervently for years to keep Spanish instruction out of public schools, are watering down its law, in part because outcomes for English learners there have been dismal.\n\nAt last count by the federal Department of Education, Arizona had the lowest graduation rate for English learners of all states: In 2016, only 32% of them graduated in four years.\n\nOur English language learner population was performing worse on tests than our special education population, says Republican state Sen.

Adam Monacelli, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nEnglish learners make progress\n\nThe city of Vineland, New Jersey, about an hour south of Philadelphia, represents changing U.S. demographics. More than 60% of the 11,000 students in Vineland Public Schools are Latino, reflecting a long-standing Puerto Rican community and a swell of migrants from Central America in recent years. Many of those new arrivals are teens who came without their parents and have no recent history of attending school.\n\nSome of the school's parents work in the surrounding eggplant and cauliflower fields during the day. Some are highly transient, migrating with the seasons wherever the work is.\n\nLike many districts in New Jersey, Vineland hosts a transitional bilingual program for students who arrive with limited English skills. This year, about 800 students are enrolled. They learn their core academics in Spanish – often right next door to classes where the same content is taught in English – but they have time built into the day for speaking, reading and writing in English.\n\nMore: Vineland ESL, bilingual programs win state honors\n\nDuring the first week of school this fall at Vineland High School, students in a 10th grade bilingual algebra class solved problems written on the board while their teacher wandered around, greeting students and checking their homework.\n\nDid you finish them all, Rafael? she asked one student in English.\n\nShe turned and saw that another had neglected to carry a negative number through an equation. She tapped the student's answer: Y un negativo, no? she said.\n\nVineland's bilingual program has been bolstered by JoAnne Negrin, supervisor of bilingual education. Since she was hired seven years ago, she made sure that all new textbook purchases were available in both Spanish and English, so students in the bilingual program could learn at the same pace as their English-speaking peers.\n\nShe made sure bilingual teachers in the lower grades weren't delivering the same lessons in both languages over the course of the day.\n\nIf you're repeating lessons every day, you're never going to help these children make progress, Negrin says.\n\nVineland's English learners show some of the highest academic improvement scores in the district, she says. Last year, the students met all the targets outlined on the state report cards.\n\nPeople sometimes question, 'How are students going to learn English if they spend the whole day learning in Spanish?'  Negrin says. Well, our data shows that proficiency in literacy in the child's first language is a very good indicator of how well that child is going to eventually learn English.\n\nOther small victories are happening. Kevin Sanchez, 17, who arrived from the Dominican Republic last year with limited English, won first place in a regional science fair after investigating how windmills worked and building a model of one.\n\nSanchez almost backed out from the fair when he learned that participants were required to make an oral presentation to the judges.

The district has long supported a dual-language, Spanish-English program in all its elementary schools, which has helped close the gap in the early grades for those who are learning English. Students can choose to continue in the bilingual program in high school.\n\nAfter students graduate, they can continue their bilingual studies in Spanish and English at the University of Texas-Rio Grande Valley.\n\nThe university added a minor in bilingual secondary education, says Janine Schall, chair of the bilingual and literacy studies department.\n\nMost of our students come from the local community and plan to return to teach in local K-12 schools after graduation, Schall said.\n\nThe university can't expand fast enough, she says. Would-be bilingual teachers often face challenges such as the cost of their education and the tests they have to take to become certified in bilingual education.\n\nWe know that there's a greater need for bilingual education teachers than we can meet right now, Schall says.\n\nLinda Ortiz and her daughter, Sophie, prepare to play Lotería, a popular Spanish game.

Fatima Hussein\n\nThe Indianapolis Star\n\nINDIANAPOLIS — Eight years into their relationship, John Scott decided to add his girlfriend's name to the title of 10 acres he had long since inherited. But the Indiana man had a condition: She couldn't cheat on him.\n\nAnd they put it in writing.\n\nAbout two months after they signed the handwritten contract, his girlfriend, Tina Hemingway, became pregnant. By another man.\n\nTheir relationship was about to end. Their court battle was about to begin.\n\nHemingway delivered the child in January 2013. She moved out in early June 2013, and that same month, Scott sent Hemingway written notice that she was in breach of the contract and must return her interest in the property to him, according to court documents.\n\nDonald Sterling sues NBA, which already has counter\n\nHemingway filed a suit to partition the property, and subsequently, Scott filed a counterclaim for breach of contract.\n\nScott, of Madison, Ind., won round one last year when Jefferson Circuit Court judge Darrell M. Auxier ruled in his favor. Hemingway filed an appeal in April.\n\nNeither party responded to requests for comment.\n\nIn her appeal, Hemingway argued that the property deed itself extinguished the contract and that the contract was unenforceable based on public policy that prohibits contracts in consideration of meretricious sexual services.\n\nBut the three appellate court judges disagreed with Hemingway that the agreement was based on a sexual contract and affirmed Auxier's ruling.\n\nThis contract is akin to a prenuptial agreement, in which the parties resolve ahead of time their relative rights in property should the relationship dissolve, states the decision, authored by Judge Terry A. Crone.\n\nBlind Ind. woman faces eviction after $43 land sale\n\nEven so, we observe that the contract does not require either party to perform sexual services. Nor does it require either party to abstain from all sexual activity, Crone wrote. Rather, it simply lists cheating by either party as one of the acts constituting breach.\n\nPrenuptial contracts forbidding extramarital affairs are nothing new to the court system. However, depending on the locale, they can have varying results.\n\nIn a 2002 case, Diosdado v. Diosdado, a California trial court found that an infidelity clause in a post-nuptial agreement was not enforceable because it was contrary to the public policy underlying California's no-fault divorce laws. However, in other states, infidelity laws reportedly are enforceable, provided the infidelity can be proven and the agreement does not violate state law.\n\nIn this case, the judges concluded that the appellant was inarguably unfaithful. In Crone's words, Hemingway wasted little time in breaching the contract.\n\nFollow Fatima Hussein on Twitter: @fatimathefatima
Jason Hall\n\nThe Motley Fool\n\nThe oldest Baby Boomers are now in retirement age, while the youngest are in their 50s. Considering that many Baby Boomers don't have substantial retirement savings, Social Security is set to remain a critically important source of income for millions of that generation as they retire over the next couple of decades.\n\nHere's a closer look at three important facts that play a big role in how well Social Security will work for you and how much income you'll get. Whether you're ready to retire soon or still a decade or more away, these three facts about Social Security will affect you.\n\nFull retirement age is set to change soon\n\nOnce you turn 62, you become eligible for Social Security retirement, but at a reduction to your full benefit, which you become eligible for at full retirement age. For anyone born in 1943-1954, the full retirement age is 66. But for anyone born in 1955 or later, you should know that full retirement age is set to increase.\n\nStarting in 2020, anyone born in 1955 will reach full retirement age at 66 years, two months. For those born in 1956, they'll have to wait another two months, to 66 years, four months. This two-month increase will continue until people born in 1960 or later reach the new full retirement age of 67 in 2027.\n\nWhy does this matter for baby boomers? Because it will affect how much of their benefit they'll receive, based on how early you retire. For instance, someone born in 1954 would have turned 62 in 2016, thus eligible for Social Security at a reduced level. Since their full retirement age is 66, they would receive 75% of their full benefit if they retired at age 62.\n\nBut someone born in 1958, for instance, would have a full retirement age of 66 years, eight months. But if that person retired at 62, they would only get 71.7% of their full benefit. It may not sound like much difference, but if you live to age 80, that's about $7,100 less on a $1,000-per-month benefit, not even including cost-of-living adjustments.\n\nIn other words, it's very important to know what your full retirement age is, no matter what age you plan to retire. A few months' difference could make thousands of dollars in difference in how much money you get.\n\nThis affects your spouse, too\n\nWhether your spouse plans to retire on their own work record or on yours, the rules still apply when it comes to full retirement age and what their benefit will be. In other words, if your spouse is younger than you, it may be necessary for them to continue to work – or at least delay filing for Social Security if they don't work – in order to make sure the monthly benefit will be sufficient to cover your expenses.\n\nThis is particularly important to consider if your spouse will file on your work record, and is likely to outlive you. Here's what the Social Security Administration says about the survivor's benefit and how it could be lower if you retire before full retirement age.\n\nIf your spouse started receiving retirement benefits before their full retirement age, we cannot pay you the full retirement age benefit amount from their record. The maximum survivors benefit is limited to what they would receive if they were still alive.\n\nIn other words, before you decide to take Social Security early, you may want to consider how it would impact your surviving spouse's income if they are likely to outlive you and would receive the survivor's benefit.\n\nIf you're likely to live very long or die very early, it may affect when you should take Social Security\n\nSocial Security is structured to provide a lot of flexibility, since you can take benefits as early as age 62 or as late as age 70, depending on what works for your situation. And while the monthly benefit is significantly lower if you file early and much higher if you delay, the total dollars paid to someone who lives the average lifespan wouldn't be that much different.\n\nBut if you're an outlier with a significant chance of either living much longer than average or dying younger, that could affect what makes the most sense for you. Here's a table that breaks down where you would maximize your total benefit, based on filing age and age of death:\n\nThis table is based on a full retirement age of 66 and a full retirement age benefit of $1,000 per month. And as you can see, if you aren't likely to live beyond your mid-70s, it's almost certainly in your best interest to file at age 62 (with the caveat that you should consider how that would affect your surviving spouse). On the other end of the spectrum, if you're fortunate enough that you'll probably live well into your 80s or beyond, delaying Social Security will almost certainly mean more total income, not to mention a bigger check later in life when your ability to earn a wage is far more limited.\n\nTake a balanced approach and consider all the repercussions\n\nThe facts above are largely about the financial impact of when you take Social Security. And while the financial part should play a primary role in when you file, it's not the only thing that matters. We must each also consider what kind of retirement we want, the value of other retirement assets and what we want to do with the time we have before we die.\n\nAnd the more you understand about Social Security before you retire, the more time you'll have to plan and prepare. If you want to maximize the quality and quantity of your retirement years, start today – no matter how far from retirement you are.\n\nTry any of our Foolish newsletter services free for 30 days.

The Editorial Board\n\nUSA Today\n\nThere are some good reasons to turn down the California teachers who asked the Supreme Court on Monday to let them stop paying union dues.\n\nFor one thing, the case is a thinly disguised attempt by conservatives to weaken public employee unions, which tend to overwhelmingly support Democrats.\n\nFor another, deciding for the teachers would allow non-members to be free riders who could collect the wages and benefits the union negotiates without having to help pay the union's costs.\n\nAnd, finally, a ruling for the teachers would overturn an almost 40-year-old Supreme Court precedent that is the basis for collective bargaining agreements affecting millions of public employees around the country.\n\nAll that said, though, the justices would do well to side with the non-union teachers, who have a First Amendment right not to be compelled to support political speech they disagree with. That's at the core of the constitutional issue at stake here.\n\nSupreme Court education case threatens local control: Column\n\nThe case turns on whether unions can force non-members to pay an agency fee equal to the cost of representing them on purely work-related matters such as pay and working conditions.\n\nPublic employees don't have to join a union, even if a majority of their colleagues vote to have it represent them. In California and other states, though, the law compels the union to represent everyone — members and non-members alike — in collective bargaining. And in California and some 20 other states, unions are allowed to collect some dues from non-members for that representation.\n\nThat arrangement was blessed by the court in 1977, when the justices said unions couldn't require non-members to pay to support a union's political activities, such as backing political candidates, but could be charged for their fair share of bargaining costs.\n\nThe teachers who brought the current case say that decision got it wrong, because there's no real distinction between a public employee union's political and non-political activities. When bargaining for taxpayer money, everything is political: Paying teachers more means spending less on something else, which is a political decision. Furthermore, the teachers bitterly resent having to support many of the unions' workplace priorities, such as making it nearly impossible to fire bad teachers with seniority.\n\nThe court's conservative justices embraced the everything-is-politics argument Monday, and a majority seemed inclined to rule against the unions. Chief Justice John Roberts said even minor matters such as working hours or mileage reimbursements are always a public policy issue, and Justice Antonin Scalia agreed that the pay, benefits and conditions public employee unions negotiate are necessarily political questions.\n\nWill public employee unions wither away if the court rules they can't collect fees from non-members? The evidence strongly suggests not.\n\nThe nation's 25 right-to-work states already bar public employee unions from requiring membership or collecting agency fees, but those unions remain reasonably robust anyway. In fact, there's a compelling argument that taking away the right to force non-members to pay dues makes unions work harder to be responsive to prospective members.\n\nUndoing the 1977 decision would be the correct call for individual rights, and it might just improve public education.\n\nUSA TODAY's editorial opinions are decided by its Editorial Board, separate from the news staff.

From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: A judge on Tuesday set a final hearing in a lawsuit over control of the Alabama Democratic Party. Montgomery Circuit Judge Greg Griffin scheduled the hearing for Jan. 30. The hearing could signal that a resolution is on the way in the legal dispute over who is party chair. Longtime state party leader Nancy Worley had filed the lawsuit to block state Rep. Chris England from taking control as party chair. A revamped governing board of the party elected England as chair this fall, but Worley and her supporters maintained his election was illegitimate. The ongoing feud has pitted longtime party leaders, such as Worley and Joe Reed, against an upstart faction. The Democratic National Committee supports England and recognizes him as state chair. Barry Ragsdale, an attorney representing the defendants in Worley's suit, said last month that England is functioning as party chair.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: Alaska experienced its warmest year on record, according to federal climate officials.The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in its U.S. Climate report said Alaska had a statewide average temperature of 32.2 degrees, 6.2 degrees above the long-term average. It also surpassed the previous record statewide average temperature of 31.9 set in 2016, the agency said. Four of the last six years in Alaska have been record warm years, NOAA said. Ten cities experienced their warmest years ever, including Anchorage, Fairbanks, Utqiagvik, Kotzebue, King Salmon, Bethel, Northway, McGrath, Kodiak and Cold Bay. Alaska set the record despite a December that featured temperatures closer to average, NOAA said. NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Information compiled the annual summary. Among the other highlights was rainfall in other states. The contiguous 48 states experienced the second-wettest year on record with 34.78 inches, just 0.18 inches less than the total for the wettest year set in 1973.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: The National Weather Service said there were seven confirmed tornadoes in Maricopa and Pinal counties last year, the most in nearly five decades. Meteorologists said last year's total is second only to the 10 confirmed tornadoes that hit the Phoenix metro area in 1972. They said all of the 2019 tornadoes were considered weak, ranking as either F0 or F1 in intensity. But in June 1972, an F2 tornado damaged about 200 homes in Paradise Valley and caused extensive damage to canals and power lines in Scottsdale and east Phoenix. The National Weather Service in Phoenix has data on tornadoes going back to 1950. Meteorologists said there were five confirmed tornadoes in the metro Phoenix area in both 1992 and 1993 with four tornadoes in 1971. Tornadoes are considered a rare event because the Phoenix area generally doesn't get the wind shear and unstable air mass needed to whip up the twisters.\n\nArkansas\n\nFayetteville: The Washington County jail has temporarily suspended its work-release program to free up more bed space in the facility, which has been hindered by overcrowding. Washington County Sheriff Tim Helder said the move will open up 24 beds, with some detainees being released if eligible and others moved into the jail's general population. The sheriff told the Northwest Arkansas Democrat-Gazette that a recent increase in the number of sex offenders housed at the county jail prompted the decision because sex offenders must be housed separately from other detainees. The county jail has 710 beds, but because of legal requirements to separate certain detainees, it's considered full when the facility is 80% full, or at 568 detainees, the sheriff's office said. On Monday, the number of detainees reached 792, authorities said.\n\nCalifornia\n\nDana Point: A baby gray whale heading south with its mother was spotted swimming alongside dolphins and sea lions off the Southern California coast. Crew members on a whale-watching boat recorded video of the pair in about 100 feet of water near Salt Creek Beach in Dana Point on Tuesday. Capt. Frank Brennan aboard Dana Wharf's Ocean Adventure estimated that the calf was just a day or so old. You could still see the fetal folds on it behind the blowhole, he said of the young whale. Brennan told the Orange County Register he followed the pair as white-sided dolphins stopped feeding to check the whales out. The dolphins and whales were then joined by a group of sea lions. The whales are migrating to the lagoons of Baja, Mexico.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: Wildlife officials have discovered evidence of wolves living in northwestern Colorado after hunters reported a suspected pack and residents found a scavenged elk carcass. The Colorado Parks and Wildlife Department announced the discoveries Wednesday, suggesting a pack of gray wolves might be residing in the state, The Denver Post reported. The news was first reported Tuesday by the Craig Press. The hunters provided a video shot in October of two wolves shown near the Wyoming and Utah borders, officials said. It was the first time in a few years multiple wolves were seen traveling together in Colorado, officials said. The announcement comes days after state election officials placed a measure to reintroduce wolves on this year's ballot, officials said. The ballot will ask voters whether to require state wildlife commissioners to reintroduce gray wolves by the end of 2023 on public land in western Colorado, officials said. State wildlife officials have studied the possibility of reintroducing wolves in Colorado and decided to oppose such efforts, officials said. Local leaders in 23 counties have also opposed reintroduction.\n\nConnecticut\n\nKillingly: The Killingly Board of Education voted to bring back a controversial Native American-themed athletic mascot. The board decided to reinstate the Redmen mascot at a meeting Wednesday, the Norwich Bulletin reported. In October, the same board approved the new Red Hawks mascot after it was overwhelmingly approved by students at Killingly High School. Several students, faculty members and local tribal representatives have criticized the original mascot as inappropriate, racist and stereotypical. It featured the profile of a Native American man wearing a headdress. Newly elected Republican members of the education board made a campaign promise to reverse the change. The board, with a Republican majority, held a public meeting on Dec. 11 where it voted to remove the Red Hawks mascot but tied on whether to return to the original mascot. More than a dozen people, including students and Native American representatives, spoke out against the decision to keep original mascot at the meeting. They also sought some other compromise, the Bulletin reported. At the Wednesday meeting, the board also voted to appoint a subcommittee that would update the high school logo so it doesn't portray Native Americans in a negative stereotype.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington:A record number of vehicles crossed the Delaware Memorial Bridge from New Jersey into the First State last year. In 2019, 18,288,314 vehicles drove through the southbound toll plaza, cruising past the 2016 record of 17.8 million, according to the Delaware River and Bay Authority. Put another way – if you lined up every one of those cars (assuming each is an average of 14.75 feet) it would stretch more than 51,000 miles. That is twice the Earth's circumference, with a road trip from Delaware to Myrtle Beach, S.C. to spare. The bridge also had a record for a month in August, handling more than 1.8 million vehicles, surpassing the August 2003 record by 27,000. Officials said the record traffic volume could be associated with an improving economy and stable gasoline prices in addition to favorable beach weather. All those vehicles means a good chunk of change in toll revenue. Last year, the net total was an estimated $132.8 million, up roughly $27 million from the previous year. For passenger vehicles, the one-way fare is $5. Tolls are paid by vehicles traveling from New Jersey into Delaware.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington:Neighbors in a Northeast D.C. community quickly mobilized to help their neighbors who lost everything in a raging fire Sunday, WUSA-TV reported. Neighbors donated everything, from school supplies to toiletries. James Caviness-Bey was working overnights at Wal-Mart when he got word of the fire, with his family still inside their Madison street home. But on Wednesday night, he was able to thank D.C. firefighters for their quick response. He also recognized the person he calls the real hero: his wife, who ran back into their burning home when she realized their 2-year-old grandson was still inside. With the flames intensifying, Edwina Caviness-Bey dropped her grandson from the second floor window into her son's arms. From there, she had no choice but to jump out. She had second-degree burns, a fractured pelvis and wrist, and is still in the intensive care unit preparing for surgery. Caviness-Bey, his son and grandson all got to thank their neighbors Wednesday night. Even the family dog, whom for hours they thought had died in the blaze, made an appearance. Neighbors are planning another donation drive to support this family in the coming days. In the meantime, they have set up a GoFundMe page.\n\nFlorida\n\nWest Palm Beach: Doctors told a woman she had a better chance of winning the lottery than of giving birth to two sets of twins in the same year. But Alexzandria Wolliston said she won the jackpot with the births of Mark and Malakhi in March and Kaylen and Kaleb in December. Oh, yes, I feel like I hit the twin lottery, Wolliston told WPTV. She said her 3-year-old daughter helped her prepare for the double dose of twins. Two months after the first set of twins arrived, Wolliston said she learned about the second set. They were born in West Palm Beach on Dec. 27. Wolliston said Kaleb was dismissed from the hospital on Monday and she's hoping to bring Kaylen home soon. She said she recently learned that both of her grandmothers lost twin boys at birth, which makes her believe her four babies are a blessing from above. I always say that I feel like my grandmothers gave me their kids because two sets of twins and their twins passed away, she said. I feel like they just sent them down for me.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Leaders of the African Methodist Episcopal Church forgave $4 million in debt owed by a college it founded in Atlanta. The financial boost for Morris Brown College was announced Tuesday night, news outlets reported. In exchange, the college agreed to establish a $1.5 million scholarship for AME church members. Morris Brown College lost its accreditation in 2002. Interim president Kevin James launched an effort last year to become accredited again. An official told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution that the debt forgiveness will help. The Georgia Conference of the African Methodist Episcopal Church founded Morris Brown College in 1881, the newspaper reported. The college has about 40 students enrolled, according to news outlets.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Improvements in programs to address Hawaii's homeless population have allowed the state to fall from first to second in the national ranking of per capita homelessness, officials said. State homeless coordinator Scott Morishige informed lawmakers Tuesday that New York now holds the top position, The Honolulu Star-Advertiser reported. Morishige presented the data to the Hawaii Homelessness Summit for both houses of the state Legislature. The summit is designed to help lawmakers evaluate the success of programs funded by the Legislature and consider other solutions to homelessness. Placements of homeless people into permanent housing in Hawaii increased in 2018 from nearly 4,000 to more than 7,000. The state appears to have exceeded 7,000 placements again in 2019, he said. After trending upward from 2013 to 2016, Hawaii's official Point in Time count of homeless people showed a decrease over the past four years. The decrease corresponds with similar increases in housing placements over the same period and is reflected in other surveys related to homelessness, Morishige said. There has also been a nearly 40% reduction in homeless families with minor children since 2016.\n\nIdaho\n\nKellogg:Shoshone County Sheriff Mike Gunderson told KHQ-TV that a third body buried under an avalanche at a resort was located Thursday by searchers in a helicopter. But that body has not yet been identified and authorities are not sure it is the person who was reported missing on Wednesday, Gunderson said. He said there were no other reports of missing persons on the mountain. The Silver Mountain Resort said it received a telephone call Wednesday morning from a concerned family member of the missing skier who was confirmed to be skiing there at the time of the avalanche. An avalanche happened at about 11 a.m. Tuesday on Wardner Peak, an area of the resort where the ski runs are rated at the highest difficulty level, according to resort officials. The runs had just been opened for a short period after crews performed avalanche control blasting in the area Tuesday morning, using explosives to trigger avalanches in hopes of leaving only the stable snow layers on the runs, officials said. Rescue crews and volunteers searched the avalanche area Tuesday with dogs and probes. The resort previously said five people had been recovered with minor injuries but said Wednesday afternoon that there were four people. Another skier was discovered Tuesday under about 10 feet of snow and did not survive. Yet another was found after dark. He was taken to a local hospital and pronounced dead. Experts said most avalanche survivors are dug out within 30 minutes. Names of the victims have not been released. Silver Mountain Resort is located about 60 miles east of Spokane, Washington, along Interstate 90 in the Idaho Panhandle.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: O'Hare and Midway international airports have added boxes where travelers can dispose of recreational marijuana before they board their flights. The cannabis amnesty boxes, as they're called, were installed at each airport last week, just as legal marijuana sales began in Illinois. The boxes are located just past the airports' Transportation Security Administration checkpoints, the Chicago Tribune reported. Although police aren't targeting travelers with cannabis, and it's not illegal to have it at the airport, possessing is still illegal under federal law, and air space is regulated by the federal government, Chicago Police Department spokeswoman Maggie Huynh said. The boxes give people an opportunity to ensure that they're not breaking federal law and won't run into an issue when they land at their destination, she said. The boxes are owned by the Department of Aviation and serviced by the police. Police officers will regularly empty the boxes, file a report for the items inside and dispose of any surrendered marijuana like they would narcotics, Huynh said. Illinois residents can legally possess up to 30 grams of marijuana, or about an ounce, in Illinois and out-of-state residents can have half that.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis:Family members of Hoosier bank robber John Dillinger have dropped their lawsuit seeking rights to open his grave at Crown Hill Cemetery. The lawsuit, filed in August by Dillinger nephew Michael C. Thompson, was initially dismissed without prejudice by Marion County Superior Court Judge Timothy Oakes on Dec. 4, but Thompson was granted an extension of time to file an amended complaint. That deadline would have been Jan. 15. But on Tuesday, a motion to voluntarily dismiss the lawsuit was submitted to the court on Thompson's behalf. It has been granted, effectively putting the issue to rest. Since the lawsuit was dismissed without prejudice, the family could revisit the issue in court. It's unknown what Thompson's plans are moving forward or how this affects the status of the proposed documentary. Attempts to reach the Thompson family and their attorney, Andrea Simmons, were unsuccessful. Crown Hill Cemetery objected to plans to exhume Dillinger's body, citing a duty to ensure the safety and integrity of the grounds and those buried there. In a written statement sent to IndyStar, cemetery management said they were pleased the matter has been resolved. Dillinger, born in Indianapolis in 1903, gained notoriety after a string of bank robberies in 1933 and several high-profile escapes from police custody. His name became legend when FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover labeled him Public Enemy No. 1, but his life of crime came to an end when police and federal agents ambushed him outside Chicago's Biograph Theater on July 22, 1934. Rumors have swirled for decades about the identity of the man killed in Chicago and buried in Crown Hill Cemetery. Efforts allegedly made by Dillinger to alter his appearance – including plastic surgery and burning off his fingerprints with acid – have led some historians and Dillinger enthusiasts to believe the body belonged to a doppelganger. Earlier this year, the FBI took the rare step of issuing a statement regarding the case, acknowledging the common myth that there was a Dillinger lookalike killed that night, but such claims have been advanced with only circumstantial evidence.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines:It will cost more to attend the Iowa State Fair this year. Gate prices for adults will rise to $14 from $12 last year, and tickets for children ages 6 to 11 will increase to $8 from $6, the fair announced Wednesday. Advance purchase prices are going up a dollar: to $9 for adults and $5 for children ages 6 to 11. Children 5 and under still will get in free. Building and security improvements, roads and entertainment are driving the increases, said the fair's marketing director, Mindy Williamson. There will be ticket discounts on some days for certain groups, including veterans on Aug. 17 and Older Iowans Day on Aug. 19. The fair runs Aug. 13-23 this year.\n\nKansas\n\nWichita: An animal rescue group said an emaciated dog is recovering after he was found in a locked kennel that was thrown in a dumpster. The Wichita Animal Action League said in a Facebook post that the pit bull was found Wednesday at an apartment complex and taken to a veterinarian, where he is eating food as fast as it's put in front of him. He is around 2 years old and weighs just over 20 pounds, less than half the amount a dog of his size should weigh.The post described the dog as very sweet and loving. The group is asking for donations for his medical care. The post said the dog is dehydrated and will need slow, small meals over a long period of time because feeding him too quickly could be dangerous. It will likely be months before he is eligible for adoption. Wichita Officer Charley Davidson said an investigation is underway.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville:A billboard calling on Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to vote to remove President Donald Trump from office is making its rounds in Louisville this week. Trump broke the law, according to the billboard, which includes McConnell's face. Senator McConnell, don't help him cover it up. Vote to convict & remove. The mobile billboard appears on a white van sponsored by four progressive organizations: Need to Impeach, Daily Kos, MoveOn and Public Citizen. Organizers said it will be parked along West Broadway through Saturday. It will make stops in front of McConnell's office and also go to Bishop Lane in front of Jefferson County Republican Headquarters. The four organizations are spending more than $400,000 on the billboard and ad campaign, according to a press release. McConnell has said he wants a quick trial that would have the Senate first hear arguments from the prosecution and defense before deciding if witnesses should be called – conditions Democrats oppose.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: John White, who helped strengthen the role of charter schools, backed a taxpayer-funded tuition voucher program for private schools and oversaw overhauls of the state's school accountability efforts, said he is stepping down as Louisiana's education superintendent. He told state Board of Elementary and Secondary Education members in a letter that he will leave the job March 11. He did not state his reasons. The board said a search for his replacement would begin immediately and the process will be discussed at an upcoming meeting. White can point to numerous improvements made during his eight years as education chief, including improved graduation rates and better performance on college preparation tests. His tenure was also marked by a rocky relationship with teacher unions and Gov. John Bel Edwards. And the state continues to lag others in nationwide education rankings. Still, his departure comes as his job seemed secure, following the election last year of a slate of state education board members who were backed by the state's business lobby, which was supportive of White. Although he didn't discuss his future, The Advocate reported in April that he had quietly co-founded a national nonprofit group, Propel America, aimed at connecting low-income high school graduates with solid jobs. White has been education superintendent since 2012 but he had been working on a month-to-month basis since 2016. Although he had the support of a majority of the 11-member state Board of Elementary and Secondary Education, he lacked the two-thirds majority needed to get a new contract.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: The state with the largest fishing industry for lobster likely experienced a drop in catch last year, but the dip in harvest was probably not as dramatic as initially feared. Patrick Keliher, commissioner of the Maine Department of Marine Resources, told Maine Public that initial reports showed a harvest of about 100 million pounds of lobster. That would be a drop of nearly 20 million pounds from last year, but still a much higher number than the industry was used to in the 1990s and 2000. The season initially looked like it could produce a substantial drop in catch, but Maine's lobstermen finished strong, Keliher said. The price for Maine lobster was also strong, he said. It's possible for the state's lobster catch to be slowed by lobsters shedding their shells late in the year. The biggest surge in catch happens after many lobsters lose their old shells and reach legal harvesting size.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: A 24-year-old chimpanzee at the Maryland Zoo has given birth to a girl. The zoo welcomed the 2-pound new addition on Dec. 29, officials announced in a statement on Wednesday. The first-time mother, Raven, and the newborn chimp have spent their first week together bonding in a quiet off-exhibit area, according to the statement. The baby chimp will go on display for the public following the short period of bonding. Raven was the second chimpanzee to give birth at the zoo outside of Baltimore in 2019. Bunny, gave birth to Lola in July. There are now 14 chimps in its care, and officials said the births have been important as reproduction of the species at zoos nationwide has slowed in recent years. Officials haven't decided on a name, a spokeswoman for the Maryland Zoo told The Washington Post. Sometimes the animal's care team chooses a name and other times there's a contest that involves the public, she added.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nWellesley: A college employee who posted a controversial Facebook post about Iran bombing the U.S. was suspended Wednesday. Babson College's director of sustainability, Asheen Phansey, faced disciplinarian actions for a post he made on social media on Tuesday that suggested Iran list 52 American cultural sites that Iran could bomb, the Boston Herald reported. President Donald Trump posted on Twitter on Jan 4. that the U.S. has targeted 52 Iranian sites in reference to rising tensions between the countries. In the now-deleted post, Phansey wrote, In retaliation, Ayatollah Khomenei should tweet a list of 52 sites of beloved American cultural heritage that he would bomb. Um… Mall of America? Kardashian residence? In a statement Wednesday, the former employee said, I regret my bad attempt at humor. As an American, born and raised, I was trying to juxtapose our 'cultural sites' with ancient Iranian churches and mosques. I am completely opposed to violence and would never advocate it by anyone. I am sorry that my sloppy humor was read as a threat.\n\nMichigan\n\nJackson:A prison inmate said he was transferred and lost his job as a tutor after complaining that teachers were supplying answers to a high school equivalency test. U.S. District Judge Mark Goldsmith declined to dismiss the lawsuit, the Detroit Free Press reported Thursday, which means it will go to trial or be settled. Munin Kathawa, 57, who is serving a life sentence for murder, sued five people, including a deputy warden, claiming his rights were violated. He said he reported his concerns about cheating in 2018 to a state lawmaker and a Catholic priest. Corrections Department spokesman Chris Gautz declined to comment. Kathawa said he was falsely accused of being a safety threat and removed as a tutor. A teacher, Laura Bendele, testified in a deposition that she was pressured by officials to stick to that story but refused.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis:Two prominent leaders have proposed an amendment to the Minnesota Constitution aimed at closing the state's dismal academic achievement gap. The proposal comes from Alan Page, a former Minnesota Supreme Court justice, and Neel Kashkari, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis. They want to change the state's constitution to guarantee all children the fundamental right to a quality public education, the Star Tribune reported Wednesday. Page and Kashkari told the newspaper in an interview that making quality education a civil right for all children is the catalyst that's needed to break the logjam that has blocked effective reform. Even though Minnesota has spent billions of dollars to solve the problem, the state still has some of the worst educational disparities in the nation, as measured by race and socioeconomic status, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis. Courts have interpreted the Minnesota Constitution as giving students a fundamental right to an adequate education. Page and Kashkari want to raise that standard to a quality education. Page and Kashkari said similar amendments have driven improvements in other states. To amend the Minnesota Constitution, they will need the Legislature's approval to put the question to voters. The two hope to get it on the ballot this fall. But they'll face opposition from the state's powerful teachers' union, Education Minnesota, which said it will resist the proposal.\n\nMississippi\n\nHancock County: A huge component of a new rocket system was wheeled slowly from a New Orleans spacecraft factory on Wednesday to a barge that will float it up the Mississippi River for testing. The recently completed core stage of NASA's Space Launch System, which dwarfed the hundreds of NASA and Boeing employees, was to be taken to the Stennis Space Center in Hancock County, about 50 miles northeast of New Orleans. Space Launch System rockets are expected to take astronauts to the moon as part of NASA's Artemis program. The core stage – which measures 212 feet from end to end and more than 27 feet in diameter – was transported like a giant Carnival float from the Michoud Assembly Center in eastern New Orleans to the barge as workers took pictures. It will undergo tests at Stennis ahead of the first Artemis launch, planned for 2021, said Tony Castilleja, a systems engineer with the Boeing Space Team. The SLS core stage, with four huge engines, is the largest rocket stage NASA has assembled since the Apollo stages that first powered crewed missions to the Moon. It will be used for Artemis I, a test-flight without a crew. Artemis II is to send up a crewed spacecraft. The third mission, Artemis III, would put a man and woman on the south pole of the moon, with an eye toward a continued presence that would lead to a trip to Mars.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: Republican Gov. Mike Parson's campaign said it raised about $540,000 in recent months, outpacing the $445,000 brought in by Democratic challenger Nicole Galloway. Those numbers are dwarfed by fundraising by independent political action committees, which rose in power after voters put limits on political donations directly to candidates in 2016. There are no limits on donations to PACs, which can work to bolster a candidate but cannot coordinate with the official campaign. A PAC backing Parson raised close to $1 million in the latest reporting period, which covers October through December. Uniting Missouri PAC Chairman John Hancock said the committee has more than $5 million on hand to spend helping Parson in the gubernatorial race. A pro-Galloway PAC has not yet reported recent fundraising. The general election is Nov. 3.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: Urban deer culling for the fall and winter seasons was suspended by city officials amid budget cuts. The Montana Fish and Wildlife Commission recommended the city of Helena be allowed to continue culling despite budget cuts, The Helena Independent Record reported Tuesday. Former Police Chief Troy McGee made the decision to cut the program when the department was ordered to make more than $470,000 in cuts, city officials said. The program costs the city about $30,000 a year, officials said. The commission sets a quota range of up to 250 designated to maintain the population at desire levels and the city determines the exact number to cull each year within that range, officials said. This will be the first fall and winter the city has not culled deer since 2008, officials said. The city has plans to survey the deer population to determine if it will resume culling operations, Police Chief Steve Hagen said. The city has usually culled about 100 deer a year and populations have remained steady, officials said.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Despite more than doubling releases from its reservoir system, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers still doesn't expect to eliminate all the leftover water from last year's near-record runoff that led to massive Missouri River flooding. The Corps had been discharging about twice the usual winter amount from Gavins Point Dam – the southernmost in the six-dam system. The Corps said it was raising the discharge this month to 30,000 cubic feet per second, an increase of more than 11%. Until a seasonal decrease that began in November, the amount being released had been 80,000 cubic feet per second for months, also more than twice the average. Areas along the Missouri River and its tributaries in parts of Nebraska, Kansas, Iowa and Missouri were ravaged by floodwaters in the early spring. Heavy rains later in the year reflooded many areas that had been left unprotected because of levee failures. John Remus, chief of the Corps' Missouri River management, told the Omaha World-Herald the reservoir system needs to make as much space as possible in light of the National Weather Service forecast for warmer than normal weather and higher than normal runoff in January and February. The Corps normally doesn't release more during the winter because of the potential for ice jams and dams upriver, Remus told the Associated Press on Wednesday. Once the river freezes over it essentially becomes a pipe, Remus said, limiting its capacity.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas:Lincoln County authorities have announced that a reward is being offered for information surrounding the starvation and death of a herd of cattle. The Lincoln County sheriff's office announced the $10,000 reward Monday after the herd of six were locked into a corral in rural south Nevada, officials said. Authorities believe at least one person intentionally isolated the herd in a coral where all but one cow starved to death. The herd was in the Tule Spring area about 30 miles north of Mesquite when weather made travel to the area difficult, Sheriff Kerry Lee said. The rancher who owns the cattle last saw them alive the first week of December before the weather cleared and he returned to his cattle, authorities said. The area is a popular location for hunters, authorities said. Anyone with information or trail camera footage of vehicles in the area is asked to contact the Lincoln County sheriff's office.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nNashua: Three employees were sickened by a cleaning chemical at an Amazon warehouse, fire officials said Thursday. Firefighters in Nashua responded at about 4 a.m. for a report of a chemical reaction that happened while a crew was mixing chemicals, Deputy Fire Chief Karl Gerhard told WMUR-TV. The major symptoms we saw were respiratory-related, scratchiness, coughing-related issues, Gerhard said. There was possibly an unknown chemical in the bucket already that they were putting the chemicals in, and that caused the reaction. The building was evacuated and the employees were taken to a hospital. Two were treated and released. A fire department report said after the building had been ventilated, crews monitored the building using air and chemical metering devices and found no abnormal readings. OSHA and the state fire marshal's office were notified.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: All 37,000 of the lead water pipes in the state capital will be replaced over the next five years at an estimated cost of $150 million, Trenton officials said Thursday. The announcement comes about five months after the state's largest city, Newark, said it would speed up the replacement of its 18,000 lead lines over the next 21/ 2 years – and as the state grapples with how to move forward with its old water infrastructure. Trenton's publicly owned water utility draws water from the Delaware River and serves some 200,000 customers in the city, in addition to surrounding communities of Ewing, Hamilton, Hopewell and Lawrence. Pipes will be replaced in phases as the city and Trenton Water Works, the public utility, continue to secure funds, which are coming from the state infrastructure bank, as well a federal program, according to David Smith, the water works chief engineer. Residents must register on the utility's website and pay $1,000 to have their lines replaced, Democratic Mayor Reed Gusciora said. That's a savings, he said, because replacement typically costs about $2,000-$5,000 per line. About 7,000 people have registered to have their pipes replaced, and officials said they hope to make the replacement mandatory and at no cost at some point.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: The head of New Mexico's largest Catholic diocese has issued directives aimed at protecting parishioners during flu season. Santa Fe Archbishop John Wester cited the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, saying New Mexico is one of the states experiencing widespread flu outbreaks. He's urging people not to shake hands or hug when they attend Mass. Parishioners also are being asked not to hold hands while reciting the Our Father and those who are ill should stay home to avoid spreading the virus. Priests and other church officials also are being asked to wash their hands before and after distributing communion. Wester said the directives will be revoked when the situation improves. He said the archdiocese was instituting the directives not to limit expression of faith, but rather as a preventive measure against a widespread and potentially deadly disease.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York City: Nearly 300 of the city's new subway cars were removed over concerns that the doors could open while the trains were in motion, The New York Times reported Wednesday. The 298 cars on the A, C, J and Z lines were supposed to replace subways that date to the 1960s. They were removed after two recent incidents signaled trouble, the Times reported, citing people who were told about the malfunctions. The Metropolitan Transportation Authority did not say what specific incidents led to removing the cars, but said no riders were injured, the newspaper reported. The new cars, known as R-179s, were purchased for $600 million under a contract between the authority and the Canadian manufacturing giant Bombardier. A Bombardier spokeswoman told the Times that the company's investigation of the cars showed that the doors had not been properly calibrated by a supplier, Nanjing Kangni Mechanical & Electrical of China. Transit workers complained that the new cars speedometer was hard to see, that the master controller used to drive the train was uncomfortable and the space between cars was too narrow for some workers to operate in. Riders also complained that new cars broke down much more often than older subway cars, the Times reported. An outside firm has been hired by the MTA to inspect the troubled cars.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nChapel Hill: The University of North Carolina Board of Governors violated the state's open meetings laws by secretly negotiating and approving a deal to dispose of a Confederate monument from the campus of the system's flagship school, according to a lawsuit filed by a student newspaper. DTH Media Corp., which publishes The Daily Tar Heel student newspaper on the UNC-Chapel Hill campus, wants a court to void two agreements between the Board of Governors and the state chapter of the Sons of Confederate Veterans, news outlets reported on Wednesday. The deal has been denounced by students and faculty members as paying money to support white nationalism. UNC-Chapel Hill lost a $1.5 million research grant because of it. Superior Court Judge Allen Baddour said last month that he is reconsidering his approval of the deal. Baddour approved an agreement on Nov. 27 in which the SCV agreed to take ownership of the Silent Sam statue and build a center to preserve it. The statue stood for more than a century on the Chapel Hill campus before protesters took it down in August 2018. The university agreed to put $2.5 million into a trust to help defray the costs of the new center. In addition, UNC-Chapel Hill paid the SCV about $75,000 not to display Confederate flags or similar banners on any UNC system campus during any meetings or demonstrations for five years.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nWilliston: A proposed gas plant could help reduce wasteful flaring in the northern region of the Bakken oil patch. Outrigger Energy of Denver wants to build a plant in Williams County west of Williston capable of processing up to 450 million cubic feet of gas per day. Crude oil prices surpassing $50 per barrel have attracted the company to oil drilling in the Bakken, according to CEO Dave Keanini. The company also plans to build a 70-mile gathering pipeline that starts in eastern Williams County and ends at the processing plant, according to the Bismarck Tribune. It has entered into an agreement with XTO Energy to transport gas from the producer's wells. The Outrigger processing plant is the sixth facility of its kind in the works in North Dakota. Officials hope the investments will significantly curb the amount of excess gas that is flared in the state.\n\nOhio\n\nCincinnati: The future of the city's only abortion clinic is in question after the state health director said the facility doesn't have enough backup doctors lined up. Because the clinic doesn't have an agreement with a nearby, private hospital to transfer patients in case of an emergency – an agreement required by state law –Planned Parenthood Southwest Ohio Region has operated the clinic under an exception known as a variance. Ohio Health Director Amy Acton recently rescinded that variance. To receive a variance, a clinic must provide a list of doctors willing to treat patients in case of emergencies. The clinic in Cincinnati informed the state in December it no longer had four backup doctors listed and requested 30 days to find a replacement physician. Acton then rescinded the clinic's variance and notified the clinic its license was in jeopardy of being revoked. The clinic, which remains open, is expected to request a hearing on the issue. It indicated it was seeking another physician. Kersha Deibel, president and chief executive officer of the Planned Parenthood region, told The Columbus Dispatch that we follow the law and are actively working to identify a new provider.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The Oklahoma Corporation Commission said it has approved a plan for an additional area code for 19 central Oklahoma counties in the 405 area, including Oklahoma County and Oklahoma City. The commission said the North American Numbering Plan Administrator will announce the new area code later this month and it will be available in July. Starting in January 2021, callers will have to dial 10 digits that include the area code plus the seven-digit number. Commission spokesman Matt Skinner said existing phone numbers will not be affected or changed, but callers will have to dial all 10 digits to make a phone call. The area code overlay is similar to one adopted in 2011, when the 539 code was added in the 918 area code region that includes Tulsa. The commission said the additional area code is needed because the administrator has determined that the 405 area code will run out of available numbers in December 2021.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: Lawmakers have approved a $4.5 million contract with a hazardous waste removal company to clean up homeless encampments across the city. The City Commission unanimously voted to give the contract to Rapid Response Bio Clean on Wednesday after the agenda item was pulled late last month over concerns from homeless people and their advocates, Oregon Public Broadcasting reported Thursday. Opponents said the cleanups are traumatic for homeless residents and cause them to lose their property. Under a modified deal, Rapid Response workers will get training in nonviolent conflict resolution and to carry naloxone, an injection that can reverse drug overdoses. The workers generally disposed of the needles, shopping carts, trash and human waste that are left behind after a homeless camp is cleared. Notices about a clean-up must be posted at least two days before the work begins. The city has contracted with Rapid Response since 2016. But in recent weeks, the contract, which expands the scope of the company's responsibilities and significantly increases the amount of money approved for campsite cleanups. Mayor Ted Wheeler said the new contract strikes an excellent balance between keeping the city clean and respecting the homeless. Rapid Response was to resume its work by Thursday.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nMacungie: Mack Trucks plans to lay off 305 employees at its assembly plant north of Philadelphia, the company said Wednesday. Mack blamed the layoffs at its Lower Macungue Township plant on a downturn in the heavy-duty truck market. They will take effect at the end of February, The (Allentown) Morning Call reported. The cuts represent about 13% of the plant's payroll. We regret having to take this action, but we operate in a cyclical market, and after two years of extremely high volumes, we have to adapt to reduced market demand, said Mack spokesman Christopher Heffner. Employees, most of whom belong to the auto workers union, were informed of the news Wednesday. The cuts were expected after Mack said last month that it would need to slow production to cope with reduced demand. Mack expects the North American truck market to be down nearly 30% this year.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Legislative leaders said Wednesday they're working to undo a change to how medical marijuana dispensaries are regulated, to address a lawsuit by the governor. A provision in the state budget approved last year gave lawmakers the right to veto regulations imposed on the industry. Democratic Gov. Gina Raimondo sued, arguing the new law violates the state constitution's separation of powers clause because it gives lawmakers unchecked control over executive rulemaking authority. Democratic House Speaker Nicholas Mattiello and Senate President Dominick Ruggerio said Wednesday they're filing legislation to repeal the language that required lawmakers to approve rules and regulations relating to the expansion of licenses for medical marijuana dispensaries. However, they still took issue with how the Department of Business Regulation proposed regulations for dispensaries, with Mattiello calling it blatant overreach by the executive branch. The legislation not only removes the controversial provision, but also imposes limits on regulators. Among them, regulators would be barred from limiting dispensaries based on geographical zones and from preventing any center from growing its own supply of medical marijuana or limiting the number of plants. Lawmakers authorized six new medical marijuana dispensaries last year, for a total of nine.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: Gov. Henry McMaster wants to expand full-day pre-kindergarten for low-income 4-year-olds to every school district across the state. The program was created in 2006 in response to a lawsuit by poorer, more rural school districts and didn't cover all the districts in the state. McMaster's $53 million proposal would expand the 4K program to the remaining 17 districts. Several are among South Carolina's largest districts, including Beaufort, Charleston, Greenville and Richland District 2, according to The Post and Courier of Charleston. McMaster told the newspaper the expansion of the 4K program is crucial to his efforts to improve education to keep economic development humming in South Carolina. Several senators and House members praised the Republican governor's proposal. Democratic Sen. Vincent Sheheen of Camden has been pushing for universal pre-kindergarten for years and said it can only improve education across all grades.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls:Police are investigating after an injured man was dropped off at a hospital in a plastic tub. The 18-year-old Sioux Falls man was dropped off at an emergency room Tuesday afternoon, police spokesman Sam Clemens said. The driver left after dropping the man off at the hospital. The victim suffered life-threatening injuries, including skull injuries. Clemens did not know how the man was injured. Police were able to identify the man who dropped off the victim at the hospital through the victim's family members, along with other people who might be involved, he said. We have a lot more questions than answers, Clemens said. The investigation is ongoing, the Argus Leader reported\n\nTennessee\n\nSpring Hill:General Motors and United Auto Workers Local 1853 have agreed to convert 157 local temporary workers to permanent status effective Feb. 3. The decision resolves a dispute between GM in Spring Hill and the union over the hiring of new temporary workers, Chairman Mike Herron told The Daily Herald on Thursday. Under the new collective bargaining agreement ratified in October, GM agreed to convert temporary workers with three years of continual service to permanent status. None of the temporary workers in Spring Hill had three consecutive years of service because of layoffs in 2017 and 2018, creating a short-lived problem. The deal between GM and Local 1853 allows the plant to begin bringing in new temporary workers. The company has started taking applications, seeking 154 employees for those positions. On Monday, GM announced it was making 930 temporary workers permanent at 30 of its 52 UAW-represented plants across the country. Ford also moved 592 temps to full-time status. At GM's Flint Assembly in Michigan, 250 were told at a meeting by the local union president of their new status.\n\nTexas\n\nGalveston: Remains found on a tiny South Pacific island where a bloody World War II battle happened have been identified as those of a missing Marine from Galveston, a federal agency said Wednesday. In a statement, the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency announced that the remains of 1st Lt. Justin G. Mills of Galveston, Texas, had been identified. The remains were found in 2015 on the island of Betio in the Tarawa Atoll of the Gilbert Islands. The remains were turned over to the DPAA laboratory for genetic identification. Mills had been missing since the November 1943 Battle for Tarawa, which left about 1,000 U.S. Marines and sailors dead and more than 2,000 more wounded from fighting that stretched over four days. The DPAA said Mills died on the battle's first day. Mills is to be buried April 29 at Arlington National Cemetery in Virginia.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George: More than 16,000 public comments have been submitted for a proposal on whether to allow a highway to be built through a protected Mojave desert tortoise habitat in southern Utah, federal officials said. The proposed four-lane road has drawn criticism from conservationists because the corridor would run through land set aside to protect the tortoise. The Bureau of Land Management opened the public comment period last month and will now go through all of the comments before releasing the draft environmental impact statement, The Spectrum newspaper reported Wednesday. BLM is not permitted to say where the people submitting comments were from, but there was a mix of people who submitted comments locally and nationally, Venhuizen said. Details on the nature of the comments were not disclosed. The draft is the first step in the year-long National Environmental Policy Act, officials said. The Utah Division of Transportation and Washington County proposed building the Northern Corridor that would pass through the Red Cliffs National Conservation Area, officials said. A definite route for the road has not yet been determined, but the draft statement would take alternatives into consideration, officials said. After the department releases the draft environmental impact statement, a new 90-day public comment period will open, officials said. A decision is expected by 2021.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: The number of fatalities on Vermont roadways went down by about 30% in 2019, according to state figures. Vermont State Police and the Vermont Agency of Transportation released figures that show the tentative number of deaths on the state's roads in 2019 was 47, down from 69 in 2018, the Times Argus reported. But state officials are not sure what to attribute the decrease in road fatalities. Lt. Tara Thomas, commander of safety programs for the Vermont State Police, said the reduction was unexplainable. Thomas said that 47 deaths are still too many for state police. We wish we knew what the formula was to keep the numbers down. 47 is still too many for the state police. That's 47 families that don't have a loved one with them, so in our eyes, it's still high. We're averaging just way too many each month, she said. The 47 deaths resulted from 44 crashes last year. The figure is tentative because if someone dies as a result of injuries from a 2019 crash within the first 30 days of 2020, that person's death would be added to the list of fatalities from 2019. Vermont also had no fatal crashes reported in the state on any of the holidays last year.\n\nVirginia\n\nVirginia Beach: An animal shelter took in 20 cats after they were found living in a storage unit with their owner who had recently lost her home, the adoption center said in a social media post. The woman and the felines were found living in a Virginia Beach self-storage unit this week, the city's Animal Care and Adoption Center said on Tuesday. The city doesn't have a limit on how many cats residents can own, Animal Control Supervisor Meghan Conti told The Virginian-Pilot. The adoption center said the cats were understandably scared, but are otherwise in good health and didn't show signs of neglect. They're being housed together and awaiting adoption into new homes. The animal shelter didn't say how long the cats and their owner had been living in the storage unit or what happened with the woman.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: Mayor Jenny Durkan said Seattle will no longer use fossil fuels like natural gas to heat, cool and cook in new and substantially altered city-owned buildings and will come up with a plan by 2021 to transition all city-owned buildings to clean electric systems over time. Durkan included those directives in a Green New Deal executive order Wednesday. Neither the new KeyArena now under construction at Seattle Center nor the massive Seattle Aquarium expansion pavilion planned for construction starting next year will be covered by the city's new fossil-fuel ban, however, Durkan said. That's because the projects are underway, she said. Both city-owned structures will use a lot of energy. The $930 million new arena and 50,000-square-foot aquarium pavilion will initially be allowed to include some fossil-fuel infrastructure, though both will be included in the city's longer-term electrification plans, Durkan's office said. There's no deadline yet for all city buildings to be fossil-fuel free. Last year, the council passed a Green New Deal resolution that said Seattle would seek to eliminate climate pollutants in the city by 2030.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The U.S. Labor Department awarded $866,675 for flood recovery in West Virginia, the state's U.S. senators announced. The funding is through the Disaster Recovery National Dislocated Worker Grant Program. Flooding in February 2018 destroyed homes, displaced residents from jobs and caused more than $22 million in public infrastructure damage, U.S. Sen. Joe Manchin said in a news release. Sen. Shelley Moore Capito said the grant will provide Workforce West Virginia with assistance to rebuild.\n\nWisconsin\n\nTown: A man from Illinois drove through Wisconsin last week with a snowmobile strapped to the roof of his car, creating a bit of a stir. Tommy Mecher, an electrician apprentice from Chicago, said he could not afford to get a trailer and pay for the extra gas to tow his snowmobile up north. I only burned $10 more in gas on a 430-mile trip, Mecher said. I put it on the roof in Lemont, Illinois, where the snowmobile was and drove it up to Bessemer, Michigan. Snowmobiling can be an expensive pastime. There's the expensive machine, helmet and cold-weather clothing, the cost to travel to a spot with enough snow and the expenses of a weekend of roaring across groomed trails. But Mecher purchased the 1990 Polaris Indy 500 snowmobile a few weeks ago, made a few minor repairs to get it running and left for his father's house in Bessemer last Friday. Mecher said It took about an hour to load the snowmobile on the roof of his 2005 Chevy Malibu, using an old blue Ford tractor with a bucket. He modified the end of the snowmobile to keep the machine's track from caving in the roof or breaking the rear window. Mecher made a support rack of boards to shift the snowmobile's weight to the sides of the roof, away from the middle. He secured his sled with several straps that he looped through the open rear doors before tightening them and closing the doors. Mecher said he got quite a few stares from fellow motorists. When he stopped, he got questions about the legality of transporting a snowmobile on top of a car. When he arrived in Bessemer, it took just nine minutes to remove the snowmobile from its lofty perch with a front end loader and a strap.\n\nWyoming\n\nJackson: Foul weather has postponed plans to kill nonnative mountain goats in Grand Teton National Park. Park officials closed a large area of the Teton Range to the public this week so that hunters could shoot goats by helicopter without endangering people on the ground. Park officials now say snow and poor visibility are postponing those plans. Grand Teton spokeswoman Denise Germann said another attempt could take place in late January or early February. Mountain goats aren't native to the park and biologists worry the 100 or more goats could spread disease to native bighorn sheep. The National Park Service has contracted Oregon-based Baker Aircraft to shoot goats with nonlead shotgun or rifle rounds, the Jackson Hole News & Guide reported. Wintry weather kept Baker from making it to the area, Germann said. Park officials also plan to use volunteer hunters on the ground.
AP\n\nPITTSBURGH (AP) — The father in Mike Tomlin regrets the language he used to describe the New England Patriots during the postgame speech Pittsburgh Steelers wide receiver Antonio Brown opted to livestream on social media after a taut playoff victory over Kansas City.\n\nThe coach in Tomlin has just as big an issue with one of his team's biggest stars forcing the Steelers to talk about something other than trying to find a way to finally beat Tom Brady when it counts.\n\nA characteristically blunt Tomlin called Brown's decision to broadcast to the world more than 17 minutes of Pittsburgh's giddy locker room celebration — a move that caught Tomlin using a handful of profanities — foolish, ''selfish and inconsiderate.\n\nNot only is it a violation of our policy, it's a violation of league policy, both of which he knows, Tomlin said Tuesday.\n\nSo there are consequences to be dealt with from his perspective. We will punish him. We won't punish us.\n\nTomlin took responsibility for his choice of words, though he was unaware of being filmed as he spoke.\n\nDuring Tomlin's post-game remarks, he attached an expletive to the Patriots, who earned a full day's head start on preparing for the Steelers by virtue of beating Houston on Saturday night, 24 hours before Pittsburgh outlasted Kansas City 18-16.\n\nThe responsibility associated with being in this thing, just from a role model standpoint, it's something that I personally embrace, Tomlin said.\n\nIt's something that we as a team and organization embrace. So that's why the language, specifically, in terms of the content, is regrettable.\n\nSo, too, is the action of the talented if sporadically diva-like Brown. The former sixth-round pick has evolved from a raw project into one of the NFL's best wide receivers.\n\nThis season he became only the second player in league history to post four consecutive 100-catch seasons.\n\nHis work ethic is universally lauded even as his Q-rating has skyrocketed. Brown can be found on TV pitching everything from soda to credit cards to video games.\n\nThe player who — for reasons he hasn't yet disclosed — occasionally refers to himself as Ronald  also has a devoted social media presence, with more than 1.5 million following on Instagram and an additional 650,000 on Facebook, many of whom got an eyeful and an earful as the Steelers celebrated their first trip to the AFC title game in six years.\n\nWhile Tomlin has very little concern about the content of the video, he has plenty of concern over Brown's lack of judgment.\n\nYou wear on your teammates when they routinely have to answer questions about things that aren't preparation or football-related, Tomlin said.\n\nIt's our desire for him and for everyone to be great teammates, as well as great players. He is a great player. He is a hardworking player. He is respected, largely, in the locker room for those things. But incidences such as this don't help him in that regard.\n\nThe Steelers have grown accustomed to Brown's flights of fancy, whether it's posing for the Mannequin challenge while meeting with reporters, wearing eye-opening (and fine threatening) cleats or doing over-the-top touchdown celebrations.\n\nThe fallout this time around has been mixed. Long snapper Greg Warren said Monday that AB is AB, he can do what he wants to do.\n\nBen Roethlisberger expressed disappointment in Brown during the quarterback's weekly appearance on 93.7 The Fan.\n\nEither way, the fact that both were forced to respond to questions about Brown before the biggest game of the season only reinforces Tomlin's point, though Tomlin stressed that Brown is hardly the only athlete capable of becoming a distraction.\n\nThose things don't apply exclusively to Antonio, Tomlin said. It's a global thing in regards to professional sports. I think that's why often times you see great players move around from team to team.\n\nAnd I definitely don't want that to be his story. I am sure he doesn't want that to be his story. So, he has to address these things that put him and us in positions from time to time, in settings such as this, where it needs to be addressed.\n\nTomlin didn't outline the internal discipline Brown faces other than to say it will not affect his availability this weekend.\n\nNew England (15-2) pulled away from the Steelers (13-5) in the second half of a 27-16 victory in Pittsburgh on Oct. 23, a game Roethlisberger missed while recovering from surgery on his left knee.\n\nRoethlisberger will be around this time. And so will Brown, who will almost certainly have his phone's camera turned off late Sunday evening regardless of the outcome.\n\nHe has to grow from this, Tomlin said. He has to.\n\nNOTES: LB James Harrison is dealing with shoulder and triceps injuries and could be limited early in the week. ...

CINCINNATI – An Ohio Taco Bell employee declined to take the order of a man who is deaf. The employee no longer works at the establishment, the company said in a statement.\n\nThe patron, sitting in a vehicle at a drive-thru window, appears to attempt to communicate with the employee by writing messages on his phone, according to video of the exchange shared Wednesday by the man's mother in a public Facebook post.\n\nThe woman, identified as Becky Burch, wrote that the incident occurred at a Taco Bell in Kettering, Ohio, near Dayton.\n\nThis is my Deaf son getting discriminated against in the Taco Bell drive thru, the woman wrote. He was trying to show them his order and they told him it was against company policy to take his order that way. Really??\n\nThe employee also tells the man he will call 911 if you don't move, according to the video.\n\nTaco Bell released the following statement about the incident on Thursday:\n\nTaco Bell has a fundamental policy to respect all of our customers and employees, and we are committed to maintaining an environment free of discrimination or harassment. The franchise owner and operator of this location has investigated this situation and the team member no longer works for their organization. All team members at this restaurant are being retrained by the franchise owner on their policies.\n\nMore:January specials: Your monthly guide to freebies and meal deals
On Wednesday, President Donald Trump encouraged his supporters to never accept defeat, then watched as hundreds of them stormed the U.S. Capitol and rampaged through the halls of Congress, later saying, We love you, you're very special to those involved in the deadly and appalling attack.\n\nOn Thursday, Hall of Fame golfers Annika Sorenstam and Gary Player stood with Trump at the White House to accept the Presidential Medal of Freedom. They likely were the first outsiders to be with Trump at the White House since the reprehensible violence just 16 blocks away.\n\nSorenstam and Player, widely regarded as paragons of sportsmanship and honor in their game, did not cancel on Trump. They did not note the horror that had taken place on his watch and decide that Thursday wasn't an appropriate time to celebrate with him at the White House. They did not care about the gravity of the situation, about the calls from political leaders to remove Trump by impeachment or the 25th Amendment.\n\nNo. They willingly chose to accept an award from Trump and be seen with him a day after his words and actions launched one of the most shameful incidents in U.S. history.\n\nThere will be those who say Sorenstam, who was born in Sweden, and Player, from South Africa, can choose to accept an award from Trump whenever they wish. That is true. What's more, Sorenstam was an ardent supporter of Trump's failed re-election bid, retweeting Jack Nicklaus' multi-paragraph endorsement of Trump in the days before the 2020 election.\n\nBut Sorenstam and Player don't just represent themselves. They represent all of golf, a mostly lily-white sport that has struggled for decades, to its continuing detriment, to attract women and people of color – just as Trump, a creature of the game, has denigrated those very same people.\n\nOPINION: NBA stars Jaylen Brown, Jimmy Butler have seen two different Americas. They hope now everybody sees it.\n\nSON KNOWS BEST: Gary Player's son thinks father should decline Presidential Medal of Freedom\n\nAs representatives of their game, and as business people who benefit greatly from it, their reputations are sullied, forever. Sorenstam and Player now will be attached to Trump at this horrible time in our nation's history, forever. They will be known as the people who had the chance to gracefully suggest another day might be better to celebrate golfers in this nation – golfers, for heaven's sake – and they refused to do so.\n\nThey had nothing to do with the insurrection of the Trump mob on Wednesday, of course, but they happily became Trump's Thursday accessories. They celebrated with him as our nation mourns what he has wrought.\n\nA third golfer, the late Babe Didrikson Zaharias, also was honored by Trump. This is just a guess, but it's hard to believe the strong, legendary, groundbreaking Babe would have allowed herself to have anything to do with that awful man.\n\nWhile Player, 85, who once supported his nation's racist policy of apartheid before later denouncing it, is an understandable Trump ally, Sorenstam's involvement with Trump is perplexing. She is one of the greatest women to ever play the game. Now 50, Sorenstam is known as a trailblazer for playing in a men's PGA Tour event, the Colonial, in 2003, enduring sexist taunts from a couple of male players while drawing huge crowds and acquitting herself quite well before missing the cut.\n\nWhen she retweeted Nicklaus' endorsement of Trump, I texted her a question:\n\nHow do you reconcile Trump's awful record on women – bragging and joking about sexually assaulting women (Access Hollywood tape), calling the Democratic VP nominee a 'monster,' being accused of sexual assault or sexual harassment by at least 26 women, etc. – while being a woman who has forged an amazing career around the issues of inclusion for women and treating women equally and fairly and with respect?\n\nShe never replied. On Thursday afternoon, I texted again, this time to say I'd like to talk to her about accepting the Medal of Freedom a day after the awful rampage of Trump supporters at the Capitol. She did not reply.\n\nIt turns out that the ceremony for Sorenstam and Player was not open to the press. There were no photos immediately available. The event was basically held in secret.\n\nActually, it was held in shame.
DAVOS, Switzerland — French President Emmanuel Macron told a crowd of internationalists that globalization is in a major crisis at the World Economic Forum Wednesday.\n\nHe kicked off his address with a joke related to climate change at the expense of President Trump, who arrives in this Alpine resort Thursday morning.\n\nWhen you arrive here and see the snow, it could be hard to believe in global warming, Macron said to a packed audience of business leaders and politicians. Obviously you don't invite anyone skeptical about global warming this year. Trump has commented in the past that he thinks global warming is a hoax.\n\nThe White House confirmed Wednesday that Macron would be the guest of honor at Trump's first state dinner at the White House. No date was announced.\n\nMacron also said a stronger Europe was needed to avoid problems with people who feel they've been forgotten and left behind.\n\nHe called on world leaders to act in a multilateral way when confronting challenges from nations including North Korea and Iran, and when fighting extremist groups to avoid fracturing of the region. Trump's administration has threatened to withdraw from an international accord with Iran that freezes its nuclear weapons program.\n\nWe've got not only to win the war against terrorism but we've got to create conditions for durable peace, Macron said, adding that a multilateral political and diplomatic approach would help in the Middle East.\n\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel and Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni echoed Macron's sentiments Tuesday, calling for a stronger Europe, and for a rejection of Trump's America First economic and trade policy.\n\nMore:Davos: Europe readies riposte to Trump's 'America first'\n\nMore:Davos 2018: Why do 3,000 of the world's most powerful people flock to a Swiss town?\n\nMore:Treasury Secretary Mnuchin to global elites: Trump's 'America First' is not America alone\n\nMore:How men can teach men not to be sexual harassers\n\nWe cannot end up in a world with a cosmopolitan digital elite and an army of discontented workers, Gentiloni said. Our history and roots are not synonymous with protectionism.\n\nMerkel said that Germany is a country committed to finding multilateral solutions. Let us not shut ourselves off from the world, she said.\n\nMacron said the world is hitting roadblocks in several major areas.\n\nIn terms of trade, we are moving back again towards greater protectionism, greater fragmentation and we are undoing what globalization has been able to achieve, Macron said. In terms of climate change, we are losing the battle. How are we going to explain to people that they are going to be more vulnerable?\n\nContributing: Gregory Korte in Washington, D.C.
Wendy R. Sherman\n\nOpinion columnist\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo started having a tough 2020 only one day into the new year. He was forced to postpone his trip to Kyiv, Ukraine, this week to attend to the new crisis in Iraq. As fraught as Pompeo's visit to Kyiv was going to be, in the shadow of the impeachment battle, Iraq trumped Kyiv after the New Year's Eve attack on the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad.\n\nIt is President Donald Trump's failed policy toward Iran that has brought us to this combustible moment.\n\nIraq is a tough country under any circumstances, made more so after the 2003 U.S. invasion that upended the Middle East and cost so much in U.S. lives and treasure. But Iraq also created strange bedfellows. The U.S. troops worked alongside Iraqi and Iranian militia to destroy a common enemy, the Islamic State terrorism group. And even as Washington was confronting Iran over its nuclear program and malign behavior elsewhere, we maintained an uneasy coexistence in Iraq, where Tehran holds considerable sway.\n\nThat uneasy balance was destroyed when Trump withdrew from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, better known as the Iran nuclear deal. Like other critics of the agreement, Trump believed it should have resolved all of America's issues with Iran. Trump believed we were giving Tehran benefits without a requisite return. He thought a maximum pressure campaign would ultimately bring Iran to its knees, or incite a popular uprising against its theocratic regime.\n\nTrump policies devastate US interests\n\nLike much of Trump's national security and foreign policy, his Iran approach is tactical and not strategic. The results have been devastating to U.S. interests. Iran's most extreme hard-liners, the Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) and Quds force, which never wanted the nuclear deal, have gained more power, arguing that the United States couldn't be trusted to honor any agreement.\n\nIran's nefarious activities in the region have increased, because terror is not an expensive undertaking and so is largely immune from economic sanctions. Indeed, the IRGC has happily returned to controlling the lucrative black market under Trump's sanctions. And Iran, after complying with the deal for nearly three years, now confronted with maximum pressure and no diplomatic track, has begun to unwind its compliance.\n\nLearning to manage conflict:As Iraq violence flares, how do we stop wars from happening in the 2020s?\n\nIn Iraq, Iranian-backed militia, led by Kataeb Hezbollah, have worked to increase their power as the Iraq central government has nearly collapsed under the weight of months of popular protests against government corruption. A rocket attack by the Kataeb Hezbollah militia last Friday killed an American contractor and injured many. The Trump administration retaliated with airstrikes two days later, leading to the New Year's Eve attack on our embassy.\n\nMost would agree that the United States had to respond in some way to the death of an American, but whether the airstrike was the right and proportionate measure is debatable.\n\nRegardless, if the Trump administration really understood the dynamics of Iraq, it might have anticipated a move like the attack on the U.S. Embassy. Administration officials might have worked more closely with the Iraq government to think through the best way forward. Instead, in essence, Trump walked into Iran's trap.\n\nFor many Americans, the Baghdad militia chants of Death to America echoed the takeover of the U.S. Embassy in Tehran in 1979, raising the specter of another hostage crisis.\n\nIran nuclear deal was solid progress\n\nThe immediate emergency at our embassy in Baghdad has subsided. Kataeb Hezbollah has withdrawn its militia from outside the compound, declaring that they have delivered the necessary message to America. They want the 5,000 U.S. troops out of Iraq.\n\nNonetheless, perhaps even Pompeo understands that a longer-term challenge remains, and thus his change of travel plans.\n\nTrump has repeatedly said he wants to withdraw American troops from just about everywhere. But a withdrawal from Iraq at this moment only serves Iran's desire to exert greater control over Iraq. To much of the world, it would signal U.S. disengagement and weakness — not strength.\n\nEven some of the harshest critics of the Iran nuclear deal now understand that the perfect is, indeed, the enemy of the good; that in volatile international situations, solid, incremental progress trumps chaos. The Iran nuclear deal was meant to prevent Tehran from getting a nuclear weapon. Such a capability would project even greater Iranian power in the Middle East and deter the ability of Washington and its allies to build a lasting peace in the region.\n\nDiplomatic amateur hour:Sondland's impeachment testimony proves Trump foreign policy is run by corrupt clowns\n\nConcerted action to curtail Iran's malign behavior, human rights abuses, unlawful detention of Americans and state sponsorship of terrorism remains very necessary. Had Trump stayed in the Iran deal and not only used the remaining sanctions in the U.S. toolbox but also built a coalition of diplomatic partners to challenge Iran to truly join the community of nations, we would be in a very different place today.\n\nThree years into his presidency, Donald Trump owns the events and outcomes in Iraq and Iran, as he does in North Korea, Afghanistan, Venezuela, the Middle East, Russia, China and Hong Kong. Having diminished our State Department, intelligence agencies and military, the very institutions that could have helped him construct an effective national security and foreign policy, he is now on his own.\n\nThe president may like it that way, but a change in his secretary of State's travel plans won't be enough to save the day, let alone the decade.\n\nWendy R. Sherman, a professor and the director of the Center for Public Leadership at Harvard Kennedy School, was undersecretary of State for political affairs from 2011-15 and led U.S. negotiations on the Iran nuclear deal.

Continuing the player-driven efforts in the fight for social justice, the NFL this week handed out 13 new grants to nonprofit organizations across the country as part of the Inspire Change initiative.\n\nInspire Change is the product of the partnership formed between the players and owners during the 2018 season and focuses on education, economic advancement, police and community relations and criminal justice reform. To date, the league and its teams have provided more than $95 million to programs across the country.\n\nThis year's new grants — which total roughly $4.3 million, according to the league — include new partners whose missions are aimed at helping to close the digital divide.\n\nEducation is a basic human right, and we can no longer deprive students of the tools they need to succeed, including devices and the internet, Arizona Cardinals offensive lineman Kelvin Beachum, also a Players Coalition task force member and Player-Owner Social Justice Working Group member, said in a press release. I am proud of the work Players Coalition and the NFL has done to help close this 'digital divide' and help those children in underserved communities.\n\nThis year's 13 grant recipients join a roster of 20 organizations that the players and owners have and continued to sponsor since forming their partnership.\n\nThe 2021 recipients:\n\n• The Association for Enterprise Opportunity, which is based in D.C. and provides strategic and developmental assistance to Black owned businesses and targets the wealth gap that exists between Black and white American families.\n\n• Boys & Girls Clubs of America, which plans to use the funding to help create the TLC Youth Advocacy process, an effort to further educate 5,000 teens and build advocacy capacity via service-learning projects.\n\n• Breakthrough Miami, whose Changemaker Leadership Track supports Breakthrough Scholars and recent alumni to build capacities to challenge the digital divide, gain early work experience, college advising, financial literacy and leadership development.\n\n• L.A.-based Center for Policing Equity, and its efforts to expand COMPSTAT usage – a software that tracks incidents, identifies trends and holds departments accountable by measuring crime.\n\n• Covenant House, which is based in New York and focuses on workforce development and education services across the U.S. while serving youth and young families facing homelessness.\n\n• Just City-Memphis and its Memphis Community Bail Fund, the Clean Slate Fund, and Court Watch programs.\n\n• Bronx-based Ladies of Hope Ministries and its Faces of Women Imprisoned Speakers Bureau, Parole and Probation Accountability Project, and EPIC Ambassadors policy advocacy project.\n\n• MENTOR, which provides resources and tools on virtual mentoring made available to mentoring programs nationwide.\n\n• Oregon Justice Resource Center and its support of Women's Justice Project – the first and only program in Oregon that addresses the needs of women in the criminal justice system.\n\n• Brooklyn's Per Scholas, which enrolls 220 new individuals into its Software Engineering courses – a 15-week, full-time training program that will include technical instruction and professional development in efforts to advance economic equity.\n\n• Texas Appleseed's work in three areas that disproportionately affect Black and Latinx Texans from low-income backgrounds: driver's license suspensions, criminal record expungement and debt collection.\n\n• United Way Worldwide's Young Men United initiative, which aims to support 25,000 young men of color in the United States to and through post-secondary and into entry-level career positions.\n\n• Silver Spring, Maryland's US Dream Academy and its Children of Incarcerated Parents initiative, which provides mentorship, leadership training, educational support and career readiness for a unique population of primarily Black and Latinx young people in communities harmed by racial bias and mass incarceration.
Elizabeth Weise\n\nUSATODAY\n\nSAN FRANCISCO — Uber is going to make urban traffic and mobility data gleaned from its millions of drivers and riders using the Uber app freely available to all.\n\nThe data, which shows anonymized travel times between points in cities, will be available on a public website called Uber Movement.\n\nUber says it will first invite planning agencies and researchers to access the information and then make the website free to the public. The first cities will be Washington D.C., Manilaand Sydney.\n\nThe San Francisco-based company decided to release the data when it realized it had this very valuable but untapped resource for understanding a city's transportation infrastructure, said Andrew Salzberg, Uber's head of transportation policy.\n\nPegged to a transportation conference in DC on Sunday, the release is also likely is a bid to gain some goodwill with cities, with which Uber has often had bare-knuckled fights over regulation.\n\nThe announcement comes as Uber, Lyft and other ride-hailing companies face demands from cities that they provide more information about their riders — demands they have long opposed.\n\nThe most recent square off is in New York City, where New York's Taxi & Limousine Commission will hold a public hearing on Thursday a demand that Uber give the city information about where and when drivers drop off passengers, something taxi drivers already are required to do.\n\nUber Movement doesn't map individuals rides, but rather segments of rides, focusing on travel time between specific points, Gilbertson said.\n\nWe're using ride data as a proxy, we're taking periodic GPS trace pings during the rides, he said.\n\nFor example, the Uber data showed changes in travel times in the Washington D.C. area when parts of the regional Metro were shut down for repairs.\n\nThe Uber data will give cities a low-cost way to do high-resolution travel time analysis. Robust traffic data of the sort needed by planners is often either expensive or out-of-date.\n\nFor us in the planning context, it's very interesting, said Jascha Franklin-Hodge, Boston's chief information officer.\n\nOftentimes, cities and state transportation systems use things like toll transponders to show how long it takes to get from one place to another. But those are on fixed routes. What's interesting is this allow us to look at a lot of different routes, he said.\n\nThe Uber data makes it possible to reliably estimate how long it takes to get from one area of a city to another by analyzing multiple trips over time.\n\nTo protect the privacy of Uber drivers and passengers, only areas with relatively high tip volume are included. Otherwise it might be possible to track the movement of a unique individual if only a few Uber trips went through a specific area in a given time.\n\nOn the maps, Uber grays out areas where trip numbers are too low to protect driver privacy.\n\nThe company has been beta testing the program with Washington D.C. The data will initially be available for a limited number of cities which will be added to over time. Uber currently is active in 450 cities worldwide.\n\nWhile the data isn't comprehensive enough to allow city planners to rely solely on it, it will be helpful. It also should be a boost to public engagement with planners, said Boston's Franklin.\n\nThis gives people tools to ask us questions. That's really powerful. We believe in having an informed public and having conversations that are rooted in facts, so the more of facts that are available, the better, he said.
David Jackson\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump tapped a new trade ambassador Tuesday while tweeting on topics ranging from congressional ethics to trade policy to changing President Obama's health care plan to keeping open the Guantanamo Bay prison.\n\nIn nominating former Reagan administration official Robert Lighthizer to be his U.S. Trade Representative, Trump echoed the attacks he made on various trade deals during the presidential campaign.\n\nLighthizer has extensive experience striking agreements that protect some of the most important sectors of our economy, and has repeatedly fought in the private sector to prevent bad deals from hurting Americans, Trump said in a statement. He will do an amazing job helping turn around the failed trade policies which have robbed so many Americans of prosperity.\n\nA critic of China trade practices in particular, Lighthizer said he is fully committed to President-elect Trump's mission to level the playing field for American workers and forge better trade policies which will benefit all Americans.\n\nTrump made the announcement while preparing for another day of briefings and jobs interviews at his Manhattan office tower.\n\nThe president-elect also stayed busy on social media. In a flurry of new tweets, Trump:\n\n• Questioned House Republicans for gutting a congressional ethics investigating committee, tweeting that the GOP should focus on issues like tax reform and health care; however, Trump also described the independent ethics committee's work as unfair. House Republicans later reversed course on plans to end the committee's work.\n\n• Threatened General Motors — and presumably other companies — with the imposition of a border tax over operations in Mexico.\n\n• Again pledged to dismantle President Obama's health care plan, saying it just doesn't work, and it is not affordable.\n\n• Warned Obama against last-minute releases from the terrorism prisoner camp at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba; these are extremely dangerous people and should not be allowed back onto the battlefield, he tweeted.\n\nLater in the week, Trump plans to receive a special security briefing on allegations that Russia orchestrated the hacking of Democratic officials during last year's presidential election, aides said. Trump, who has questioned whether Russia was involved, is awaiting a final report being developed by intelligence agencies at Obama's request.\n\nAmong the jobs he plans to fill in the coming days: director of National Intelligence, secretary of Agriculture and secretary of Veterans Affairs.\n\nRead more:\n\nWho has Trump picked for his Cabinet so far?\n\nTrump blasts GM for Mexican-made Chevy Cruze\n\nDuring the presidential campaign, Trump vowed to kill the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership deal with Pacific Rim nations. He also vowed to re-negotiate, or possibly scrap, the North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico.\n\nTrade played a role in Trump's latest tweet storm, as he criticized General Motors for making Chevrolets in Mexico and selling them in the United States.\n\nIn announcing the selection of Lighthizer, the Trump transition team noted that he served Reagan as deputy United States trade representative, playing a major role in developing trade policy for the Reagan Administration and negotiating roughly two dozen bilateral international agreements on a variety of topics from steel to grain. These agreements were uniformly tough and frequently resulted in significant reductions in the shipment of unfairly traded imports into the United States.\n\nIn recent years, Lighthizer has worked on trade issues as a partner with the law firm of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom.\n\nThe Senate must still confirm Lighthizer's nomination as trade representative.\n\nThere is some question as to how much power the trade representative will have in a Trump administration.\n\nThe president-elect has said he will give more trade authority to the Commerce department, to be headed up by billionaire investor Wilbur Ross.\n\nTrump also picked another China critic, Peter Navarro, to head up a new White House office overseeing trade and industrial policy.
Jim Waymer\n\nFlorida Today\n\nMELBOURNE, Fla. — Federal regulators have denied six pending permits for using high-powered airguns to scan the ocean floor for signs of oil and gas deposits from Florida to Delaware.\n\nThe permits were no longer needed because the federal government removed those waters from the list of areas available to be leased for oil and gas exploration between 2017 and 2022, according to a release Friday from the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management.\n\nEnvironmental groups touted the decision as a major victory for coastal habitats and future tourism, while industry officials said it would hamper America's energy independence, scientific knowledge and jobs.\n\nHorrific, David Mica, executive director of the Florida Petroleum Council, a division of the American Petroleum Institute, said of the decision. This agency has stated over and over again — even under this administration — how safe and efficient and how scientifically proven geological science is to do this. So I see it as a horrific political example that's only the latest in disregarding American energy security needs.\n\nThe use of airgun seismic surveys would have generated maps or models of rock distributions and other geological structures to show potential for oil and gas deposits. But conservation groups worried that the seismic testing could harm marine life, especially endangered North Atlantic right whales.\n\nU.S. oil companies poised for rebound\n\nThat really put our right whales at risk, said Amy Tidd of Rockledge, who organized anti-oil-drilling rallies at Florida beaches. We need to protect our marine mammals. I think this is a great step toward protecting them and protecting our beaches.\n\nBOEM officials said it's unlikely the information from seismic airgun surveys would be used if the federal government does not offer the Atlantic for future oil and gas leasing. The agency also pointed out that even if the area is opened to drilling in the future, the information gathered would become outdated.\n\nThe deep-penetration seismic surveys are conducted by vessels that tow an array of airguns that emit acoustic energy pulses into the seafloor over large areas and long periods of time, according to BOEM. The airguns penetrate several thousand meters beneath the seafloor.\n\nConservation groups worry the airguns could harm whales, dolphins and other marine life.\n\nNumerous studies demonstrate the negative impacts that seismic airgun noise has on ocean ecosystems, including reduced catch rates of commercially valuable fish and silencing bowhead whales, the nonprofit group Oceana said in a press release. The government's own estimates state that seismic airgun blasting in the Atlantic could injure as many as 138,000 marine mammals like dolphins and whales, while disturbing the vital activities of millions more.\n\nShallow-depth surveys for other purposes typically don't use airguns. While surveys may have some impacts to marine life, airgun seismic surveys have the potential for greater impacts, BOEM officials said.\n\nMore than 120 East Coast municipalities, 1,200 elected officials, 35,000 businesses and 500,000 fishing families have publicly opposed offshore drilling and/or seismic airgun blasting, according to Oceana, which has fought against the seismic testing.\n\nCocoa Beach was one of the cities that passed resolutions against seismic airgun testing.\n\nWe're pretty happy, Cocoa Beach Mayor Ben Malik said of Friday's decision. We're pretty sensitive to our coast and making sure it's preserved for future generations.\n\nThe pending permits from oil or gas exploration spanned from Delaware to Florida.\n\nEarlier this month, Obama declared certain federal waters of the Atlantic and Arctic oceans off-limits to offshore oil and gas drilling — for good.\n\nThe ban does not include Atlantic waters off Florida and would not affect current oil and gas leases, but it aims to stop indefinitely the sale of new leases in an area of the Atlantic stretching from about Rhode Island to southern Maryland — and in the Arctic's Chukchi and Beaufort seas north of Alaska.\n\nObama designated 31 Atlantic canyons along the Continental Shelf off limits to oil and gas exploration and development due to their critical and irreplaceable ecological value. The withdrawn area totals 5,990 square miles (or 3.8 million acres). The measure would protect deep-sea coral, fish habitat and other marine life, administration officials said.\n\nAPI Director of Upstream and Industry Operations Erik Milito said Friday's decision harms the nation's energy security, scientific research and was politically driven.\n\nWe are hopeful the incoming administration will reverse this short-sighted course, Milito said in a prepared statement, and base its decisions on facts so that we can have a forward-looking energy policy to help keep energy affordable for American consumers and businesses, help create jobs, and strengthen our national security.\n\nTidd said the airgun permit denials are also a victory for Florida's economy.\n\nOur economy depends on clean beaches. and to do anything that puts that at risk is foolhardy, she said.\n\nFollow Jim Waymer on Twitter: @JWayEnviro
Corrections & Clarifications: An earlier version of this story mischaracterized the shutdown's current impact on growth.\n\nWhen the next recession strikes, it won't be as bad as the last one, J.P. Morgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon predicted Tuesday.\n\nYou will have a recession. It just won't be like you had the last time in ... affecting the banking system, he said in a call Tuesday with analysts after the company released its fourth-quarter earnings.\n\nThe chief executive said the larger banks have been more prudent when approving new loans. It's the newer, non-bank lenders – dubbed shadow banks – that could have problems during a recession, he predicted.\n\nSomeone's going to get hurt, he said. The issue there for the marketplace is going to be, we have a recession, the lender will not be there. So a lot of these borrowers will be stranded.\n\nMore Money: Ask HR: My boss has body odor and bad breath. What can I do about this issue?\n\nMore Money:Chick-fil-A testing spicy new menu items in select markets, considering nationwide rollout\n\nDimon didn't forecast when he expected a downturn to occur. The company's chief financial officer, Marianne Lake, said despite some softness recently in manufacturing and capital expenditures, the outlook for growth in the economy is still strong, especially among consumers.\n\nIt's good, Dimon agreed.\n\nGovernment shutdown concerns\n\nDimon also weighed in on the partial government shutdown in an earlier call with the media. He repeated recent estimates by some economists that the government shutdown could sap all growth from the world's biggest economy.\n\nSomeone estimated that if it goes on for the whole quarter, it can reduce growth to zero, Dimon said. We just have to deal with that. It's more of a political issue than anything else.\n\nHis figures aren't off, says Dean Baker, a senior economist at the Center for Economic and Policy Research in Washington, D.C.\n\nFurloughed workers make up about 0.5 percent of the total U.S. workforce and contribute roughly about the same to the economy, he said. That means an extended shutdown could shrink the economy by 0.5 percent in the first quarter, he said, which would reduce its growth rate by 2 percent on an annual basis.\n\nSo, if it lasts the whole quarter, zero growth is very plausible, for the first quarter, Baker wrote in an email to USA TODAY.\n\nDimon's comments on the shutdown come on the same day that Delta Air Lines' CEO said the airline is losing about $25 million in business because of the shutdown. Ed Bastian told CNBC that fewer government employees and contractors are traveling, resulting in the decline.
Nick McCarvel\n\nSpecial to USA TODAY Sports\n\nMELBOURNE - Tennis officials sounded off Monday afternoon at a BuzzFeed and BBC report that claimed match-fixing is still a problem in tennis, and includes cases that involve a top 50 player and former Grand Slam singles and doubles champions.\n\nThe Tennis Integrity Unit and the tennis authorities absolutely reject any suggestion that evidence of match-fixing has been suppressed for any reason or isn't being thoroughly investigated, ATP chairman Chris Kermode said in a press conference called to address the report.\n\nThe Tennis Integrity Unit, or the TIU, was set up in 2008 to investigate match fixing at every level of the sport. In its existence, 18 convictions have been made, including six life bans.\n\nAll of us here are absolutely committed to stamp out any corrupt conduct, Kermode said. There is a zero-tolerance policy. All sport, just not tennis, is at risk to corruption … and that is why in 2008 the TIU was set up to tackle this issue head-on.\n\nNigel Willerton, the director of the TIU, would neither confirm nor deny that there were any players currently on the tour that are being investigated by the TIU.\n\nThe BuzzFeed/BBC report said that the TIU had been warned about 16 core players as part of the scandal, all of whom had been ranked inside the top 50 at some point, but none of whom were sanctioned. The focus of the report was a 2008 probe that it says was shelved by tennis authorities, ignoring evidence presented with a nice pink bow that they took no action at all with.\n\nThe governing bodies of tennis (ITF, ATP World Tour, WTA and the four Grand Slam events) issued a joint statement calling out the report for using what they call information, suspicion or hearsay over evidence, as Kermode noted in his comments.\n\nWillerton added that the TIU can make demands of personal phones and laptops of players they suspect to be involved in match-fixing. When needed, the TIU works with necessary law enforcement.\n\nAll eyes on Novak Djokovic as he starts quest for elusive Grand Slam\n\nIt's always disappointing when stories like this come out in front of an event, Kermode said, noting that the story was released on the eve of the first Grand Slam of 2016, the Australian Open. We are confident there is nothing in the sport that has been suppressed. The TIU tackles this issue. Tennis is in a very, very good place.\n\nSome $14 million have been invested in the TIU and it's constantly being reviewed Kermode said.\n\nThe main press room in Rod Laver Arena was packed to the gills as a host of international media attended the press conference, which included officials from the WTA, ITF, U.S. Tennis Association and the sport's other biggest bodies.\n\nKermode stressed that the TIU focuses on evidence over information.\n\nThe BuzzFeed and BBC investigation suggested that the TIU was understaffed, calling it a plastic solution that has furthered the match-fixing problem in tennis.\n\nAustin Krajicek, an American ranked No. 82 in the world and who has played most of his career on the lower-level Challenge circuit (where match-fixing has been found at its most prevalent in the past, told USA TODAY Sports he had never been approached by betters or heard of match-fixing separate from rumors.\n\nI've never been approached, he said. I know the ATP takes that stuff really seriously. To be honest, I've never heard of someone being approached. I've heard rumors, but I haven't had any contact with it. It can't be tolerated.
LAS VEGAS – Sex toys are back on the CES show floor. And Lora Haddock DiCarlo deserves a lot of the credit.\n\nWe want to reshape how people think about sex tech, says the CEO and founder of the company that bears her name and markets such products.\n\nWe shamed pleasure (tech) for so long, she says. The fact is that sexual health and wellness (products) are health and wellness products.\n\nThat's the category under which the Consumer Technology Association (CTA), which organizes the event, is letting such companies exhibit at the 2020 industry shindig. But it took some convincing.\n\nIn DiCarlo's telling, the backstory begins with an orgasm, leading to the company's first in a family of hands-free robotic massagers called Osé. Osé emerged in partnership with the robotics lab at Oregon State University, which, DiCarlo points out, included several female engineers.\n\nHer company applied for and was granted a CES innovation award for the prototype that was Osé, stating up-front that the product is meant to stimulate a woman's G-spot and clitoris. But about a month later, when Lora DiCarlo asked for Osé to be included in a product showcase at CES and to exhibit at the show, the CTA took the award away on the grounds, DiCarlo says, that they found it immoral, obscene, and profane.\n\nCES flashback:If LG's rollable OLED TV sounds familiar, there's a reason\n\nVoice tech:For people who stutter, the convenience remains out of reach\n\nWhat caught our eye:4 cool gadgets at CES\n\nA backlash ensued over the sexist stance toward the female-focused product, and the CTA eventually bowed to the pressure. It not only apologized to DiCarlo and reversed its reversal of the award, but began a dialogue with her that resulted in a new policy, opening up floor space in the health and wellness area for such sex tech exhibitors.\n\nThe ban actually raised DiCarlo's profile and, while not necessarily the route she would have chosen, has been good for business. She pre-sold more than 10,000 Osé units in December (at $290 each), and has tripled the size of the company. At CES 2020, DiCarlo's company will unveil two new bio-mimetic pleasure devices under the names Baci and Onda.\n\nControversy over sex is nothing new for CES. In its earliest days, the show incorporated members of the porn industry.\n\nThe Adult Entertainment Expo eventually became its own event, though for some years it ran concurrently with CES, though not presently.\n\nAside from that, many companies at CES have employed attractive scantily clad booth babes, the term coined for women whose job it is to lure foot traffic to a mostly male audience. The CTA has said it maintains the right to remove people wearing what it considers inappropriate attire.\n\nCritics of the show have also complained through the years about the lack of inclusiveness when it comes to speaking roles, with most prominent keynote slots given to male executives.\n\nAt this year's CES, Ivanka Trump will be speaking which has generated its own controversy.\n\nFor her part, DiCarlo says the inclusion of sex tech exhibitors is all about normalizing the way people talk about a subject deemed by some as off-limits. We believe that having open conversations about our bodies and human sexuality is the right thing to do, she says.\n\nStill, it will be worth watching over the next several days the kind of response sex tech actually gets.\n\nThe big question for me is how brands will talk and position these gadgets, says Carolina Milanesi, an analyst with Creative Strategies. Will it be about women, their pleasure and health or, as we very often see, the gadgets marketed will be about men?\n\nEmail: ebaig@usatoday.com; Follow @edbaig on Twitter.
Bart Jansen\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nThe Transportation Department thinks airline travelers should know all the bag and seat-assignment fees they face before paying for a ticket. But after proposing in May 2014 to require airlines to provide that information, the administration continues to grapple with hundreds of comments on all sides of the issue.\n\nThe department's plan aims to alert travelers to the precise fees regardless of where they purchase their tickets. Half of all tickets are bought somewhere other than from airlines directly. Shopping at comparison web sites can be complicated, and some airlines change fees based on frequent-flier status or even the credit card used to buy a ticket.\n\nBut the proposal stopped short of requiring airlines to charge the fee at the moment the ticket is bought, something that consumer advocates had urged as a policy called transactability. Some travelers have complained about fees that surprise them upon arrival at the airport.\n\nAs airlines divide their ticket prices into optional services such as bags, seating and food, The fees have grown into big business, with bag fees totaled $3.5 billion in 2014, according to the department's Bureau of Transportation Statistics.\n\nIf the rule is adopted, airlines would have to disclose fees for first and second checked bags, carry-on bags and for advanced seat assignments that often provide extra legroom before the traveler pays for the ticket.\n\nThe department remains of the view that as carriers continue to unbundle services that used to be included in the price of air transportation, passengers need to be protected from 20 hidden and deceptive fees and allowed to price shop for air transportation in an effective manner, the 118-page proposal says.\n\nAfter receiving more than 750 comments, DOT has been grappling with whether to change or scrap anything in the proposal. No deadline is set for action, but the department's latest formal estimate is that the proposal will be finalized by June.\n\nIt's urgent, said Charlie Leocha, chairman of consumer-advocate Travelers United. The sooner we do it, the sooner that consumers can start to comparison shop.\n\nMelanie Hinton, a spokesman for the trade group Airlines for America, said it would be premature to comment on a rule before it is finalized. But she argued that airlines are already one of the most transparent industries for pricing, with the market dictating prices that are considerably less and far more plentiful than under government regulation.\n\nCustomers today are able to choose among carriers and select the best services offerings, Hinton said.\n\nDOT extends deadline to comment on airline fees, performance\n\nAirlines argued that the department doesn't have the power to regulate fees after Congress deregulated the industry in 1978, because the services are optional. But the department contends it is authorized under a section of federal law calling on it to prohibit unfair or deceptive practices in air transportation.\n\nAs much or more than any other industry, airlines depend upon repeat customers to sustain the business model, Delta Air Lines said in its comments on the rule. Delta has every incentive NOT to treat our customers unfairly or deceptively, and we strive to clearly and accurately inform our customers about Delta's fees for ancillary services, specifically including baggage and preferred seating.\n\nThe proposal is the third in a string of aviation consumer rules, with the first adopted in 2009. Earlier rules set large fines for lengthy tarmac delays and forced airlines to post the full cost of a ticket with taxes when advertising fares.\n\nThe U.S. Travel Association said nearly half (45%) of 1,031 travelers surveyed in February 2014 found it difficult to budget for travel because of fees, and that one-fourth faced a fee at the airport they didn't anticipate.\n\nFrancis Komola of Bradford, Mass., told the department that making the cost more obvious for advanced seat assignments that provide extra legroom is the most important part of the proposal.\n\nA significant amount of personal information has to be provided to United Airlines, for example, before the total cost of the flight is available to customers like me, Komola said.\n\nA rule that went into effect in January 2012 required airlines to notify passengers that baggage fees may apply and to post fees on their websites. The specific fees for first and second checked bags must be included in the summary after a purchase and post-purchase email.\n\nBut travelers complain that some airlines don't include fees in the initial purchase, and it becomes a surprise at the airport.\n\nDisplaying all fees as part of the ticket price levels the playing field and makes it much easier for consumers to compare apples to apples, said Matthew Kirkland of Watkinsville, Ga.\n\nSenate studies airline fees at $6 billion and growing\n\nOf course, the industry isn't monolithic. Southwest Airlines promotes its lack of baggage fees and supports greater transparency for its rivals that may also exert downward pressure on fees.\n\nPart of the dispute involves the technical side of how travelers shop for fares. Travel agents, whether mom-and-pop shops or online sites, urged the department to force airlines to provide detailed fees so they could relay them to customers.\n\nIt would not be remotely practical for a ticket agent to establish direct connections with hundreds of airlines in order to obtain the data and comply with the proposed disclosure obligations, Priceline.com told the department.\n\nBut Delta warned that making ticket searches more complicated could dampen sales. Travelers highly value speed and efficiency in the reservations process and tend to abandon searches after 430 seconds, the carrier said.\n\nAmerican Airlines cited department cost estimates that the fee provision would cost airlines $46 million over a decade and yield benefits of $25 million. The cost estimate was based on additional technology -- for equipment, software and labor -- to post the fees, according to a DOT analysis. The projected benefits are based on consumers buying more optional services and airlines reducing their administrative costs for managing complaints, the DOT analysis said.\n\nThe costs at issue are quite real and will inevitably be passed along to consumers in this intensely competitive industry, the carrier said.\n\nUnited Airlines said requiring fees with search results involving multiple carriers would take longer and lead to information overload.\n\nUnited has learned over many years — through extensive consumer feedback and other empirical observations — that many customers do not want this information at any point, and certainly not when they are looking at the first display that shows their search results, the carrier said.\n\nAirline: 10 'bizarre' things fliers have done to avoid bag fees
Zeke Miller\n\nAssociated Press\n\nJERUSALEM – President Donald Trump's national security adviser, John Bolton, said Sunday that the U.S. military withdrawal from northeastern Syria is conditioned on defeating the remnants of the Islamic State group, and on Turkey assuring the safety of Kurdish fighters allied with the United States.\n\nBolton, who traveled to Israel to reassure the U.S. ally of the Trump-ordered withdrawal, said there is no timetable for the pullout of American forces in northeastern Syria, but insisted it's not an unlimited commitment.\n\nThere are objectives that we want to accomplish that condition the withdrawal, Bolton told reporters in Jerusalem. The timetable flows from the policy decisions that we need to implement.\n\nThose conditions, he said, included the defeat of remnants of IS in Syria, and protections for Kurdish militias who have fought alongside U.S. troops against the extremist group.\n\nBolton's comments mark the first public confirmation that the drawdown has been slowed, as Trump faced widespread criticism from allies and the resignation of Defense Secretary Jim Mattis for a policy that was to have been conducted within weeks.\n\nTrump announced in mid-December that the U.S. will withdraw all of its 2,000 forces in Syria. Trump's move has raised fears over clearing the way for a Turkish assault on Kurdish fighters in Syria who fought alongside American troops against IS extremists. Turkey considers the Syrian Kurdish People's Protection Units, or YPG, a terrorist group linked to an insurgency within its own borders.\n\nBolton, who is to travel on to Turkey on Monday, said the U.S. is insisting that its Kurdish allies in the fight against the Islamic State group are protected from any planned Turkish offensive. He is to deliver a warning to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan this week.\n\nWe don't think the Turks ought to undertake military action that's not fully coordinated with and agreed to by the United States, Bolton said.\n\nTrump has stated that he would not allow Turkey to kill the Kurds, Bolton said. That's what the president said, the ones that fought with us.\n\nBolton said the U.S. has asked its Kurdish allies to stand fast now and refrain from seeking protection from Russia or Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's government. He said Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Joseph Dunford would continue negotiations with his Turkish counterparts this week to seek protection for America's Kurdish allies in Syria.\n\nHe added that Ambassador Jim Jeffrey, who has been serving since August as the special representative for Syrian engagement and was named last week as the American special envoy for the anti-Islamic State coalition, would travel to Syria this week in an effort to reassure the U.S.'s Kurdish allies that they are not being abandoned.\n\nBolton said U.S. troops would remain at the critical are of al-Tanf, in southern Syria, to counter growing Iranian activity in the region. He defended the legal basis for the deployment, saying it's justified by the president's Constitutional authority, adding I'm a strong believer in Article II.\n\nBolton on Sunday also toured the ancient tunnels beneath the Western Wall in Jerusalem's Old City. He watched a virtual reality tour of the historic site and dined there with his Israeli equivalent, as well as U.S. Ambassador to Israel David Friedman and Israel's ambassador to the U.S., Ron Dermer.\n\nVisiting American officials typically avoid holding official meetings in parts of east Jerusalem, which is contested between Israelis and Palestinians. Trump himself, however, also toured the area in a previous visit. Israel captured the Old City from Jordan in the 1967 war.
Adam Shell\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nU.S. long-term government bonds are in demand again and the dollar is losing some of its luster as Wall Street downgrades its views on interest rate hikes.\n\nWith markets experiencing turbulence and the global economy facing myriad headwinds, investors are again flocking to the perceived haven of bonds issued by Uncle Sam. The reason: Wall Street is pretty much ruling out a March rate hike by the Federal Reserve and thinks the U.S. central bank may remain on hold for the remainder of the year.\n\nThat shift in thinking about U.S. interest rate policy is pushing the value of the dollar down, a development that is positive for commodities and for U.S. multinationals that do a lot of business abroad.\n\nOn Wednesday, the yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which moves in the opposite direction of price, hit an intraday low of 1.79%, its lowest yield since Feb.5, 2015 — or a 12-month low. The yield has since crept back up to 1.90% in early trading Thursday but the sub-2% yield is a sign rate hikes are no longer a big fear on Wall Street -- at least for now.\n\nThe dollar also weakened Wednesday, a trend that remains in place in early trading Thursday.\n\nThe weakening dollar tells me investors are sensing there's no way the Fed can tighten anytime soon, Nick Sargen, senior investment advisor at Fort Washington Investment Advisors, told USA TODAY.\n\nInvestors' renewed love affair with U.S. government bonds also follows a weaker-than-expected January reading on the U.S. services sector, which is a key pillar of the consumer-focused U.S. economy. The weaker number, released Wednesday, led to speculation that the Federal Reserve would not raise rates at its March meeting -- and may pass on rate hikes altogether this year. The Fed earlier this year had said it would like to hike rates another full percentage point in 2016 after a quarter-point hike in December. But Wall Street is now questioning that so-called hawkish pace of rate hikes.\n\nSome pundits believe the bond market may be sniffing out a coming recession, or at least pricing in a greater probability of a slowdown, due in large part to global pressures from places such as China and emerging markets -- and the downside fallout of the dollars sharp rise against other currencies prior to this week's reversal.\n\nThe downward pressure on yields is causing pain in shares of banks, however, which benefit from rising rates as they can lend money at higher rates and benefit from a wider spread between rates they charge borrowers and interest they pay savers. In Wednesday trading, bank stocks, including Bank of America, Citigroup and Wells Fargo, briefly touched fresh 52-week lows before mounting a late rebound. The biggest worry for bank stocks is the prospect of Fed rate hikes getting pushed out, says Ralph Bassett, head of North American equities at Aberdeen Asset Management.
Nancy Tengler\n\nSpecial to USA TODAY\n\nThe stock market is rational, despite what it looks like.\n\nWhich brings me to the latest report on U.S. hiring from Friday.\n\nThe change in nonfarm payrolls in the report disappointed some. New jobs came in below expectations at a net addition of 145,000 jobs in December versus estimates of 160,000. November's blowout number of 266,000 new jobs was revised down by 10,000 jobs. Good, but not spectacular.\n\nThe unemployment rate remained at a 50-year low. It would appear just about everyone who wants to work is working. Job growth is not too hot to spark inflation concerns and not too low to signal inflation. Which is likely to keep the Fed on the sidelines.\n\nAnd then there is the fact that wages aren't growing as fast as the experts expected.\n\nAverage hourly earnings rose a modest 0.1% in December compared to an estimate of 0.3%. Year over year, average hourly earnings rose a manageable 2.9%, again versus expectations of 3.1%.\n\nMost popular models in each state:Ford's F-series remains America's best-selling vehicle, but in 19 states these models were more popular\n\nBuying a home may be easier:More starter homes are getting built\n\nBut consumers don't need significant wage increases to prosper. Despite unexpectedly low wage growth, the consumer is confident and still spending. That is because inflation is well below 2%, interest rates are near historic lows, tax-cuts increased net take-home pay and energy costs are muted. Since the American consumer drives two-thirds of domestic GDP growth (and 17% of global GDP growth) he or she matters to growth. And the picture looks pretty rosy.\n\nSo, Friday's job report is bullish for stocks for three reasons.\n\n1. The Fed is more likely to stay on the sidelines, with jobs growing at reasonable but not blowout levels and wage growth manageable. Think of steady jobs and wage growth as the sweet spot for Fed policy which is good for stock investors.\n\n2. If Americans are working, they are contributing to their 401(k) accounts, putting money into the market every two weeks and potentially driving stock prices higher. As companies buy back shares while investors increase allocation to stocks – supply becomes scarcer in the face of increased demand. It's econ 101.\n\n3. If wage growth remains muted (as it did in December), corporate margins are not at risk. The worry for investors has been that as the unemployment rate reaches historic lows and the employment participation rate maxes out, wage pressure would rise and negatively impact corporate earnings and margins. That does not yet seem to be happening – another bit of good news for stocks.\n\nWhen you are tempted to throw in the towel and declare the market irrational, remember that it is a forward discounting mechanism that is already looking past today's news to what that means for the future.\n\nWe believe that the market may need a correction to prune excesses and reaccelerate from here. But when a sell-off occurs, remember that the underlying fundamentals for stock performance continue to be more bullish than not. And if your neighbors are working, that is better for the economy and good for all of us.\n\nNancy Tengler is chief investment strategist at Tengler Wealth Management, ButcherJoseph Asset Management and the author of The Women's Guide to Successful Investing.
AP\n\nIOWA CITY, Iowa (AP) — Former NFL and Iowa safety Tyler Sash, who died last year at age 27, has been diagnosed with chronic traumatic encephalopathy.\n\nChris Nowinski of the Boston University-affiliated Concussion Legacy Foundation confirmed the diagnosis on Tuesday night. The New York Times was the first to report the finding.\n\nCTE, which can be diagnosed only after death, has been found in the brains of dozens of former football players. Linked to repeated brain trauma, it is associated with symptoms such as memory loss, impaired judgment, depression, and, eventually, progressive dementia.\n\nSash, who won a Super Bowl during his rookie season with the New York Giants, was found dead at his home on Sept. 8. The Iowa State Medical Examiner's office found he died from an accidental overdose after mixing two powerful pain medications, and a history of painful injuries was a contributing factor.\n\nMonths after the Super Bowl victory, Sash was suspended for four games in 2012 for violating the NFL's performance-enhancing substances policy by testing positive for Adderall, a stimulant used primarily to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and the sleep disorder narcolepsy. The Giants cut ties with Sash prior to the 2013 opener, reaching an injury settlement after he sustained a concussion in the preseason finale against New England.\n\nAt Iowa, Sash started 37 games from 2007-10, earning first-team All-Big Ten honors in his final season. He bypassed his fourth year of eligibility to enter the NFL draft.
