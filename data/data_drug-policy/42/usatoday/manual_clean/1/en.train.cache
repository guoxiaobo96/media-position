hilo: the big island geothermal power station that was knocked offline by a volcanic eruption hopes to produce lower-cost electricity under a new agreement with a state utility, company officials said. puna geothermal venture and hawaiian electric light co. are seeking approval of an amended power purchase agreement submitted last week to the state public utilities commission. hawaiian electric said puna geothermal agreed to sell electricity from its restored and enlarged facility, the state's only geothermal power plant, at a reduced price that would save a typical residential customer $7.50 to $13 a month. puna geothermal is working to resume normal operations after the kilauea volcano eruption that began in may 2018 and destroyed more than 700 homes in lower puna. lava destroyed the company's substation and covered geothermal wells, while cutting off road access.

missoula: new data released by the montana food bank network shows more than 40% of respondents to a survey needed food assistance for the first time in their lives since the coronavirus pandemic began. while in 2019 only 1 in every 10 montana residents needed food assistance from a pantry in the montana food bank network, in 2020, that figure could jump at least 29%, the missoulian reports. the number of people receiving food assistance for the first time after the covid crisis was pretty astounding, said lorriane burhop, the chief policy officer of the montana food bank network. the survey conducted from june to july garnered 917 responses across 30 counties in the state. the report said 70% of adults lost income or were furloughed as a result of the economic fallout from the pandemic. burhop said that reveals how many people were making ends meet, but the loss of just one or two paychecks all of a sudden pushes those households into crisis, and they need to turn to a local food pantry for help.

colorado springs, colo. (january 15, 2019) – usada announced today that jennifer maia, of curitiba, brazil, has accepted a six-month sanction for a violation of the ufc® anti-doping policy after testing positive for prohibited substances from a contaminated dietary supplement. maia, 30, tested positive for furosemide, hydrochlorothiazide, chlorothiazide, and the thiazide metabolite 4-amino-6-chloro-1,3-benzenedisulfonamide (acb), following an out-of-competition test conducted on august 16, 2018. these substances are specified substances in the class of diuretics and masking agents and are prohibited at all times under the ufc anti-doping policy, which has adopted the world anti-doping agency (wada) prohibited list. during an investigation into the circumstances of her case, opened and sealed containers of a dietary supplement she was using at the time of the august 16, 2018 sample collection, and that she declared on her doping control form, were sent to the wada-accredited laboratory in brazil for analysis. although no prohibited substances were listed on the supplement label, the analysis revealed that both contained the prohibited substances for which maia tested positive. accordingly, this product has been added to the high risk list of supplements maintained on usada's online dietary supplement safety education and awareness resource – supplement 411 (www.supplement411.org). further, usada reminds athletes that dietary supplement products marketed for weight loss carry significant risk to contain prohibited prescription medications, such as diuretics. under the ufc anti-doping policy, as well as the world anti-doping code, the determination that an athlete's positive test was caused by a contaminated product may result in a reduced sanction.

while these were the early effects of redefinition, the more profound consequences will be to marriage itself. law shapes culture; culture shapes beliefs; beliefs shape action. the law now effectively teaches that mothers and fathers are replaceable, that marriage is simply about consenting adult relationships, of whatever formation the parties happen to prefer. this undermines the truth that children deserve a mother and a father — one of each.

albany: faced with mounting criticism over the slow pace of the coronavirus vaccine rollout, gov. andrew cuomo announced friday that, starting this week, the state will allow a much wider swath of the public to get inoculated, including anyone age 75 or older. the governor warned that the supply of vaccines available to people other than health care workers and nursing home patients would be very limited at first. new york has used roughly half of the 900,000 doses received so far, but cuomo claimed it hasn't received nearly enough to vaccinate all health care workers. cuomo said a beefed-up statewide distribution network will include more than 1,000 pharmacies, doctors' networks and county health departments. the 3.2 million new yorkers newly eligible for the vaccine under the 1b designation include teachers, first responders, firefighters, public transit workers and police. there are 1.4 million people 75 or older who will be eligible. caution, caution, caution, because the supply is a major problem, cuomo said. you'll wind up having 3,000 distribution points in a couple of weeks, but none of them will have nearly enough vaccine.

santa fe: the new mexico public education department is working with school districts and internet providers to expand broadband access in rural areas struggling with remote learning, according to lawyers for the state. in a response filed in court last week, the lawyers also said school funding hasn't been cut since the pandemic started. the filing comes after plaintiffs in a landmark education lawsuit argued that the state's attempts to provide internet access and learning devices were woefully insufficient. in a motion filed in december, the plaintiffs asked state district judge matthew wilson to order the state to connect more children to online learning by immediately identifying students who lack laptops or tablets and providing internet vouchers for at-risk households. with in-person learning currently off limits, the inability to access remote classes has been a challenge for many rural and low-income students, particularly native american children living on tribal lands. court documents show the public education department distributed about 6,200 laptops and 700 residential hot spots, all of which went to tribal communities.

chicago: chicago public schools students began their return to the classroom monday as school doors opened to thousands of pre-kindergarten and some special education students. the nation's third-largest district, with about 355,000 students, plans a gradual return to in-person instruction after going remote last march due to the coronavirus pandemic. it is our city's first day of embarking on our path to returning to in-person learning, mayor lori lightfoot said at a southwest side elementary school, where students wore face coverings, and desks had sneeze guard barriers. nearly 40% of eligible students, about 77,000, expressed interest in returning, with about 6,000 students in pre-kindergarten and special education expected monday. the chicago teachers union has opposed reopening over safety concerns. union officials claim the district hasn't done enough to protect teachers from covid-19, proposing to continue distance learning until teachers are vaccinated. district officials argue distance learning doesn't work well for all, particularly many black and latino students who make up the majority of the district. the district's safety plan includes purchasing classroom air purifiers and a testing program.

albuquerque: the state is moving ahead with covid-19 vaccine distribution, expanding eligibility friday to people 75 and older as well as residents with underlying medical conditions that place them at greater risk. the expanded list under what is known as phase 1b of the distribution plan also includes front-line essential workers who can't work remotely and other vulnerable populations such as the homeless and those in correctional facilities or residential treatment centers. shots also are still being given to health care workers, first responders, and staff and residents at nursing homes and other long-term care facilities. health secretary dr. tracie collins called the vaccination effort critical, saying she was pleased to move to the next stage. state officials said last week that new mexico is among the leading states when it comes to vaccination rates. they estimated that between 62,000 to 68,500 vaccines had been administered in new mexico from a supply of more than 106,000 doses. updated numbers were expected monday.

las vegas: funeral homes and the county coroner in las vegas are preparing for a post-holiday spike in coronavirus deaths by adding storage space – including refrigerated trailers with special shelving – for corpses. michael murphy, a consultant serving as interim clark county coroner, said southern nevada was fortunate in procuring the portable metal containers early in the pandemic because jurisdictions throughout the country are now competing for ways to store bodies awaiting burial or cremation. if you don't get them for your community, they are going to another community, murphy said. they're getting hard to come by. nevada has reported more than 2,500 coronavirus-related deaths in clark county, where most of the state's population resides. state health officials had reported more deaths last week – 243 as of just thursday – than any week since march. murphy said the coroner's office distributed nine storage containers ranging in length from 20 feet to 40 feet funeral homes and had three more on the way. in case of a surge, one container was left in the coroner's office parking lot in mid-december. it's not being used but could add space for up to 60 bodies in addition to the 100 inside the morgue.

bismarck: the state's efforts to make its legislative session safer during the coronavirus pandemic should also make it easier for citizens to observe the proceedings and participate in government, leaders and longtime observers say. legislative leaders have spent more than $2.6 million in federal covid-19 relief money to beef up livestreaming and remote technology to allow people to watch committee meetings and floor sessions in real time. the public will be able to give remote testimony and not have to worry about driving to bismarck in the middle of winter. they will be able to follow certain issues that they're interested in from the committee room to the chamber, and if it passes and goes to the next chamber, they'll know everything that's said, everything that's done, said republican senate majority leader rich wardner, who spearheaded the upgrades. house and senate floor sessions have been livestreamed, archived and indexed online since 2013, the bismarck tribune reports. but much of the action, including hearings on bills, takes place in committee meetings, north dakota newspaper association attorney jack mcdonald said.

after a thorough investigation of the circumstances that preceded her positive test, which included a comprehensive review of justino's documented medical history, usada accepted justino's explanation that her use of spironolactone began in late september, following her bout at ufc fight night brasilia, and was in accordance with her physician's recommendation for the treatment of a legitimate medical condition. nonetheless, because spironolactone is prohibited at all times under the ufc anti-doping policy, usada advised justino that her use of the medication without a valid tue violated the ufc anti-doping policy. accordingly, justino applied for a tue to authorize her use of the medication, with retroactive effect.

south whitley: a northern indiana dam that was the scene of a deadly 2017 kayaking accident has been demolished, making the region's eel river safer for recreation and removing a barrier to migrating fish. a crew that began demolishing the collamer dam on wednesday finished removing the last of the concrete structure thursday, said jerry sweeten, a retired manchester university biology professor. the dam's removal means the eel river now includes about 95 miles of free-flowing open waterway that will promote both safer recreation and the river's ecological health, sweeten said. this is a remarkable thing, to open up this much of the river, he told the journal gazette. there's now no barrier to migrating fish, including small-mouth bass and several species of suckers, including the great red horse sucker, which is an endangered species in indiana, sweeten said. the river has 52 fish species, 43 of which migrate upstream, he said.

lincoln: a state lawmaker concerned about prison overcrowding plans to propose building a new 300-bed work release facility in omaha. state sen. steve lathrop tells the omaha world-herald he'll introduce a bill calling on the state to begin planning a new community corrections facility. building the new facility could cost more than $40 million, but lathrop's bill would only require the state to plan for the new work release facility. nebraska's prisons currently hold 2,006 more inmates than their design capacity of 3,535 inmates, putting the prison system at 157% of its design capacity. lathrop says the state is facing a prison overcrowding crisis and needs to address the issue. a consultant recommended expanding omaha's community corrections prison in 2014, but the project was never done. lathrop says work-release facilities can help better prepare inmates to return to society.

phoenix: state health officials have reported 5,158 new cases of covid-19 and three additional deaths. the latest figures released monday by the arizona department of health services come as the number of people hospitalized due to the virus hits a new high. officials say 54% of inpatient hospitalizations across the state are covid-19-related. the number of patients in intensive care units due to the virus is also at a record high for arizona. according to state health officials, only 7% of icu beds remain available. the crush of covid-19 patients has caused some phoenix- and tucson-area hospitals to suspend elective surgeries and turn away ambulance patients or transfers from other hospitals, while still accepting walk-in patients needing emergency care. hospital officials have discussed triage protocols that the state could order to decide which patients get access to limited resources.

the tightening job market that the labor department portrayed last week has delivered only limited benefits to one group: the long-term unemployed. the number of people jobless six months or more may have fallen by 25,000 to 1.8 million in december and is down from 6.8 million in 2010. yet they still represent a quarter of all those unemployed, about the same as a year ago and up from 18% before the recession began in late 2007.
des moines: visitors to the statehouse will not be required to wear masks, and employees will not be required to disclose if they have tested positive for the coronavirus, according to safety protocols released ahead of monday's start of the 2021 legislative session. house speaker pat grassley and senate majority leader jack whitver, both republicans, released the guidelines a few days before the legislature was due to return. because republicans hold majorities in the iowa house and senate, they are responsible for setting the rules. the guidelines ask anyone who is sick or has a fever or other symptoms to please stay home. they state that anyone in the capitol building should practice social distancing by keeping at least 6 feet away from others. if an individual is unable to practice social distancing, a face covering is recommended. masks and face shields will be made available at the capitol for those who voluntarily want to wear a mask, the guidelines state. members of the public will be required to have their temperature checked and complete a questionnaire administered by capitol security officers when they enter the building. those requirements do not appear to apply to lawmakers.

new york: the city will install 100 new security cameras in ultra-orthodox jewish neighborhoods in an effort to prevent anti-semitic attacks, mayor bill de blasio announced friday. fear has gripped the city's orthodox jewish community since the the fatal dec. 10 attack at a kosher grocery store across the hudson river in jersey city and the dec. 29 stabbings at a hanukkah celebration in suburban monsey. the new cameras will be installed in the brooklyn neighborhoods of williamsburg, crown heights and borough park, where hasidic jewish residents have reported attacks ranging from someone pulling off a wig or hat to more violent assaults. an attack on the jewish community is an attack on all new yorkers, de blasio, a democrat, said in a statement. police officials say anti-semitic crimes in new york city jumped 21% in 2019 compared with 2018.

st. louis: as coronavirus cases surge, public health officials are thankful that, so far, the flu has remained largely in check. health leaders worried about a possible twindemic as the severe flu season began in the late fall – something that would leave patients with the flu and covid-19 competing for ventilators and hospital beds. missouri's influenza report shows that by dec. 26, 681 people had tested positive for influenza, the lowest total by that time of year in at least the past six flu seasons, the st. louis post-dispatch reports. typically, case numbers by the end of december have averaged just under 13,000. there has been one confirmed influenza death in the state since october. in comparison, 3,730 people have died from covid-19 in missouri since october. i think this year shows that the steps we're taking to drop our covid numbers are also preventing the flu, said dr. hilary babcock, an infectious disease specialist with the washington university school of medicine and bjc healthcare. she cited measures such as social distancing and mask-wearing.

helena: new gov. greg gianforte has signaled he won't continue a statewide mask mandate in place since july, though he said he plans to wear a mask himself and get vaccinated against covid-19. if gianforte, a republican, reverses former democratic gov. steve bullock's mask order, montana will be just the second state after mississippi to lift its mandate. thirty-eight states now have statewide mandates. i trust montanans with their health and the health of their loved ones, gianforte said in a recent interview with kaiser health news. the state has a role in clearly communicating the risks of who is most vulnerable, what the potential consequences are, but then i do trust montanans to make the right decisions for themselves and their family. gianforte has said he plans to announce his covid-19 policy for the state the week he assumes office, according to the associated press. he was sworn in monday, becoming the state's first republican governor in 16 years. montana is the only state where control of the governor's office is changing parties as a result of november's election. and among the 11 governors being sworn in this month, gianforte will be the only one new to managing his state's response to the pandemic.

the ufc organization was notified today that the u.s. anti-doping agency (usada) informed cynthia calvillo of a potential anti-doping policy violation involving carboxy-tetrahydrocannabinol (carboxy-thc) which is a metabolite of marijuana and/or hashish, above the decision limit of 180 ng/ml, stemming from an in-competition sample collected in conjunction with her recent bout in las vegas, nevada on december 30, 2017, ufc 219: cyborg vs. holm. usada, the independent administrator of the ufc anti-doping policy, will handle the results management and appropriate adjudication of this case involving calvillo, as it relates to the ufc anti-doping policy and future ufc participation. because the nevada athletic commission was the regulatory body overseeing the fight in las vegas and has licensing jurisdiction over calvillo, usada will work to ensure that the nevada athletic commission has the necessary information to determine its proper judgment of calvillo's potential anti-doping violation. additional information will be provided at the appropriate time as the process moves forward.

portland: the legislature will consider a proposal that would require insurance companies to cover covid-19 tests and immunizations and waive any co-payments related to them. senate president troy jackson and speaker of the house ryan fecteau, who are both democrats, unveiled the covid-19 patient bill of rights on monday. the proposal will be the first bill of the new session of the maine legislature, democratic leaders said. lawmakers were sworn in last month. jackson said the proposal is about making sure patients around the state maintain access to critical health care services during the pandemic. the covid-19 patient bill of rights brings us closer to the end of this crisis and the hold covid-19 has had over our lives, he said. the proposal also includes provisions that ease requirements for telehealth visits. and it's designed to allow residents to get larger supplies of their prescriptions to reduce the number of visits to a pharmacy. the maine legislature office of the presiding officers said the proposal is about making sure nothing prevents mainers from getting the health care they need to protect themselves, their families and loved ones from this serious virus.

usada recognizes that over the course of a career, athletes may experience illnesses or medical conditions that require the use of a particular medication for proper treatment. while athletes are educated and encouraged to apply for a tue in advance of using a prohibited substance or method, the ufc anti-doping policy permits athletes to file for retroactive tues where the use of a prohibited substance or method was medically justified. athletes are cautioned, however, that applying retroactively is at their own risk and the only guaranteed way to avoid an anti-doping policy violation for using a prohibited substance or method is by obtaining a tue prior to the use of a prohibited substance or method.

pierre: determined to defy the coronavirus, the legislature will convene for its 96th session tuesday, when lawmakers will begin trying to settle a state budget flush with one-time money from federal coronavirus funds, as well as figure what to make of voter-initiated measures to legalize both medical and recreational marijuana. but the biggest challenge for lawmakers may be in carrying out their duties while trying to avoid virus infections. chamber floors will feature plexiglass dividers; mask-wearing rules and rapid testing for lawmakers with covid-19 symptoms are in the works; and committee meetings are expected to use remote participation. but all 105 lawmakers, in addition to a cast of staff, lobbyists and visitors, are expected in the capitol at some point. the legislature is trying to avoid a virus outbreak that cripples the session. that may be difficult. a handful of infections surfaced among lawmakers after they gathered for gov. kristi noem's budget address last month, and the statehouse is already notorious for breeding what's known as the capitol crud, the hacking cough that seems to spread among lawmakers and lobbyists every year.

austin: health officials in austin and travis county announced saturday plans to open space in the austin convention center for covid-19 patients as hospitalizations in texas set a record high for the 13th consecutive day. state health officials reported 13,935 patients hospitalized statewide, 14 more than friday. the alternate care site in austin was initially established during a summer surge of the coronavirus but has not yet taken patients, according to a statement from the austin-travis county health authority. activating the alternate care site means that we believe that it is inevitable that the health care system in central texas will exceed capacity and will soon be overwhelmed, said dr. jason pickett, deputy medical director of the health authority. the site is for patients who do not need high-level or intensive care, according to the statement. patients needing that level of care will remain at hospitals. the seven-day rolling average of new cases in texas has risen from 14,553.7 per day dec. 25 to 20,396.8, according to data from johns hopkins university, and the average positivity increased from 14.18% to 20.88%.

this is not simply a public policy or ethical issue — it's also a rhetorical issue. trump understands marketing and the ability to repackage his policies and manufacture a crisis in order to win. he believes — and it is possible he may be right — that the prime-time speech and subsequent visit to the southern border could result in a slight shift in public opinion and congressional sentiment on the wall. if that happens, it won't matter how much he lied or the apparent lack of a valid grounding for his proposed border policy. what will matter is how convincing trump's message was. this is a pivotal moment for our country. how sad it is that all of this boils down to winning and losing, rather than the nation's best interest.

columbus: there's limited evidence that expanding the electronic monitoring of inmates in the state would reduce the rates at which ex-offenders commit new crimes or that it would enhance public safety, according to a new report. in addition, creating a system that would allow real-time monitoring of inmates in the hopes of placing them near crimes would still do nothing to prevent such crimes from happening, though it could help aid investigators and parole officers, according to the report released last week. such a system is known as crime scene correlation technology. the daily operations required for such a system are exceedingly complex and would require careful planning and consistent oversight, according to the report, which was given to a state task force looking at all aspects of supervising inmates upon release. additionally, the costs associated with developing and operating such an initiative would be substantial and recurring.

indianapolis: anxiety, depression and other mental health conditions have become more prevalent among hoosiers since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic, the state's top health officials said in calling for renewed attention on mental health resources. many of those reporting mental health woes are affected by covid-19 itself, jennifer sullivan, secretary of the state's family and social services administration, said during gov. eric holcomb's weekly briefing wednesday on the state's coronavirus response. that includes dealing with loss and fear, disruption to daily life with recurrent needs for quarantine and isolation, changes to school and work schedules, unexpected illness of friends and family, and disruption to normal social supports. cold weather and the holiday season, too, have likely added difficulties for people with existing mental illnesses and those experiencing acute stress, she said. as a way to help, sullivan encouraged hoosiers to use the state-run bewellindiana.org to take a mental health self-assessment. since april, more than 25,000 hoosiers have completed those assessments. for more than three-quarters of those taking the surveys, there was confirmation of a mental health diagnosis, sullivan said.

spokane: the city is planning to write off hundreds of thousands of dollars in unpaid utility bills dating back two decades as it looks to upgrade its payment software. the proposal would forgive more than $450,000 in payments and late fees accrued by 174 ratepayers during the years 1999 to 2013. the spokesman-review reports a city official says those payments would be legally difficult to recoup. nonpayment of utilities, including charges for trash collection, sewer and water services, can result in late fees, liens placed on a property and termination of service. but the debt that is being considered for forgiveness may have been incurred by businesses no longer located in the area or residents who died or moved away. spokane city councilwoman candace mumm says she wants to make sure city officials have done everything to secure payment before writing the debts off.

atlanta: georgia ranks last among states for the share of available covid-19 vaccines that it has administered, but gov. brian kemp said the data is misleading because some hospitals have failed to report all the shots they've given. still, the republican governor acknowledged friday that the state is struggling with the vaccine rollout that has become his primary focus even as georgia sets daily records for people hospitalized with the respiratory illness. look, i'm not happy with it, kemp said of the rollout. i'm pleased with how hard everybody's working, but i'm not happy with where we are; we got to keep moving the needle. we're working on that every single day. kemp said the state now has the capacity to administer 11,428 doses a day. at that rate, it would take more than 21/ 2 years to vaccinate every georgia resident. some of it is due to poor planning and execution of a mass vaccination strategy, if georgia ever actually had one, wrote amber schmidtke, an epidemiologist who reports daily on georgia's outbreak. instead, the responsibility for vaccinating a population of 10.6 million people has been pushed down to 18 underfunded public health districts, operating with a skeleton crew.

houston: shriners hospital for children in the texas medical center will close in 2021 to consolidate area care at its larger galveston hospital. the decision, made last fall, was driven by a desire to build one premier hospital, according to the houston chronicle. it was not based on financial concerns. though the closure will end shriners' 100-year presence in houston, it will mean all four specialty care departments – acute burns, orthopedic conditions, spinal injuries, and cleft lip and palate abnormalities – will be provided in galveston. this will make more efficient use of resources and enable us to provide our patients who need more than one type of care to receive it all in one place, said mel bower, director of marketing at the shriners national offices in tampa. it makes more strategic sense.

columbia: as other states trim expenses and borrow money amid the economic fallout prompted by the coronavirus pandemic, gov. henry mcmaster is already looking to shore up the state's rainy day fund with $500 million for a future crisis. mcmaster released his spending proposals for next year's budget friday, less than a week before legislators will gather for the 2021 session tuesday. the governor's so-called skinny budget, at roughly $9 billion, keeps agencies running without any cuts. south carolina's relative economic stability was a function of careful budgeting, freezing new spending and keeping state businesses open throughout the pandemic, mcmaster's office said. the state has also avoided dipping into its reserve fund for any pandemic-related purposes, using federal dollars instead. but the pandemic's effects still whittled down an expected $1.8 billion surplus into the millions. the governor's proposals include $123 million in grants for small businesses hit with revenue losses during the pandemic and $30 billion to expand broadband across across the state, two areas that federal pandemic relief monies have already touched in the state.

stamford: the town has voted to overturn in its community gov. phil scott's emergency orders issued with the intention of protecting the state during the covid-19 pandemic. the select board of the town of about 800 people along the massachusetts border voted 3-2 tuesday to terminate the governor's restrictions. the three board members in favor of the idea cite a section of vermont law that they believe allows them to reject the governor's order. select board member daniel potvin said during the meeting that quarantine requirements, restrictions on large family or public gatherings, and face mask requirements violate the constitution in part because they were imposed without normal due process of law. he asserted it was important to stand up against such measures because it could lead to more loss of personal freedoms later on. scott hasn't enforced the orders heavy-handedly, he said, but that could change. potvin said friday the town is expecting some type of legal action from the state of vermont, but until it's cleared up, the governor's orders are still in effect.

richmond: lawmakers are set to start this year's legislative session focused on covid-19 relief efforts and legalizing marijuana. the 2021 session will kick off wednesday, with legislators meeting away from the capitol as the state continues to wrestle with the impacts of a global pandemic that's shut down schools, closed businesses and left more than 5,000 virginians dead in the past 10 months, including a state senator. the house of delegates plans to meet remotely, while the senate will meet at a large conference center near the capitol. this will be the second regular legislative session controlled by democrats since they won control of the general assembly for the first time in a generation in 2019. republicans, upset that the house is meeting remotely and that lawmakers held an extended special session last year, have signaled they will limit what's normally a 45-day session to only 30 days. democrats can extend the the number of legislative working days by having gov. ralph northam call a special session. state del. schuyler vanvalkenburg said a top priority will be ensuring that schools have robust funding, including money for extra counselors, to help teachers deal with the fallout from the coronavirus once students return to the classroom.

hartford: the leader of connecticut's largest teachers union is urging school superintendents statewide to switch all classes to remote learning until at least the middle of this month, citing concerns about the coronavirus pandemic. jeff leake, president of the connecticut education association, said many students and educators were to return to classrooms monday, before potential virus surges from the holiday season are over. he said many school districts already have moved to strictly distance learning through mid-january. while no one is more eager to return to the classroom than connecticut's dedicated teachers, detecting and stopping the spread of covid-19 must be the top priority, leake said in a statement sunday evening. he also called on the state to mandate more coronavirus testing and said a new survey by his union and the american federation of teachers shows that schools are not the safest places for children or educators amid a pandemic. gov. ned lamont and state education officials have been allowing local school officials to decide whether to switch to all-remote learning but have been advocating for schools to be kept open, saying it's better for students.

boston: the state is preparing to launch a pooled testing program in schools that aims to help expand monitoring for covid-19 and encourage schools to remain open with students attending in person. pooled testing is designed to test larger batches of people at a lower cost. under the program outlined by gov. charlie baker at a news conference friday, teachers, staffers and students would be tested in batches of 10 using swabs in the front part of the nose. ten swabs at a time would be placed in a single tube and shipped off to a lab for testing. if the tube is tested and comes back negative, all 10 individuals are presumed to be negative for the coronavirus. if the test for a tube comes back positive, the 10 who contributed swabs to the tube are tested individually to determine who is positive and who is negative. a handful of school districts are already using pooled testing, including salem, watertown and medford. the new program will be available to schools next month. baker said the goal is to make sure that students can remain in their classes rather than relying on remote learning.

seattle: king county is starting 2021 with plans to buy as many as a dozen hotels to permanently house hundreds of homeless people and provide them with services. we have every reason to believe that homelessness will get a lot worse after this pandemic unless we take bold action, said leo flor, director of the king county department of community and human services. the initiative is called health through housing, king5 reports. it uses revenue from a 0.1% sales tax increase to develop a network of apartment-like shelters, with the goal of getting people out of tents, off sidewalks and into safe, clean homes. the county hopes to eventually house 45%, or 2,000 people, of its chronically homeless population of 4,500. the goal for 2021 is to create housing units for 1,500 people countywide, in former hotels and nursing homes throughout the county. flor said hotel owners are already approaching the county and offering their properties, which are struggling to fill rooms during the pandemic.

omaha: restaurants that were allowed to start selling carryout cocktails amid the pandemic want to continue doing so even after the public health crisis wanes. the omaha world-herald reports the nebraska restaurant association plans to push for the expansion during the upcoming 2021 legislative session. the waiver extends until the end of the pandemic emergency. this is a way for our restaurants to survive and come out the other side of this pandemic, said zoe olson, the executive director of the restaurant group. olson said the association's proposal would include a requirement for some sort of seal on carryout beverages that, if broken, would indicate someone had opened their takeout drink in transit. the proposal would also end to-go drinks at some point, so legislators could review the policy and decide whether it should be extended. but the idea is getting some pushback from groups that oppose binge drinking and drunken driving. when you increase the availability and the ease of access to alcohol, that's when you get increased harms, said chris wagner, executive director of project extra mile, an omaha-based group that seeks to prevent or reduce problems associated with alcohol.

denver: a day after gov. jared polis announced that restrictions for places like restaurants and gyms will be eased in much of the state starting this week, some local public health officials said they were concerned about the move. the governor cited improving statewide covid-19 metrics in lifting certain restrictions in 33 counties, including denver and the entire front range, but his announcement wednesday came as not all of those counties meet the individual requirements to downgrade restrictions, the denver post reports. it appears that if there's enough pressure from the business and economic forces in the state that we will change the dial to meet those demands, and that's kind of frustrating, said mark johnson, executive director of jefferson county public health. the announcement came a day after colorado said it had confirmed the united states' first case of a new and apparently more contagious variant of the coronavirus. we don't believe that it in any way reflects the spread of the disease or how dangerous the disease is or our concern about what is going to happen with christmas, new year's or the new variant that is more infectious, johnson said.

columbus: the newly elected state senate president will be sworn into office from his home monday after contracting covid-19 over the holidays. senate president matt huffman experienced mild symptoms before the new year and is doing well, spokesperson john fortney said. huffman, a republican from lima, joins a list of more than a dozen ohio lawmakers who have tested positive for the coronavirus since the pandemic began in march. huffman was chosen to succeed former senate president larry obhof for the 134th general assembly following a session filled with pandemic-related hurdles, a federal bribery scheme and infighting within the majority party. fortney said huffman will return to the statehouse after following cdc quarantine guidelines and senate policy. the ohio statehouse has become the scene of a partisan divide over mask-wearing in recent months, with republicans continuing to push down democrats' motions to require all statehouse staff to wear masks while in session and committees.

minneapolis: the minneapolis va health care center has been cited for failures in connection with the 2018 suicide of a veteran in its care. it's the second time in 16 months that a federal watchdog has cited the medical center after a suicide. in a report last week, the va office of inspector general found the minnesota veteran said he wanted to die after he was admitted in spring 2018. a nurse also overheard him telling someone on the telephone that he would die at the hospital. hours after that call, he attempted suicide and couldn't be revived. the inspector general found that staff members failed to share the man's suicidal thoughts with others on the treatment team, which might have prevented his death, the star tribune reports. his death came weeks after another veteran killed himself in the center's parking lot, less than 24 hours after he was discharged from the mental health unit.

jackson: gov. phil bryant is leaving office tuesday after serving his limit of two terms. the republican says he believes the state's economy is stronger, vulnerable children are better protected, and students are showing stronger academic performance. he also says a recent outburst of violence in mississippi prisons is not something he would have wanted as part of his legacy. five inmates were killed, an undisclosed number were injured, and facilities at the state penitentiary at parchman were so damaged that the state set an emergency contract to move 375 inmates to a private prison. bryant's predecessor, fellow gop gov. haley barbour, pardoned nearly 200 people as he finished his second term in 2012. people protesting prison conditions last week called on bryant to release some nonviolent inmates to ease prison crowding, but the onetime deputy sheriff says he will not issue any pardons or commute any sentences and does not think of inmates as victims.

honolulu: the state's doctor shortage has worsened during the coronavirus pandemic, and experts say the chances of a rebound hinge on hawaii's ability to help doctors stay in business. more than 400 doctors say covid-19 has forced them to close their practices, reduce hours or switch to telehealth services, hawaii public radio reports. that brings the state's overall doctor shortage to more than 1,000, according to the latest hawaii physician workforce assessment released by the university of hawaii's john a. burns school of medicine. so what it means is that if you need a doctor urgently, you might die because you might not be able to access that, said dr. kelley withy, director of the hawaii and pacific basin area health education center at the honolulu medical school. and if you need a specialist chronically to help you manage your condition, you may have to travel to get to that specialist, and it may be by air travel, which of course is especially difficult right now. the shortage is greater in the communities beyond oahu, said dr. elizabeth ann ignacio, an intervention radiologist on maui. hawaii has more than 10,000 licensed doctors, but only about 3,200 are active, ignacio said.

raleigh: state education officials recently estimated educators can't account for about 10,000 to 15,000 public school students this school year amid the covid-19 pandemic. lawmakers and educators worry more students are falling through cracks in the system than is presently known, as the coronavirus pandemic upends students' learning plans and keeps some out of virtual or physical classrooms. david stegall, the north carolina department of public instruction's deputy superintendent of innovation, told lawmakers last month that a survey the state conducted of some districts concluded that the whereabouts of about 0.7% to 1% of the state's 1.5 million k-12 public school students are unknown. this happens when a school has lost contact with a student, often because the student dropped out without alerting the school or moved elsewhere without the parent notifying the school or responding to repeated requests to get their kid back in class. if a student misses at least 10 consecutive days of school in north carolina, they are typically unenrolled, and the school works to account for them.

juneau: a judge ruled friday that an effort to recall republican gov. mike dunleavy may proceed, a decision that is expected to be appealed. the decision by superior court judge eric aarseth in anchorage followed arguments in the case friday and came two months after gail fenumiai, director of the state division of elections, rejected a bid to advance the recall effort. fenumiai said her decision was based on an opinion from attorney general kevin clarkson that found the reasons listed for recall were factually and legally deficient. the recall dunleavy group has argued that clarkson's analysis was overreaching and that the recall effort should have been allowed to move to a second, signature-gathering phase. among its claims, the group said dunleavy violated the law by not appointing a judge within a required time frame, misused state funds for partisan online ads and mailers, and improperly used his veto authority to attack the judiciary.

montpelier: the state ranks second in the nation in the pace of receiving and administering covid-19 vaccines per 100,000 people, human services agency secretary mike smith said friday. as of thursday night, 21,000 vermonters had been vaccinated, he said during the state's biweekly briefing on the coronavirus. however we need to keep accelerating our pace of vaccinations, even as supplies remain uneven and often disappointing, smith said. the state has now included about 4,500 first responders – such as police and firefighters – among the first group to receive the vaccine, he said. primarily because we discovered that often these vermonters are responding to accident scenes and 911 medical calls. they are administering aid or helping to get individuals ready for transport even before ems arrives. they are directly involved in patient care, he said. the next group to be vaccinated will be vermonters aged 75 and older, followed by 70 and up and then 65 and older. the three groups make up 125,000 people, and it will likely take until the spring to vaccinate them with the current allocation of doses, smith said.

iowa city: new clinical trials began last week at the university of iowa hospitals and clinics for a covid-19 vaccine that officials there hope will be even more viable for global distribution. to really get (covid-19) under control, we need the world vaccinated, said dr. patricia winokur, executive dean at the university of iowa's carver college of medicine and principal investigator for the ui site of the clinical drug trial. uihc began enrolling participants in the novavax trial last monday, and winokur said it's still accepting more. winokur estimated 30,000 individuals would be enrolled at sites across the country, all told. so far, roughly a sixth of those spots have already been filled. while the novavax vaccine – like pfizer's and moderna's – will require two doses, winokur said she expects it could be easier to distribute around the world because of the temperature at which the vaccine is stored. while early data suggests novavax can be stored at refrigerator temperature, the pfizer vaccine needs to be stored at close to -100 degrees fahrenheit to remain effective, and moderna's must be kept at -4 degrees fahrenheit.

columbus: as gov. mike dewine applies pressure to get covid-19 vaccines administered faster throughout the state, those charged with inoculating people against the virus say a combination of factors has contributed to a slow rollout. vaccines arrived during the holidays, when more workers were off and less likely to be available to get the vaccine. in some cases, vaccine hesitancy has contributed to lower demand as well, they say. shipments also have been unpredictable, sometimes arriving later than expected or in smaller quantities than previous allotments, making it difficult to plan for distribution. protocols require a 15-minute observation window for each patient, limiting the number of people who can cycle through a chair each day. this is not your routine stop by the primary care office to get a flu shot. this is a whole different operation, said dr. andy thomas, chief clinical officer at ohio state university's wexner medical center. on wednesday, dewine said he had grown impatient with the rollout and challenged hospitals to administer the vaccine within 24 hours of receiving it, calling it a moral imperative to get the vaccine out as quickly as possible.

salt lake city: rare salt formations have been documented for the first time on the shores of the great salt lake, and they could yield insights about salt structures found on mars before they disappear for good. they're showing up now in part because water levels at the largest natural lake west of the mississippi have been lowered by drought and water diversion, exposing more shoreline. that means there are more places where water can bubble up to the surface from warm, sulfate-rich springs. when it hits the cold air, a mineral called glauber's salt, or mirabilite, separates out. the tiny crystals have built up over the past several months, eventually creating flat terraces stacked atop one another like the travertine rimstone and dam terraces at yellowstone's mammoth hot springs. from above, though, the cascading terraces are like an enormous piece of lace laid over the sandy earth. there are now four mounds at the great salt lake beach, growing up to 3 feet tall.

provo: the state's number of drug overdose suicides has potentially been underreported by 33%, according to a new study. published in the journal suicide and life-threatening behavior, the study came to the conclusion after looking at 2,665 overdose deaths from 2012 to 2015 in utah, the provo daily herald reports. paul nestadt, one of the paper's authors, says the nation's opioid epidemic has clouded suicide classification across the nation. if you work in mental health, it is pretty clear there is a lot of overlap in the symptoms of someone who is using opiates and someone who may be suicidal, nestadt said. state health officials say roughly 630 utahns die from suicide and about 4,570 attempt suicide every year. utah's suicide rate is above the national average, causing the deaths of 22.7 per 100,000 people in 2017, compared to a national rate of 14 people per 100,000. according to the study, that rate could be significantly higher.

detroit: the state is ready to buy 100,000 covid-19 vaccine doses directly from the manufacturer, gov. gretchen whitmer announced monday, in a move she says would help the state ramp up its vaccination efforts. it comes as county health departments and hospital systems say the unpredictable and inadequate supply of vaccines has kept them from getting shots into arms. the request coincides with the state drastically expanding eligibility for the vaccine against the disease caused by the coronavirus. although all michiganders 65 and older – along with teachers, police officers and many more first responders – are eligible to receive the vaccine, a litany of challenges at every level of government means it will likely be some time before people seeking an appointment are actually injected. whitmer sent a letter to alex azar, secretary of the u.s. department of health and human services, asking for permission to buy the doses from pfizer. currently, federal health officials coordinate the delivery of doses to every state in the country.

asheville: reports of sexual assaults against children in asheville and buncombe county rose sharply in 2020, and some experts attribute the increase to the effects of the covid-19 pandemic, as well as a new state mandatory reporting law. the buncombe county sheriff's office had 35 sexual assault reports involving minors in 2019, which jumped to 65 reports through mid-december of 2020, an 86% increase, said spokesman aaron sarver. the asheville police department reported a 55% increase, with 29 cases of sexual assaults on a juvenile in 2019 and 45 through mid-december, said spokeswoman christina hallingse. the new law is resulting in more reports, and we are thankful to have it in place, sheriff's detective sgt. bryon crisp said. but some experts fear the law has gone largely unnoticed, since it started gaining momentum just as covid-19 hit and was mostly focused on the removal of the consent aspect of sexual assault. school personnel are our no. 1 reporters, and if not for covid and school being out for parts of this year, the numbers would likely have been higher, crisp said.

trenton: more than 70% of the state's supply of covid-19 vaccine had not been used as of thursday, echoing a national trend of slow distribution, according to data released by state officials. of the 265,000 doses of the pfizer and moderna vaccines that have been delivered to new jersey, 72,657 residents had been given a shot by thursday afternoon. despite months of planning, state officials said wednesday that a lack of personnel, along with logistics and timing issues, was to blame. remember, you need health care workers to do this, gov. phil murphy said at a briefing. i'm not qualified to deliver these vaccines. the slow rollout has been frustrating to a public eager to end a pandemic that has infected at least 477,000 new jerseyans, killed more than 19,000 and caused vast economic hardship. state health commissioner judy persichilli said the rollout of the moderna vaccine in particular has been slow because it was delivered just before christmas. persichilli said 57% of the state's stockpile of pfizer doses had been administered as of wednesday, calling it one of the highest percentages that i've seen nationally.

baton rouge: the state has unveiled the list of 107 pharmacies that will begin offering the coronavirus vaccine this week to people ages 70 and older. with demand certain to outstrip limited supplies and interest running so high, the state website crashed within minutes of the information's release monday. the louisiana department of health quickly reworked the website to get the list back online. hoping to avoid long lines seen in other states with people awaiting vaccination, the agency stressed that appointments for the immunizations are required. still, people started showing up at their local pharmacies and inundating them with phone calls days ahead of the expanded eligibility, seeking vaccines for themselves or elderly family. gov. john bel edwards' administration called for patience. patients who arrive without an appointment will not be vaccinated. do not arrive at a location without an appointment, the health department said as it announced the list. an estimated 640,000 people in louisiana are newly eligible for the shot this week, but only about 10,000 doses of the moderna vaccine were initially shipped to the state's pharmacies for this cohort, leaving each pharmacy with no more than about 100 doses available to their customers.

hartford: an agreement reached friday in a long-running school desegregation case in the capital city will put the district on a path to ending 30 years of litigation, state officials said. the settlement includes new measures to reach diversity goals and allows for judicial oversight to end once the effort is shown to produce opportunities in diverse school settings for all hartford families. the sheff v. o'neill case began in 1989 with a lawsuit challenging racial and economic segregation and inequalities between hartford schools and suburban schools against then-gov. william o'neill. the plaintiffs were black, latino and white families from hartford. the case was named after milo sheff, one of the main plaintiffs, and his mother, elizabeth horton sheff. in 1996, the state supreme court ruled the extreme racial isolation of hartford students violated the state constitution.

nashville: officials are launching a statewide online scheduling system in the coming days for covid-19 vaccine appointments. the effort aims to prevent people from having to wait in line for hours, sometimes only to be turned away because there are no doses left, state health commissioner lisa piercey said friday. that's been an issue in chattanooga, for instance, where there have been long lines of people waiting in their cars as hamilton county opened vaccine eligibility for those 75 and older. some counties already have been using an appointment-based system. meanwhile, some larger counties are just starting to schedule vaccinations for people 75 and older. on thursday, tennessee reported more than 215,400 covid-19 vaccinations had been administered so far in the state. that's about 3% of the state's population, compared to a 2% national rate reported by federal health officials. more than 4,500 people have received their second doses in tennessee. the state ranks fourth in the country for new coronavirus cases per capita, according to researchers at johns hopkins university.

democratic attorneys general, consumer activists and others sued to stop the administration from expanding access to association health plans and to short-term coverage. the administration said consumers need alternatives to obamacare plans, which can be expensive, especially for those who don't qualify for subsidies. opponents said that because the alternatives have fewer consumer protections and benefits, they would siphon healthy customers out of the obamacare market – increasing the premiums for everyone left. in a letter sent to the white house tuesday, congressional democrats asked for more information on the proposed short-term plans – which they argued would not be legal.

topeka: psychiatrists are so hard to come by in some rural parts of the state that doctors from outside its borders now commonly treat patients through video conference. kansas, like the rest of the u.s., is seeing an increase in patients seeking mental health treatment. the state can't find enough doctors, nurses and therapists to treat them, and providers say the problem is worse in the state's least-populated rural areas. the kansas news service reports the high plains mental health center in northwestern kansas has long struggled to attract psychiatrists for patients in its 20-county coverage area. executive director walt hill stopped even trying because it typically took him more than a year to fill a position. attracting psychiatric nurses is hard, too. so hill turned to providers who conference in from kansas city, missouri; texas; and oklahoma.

boston: gov. charlie baker signed a wide-ranging health care bill friday that he said will codify in law many of the emergency changes made to the state system in response to the coronavirus pandemic. the republican said the new law extends requirements for all insurance carriers in massachusetts to cover covid-19 testing and treatment. it also increases insurance coverage for telehealth services, which have become vital during the pandemic. baker's office said the law also expands the scope of practice for nurse practitioners, other specialized nurses and optometrists; takes steps to protect consumers from surprise medical bills; and calls for a study on the effects of covid-19 on the health care system, among other steps. meanwhile, a covid-19 field hospital that was supposed to open at umass lowell last week instead will open monday after staffing shortages delayed the soft launch. while the site has capacity for 77 beds, the facility has so far only recruited enough nurses to staff one 14-bed pod. lowell general hospital currently has 63 covid-19 patients at its main campus.

cheyenne: health officials have reported that the exterior doors of the cheyenne-laramie county health department were vandalized with fake blood, a few days after a protest was held at the state capitol against public health orders in response to the coronavirus pandemic. department executive director kathy emmons said the fake blood, commonly used on halloween, was splattered on the front and side doors thursday, likely around 5:30 a.m., the wyoming tribune eagle reports. local health and law enforcement officials believe the motivation is tied to opposition to health orders intended to limit the spread of covid-19. about 250 residents gathered at the capitol last monday to protest the orders and burn masks. my assumption is that it's probably in part based on monday, when people were becoming escalated, emmons said. i don't know that it was necessarily about us, so much as somebody wanting to act out in a really destructive way. cheyenne police spokesperson alex farkas said the case is under investigation.

madison heights: an industrial site in suburban detroit from which a greenish stream of contaminated water leaked onto a freeway will be considered for the federal superfund cleanup program, state officials said friday. the department of environment, great lakes and energy said an evaluation of the electro-plating services inc. site will be completed this spring. it will be based on dozens of soil and water samples being taken by the department and the u.s. environmental protection agency. the chrome plating company in madison heights was shut down by state regulators in 2016 due to mismanagement of industrial waste. an epa cleanup removed toxic chemicals and contaminated liquids. the leak of bright green goo onto the shoulder of interstate 696 last month prompted a new investigation. it found high levels of numerous toxins in soil and groundwater at the site, including hexavalent chromium, which is associated with cancer, kidney and liver damage.

supreme court reluctant to rule on juvenile murderers' life sentences
baton rouge: families are eligible for a 15% boost in their food stamp benefits through june, under a federal coronavirus aid package passed by congress. the state said any increases due to people receiving benefits through the supplemental nutrition assistance program started being transferred to benefit cards friday. the latest federal coronavirus legislation didn't expand eligibility for food stamps. but the times-picayune/the new orleans advocate reports that state officials said several key provisions will increase snap's reach. shavana howard, an assistant secretary for the louisiana department of children and family services, said the program will no longer count federal extended unemployment benefits as income, which previously put snap out of reach for 44,165 applicants between march and july and ousted 2,185 households receiving benefits. howard said many students who also did not qualify for food stamps because a portion of their parents' income was counted against them will qualify this time. hunger has soared in louisiana since the onset of the pandemic, and the problem worsened as the state was hit with storm after storm during a record 2020 hurricane season.

taking the 'poison out of politics'
lincoln: gov. pete ricketts said friday that he's reasonably satisfied with the state's distribution of covid-19 vaccines despite a slowdown last month but urged residents to remain patient and expect some logistical delays. ricketts said the state had received an additional 40,000 doses in the past couple of days, but it will take a few more days to get them distributed. i think this program is really going along as well as can be expected considering we have not done this kind of mass vaccination in this country ever, ricketts said a coronavirus news conference. on thursday, state officials said they were preparing to launch a website that will allow people to register for a vaccination even if they don't immediately qualify. the first eligible people in nebraska are front-line health care workers and people who live in or work at long-term care facilities. nebraska also saw a reported surge in deaths thursday, but a local public health official said friday that those numbers weren't accurate.

lincoln: the state appears to have avoided a post-christmas spike in coronavirus cases that many had feared, although it's not entirely clear why, gov. pete ricketts said monday. it may be because people followed virus safety guidelines warning against attending holiday gatherings, ricketts said during a news conference. i think a lot of nebraskans made modifications to their holiday get-togethers, he said. i'd also say there's also a lot of we don't know about this virus. the republican governor said the decision not to impose a statewide lockdown may also have played a role because it helped avoid pandemic fatigue that leads some people to break the recommendations. other states, such as california, have reported large increases in cases in december. we tried to strike a balance in nebraska, ricketts said. nebraska has imposed restrictions on crowd sizes and public spaces but has never imposed a stay-at-home order or a statewide mask mandate. the state saw a sharp increase in virus hospitalizations in mid-november, raising concerns about bed space and burnout among hospital workers. the numbers have since declined, although public health officials say it's important for residents to continue following social distancing safety guidelines.

boise: u.s. officials have released a new plan involving methods to deal with a microscopic pest in southeastern idaho that threatens the state's billion-dollar industry that supplies a third of the nation's potatoes. the u.s. department of agriculture late last week released the final rule that takes effect at the end of january. it sets out years­long criteria for killing off the pests and reopening quarantined fields to production. the new rule follows a 2018 court decision in a lawsuit filed by potato farmers that found the u.s. government illegally quarantined some idaho potato fields infested with the pale cyst nematode first discovered in 2006. farmers with quarantined fields aren't allowed to sell potatoes grown in them. nematodes feed on potato roots and can reduce crop production by 80%. when the pests were first discovered, canada, mexico and korea would not accept idaho potatoes, and japan banned all u.s. potatoes. the countries ultimately lifted their bans, the latest coming late in 2017 when japan opened its market again.

philadelphia: scores of costumed performers took to the streets of their south philadelphia stomping grounds for a new year's celebration of mummers tradition, far from the customary parade route and despite official cancellation of the annual event and a ban on large gatherings due to the coronavirus pandemic. participants in brightly colored costumes, some with faces painted, paraded down 2nd street in south philadelphia on friday following trucks that blared string band or popular music. some wore masks, but many did not. mayor jim kenney announced in july that the city would not grant permits to planned outdoor events with more than 50 people, effectively canceling the large annual parade and other events as officials struggled to keep a lid on the spread of the virus. some mummers leaders and organizations also asked members to stay home. city spokeswoman lauren cox said there were no major issues friday but said seeing pictures of many participants without masks was very concerning given the seriousness of this current wave of the pandemic. she urged voluntary quarantines and testing for anyone who had been in large crowds.

oklahoma city: the state has set a new record for covid-19 deaths in a week, as health officials on sunday reported more than 8,000 new cases of the disease caused by the novel coronavirus over two days. oklahoma had 170 deaths from covid-19 over the prior seven days, according to data from johns hopkins university. the previous one-week record of 168 deaths was set in early december. state health officials recorded 5,002 new cases of the virus saturday and another 3,015 on sunday, as well as 20 additional deaths. the actual number of cases is believed to be far higher because many people haven't been tested, and some who get sick don't show symptoms. there were more than 36,000 active cases of the virus in oklahoma and 1,910 people hospitalized with it sunday, according to the state department of health. over the prior seven days, nearly 1 in 5 coronavirus tests in oklahoma has come back positive, according to data from johns hopkins university.

based on my informal discussion with athletes, there's a significant number of percentage of athletes that choose to use marijuana, many for legitimate reasons outside of recreational, novitzky said. many use it for pain control, anti-anxiety, to sleep, in lieu of more dangerous, more addictive drugs, so hopefully this being the first step to opening that up so that an athlete on wednesday night of fight week instead of going to a vicodin because their knee hurts and they can't sleep can use a little bit of cannabis and get to sleep and have that pain control. it has no affect whatsoever on a competition on saturday night, so it's the right move, and i'm really excited about this revision and that specific policy change.

fort lauderdale: health officials reported a two-day total of 30,767 new cases of the coronavirus in the state and 217 new deaths saturday. florida's department of health did not release numbers on new year's day. the state has also chosen not to report covid-19 cases on two other holidays, thanksgiving and christmas. the two-day total brings the overall number of confirmed covid-19 cases in florida to 1,354,833. the agency posted that 21,015 cases were reported friday and 9,752 reported saturday. the state's death toll throughout the coronavirus pandemic stands at 22,074. on new year's eve, the state reported the highest daily jump in covid-19 cases ever detected in florida, with 17,192 new cases. also on thursday, state health officials disclosed in a statement tweeted on the department's healthyfla site that evidence of a new and apparently more contagious coronavirus strain first seen in england has been detected in a martin county man with no recent travel history. martin county is north of palm beach county, which along with miami-dade and broward counties have comprised the state's hardest-hit region in dealing with coronavirus cases.
anchorage: the usual transportation difficulties in rural alaska have presented unique obstacles for the distribution of covid-19 vaccines, officials said. dozens of remote villages lack hospitals and road connections, while ultracold freezers required for storage of specific varieties of the vaccine are essentially nonexistent, alaska public media reports. tribal health care providers responded by mobilizing a massive effort delivering thousands of doses to remote areas. providers airlifted vaccine to villages using a fleet of chartered planes, while the medicine also was delivered over choppy seas on a water taxi. some clinicians were shuttled around villages on sleds pulled behind snowmachines. dr. ellen hodges encountered the unforeseen difficulty of alaska being too cold in some places to vaccinate front-line health care workers. it became immediately apparent that the vaccine was going to freeze in the metal part of the needle, said hodges, who contended with subzero temperatures on a remote southwest alaska airport tarmac. hodges ultimately kept doses tucked in her shirt until they were injected.

jackson: gov. tate reeves said friday that the state's covid-19 vaccine rollout is not going fast enough, and officials are working behind the scenes to eliminate roadblocks so more people can get inoculated quickly. the republican governor said the state is planning to double the number of sites where people can be vaccinated in the coming days and double the appointment capacity of those sites, as well as the number of days they are open. if you want a vaccine, you should have quick, simple access, reeves said. government logistics should not stand in your way. mississippi set up 18 drive-thru sites for vaccinations, which opened for health care workers last monday and individuals 75 and over on wednesday. about 7,600 coronavirus vaccinations were administered at drive-thru vaccination sites in the state last week, said state health officer dr. thomas dobbs. however, residents said the process has not been as smooth as they would like. online appointments were filling up quickly, calls to the hotline to make appointments were backed up, and some said they were not able to make appointments after waiting or had to go to counties far from where they live.

anchorage: health officials said the state plans on receiving almost 53,000 doses of coronavirus vaccines this month from drug companies pfizer and moderna. that figure is about 7,000 fewer vaccines than the state received in december. thus far, only front-line health care workers in hospitals, residents and employees at long-term care facilities, emergency personnel, community health aides and people conducting vaccinations have been eligible to be inoculated in alaska. starting monday, another tier of people will begin receiving vaccines. that group includes people working in health care who are at the highest risk of contracting the virus, are considered essential to the health care system, and do regular work that can't be done remotely or postponed. almost 50 alaska residents spoke at a public hearing last monday to advocate for their demographic to be included in the next vaccination group. that group included teachers, older adults and seafood industry workers, the daily news reports. alaska has so far vaccinated over 13,000 people, according to a state tracker last updated last monday.

new haven: some of the city's public school students will return to their physical classrooms later this month for the first time since last spring, according to the superintendent of schools. superintendent iline tracey announced on the district website thursday that officials are preparing for a limited return of students to a hybrid learning model starting jan. 19. the new haven district has been closed for in-person instruction except for some special-needs programs since the coronavirus pandemic forced schools across the country to shut down last march. officials in new haven chose to keep school buildings shuttered in september as other districts in connecticut offered either full-time or part-time in-person learning. a plan to reopen new haven's schools on nov. 9 was shelved amid rising covid-19 cases. tracey said schools will open jan. 19 to students in prekindergarten through fifth grade as well as students in special-education programs and programs for new immigrants at two of the district's schools. two schools, quinnipiac school and west rock school, will remain closed because city health officials determined that a lack of ventilation renders them unsafe during the pandemic, tracey said.

boston: a group of families in the state is fighting a recent court ruling that found au pairs should be treated as employees entitled to minimum wage. an organization called au pair families of massachusetts is planning to lobby for legislation in the statehouse on wednesday, the boston globe reports. a federal court ruled dec. 2 that au pairs in massachusetts were entitled to earn state minimum wage and overtime, which could raise host families' costs by as much as $333 per week. many host parents agree au pairs should have additional protections but argue the new changes will make the program less accessible in a state that has some of the nation's highest child care costs. the au pair program, overseen by the u.s. state department, was launched as a cultural exchange program in which young people live with families in other countries while helping with child care and some housework. host families paid at least $197 a week for a maximum of 45 hours of work before the ruling.

raleigh: residents of neighboring states are able to come into north carolina to get a covid-19 vaccine, according to the state's department of health and human services, even though demand has greatly outpaced supply during its sluggish start to administering doses to hospital workers and people 75 years or older. the lack of strict residency requirements makes it possible for somebody from south carolina or another neighboring state in that profession or age group to get doses that the federal government has allocated for north carolina residents. a provider cannot refuse to vaccinate someone that presents for vaccination if they fall into the open prioritization phase and do not have a vaccine contradiction, so a resident of another state could be vaccinated here if they fall into the appropriate open prioritization phase, the department said in a statement to the associated press. the centers for disease control and prevention last week ranked north carolina as the sixth slowest in the country per capita in administering doses it has received from the federal government. the state is still working to vaccinate some hospital workers and started inoculating people 75 and up in several counties last week.

salt lake city: less than a quarter of the 127,375 doses of covid-19 vaccine reportedly received in the state have been used to vaccinate health care providers and long-term care facility residents and staff as of the end of the year, deseret news reports. the initial rollout of the vaccine has been slow, slower than anticipated, slower than we wanted, said rich lakin, immunization program director with the utah department of health. we hope to be at a much faster pace in the next 15 days. utah is already starting to speed up the process, health department spokesperson tom hudachko said thursday. more than 6,000 doses were reportedly administered in the state thursday, double the daily increases earlier in the week. what's making the difference, hudachko said, is that local health departments, including tribal clinics, and long-term care facilities are able to give doses much faster than hospitals. in davis county, a mass drive-thru clinic at the legacy events center is able to vaccinate 28 health care workers at a time with appointments, he said. at long-term care facilities, cvs and walgreens and other contractors are quickly inoculating both residents and staff.

augusta: protesters gathered outside the maine statehouse on saturday to criticize how democratic gov. janet mills has handled the coronavirus pandemic. wabi-tv reports the protest organized by the swinging gate organization attracted a large crowd despite snowy weather. there's this undercurrent of pent-up energy that's not doing well under this governor's rule, and it's important to harness that organic energy that's out here that needs something to do; their hands are tied, said event organizer dick campbell. more than 25,000 people have tested positive for the virus in maine, including nearly 350 new confirmed cases announced sunday. one additional death was announced, bringing the total since the pandemic began to 359. just under 33,000 people in the state have been vaccinated against the virus. the seven-day rolling average of daily new cases in maine increased over the past two weeks, going from 445 on dec. 19 to 528 on saturday.

to be clear, hunter biden's involvement with a ukrainian energy company while his father was vice president is in no way comparable with trump's abuses of power. less a scandal than a family embarrassment, it falls more into the category of billy carter, the ne'er-do-well brother of jimmy carter who hawked billy beer and lobbied for libya, and of neil bush, the son of george h.w. bush who got himself embroiled in the savings and loan crisis while his father was vice president.

harrisburg: along with once again being able to dine indoors, pennsylvanians were able to go to the gym or watch a movie at a theater starting monday, under an easing of restrictions by gov. tom wolf. the updated state guidance is the next step in the state's relaxation of the closures wolf put in place in december to combat the spread of the coronavirus. our mitigation efforts over the past several weeks are working, and i thank everyone who abided by the restrictions put in place to protect us, wolf said. every time we make a small decision to avoid risk – or take steps to make our actions a little bit less risky – we are helping to stop the spread of covid-19 and save lives. but just because a business or church can open doesn't mean it will. wolf has encouraged pennsylvanians to stay home as much as possible and continues to urge vulnerable residents, such as those over 65 or with preexisting medical conditions, to remain home as much as possible. and while much of the focus has been on the restaurant industry, museums, aquariums and wedding reception venues are among the other businesses allowed to reopen.

harrisburg: the state on friday released an updated coronavirus vaccine plan that makes more people eligible for shots in the initial phases of the rollout. health care workers and nursing home residents remain at the front of the line, followed by people 75 years and older and essential workers such as police officers, grocery store clerks and teachers. with covid-19 continuing to rage throughout pennsylvania, health officials cautioned the state is still months away from having enough doses of the two approved vaccines to inoculate the general public. i know it is difficult to ask, but we must have patience, dr. rachel levine, the state health secretary, said friday. it will take several months before this vaccine is available for everyone. to date, the federal government has allocated to pennsylvania more than 827,000 doses of the pfizer and moderna vaccines. more than 235,000 shots have been given, though levine said the actual number is certain to be higher because reporting by hospitals and pharmacies lags by one to three days.

montgomery: a recycling center that employs adults with intellectual disabilities should have paid hundreds of thousands of dollars to its workers, federal labor officials said. the u.s. department of labor recently announced that employees were rightfully owed $540,000. montgomery arc and two of its partners – hanan center and mcinnis recycling center – will now pay $541,597 in back wages to 80 employees, federal officials said. the deal is part of a settlement between the organizations and the federal agency, the columbus ledger-enquirer reports. the organizations were supposed to provide services to the employees in exchange for paying them less than minimum wage, the newspaper reports. but the agency found that it failed to provide services required by federal guidelines.

atlanta: the state's plan to expand access to a covid-19 vaccine to people over 65 got off to a rocky start monday, with the websites of at least two public health districts crashing and other districts reporting overwhelming demand for appointments. the state was already struggling with its vaccine rollout before the latest woes. the coastal health district, which includes savannah, stopped scheduling appointments after an overwhelming response from residents ages 65 and older interested in covid-19 vaccination, the district said in a news release. the district – one of 18 in the state – said health officials in the eight counties it covers have enough requests to schedule appointments through february and, in some cases, into march. we know people are frustrated because the process is moving more slowly than they would like, and if we could vaccinate everyone today, we'd do that, lawton davis, the district's health director, said in a statement. but your health departments are stretched thin and doing what they can to move forward.

hilo: hawaii's optional coronavirus notification app is expected to launch statewide wednesday. the alohasafe alert app aims to help reduce the spread of covid-19 by notifying users about potential exposure to someone who tests positive for the virus, the hawaii tribune-herald reports. when the app senses another app in use nearby, the devices will exchange a secure, random, anonymous code. a person's location, name and other identifiable information would not be included. a user who tests positive would get a text message with the option to notify other app users who may have been exposed. the notification would go out to all users who were within 6 feet of the person who tested positive for at least 15 minutes. the app has already launched on the big island, lanai and maui. for me, the big takeaway is this is one other way that we can start protecting our island against the coronavirus and keep all of us safe, hawaii county mayor mitch roth said. he acknowledged that not everyone will use the app but called it an extra tool that will speed up contact tracing.

new orleans: southern university at new orleans will suspend all of its athletics programs at the end of the academic year, trying to save money and dig itself out of years of financial problems. the southern university board of supervisors approved the move friday without objection, at the request of suno interim chancellor james ammons. this is one of the most difficult decisions i've made as an administrator, ammons said. he said while he understands the importance of athletics programs to attracting students and drawing alumni support, the campus must focus on protecting its academic programs rather than continuing to steer money to sports. the historically black public university is on probation by its accrediting agency amid continuing financial woes that have stretched over years as enrollment has fallen.

lansing: gov. gretchen whitmer on friday strongly encouraged all k-12 schools to offer in-person instruction by march 1 or earlier if possible, but she stopped short of requiring it, saying face-to-face classes should at least be an option. many schools, including in large districts such as ann arbor and grand rapids, have been fully remote amid the coronavirus pandemic. teachers and child care staff are among residents who will begin being vaccinated starting monday as the state transitions to the next phase of its vaccine rollout. vaccines were first offered to health care workers and nursing home residents. the value of in-person learning for our kids is immeasurable, whitmer said, adding that it is safe if schools require masks and adopt infection-prevention protocols. the democratic governor last month lifted her administration's temporary ban on in-person learning in high schools as a spike in covid-19 infections receded. in december, at least 800,000 public school students – 55% – were in districts that planned to offer only virtual instruction amid the surge, according to a study by michigan state university. about 453,000, or 31%, were in districts with an option of full in-person learning. others had hybrid or other setups.

the litany was a rehash of trump's greatest hits, but since the attempt to subvert the legal transfer of power, there were dangerous signs embedded in the braggadocio. trump stated, removing any of these measures would hamstring our workers, endanger our country and cost taxpayers hundreds of billions of dollars a year — knowing that the president-elect has called for the removal of many of these unilateral measures. trump further warned, we can't let the next administration even think about taking it (the wall) down.

bismarck: the state's covid-19 update released monday showed no deaths for a third straight day – a mark that hasn't been seen in nearly six months, although health officials noted that virus reports are typically sporadic over the weekend. the two previous days of no fatalities did not change the state's death toll ranking of sixth-highest per capita in the country at about about 178 deaths per 100,000 people, according to the covid tracking project. a total of 1,352 north dakotans have died from complications due to the coronavirus. health officials have confirmed 16 deaths this month, after 272 on december and 494 in november. i'm cautiously optimistic, state health department spokeswoman nicole peske said. typically we do have a lag in reporting from over the weekend, so we'll see what tomorrow brings. the state reported 121 new positive cases since sunday, for a total of 94,830 cases since the start of the pandemic. the tracking project ranks that 48th in the country for new cases per capita. one in every 454 people in north dakota tested positive in the past week.

jackson: as the 2020 legislature prepares to convene tuesday, the future of hemp in the magnolia state is hazy. there were a few attempts to legalize hemp production in the 2019 session, but all failed. now, as farmers in surrounding states are already cultivating and selling hemp, mississippi remains one of only three states where production is illegal. a task force on hemp production met three times last year and weighed pros and cons of the issue. farmers crowded into a room in the capitol to hear about a new crop they might soon plant. agricultural experts explained the benefits and hardships of growing hemp without taking a hard stance on the issue, but law enforcement officials on the task force were deeply critical of hemp legalization. the task force ultimately produced a report that included these findings, though it doesn't include a recommendation on whether to legalize hemp. last year, the house passed a bill legalizing hemp production. that bill stalled in the senate.

phoenix: despite a surge of coronavirus cases, gov. doug ducey on saturday rejected the state's top education official's call for him to order public schools to use only distance learning for the next two weeks unless they have waivers from health officials. given the severity of our state's situation and the virus's trajectory after the holiday period, schools need a two-week quarantine period for education leaders and local officials to use local health data to decide the appropriate instruction model for their communities, superintendent of public instruction kathy hoffman said in a twitter thread. hoffman called for the two-week quarantine period for schools after the department of health services on saturday – the second day of the new year – reported nearly 8,900 additional known covid-19 cases, giving the state a two-day pandemic high for new cases. however, ducey spokesman c.j. karamargin said the governor will not be considering this request or issuing this kind of mandate. this is a local decision. the online option is already available, and the governor has repeatedly made his preference clear: kids have already lost out on a lot of learning, and he wants schools opened, safely. many schools are set to resume classes this week after the winter holidays.

chicago: the state will stop collecting fines against drivers who are ticketed after cameras catch them violating red lights, comptroller susana mendoza said monday. she said poor and minority motorists appear to be most affected by the $100 tickets, which can double if not timely paid. she also noted a federal investigation of relationships between some communities and a red light vendor. the new policy starts feb. 6. this system is clearly broken, mendoza said. i am exercising the moral authority to prevent state resources being used to assist a shady process that victimizes taxpayers. a 2012 state law allows local governments to use the comptroller's office to collect debts. unpaid traffic tickets, for example, can be deducted from tax refunds. mendoza said communities can hire private debt collectors instead.

augusta: a group of republican lawmakers plans to travel to the statehouse on tuesday to call on their colleagues to get back to work, accusing democratic leaders of dragging their feet. legislative leaders countered that the work already is underway and that the appropriations committee is meeting tuesday. republicans protested in the summer and fall when the legislature failed to reach a consensus for reconvening during the pandemic. the current plan is for the bulk of committees to convene in a few weeks. republican rep. shelley rudnicki, of fairfield, said her group will gather in the house chamber to make a point. we are a co-equal branch of government, and the governor is making decisions without any input from the legislature. it's time for us to get to work, said rudnicki, who accused the governor of unprecedented and draconian actions while the legislature was sidelined. republicans decried some of democratic gov. janet mills' executive orders imposed because of covid-19, but the legislature failed to reconvene when republicans and democrats couldn't agree on the scope of work to be conducted. rudnicki acknowledged tuesday's action is a symbolic gesture since both chambers are controlled by democrats.
