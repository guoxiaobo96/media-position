One police internal affairs expert said the repetitive domestic tensions between the Seidles should have sent warning signs to his supervisors.
You know, there were a lot of problems, Seidle said in a prison phone call. But we didn't believe in divorce and so we stayed together.
Honolulu: Improvements in programs to address Hawaii's homeless population have allowed the state to fall from first to second in the national ranking of per capita homelessness, officials said. State homeless coordinator Scott Morishige informed lawmakers Tuesday that New York now holds the top position, The Honolulu Star-Advertiser reported. Morishige presented the data to the Hawaii Homelessness Summit for both houses of the state Legislature. The summit is designed to help lawmakers evaluate the success of programs funded by the Legislature and consider other solutions to homelessness. Placements of homeless people into permanent housing in Hawaii increased in 2018 from nearly 4,000 to more than 7,000. The state appears to have exceeded 7,000 placements again in 2019, he said. After trending upward from 2013 to 2016, Hawaii's official Point in Time count of homeless people showed a decrease over the past four years. The decrease corresponds with similar increases in housing placements over the same period and is reflected in other surveys related to homelessness, Morishige said. There has also been a nearly 40% reduction in homeless families with minor children since 2016.
Minneapolis:Two prominent leaders have proposed an amendment to the Minnesota Constitution aimed at closing the state's dismal academic achievement gap. The proposal comes from Alan Page, a former Minnesota Supreme Court justice, and Neel Kashkari, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis. They want to change the state's constitution to guarantee all children the fundamental right to a quality public education, the Star Tribune reported Wednesday. Page and Kashkari told the newspaper in an interview that making quality education a civil right for all children is the catalyst that's needed to break the logjam that has blocked effective reform. Even though Minnesota has spent billions of dollars to solve the problem, the state still has some of the worst educational disparities in the nation, as measured by race and socioeconomic status, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis. Courts have interpreted the Minnesota Constitution as giving students a fundamental right to an adequate education. Page and Kashkari want to raise that standard to a quality education. Page and Kashkari said similar amendments have driven improvements in other states. To amend the Minnesota Constitution, they will need the Legislature's approval to put the question to voters. The two hope to get it on the ballot this fall. But they'll face opposition from the state's powerful teachers' union, Education Minnesota, which said it will resist the proposal.
After two years of fighting for your children, they don't want to be with you, Seidle wrote in an online message. You continue trying, but nothing works. Everyone acknowledges you're legally within your right to get them back, but nothing gets done. Then after 3 1/2 years of crying and wanting just to be a part of your children's lives, to talk to them, to see them, to know what's going on in their lives, to go to church, and do the things you used to. Then one day you find out they've been given away to someone else. Perhaps you take it lightly? Maybe you think I'm exaggerating? I'm not.
Over the past decade, an average of 27 Americans were killed each year from lightning strikes, Jensenius said. While we don't like to see any lightning deaths, the continuing downward trend in yearly fatalities is encouraging, Jensenius added.
It would be easier to part with Jeffery if the Bears knew what they had in Kevin White, the No. 7 overall pick in 2015. But he was limited to four games because of a fractured left fibula after missing his rookie year with a stress fracture in his left shin.
In 2001, the weather service launched a lightning safety campaign, which included the now well-known phrase when thunder roars, go indoors. At that time, the nation recorded about 55 lightning deaths a year.
Seidle's eldest daughter dropped his youngest daughter off at his home on Walnut Street in Neptune. Seidle deduced that a man had been spending time with Tamara and the children. The kids had mentioned his last name before, his parents spent time with the kids. He was at the graduation party.
I realized I had shot her, Seidle said.
ON STAFF: While Fox said last week he wasn't planning to make changes to his staff, he didn't quite slam the door on it, either.
In 2001, police responded to a screaming match that escalated to Tamara pushing Seidle, according to the prosecutor's report.
New York: The country's busiest train station would get new tracks, expanded terminals and better access for commuters under a plan announced by the governor Monday. Gov. Andrew Cuomo said he will propose acquiring the block south of Penn Station to add at least eight new underground tracks, which he said will create new, larger terminals and boost track and train capacity by 40%. More than 600,000 people pass through Penn Station daily on trains run by Amtrak, New Jersey Transit and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, operator of the Long Island Rail Road and the New York City subway system. The station has 21 tracks and operates at full capacity during peak periods, leading to rippling delays when trains or infrastructure break down. The more than century-old station was considered an architectural masterpiece in its day, and its demolition and repurposing in the 1960s provoked a public outcry.
He telephones Chavarriaga, who he called his partner, in the morning and evening. He sleeps well at night. He thinks about his children, especially on holidays and birthdays.
Divorce is finalized, Hanbury wrote in an entry two weeks before the killing. However, he was upset with Tammy because she reportedly threw his personal items out. They include Navy papers, training certificates and personal items that meant something to him.
By April 2010, I'd decided to leave, Seidle wrote. I had told myself I would stay for the kids, and being a Catholic, divorce was frowned upon. I was making an effort to live my faith. But I reached the point I resented being around her, and even living in my home.
Gramiccioni's report underscores a failing in New Jersey police policy.
You owe me that much, Seidle recalled Fisher saying at the scene.
Santa Fe: The Legislature's lead budget-writing committee on Tuesday recommended a 6.5% increase in state general fund spending and endorsed plans to stash away a portion of New Mexico's windfall from oil production in trust funds to ensure future financial stability. The Legislative Finance Committee that operates a year-round policy and accountability office recommended a $464 million increase in sustained spending to about $7.5 billion for the fiscal year that begins July 1. Another $325 million would be set aside in an investment trust to underwrite early childhood schooling and services, alongside smaller trusts dedicated to college affordability and rural libraries. Legislators expect the state will receive an $800 million surplus in general fund income next year, in excess of the $7 billion in current spending obligations.
Bound by Catholic doctrine, the Seidle marriage was a cycle of faith, sin and reconciliation. For decades, there were showdowns documented by police and later in court between the Seidles, with each making allegations of domestic violence against the other.
Their report shows Seidle wasn't disarmed after this incident. Seidle told the Press that his gun was taken away again around this time.
He said he called Tamara several times.
Then he remembers staring at her limp foot hanging through the shattered glass of her car window.
Lightning killed fewer Americans last year than any year on record, marking a steady downward trend that experts attribute to more awareness, better lightning-proof construction and fewer people working in farms and fields.
Then a car horn, screeching tires. The two Seidle cars tore around the corner of Ridge Avenue, nearly hitting Lawson as he jumped out of the way.
Casper: A school district has paid off more than $4,000 in student lunch debt after a crowd-sourced check bounced. The Casper Police Department has opened an investigation into the Feed Casper Students fundraising campaign on GoFundMe aimed at paying off the Natrona County School District's student lunch debt, The Casper Star-Tribune reports. The district accepted about $19,000 in fundraising donations in April, the same month the check bounced, school officials said. The district paid off the lunch debt for about 250 students out of its general fund, rather than reopen the outstanding debt for the students, officials said. A school district administrator made several attempts to reach the woman who started the fundraiser, Brittny French, authorities said. Multiple attempts by the Star-Tribune to contact French were unsuccessful last week, including through GoFundMe. Police asked anyone who had donated to the campaign to get in touch with police.
The Press is suing Neptune to make the file public. A judge could decide the matter next month.
While his IA file remains secret, documents did emerge publicly showing two citizens complained in 2004 that Seidle used excessive force during arrests, according to documents attached to a lawsuit alleging excessive force during a 2015 arrest. That lawsuit was dismissed by a federal judge and Seidle was cleared by his department in the 2015 incident.
In his 22-year career, Seidle was the subject of 26 internal affairs reports conducted before the shooting.
Seidle had wanted to be the father figure he never had.
Internal affairs expert D'Angelo reviewed the special report on the Seidle shooting issued by Prosecutor Gramiccioni in 2016, a year after the shooting.
He said the Court of Arbitration for Sport, which is hearing various Russian appeals, was biased toward the Olympic officials and the World Anti-Doping Agency.
Seidle was taken to the prosecutor's outpost in Asbury Park and escorted into a conference room, grand jury testimony shows.
In practically every event it's an absolutely new, young team, Mutko said in an interview Saturday in a VIP box at the European figure skating championships in Moscow.
Prosecutor Gramiccioni said Lawson was too far away to effectively shoot Seidle.
…They all tried to convince me not to leave, they told me it wasn't a good idea, Seidle said.
The camera on Lawson's patrol car recorded the sounds of the shooting. Eight shots can be heard in the video in quick succession, then a ninth shot.
Augusta: Biologists with the state Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife are getting ready to round up some moose. Starting this week, biologists will be capturing and collaring 130 moose as Maine's moose survival study enters its sixth year and focuses on a new study area. The study began in the winter of 2014 in western Maine, and a second study area in northern Maine was added in 2016. Over five years, 475 moose were captured by helicopter-launched nets and fitted with a GPS collar. This year, the program will include a new area north of Moosehead Lake. The collars enable staff to remotely track moose locations and movements over time and to be notified if a moose dies. Adult cows are monitored each spring and summer to determine birth rates and survival rates of calves. For each collared moose, biologists collect detailed health information, including a blood sample, parasite loads, body condition and winter tick loads.
I was angry for a while, I was really angry, she said. Angry because Seidle hurt Chavarriaga. He made Chavarriaga happy and Rittman thought they'd have a future together.
POLICING THE USA: A look at race, justice, media
Seidle insists he didn't plan to kill his ex-wife.
Richmond: More people earned bachelor's degrees in the state last year than ever before. Data from the State Council of Higher Education for Virginia shows that a record number of degrees were awarded in science, technology, engineering, mathematics and health fields. During the 2018-19 school year, public and private nonprofit colleges and universities awarded 122,168 degrees and certificates – an increase of nearly 50% from a decade ago. In-state students accounted for 86,325, or more than 70%, of those awards. Bachelor's degrees accounted for 46% of the total, while graduate degrees made up 25%. Associate degrees made up 16%, and certificates made up 13%. The three most popular bachelor's degree programs remained unchanged from previous years: business administration and management; psychology; and biology/biological sciences. Those three majors accounted for 19% of all bachelor's degrees.
This is a story about the two Phil Seidles.
Just emotionally it all just piled up on me, he said. And I just broke down and just, I don't know, just flew off the handle and just lost my mind.
It hasn't happened since the 2010 team lost to Green Bay in the NFC title game. The Bears enter this offseason with the No. 3 pick in the draft and some big issues to address on their roster.
Gramiccioni's report was produced by his office after the New Jersey Attorney General's office found no conflict of interest with the prosecutor's office investigating. The report largely absolves those who oversaw Seidle, including the prosecutor's office.
Seidle was very emotional and tearful when he was talking about his relationship with the children, Hanbury wrote in November 2014.
His department's reactions didn't address the real problem, he said from prison – stress related to his troubled access to his children.
If he's living there, there's going to be a f------ problem, Seidle said.
She shut down and stopped tending to her responsibilities, Seidle wrote.
Portland: Lawmakers have approved a $4.5 million contract with a hazardous waste removal company to clean up homeless encampments across the city. The City Commission unanimously voted to give the contract to Rapid Response Bio Clean on Wednesday after the agenda item was pulled late last month over concerns from homeless people and their advocates, Oregon Public Broadcasting reported Thursday. Opponents said the cleanups are traumatic for homeless residents and cause them to lose their property. Under a modified deal, Rapid Response workers will get training in nonviolent conflict resolution and to carry naloxone, an injection that can reverse drug overdoses. The workers generally disposed of the needles, shopping carts, trash and human waste that are left behind after a homeless camp is cleared. Notices about a clean-up must be posted at least two days before the work begins. The city has contracted with Rapid Response since 2016. But in recent weeks, the contract, which expands the scope of the company's responsibilities and significantly increases the amount of money approved for campsite cleanups. Mayor Ted Wheeler said the new contract strikes an excellent balance between keeping the city clean and respecting the homeless. Rapid Response was to resume its work by Thursday.
Lawson recognized him. He begged for Seidle to drop his weapon.
None of your business, he recalled Tamara saying.
Despite the Olympic bans, Russian officials expect about 200 athletes to compete in Pyeongchang, though not all would have normally been the country's first choice. That's fewer than in Sochi in 2014, but more than in Vancouver in 2010.
Less than four months before the shooting, Seidle filed for a domestic violence civil complaint and restraining order of his own. He claimed in court documents that Tamara once threatened to kill him after he declined to have sex with her, she once threw items around their house, she involved the police in personal matters to embarrass him and in the past poked him in the chest and face, pushed him and slapped him. His restraining order wasn't granted either.
It's not yet clear which Russians will go to the Olympics — where they will compete as Olympic Athletes from Russia because the country's team is formally banned. The IOC is vetting lists of athletes submitted by Russian officials before issuing invitations.
Seidle met Chavarriaga through church. Chavarriaga, 54, knew Seidle for years professionally before they were involved romantically, she told a reporter. She was a single parent and Seidle helped with her daughters. She admired the way Seidle loved his children.
He provided letters of support citizens wrote on his behalf.
He unsuccessfully appealed his sentence. He said he didn't deserve 30 years, but declined to say what would have been an appropriate sentence.
It's basically tame for the IOC and WADA. It's tame, he said, adding that Russia still rejected the findings of IOC and WADA investigations which detailed widespread doping. Why does everyone tell us to accept the report? We won't accept any report.
Your mother is dead because of her actions…
Spring Hill:General Motors and United Auto Workers Local 1853 have agreed to convert 157 local temporary workers to permanent status effective Feb. 3. The decision resolves a dispute between GM in Spring Hill and the union over the hiring of new temporary workers, Chairman Mike Herron told The Daily Herald on Thursday. Under the new collective bargaining agreement ratified in October, GM agreed to convert temporary workers with three years of continual service to permanent status. None of the temporary workers in Spring Hill had three consecutive years of service because of layoffs in 2017 and 2018, creating a short-lived problem. The deal between GM and Local 1853 allows the plant to begin bringing in new temporary workers. The company has started taking applications, seeking 154 employees for those positions. On Monday, GM announced it was making 930 temporary workers permanent at 30 of its 52 UAW-represented plants across the country. Ford also moved 592 temps to full-time status. At GM's Flint Assembly in Michigan, 250 were told at a meeting by the local union president of their new status.
He spoke to his daughter, who confirmed Tamara's boyfriend had been staying at the house for two weeks.
Seidle will become eligible for parole in December 2040, when he'll be 76.
Oklahoma City: Two days of meetings and new searches are planned this week for two 16-year-old girls missing and presumed dead for more than two decades, authorities said Monday. Investigators with the Craig County District Attorney's Office and the Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation will be joined by the U.S. Department of the Interior's Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement for Lauria Bible and Ashley Freeman in and around the former town of Picher, about 85 miles northeast of Tulsa, said district attorney spokeswoman Michelle Lowry. Lowry said a request from Republican U.S. Sen. Jim Inhofe of Oklahoma late last year prompted the federal agency's involvement. The OSMRE will use an underground camera and, if needed, lighting to examine the floors and walls of mine shafts in the area. Picher, which no longer exists as a town, was included in a federally funded buyout after a 2006 Army Corps of Engineers study revealed abandoned lead and zinc mines beneath the area had a high risk of caving in.
Cincinnati: The future of the city's only abortion clinic is in question after the state health director said the facility doesn't have enough backup doctors lined up. Because the clinic doesn't have an agreement with a nearby, private hospital to transfer patients in case of an emergency – an agreement required by state law –Planned Parenthood Southwest Ohio Region has operated the clinic under an exception known as a variance. Ohio Health Director Amy Acton recently rescinded that variance. To receive a variance, a clinic must provide a list of doctors willing to treat patients in case of emergencies. The clinic in Cincinnati informed the state in December it no longer had four backup doctors listed and requested 30 days to find a replacement physician. Acton then rescinded the clinic's variance and notified the clinic its license was in jeopardy of being revoked. The clinic, which remains open, is expected to request a hearing on the issue. It indicated it was seeking another physician. Kersha Deibel, president and chief executive officer of the Planned Parenthood region, told The Columbus Dispatch that we follow the law and are actively working to identify a new provider.
Tallahassee: The state's environmental cops fine polluters today less than half as much as they did a decade ago, before former Gov. Rick Scott took office and shifted state regulators to a more pro-business posture, state data shows. Through the first week of December, the Florida Department of Environmental Protection assessed 352 penalties in 2019, totaling $4.4 million in fines for violating air, water, sewer, petroleum tank and other state environmental regulations. By comparison, in 2010 DEP assessed 1,249 environmental penalties in Florida, totaling $10.2 million – more than 3 1/ 2 times as many penalties and double the fines assessed this year. DEP holds that the lower figures prove the success of the agency's mission to help businesses, utilities and other polluters to clean up their acts. But the agency's critics say the steep drop in fines reflects an ever-softening stance.
The domestic issues caused Seidle to be suspended from his department at least twice and disarmed at least once, records show. Seidle said he was also disarmed a second time. He was sent by his department for psychological review at least three times.
Jeffery played for the $14.6 million franchise tag this season. The Bears could tag him again if they don't agree to a multiyear deal, though that would be an expensive option to use on a receiver with a PED suspension and a history of injuries.
Tamara told her boyfriend and her eldest daughter that Seidle threatened to kill her, according to grand jury testimony Seidle provided to the Press.
If they say that when you find out someone's cheating on you – your husband or your wife is cheating on you, you can be driven to violence – you can't be driven to violence when your children are taken away from you and kept away from you until the point where finally, one day, you just snap? Seidle asked. Doesn't matter whether I was a cop or not, any man would have done the same thing, would have felt the same way.
Townsend: One of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park's most popular sites has been closed to all vehicles until repairs to a main access road tunnel are finished. The Cades Cove closure started Sunday night and is expected to last until March. Major repairs are needed for the internal drainage system in the 121-foot long Bote Mountain Tunnel on Laurel Creek Road, according to the National Park Service. The tunnel hasn't undergone significant work since it was built in 1948. The cove's campground also will be closed until March. The nearby Elkmont Campground and the Smokemont Campground in North Carolina will remain open year-round to accommodate displaced cove campers, according to WATE-TV.
I gave him my badge and my gun and I told him: 'that's it, I'm going to resign because I'm just fed up,' Seidle said.
I killed my wife, and the mother of my children, the most horrific thing, Seidle wrote. I destroyed my children's lives. What I did is absolutely unacceptable. I can't forgive myself, and don't hold out any hope they ever will.
It's likely that any decision will be followed by a rush of last-minute appeals by athletes who aren't invited, particularly because the IOC wants to exclude all Russians with previous doping offenses — potentially including Kulizhnikov — not just the 43 banned from Sochi. Mutko said that condition had been added absolutely illegally.
They said they'd take his kids to a prosecutor's satellite office in Asbury Park. Ten minutes later, they showed him another photo of the children.
Substantive policy debates won't be any more likely in an election year like this one. But in four critical areas there are decisions ahead that will have major ramifications for millions of Americans — and potentially for what happens in November, when control of Congress is at stake.
Little Rock: State officials announced Monday that the closure of a hog farm near the Buffalo River has been completed, months after striking a deal with the facility's owners. Arkansas Parks, Heritage and Tourism Secretary Stacy Hurst announced that the terms of the state's agreement with the owners of C&H Hog Farms Inc. are complete. The shuttered hog farm's owners have received $6.2 million in state and private funds that was held in escrow since last August, and the state in return now holds a conservation easement for the property. Under the agreement, the state will be responsible for the closure of the waste ponds at the property. Gov. Asa Hutchinson in June announced the settlement with the 6,500-hog farm in Vendor, about 95 miles northwest of Little Rock, which had been the source of controversy since it was permitted several years ago. The Nature Conservancy provided $1 million of the funding.
There is plenty about the ACA that isn't working as well as it could. Seven years of no improvements and the peeling away of key elements will do that to any law.
BUILDING BLOCKS: There were some bright spots for the Bears.
Seidle dismissed the effectiveness of the therapy.
Harrisburg: Voters in three Pennsylvania House districts will choose new state representatives during special elections scheduled for March, the state House speaker announced Tuesday. A top aide to Speaker Mike Turzai, R-Allegheny, said the March 17 date was chosen to fill seats that became vacant because the incumbents were elected in November to other offices. The seats were most recently held by Rep. Tedd Nesbit, R-Mercer; Rep. Gene DiGirolamo, R-Bucks; and Justin Walsh, R-Westmoreland. Nesbit and Walsh were elected to become county judges, and DiGirolamo is now a county commissioner. Rep. Tom Murt, R-Montgomery, will succeed DiGirolamo as chair of the Human Services Committee, and Rep. Gary Day, R-Lehigh, will chair Aging.
The responding Tinton Falls officer contacted Sgt. Doug McEntegart. McEntegart spoke by phone with a Neptune Township lieutenant, a police report shows.
Seidle also spoke exclusively to the Press through phone calls facilitated by his one-time mistress. They still tell each other I love you on the calls.
In the 1940s, there were many, many more small farmers who were out working in fields, which meant many more chances to be struck by lightning, Jensenius said.
The thing is that after all these complaints someone should have stepped in and done some kind of investigation and said: what is going on here? He said. Why is she constantly calling the police? Why does she continue to call the police for these matters?
In addition to being notified about the Tinton Falls incident, the prosecutor's office was notified of the 2012 argument at the Seidle home in which Tamara alleged past abuse and they signed off when Seidle was later rearmed.
She wanted revenge for me leaving, he wrote. She knew there were two things important to me… my children and my reputation. She wanted to take away both of those things to hurt me the way I had hurt her by leaving.
Mutko said Russia's young stars who could break through in Pyeongchang include 15-year-old European figure skating champion Alina Zagitova, ski jumper Sofia Tikhonova and speedskater Pavel Kulizhnikov.
He fired all but one round in the magazine of his Glock.
Honolulu: Road crews are working to repair a section of highway that collapsed into the ocean as some residents question the state's actions to fight road deterioration. Repair crews began working Sunday on Kamehameha Highway in Hauula after coastal erosion caused the collapse of the shoulder and part of a lane. An area north of Pokiwai Bridge will remain closed until further notice, the Hawaii Department of Transportation said. Ed Sniffen, the state deputy director for highways, estimated the repairs would cost about $120,000 and take about a week to complete. The collapsed area of road is 12 feet long and 6 feet above the beach. Inspectors found the shoulder had been undercut for approximately 20 feet in both directions, the department said.
Their problems deepened, but still they stuck it out.
Seidle found fault in how many people treated him. He said his ex-wife's abuse claims were lies, he dismissed his first divorce attorney, he felt the divorce judge merely warned Tamara for violations of orders, he described how his police chief's punishments just created more stress for him.
Jensenius said increased awareness prompted better lightning safety policy for outdoor sports and recreational organizations.
They were both 26. They married in August 1990, in St. Peter Claver Church in Asbury Park, court documents show. That's about half a mile from where Seidle shot Tamara.
I just think I had a mental breakdown. I just – because of all the stress that I was under and the anger that I had, Seidle said. I just blacked out that day.
Sioux Falls:Police are investigating after an injured man was dropped off at a hospital in a plastic tub. The 18-year-old Sioux Falls man was dropped off at an emergency room Tuesday afternoon, police spokesman Sam Clemens said. The driver left after dropping the man off at the hospital. The victim suffered life-threatening injuries, including skull injuries. Clemens did not know how the man was injured. Police were able to identify the man who dropped off the victim at the hospital through the victim's family members, along with other people who might be involved, he said. We have a lot more questions than answers, Clemens said. The investigation is ongoing, the Argus Leader reported
Wilmington:A record number of vehicles crossed the Delaware Memorial Bridge from New Jersey into the First State last year. In 2019, 18,288,314 vehicles drove through the southbound toll plaza, cruising past the 2016 record of 17.8 million, according to the Delaware River and Bay Authority. Put another way – if you lined up every one of those cars (assuming each is an average of 14.75 feet) it would stretch more than 51,000 miles. That is twice the Earth's circumference, with a road trip from Delaware to Myrtle Beach, S.C. to spare. The bridge also had a record for a month in August, handling more than 1.8 million vehicles, surpassing the August 2003 record by 27,000. Officials said the record traffic volume could be associated with an improving economy and stable gasoline prices in addition to favorable beach weather. All those vehicles means a good chunk of change in toll revenue. Last year, the net total was an estimated $132.8 million, up roughly $27 million from the previous year. For passenger vehicles, the one-way fare is $5. Tolls are paid by vehicles traveling from New Jersey into Delaware.
Neptune Capt. Fisher pleaded with Seidle to drop his gun, the grand jury testimony shows. Fisher had worked with Seidle for years. Seidle said Fisher had seen him cry.
Trump's actions: With his executive order last year, Trump signaled that he would undermine the ACA's protections by allowing insurance plans that don't have to cover even the basics. Trump calculated that would bring the Democrats to the table, but Democrats are wise to stay away on those terms. Early in 2018, the administration has to decide if and how to implement this executive order as well as whether to approve requests from states to impose work requirements or require drug testing for Medicaid beneficiaries. These decisions are likely to draw a range of legal challenges and protests. Trump may welcome the controversy, and if he proceeds with more unilateral action, he and the entire party will certainly get it.
His secret internal affairs file tops 600 pages.
Mecher said he got quite a few stares from fellow motorists. When he stopped, he got questions about the legality of transporting a snowmobile on top of a car. When he arrived in Bessemer, it took just nine minutes to remove the snowmobile from its lofty perch with a front end loader and a strap.
Lightning killed 16 people in 2017, the fewest deaths since accurate records began in 1940, the National Weather Service said. This broke the previous record low of 23, set in 2013, weather service meteorologist John Jensenius said.
The chief thought the answer was to punish me, Seidle said. You know, if I forgot to do something or he saw me under stress – and he knew why – but his answer was: punish Phil and then that's going to make him, you know, somehow magically not, or make me perform or do better; when the problem wasn't with me not wanting to do it or not being able to, it was the fact that I was under stress and I was just having trouble coping. Having trouble with what was going on in my personal life. And he knew that, he knew that.
That declaration was for the civil suit, Seidle wrote. And basically, their investigation covered all of the allegations made by my children in the suit. They cleared themselves in a case where they are my co-defendants. I think there's something wrong with that, and cannot understand why the Attorney General's Office allowed it.
The week after the shooting, hundreds of people attended Tamara's Catholic funeral, where her nine children followed her casket out of a church about a mile from the crime scene. The children later filed a lawsuit alleging negligence by the law enforcement agencies responsible for overseeing Seidle and responding to the shooting. A notice of claim showed they are seeking $10 million in damages. Neptune, Asbury Park and Monmouth County Prosecutor's Office have filed motions to dismiss the lawsuit.
In one incident about 11 months before the shooting, Seidle approached two of his children at their job at a snack stand on the Ocean Grove boardwalk. He said one of his daughters hadn't been returning his calls. He told the Press that he told the 16-year-old he wanted her to call him, and if she didn't there would be consequences.
As reality sank in for Seidle in his cell, shock and outrage radiated from Sewall Avenue, making headlines across the region.
Both McEntegart and the Neptune lieutenant notified higher-ranking officers. McEntegart also briefed an assistant Monmouth County prosecutor. In an interview, First Assistant Prosecutor Lori Linskey said this was a police officer asking for legal advice, which doesn't mean a case was opened by the prosecutor's office.
Baltimore: A 24-year-old chimpanzee at the Maryland Zoo has given birth to a girl. The zoo welcomed the 2-pound new addition on Dec. 29, officials announced in a statement on Wednesday. The first-time mother, Raven, and the newborn chimp have spent their first week together bonding in a quiet off-exhibit area, according to the statement. The baby chimp will go on display for the public following the short period of bonding. Raven was the second chimpanzee to give birth at the zoo outside of Baltimore in 2019. Bunny, gave birth to Lola in July. There are now 14 chimps in its care, and officials said the births have been important as reproduction of the species at zoos nationwide has slowed in recent years. Officials haven't decided on a name, a spokeswoman for the Maryland Zoo told The Washington Post. Sometimes the animal's care team chooses a name and other times there's a contest that involves the public, she added.
Tamara stopped working to stay home with the kids after their sixth child was born, Seidle wrote. She nearly died during the birth of their seventh child and underwent a gall bladder surgery in 2002, Seidle wrote. She lost her mother and father within a year.
The prosecutor's office was notified of a 2014 incident in which Tamara reported to police that Seidle was harassing her, then Seidle began screaming profanities at the officers who responded, according to the prosecutor's report.
Many people surrounding the Seidles didn't respond or declined to comment, including the attorney representing the Seidle children in the lawsuit, the Seidles' priest, the Catholic Diocese of Trenton, the Seidles' divorce attorneys, the Neptune police chief, and former police director.
And when lightning does strike, Jensenius said, better medical treatment and access to automatic external defibrillators has helped save the lives of lightning strike victims. Roughly 90% of people struck by lightning survive.
Once entrusted with a badge and a gun to protect the town he called home, Seidle, 53, is no longer trusted with a real pen.
They walk straight, Chavarriaga said of the children. They are good kids. That says a lot when children behave because obviously, someone is teaching them the right thing.
Then there were two reports of domestic incidents involving Seidle in January and February that year, according to the prosecutor's report. Tinton Falls police responded to a confrontation between Seidle and one of Chavarriaga's daughters, according to the prosecutor's report. Seidle provided the Press with a letter showing the girl recanting her statement to police that Seidle put his hands on her.
There was a report of friction between Fangio and Fox a few weeks ago. Fangio might also get interviews for head coaching jobs.
Atlanta: Leaders of the African Methodist Episcopal Church forgave $4 million in debt owed by a college it founded in Atlanta. The financial boost for Morris Brown College was announced Tuesday night, news outlets reported. In exchange, the college agreed to establish a $1.5 million scholarship for AME church members. Morris Brown College lost its accreditation in 2002. Interim president Kevin James launched an effort last year to become accredited again. An official told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution that the debt forgiveness will help. The Georgia Conference of the African Methodist Episcopal Church founded Morris Brown College in 1881, the newspaper reported. The college has about 40 students enrolled, according to news outlets.
Chicago: Several recreational marijuana dispensaries in the state were closed Monday, with some owners saying strong demand has caused a shortage in supplies and staff exhaustion. The legal sale of recreational cannabis began Jan. 1 in Illinois, with customers spending about $3.2 million on the first day and more than $10.8 million over five days. By comparison, Michigan, which made recreational marijuana legal Dec. 1, generated $3.1 million in the first two weeks of sales. Neal McQueeney of Midway Dispensary in Chicago said the shop stopped selling recreational product Sunday and doesn't expect to resume sales until Friday. Jason Erkes said Cresco Labs shut its Sunnyside shops in Chicago, Rockford and Champaign to all customers to reset and give his staff a break after working five consecutive 14-hour days.
In a Nov. 3 hearing, Monmouth County Assignment Judge Lisa P. Thornton remarked on the number of internal affairs incidents.
Indianapolis:Family members of Hoosier bank robber John Dillinger have dropped their lawsuit seeking rights to open his grave at Crown Hill Cemetery. The lawsuit, filed in August by Dillinger nephew Michael C. Thompson, was initially dismissed without prejudice by Marion County Superior Court Judge Timothy Oakes on Dec. 4, but Thompson was granted an extension of time to file an amended complaint. That deadline would have been Jan. 15. But on Tuesday, a motion to voluntarily dismiss the lawsuit was submitted to the court on Thompson's behalf. It has been granted, effectively putting the issue to rest. Since the lawsuit was dismissed without prejudice, the family could revisit the issue in court. It's unknown what Thompson's plans are moving forward or how this affects the status of the proposed documentary. Attempts to reach the Thompson family and their attorney, Andrea Simmons, were unsuccessful. Crown Hill Cemetery objected to plans to exhume Dillinger's body, citing a duty to ensure the safety and integrity of the grounds and those buried there. In a written statement sent to IndyStar, cemetery management said they were pleased the matter has been resolved. Dillinger, born in Indianapolis in 1903, gained notoriety after a string of bank robberies in 1933 and several high-profile escapes from police custody. His name became legend when FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover labeled him Public Enemy No. 1, but his life of crime came to an end when police and federal agents ambushed him outside Chicago's Biograph Theater on July 22, 1934.
Now we enter 2018 with health care as a top concern of American voters and the ACA as popular as ever. More importantly, Americans recognize the ACA's flaws and by large margins just want them to be fixed.
The number of people killed by lightning in recent years a far cry from annual lightning deaths decades ago: In the 1940s, for instance, hundreds of people were killed each year by lightning. In 1943 alone, 432 people died.
Seidle began seeing Gloria Patricia Chavarriaga. A divorce document filed on Tamara's behalf claimed this happened during her cancer treatment, which ended in June 2011.
Afterward, he said he talked to two colleagues, Capt. Fisher and Sgt. J. Hunter Ellison. Ellison also couldn't be reached for comment. Fisher would later respond to the scene the day Seidle shot Tamara.
But Gramiccioni's report made no mention of police escorts and set aside the calls for custody disputes, saying they do not constitute incidents of domestic violence.
Silver Mountain Resort is located about 60 miles east of Spokane, Washington, along Interstate 90 in the Idaho Panhandle.
Winona: An employee has been fired after tweeting criticism of his firm's holiday gift to its workers. A branch manager for Fastenal in Canada was fired just before New Year's Day after he posted a tweet chiding the company about its gift choice of barbecue sauce and a wooden grill scraper. Fastenal says the tweet violated the company's policy on social media posts. CEO Dan Florness said the policy about acceptable standards of conduct is given to every employee and posted on the company website. News of the firing has been widely shared on social media and prompted a backlash, including several website posts and phone messages that were deleted immediately because they were vulgar or threatening, Florness told the Star Tribune. Fastena'l, based in Winona, says it's the largest fastener distributor in North America.
I look at the ruling on myself and ... I don't understand it. I'm being accused of being a minister who did not ensure quality anti-doping at the Olympics. But I wasn't supposed to do that. It's their work, understand? Mutko said, blaming WADA. They didn't control a damn thing — excuse me — and what, should we answer for that?
The first thing he did in jail was to ask for a priest. Seidle said he confessed his sin and asked for absolution.
Exclusively for Insiders: Philip Seidle's thoughts - Inside the mind of a killer cop
He chased her west on First Avenue, south on Central and west on Asbury Avenue, grand jury testimony shows. His car struck her car near Jimmy's Restaurant, knocking off the front license plate of Seidle's SUV.
Less than a year before the shooting, Seidle tried to retire from the force in a fit of frustration over friction with his ex-wife and his deteriorating relationship with his children. He handed in his badge and gun. But Seidle said his colleagues encouraged him to return. He was put back on the job and rearmed.
Those bans, which include 14 medalists, have helped clear the way for younger talent in Russia, Mutko said. While there would usually be about 40 percent changeover in the Russian team between Olympics, he said, this time 80 percent of athletes will not have competed in Sochi.
I don't expect them to forgive me, he said. But I just want them to know how sorry I am.
Gramiccioni has since established an early warning system in which Monmouth County departments are required to report to the prosecutor's office if an officer meets criteria like being involved in a domestic violence incident.
Within a year of his hire, the department knew about Seidle's trouble at home. In March 1994, Seidle called Neptune police after Tamara allegedly threw a chair at him, according to a prosecutor's office report. But then, as it would happen several more times in the future, neither Seidle nor Tamara filed a criminal complaint.
Trenton: All 37,000 of the lead water pipes in the state capital will be replaced over the next five years at an estimated cost of $150 million, Trenton officials said Thursday. The announcement comes about five months after the state's largest city, Newark, said it would speed up the replacement of its 18,000 lead lines over the next 21/ 2 years – and as the state grapples with how to move forward with its old water infrastructure. Trenton's publicly owned water utility draws water from the Delaware River and serves some 200,000 customers in the city, in addition to surrounding communities of Ewing, Hamilton, Hopewell and Lawrence. Pipes will be replaced in phases as the city and Trenton Water Works, the public utility, continue to secure funds, which are coming from the state infrastructure bank, as well a federal program, according to David Smith, the water works chief engineer. Residents must register on the utility's website and pay $1,000 to have their lines replaced, Democratic Mayor Reed Gusciora said. That's a savings, he said, because replacement typically costs about $2,000-$5,000 per line. About 7,000 people have registered to have their pipes replaced, and officials said they hope to make the replacement mandatory and at no cost at some point.
Top receiver Alshon Jeffery's future is in question. Change could be coming to the coaching staff, too.
Wilmington: A popular ferry route has closed for three months to allow crews to perform repairs. The StarNews reports the N.C. Department of Transportation closed the Southport-Fort Fisher ferry beginning Monday to update ramp equipment at both ferry terminals. The department's ferry division said contractors expect work on the approximately $3 million project should be done by early April. The work comes after a failure of the ramp system on the Southport side of the ferry shut down the route for five weeks in August and September. The ferry closure will be a headache for tourists and commuters. What was a 30-minute trip over the water could take an hour-plus by road. Nearly 200,000 vehicles make the Southport-Fort Fisher crossing each year, the StarNews reports, citing state statistics.
Bismarck: A county commission that recently voted to limit how many refugees it would accept voted Monday not to put the issue before voters in a nonbinding straw poll. The Bismarck Tribune reports the five-member Burleigh County Commission voted 3-2 against a potential ballot question relating to future refugee resettlement. The vote breakdown was the same as the commission vote last month not to accept more than 25 refugees in 2020. That vote came after a four-hour meeting where several refugees, in often emotional testimony, urged the commission to continue accepting new arrivals. Had the commission voted a total ban on refugee resettlement in Burleigh County, home to about 95,000 people and the capital city of Bismarck, refugee resettlement groups said they believe it would have been be the first local government to do so since President Donald Trump gave states and counties that power.
Wellesley: A college employee who posted a controversial Facebook post about Iran bombing the U.S. was suspended Wednesday. Babson College's director of sustainability, Asheen Phansey, faced disciplinarian actions for a post he made on social media on Tuesday that suggested Iran list 52 American cultural sites that Iran could bomb, the Boston Herald reported. President Donald Trump posted on Twitter on Jan 4. that the U.S. has targeted 52 Iranian sites in reference to rising tensions between the countries. In the now-deleted post, Phansey wrote, In retaliation, Ayatollah Khomenei should tweet a list of 52 sites of beloved American cultural heritage that he would bomb. Um… Mall of America? Kardashian residence? In a statement Wednesday, the former employee said, I regret my bad attempt at humor. As an American, born and raised, I was trying to juxtapose our 'cultural sites' with ancient Iranian churches and mosques. I am completely opposed to violence and would never advocate it by anyone. I am sorry that my sloppy humor was read as a threat.
Lawson gave the location over the radio, shouting for backup, noting that Seidle had the gun to his head and that he was a sergeant from Neptune. Seidle's daughter ran to responding officers and Asbury Park police Capt. Marshawn Love. Love had been their neighbor for more than a decade and recognized the cars as belonging to the Seidles. He drove Seidle's daughter away from the scene.
Portland: The state with the largest fishing industry for lobster likely experienced a drop in catch last year, but the dip in harvest was probably not as dramatic as initially feared. Patrick Keliher, commissioner of the Maine Department of Marine Resources, told Maine Public that initial reports showed a harvest of about 100 million pounds of lobster. That would be a drop of nearly 20 million pounds from last year, but still a much higher number than the industry was used to in the 1990s and 2000. The season initially looked like it could produce a substantial drop in catch, but Maine's lobstermen finished strong, Keliher said. The price for Maine lobster was also strong, he said. It's possible for the state's lobster catch to be slowed by lobsters shedding their shells late in the year. The biggest surge in catch happens after many lobsters lose their old shells and reach legal harvesting size.
Providence: Legislative leaders said Wednesday they're working to undo a change to how medical marijuana dispensaries are regulated, to address a lawsuit by the governor. A provision in the state budget approved last year gave lawmakers the right to veto regulations imposed on the industry. Democratic Gov. Gina Raimondo sued, arguing the new law violates the state constitution's separation of powers clause because it gives lawmakers unchecked control over executive rulemaking authority. Democratic House Speaker Nicholas Mattiello and Senate President Dominick Ruggerio said Wednesday they're filing legislation to repeal the language that required lawmakers to approve rules and regulations relating to the expansion of licenses for medical marijuana dispensaries. However, they still took issue with how the Department of Business Regulation proposed regulations for dispensaries, with Mattiello calling it blatant overreach by the executive branch. The legislation not only removes the controversial provision, but also imposes limits on regulators. Among them, regulators would be barred from limiting dispensaries based on geographical zones and from preventing any center from growing its own supply of medical marijuana or limiting the number of plants. Lawmakers authorized six new medical marijuana dispensaries last year, for a total of nine.
I just told them that I love them and that I only wanted to have a relationship with them and that I was sorry, he said.
But beneath that public persona, Seidle's stress and frustration were no secret to his colleagues and supervisors. Both he and his ex-wife made claims of domestic violence.
Hayneville: A teenager admitted to fatally shooting a sheriff who was attempting to disperse loiterers at a gas station, a state investigator testified Monday. Lt. Shawn Loughridge of the State Bureau of Investigation testified in a preliminary hearing that 18-year-old William Chase Johnson admitted after being arrested that he shot Lowndes County Sheriff John Williams Sr. Johnson is charged with capital murder in the sheriff's death. Store security video showed the sheriff arriving at a gas station and attempting to disperse a noisy crowd that was blocking gas pumps, the investigator said. He said witnesses indicated Johnson first approached Williams in an aggressive manner, and the sheriff told him to return to his vehicle. The sheriff was shot after approaching Johnson's black Silverado truck, Loughridge testified.
I'll be just fine, said White, who hasn't started running. Just about getting my mobility back, getting my strength back.
He was constantly a mess over his kids, Rittman said. That's one thing, he always tried to be there for his kids.
He planned to leave in January 2011, wanting not to spoil the holidays. But in October 2010, Tamara told him she had breast cancer.
After high school, I didn't believe myself to be disciplined enough to go to college. Wanting to travel, I enlisted in the U.S. Navy in July of 1982 at 18, he wrote.
He called Tamara as he was walking out of his home.
With his left hand, Seidle held the gun to his head. For about 45 minutes, officers held their fire, trying to coax Seidle into surrendering. He shouted profanity, furious about being kept apart from his nine children.
Anchorage: Alaska experienced its warmest year on record, according to federal climate officials.The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in its U.S. Climate report said Alaska had a statewide average temperature of 32.2 degrees, 6.2 degrees above the long-term average. It also surpassed the previous record statewide average temperature of 31.9 set in 2016, the agency said. Four of the last six years in Alaska have been record warm years, NOAA said. Ten cities experienced their warmest years ever, including Anchorage, Fairbanks, Utqiagvik, Kotzebue, King Salmon, Bethel, Northway, McGrath, Kodiak and Cold Bay. Alaska set the record despite a December that featured temperatures closer to average, NOAA said. NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Information compiled the annual summary. Among the other highlights was rainfall in other states. The contiguous 48 states experienced the second-wettest year on record with 34.78 inches, just 0.18 inches less than the total for the wettest year set in 1973.

Fayetteville: The Washington County jail has temporarily suspended its work-release program to free up more bed space in the facility, which has been hindered by overcrowding. Washington County Sheriff Tim Helder said the move will open up 24 beds, with some detainees being released if eligible and others moved into the jail's general population. The sheriff told the Northwest Arkansas Democrat-Gazette that a recent increase in the number of sex offenders housed at the county jail prompted the decision because sex offenders must be housed separately from other detainees. The county jail has 710 beds, but because of legal requirements to separate certain detainees, it's considered full when the facility is 80% full, or at 568 detainees, the sheriff's office said. On Monday, the number of detainees reached 792, authorities said.
Linebacker Leonard Floyd showed promise with seven sacks after being drafted No. 9 overall, though he did suffer two concussions late in the season.
He wrote that he was found unfit because he asked to be. His unfitness was not on any finding of psychological dysfunction, or disorder, Seidle said.
Then on the morning of June 16, 2015, Seidle learned Tamara's new boyfriend had been spending time alone with the Seidle children.
Denver: An initiative to reintroduce gray wolves to the state has qualified for the November ballot. The secretary of state's office said Monday that backers of the proposal turned in sufficient valid voter signatures to qualify the measure. The gray wolf has been successfully reintroduced to a number of U.S. states. It was eradicated in Colorado in the 1940s. Colorado ranchers and other interests strongly oppose the initiative, saying it would threaten livestock as well as elk, moose, deer and other animals. The Rocky Mountain Wolf Action Fund is campaigning for the plan. It says voters have the opportunity to decide for themselves whether to introduce the wolf, whereas efforts in other states are directed by federal wildlife officials. If passed, the initiative would direct the Colorado Parks and Wildlife Commission to devise a plan to introduce wolves on public land west of the Continental Divide before 2024.
In the last week I had occasion to be in touch with your Patrolman Philip Seidel (sic) on three occasions and I wanted to let you know that I found him to show good judgment and professionalism on each occasion, Ruth E. Buck, proprietor of The Shelburne Hotel, wrote in June 1994.
St. Louis: Gov. Mike Parson says he's not convinced that unregulated and untaxed video gambling terminals in the state are illegal, even as investigators in his administration work to halt their spread. The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports that Parson, the former Polk County sheriff, said he is monitoring a Platte County court case that could provide legal guidance to the state's prosecutors on what constitutes a game of chance versus a game of skill. The video gambling terminals, which work in a fashion similar to slot machines, have been rolled out in truck stops, gas stations and convenience stores across the state. Opponents argue that slot machines are only allowed in casinos. But backers say the machines give players the option of viewing the outcome of a wager before placing a bet. The governor's stance is in contrast to the Missouri State Highway Patrol, whose leaders have made a decision.
The line supervisors, they were all aware, Seidle said. They knew what was going on, they knew that there were problems…you know there were times that I came to work late. I reported late because I had to be, I was in court. I had to be in court. And then just all the police reports that I made. And I spoke to them constantly.
In an interview, the prosecutor's office limited its comments on Seidle, pointing to the children's lawsuit.
San Diego: A team of eye experts has operated on an unusual patient – a gorilla. A cataract was removed Dec. 10 from the left eye of a 3-year-old western lowland gorilla who lives at the San Diego Zoo Safari Park, the park announced Monday. The gorilla, named Leslie, was given a muscle blocker to keep her still while a team that included vets along with anesthesiologists and an ophthalmology team from UC San Diego Health removed the cloudy lens and replaced it with an artificial lens that should last for life. The operation was performed at the San Diego Zoo Global's Paul Harter Veterinary Medical Center. Cataract surgeon Chris Heichel, who led the team and has performed thousands of operations, said it was his first on a gorilla.
Omaha: Despite more than doubling releases from its reservoir system, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers still doesn't expect to eliminate all the leftover water from last year's near-record runoff that led to massive Missouri River flooding. The Corps had been discharging about twice the usual winter amount from Gavins Point Dam – the southernmost in the six-dam system. The Corps said it was raising the discharge this month to 30,000 cubic feet per second, an increase of more than 11%. Until a seasonal decrease that began in November, the amount being released had been 80,000 cubic feet per second for months, also more than twice the average. Areas along the Missouri River and its tributaries in parts of Nebraska, Kansas, Iowa and Missouri were ravaged by floodwaters in the early spring. Heavy rains later in the year reflooded many areas that had been left unprotected because of levee failures. John Remus, chief of the Corps' Missouri River management, told the Omaha World-Herald the reservoir system needs to make as much space as possible in light of the National Weather Service forecast for warmer than normal weather and higher than normal runoff in January and February. The Corps normally doesn't release more during the winter because of the potential for ice jams and dams upriver, Remus told the Associated Press on Wednesday. Once the river freezes over it essentially becomes a pipe, Remus said, limiting its capacity.
She didn't answer the phone, Seidle said. I said 'OK, well if she won't answer the phone I'm gonna go to the job and I'll talk to her and get her to talk to me and see what's going on.'
Seidle worked in patrol, later as a detective and as a sergeant. He was credited for police work in Asbury Park Press stories. He helped make arrests in a car theft ring in 1995, he was among officers who booked several people after a shooting in 1997. While patrolling in an unmarked car in 1998, he arrested a man who tried to sell him cocaine. He received a commendation from the 200 Club of Monmouth County – an organization that supports the police – in 2007 for his role as a detective on the department's quality of life team.
You tell me Mr. Ford. Tell me that isn't enough to bring someone to violence? I'm not saying it's right! I'm saying nothing stirs violence like a child. That's all I'm saying. I want this narrative of me being inherently violent to stop. Period. I want this idea that I was the one who needed to be stopped to cease. Tamara should have been stopped! Period. All I wanted was to share in my children's lives. If I had been allowed to, I'd have been fine. It was my right under every law on this earth, and I shouldn't have had to wait until she felt like abiding by the law.

With his right hand, he typed a text message to the children:
Nashua: Three employees were sickened by a cleaning chemical at an Amazon warehouse, fire officials said Thursday. Firefighters in Nashua responded at about 4 a.m. for a report of a chemical reaction that happened while a crew was mixing chemicals, Deputy Fire Chief Karl Gerhard told WMUR-TV. The major symptoms we saw were respiratory-related, scratchiness, coughing-related issues, Gerhard said. There was possibly an unknown chemical in the bucket already that they were putting the chemicals in, and that caused the reaction. The building was evacuated and the employees were taken to a hospital. Two were treated and released. A fire department report said after the building had been ventilated, crews monitored the building using air and chemical metering devices and found no abnormal readings. OSHA and the state fire marshal's office were notified.
Virginia Beach: An animal shelter took in 20 cats after they were found living in a storage unit with their owner who had recently lost her home, the adoption center said in a social media post. The woman and the felines were found living in a Virginia Beach self-storage unit this week, the city's Animal Care and Adoption Center said on Tuesday. The city doesn't have a limit on how many cats residents can own, Animal Control Supervisor Meghan Conti told The Virginian-Pilot. The adoption center said the cats were understandably scared, but are otherwise in good health and didn't show signs of neglect. They're being housed together and awaiting adoption into new homes. The animal shelter didn't say how long the cats and their owner had been living in the storage unit or what happened with the woman.

Seidle said he was devastated by his fraying relationship with his children and the warming relationship between Tamara's new boyfriend and the Seidle children.
Trenton: The state could see a significant increase in the number of electric cars traveling on local roads under a bill gaining momentum that would expand the state's network of charging stations and give motorists a sizable rebate on a purchase or lease. The measure is seen as a cornerstone of efforts to reduce air pollution, including greenhouse gases, in a state that continually receives failing grades for smog. The bill was approved by two Assembly committees Monday as lawmakers push to pass it before the legislative session comes to a close next week. To achieve those clean air reductions, motorists will be given one of the best incentive packages in the nation to buy an electric car. At the center of the bill is a rebate of up to $5,000 intended to lower an electric vehicle's sticker price to make the sector more competitive with gasoline-powered cars.
The next day, Seidle filed for a domestic violence civil complaint and temporary restraining order, detailing the custody dispute and alleging past abuse by Tamara.
Washington:Neighbors in a Northeast D.C. community quickly mobilized to help their neighbors who lost everything in a raging fire Sunday, WUSA-TV reported. Neighbors donated everything, from school supplies to toiletries. James Caviness-Bey was working overnights at Wal-Mart when he got word of the fire, with his family still inside their Madison street home. But on Wednesday night, he was able to thank D.C. firefighters for their quick response. He also recognized the person he calls the real hero: his wife, who ran back into their burning home when she realized their 2-year-old grandson was still inside. With the flames intensifying, Edwina Caviness-Bey dropped her grandson from the second floor window into her son's arms. From there, she had no choice but to jump out. She had second-degree burns, a fractured pelvis and wrist, and is still in the intensive care unit preparing for surgery. Caviness-Bey, his son and grandson all got to thank their neighbors Wednesday night. Even the family dog, whom for hours they thought had died in the blaze, made an appearance. Neighbors are planning another donation drive to support this family in the coming days. In the meantime, they have set up a GoFundMe page.
Punitive measures like suspensions and disarmament compounded the stress he was under, Seidle said. The punishments hindered his ability to pay child support, alimony and his own bills because suspensions cut his six-figure pay, he said. He said he leaned on Capt. Fisher for sympathy and, at one point, to pay the rent.
Sioux Falls: Legislators have invited the Crow Creek Sioux tribal chairman to deliver the annual State of the Tribes address after some tribal leaders threatened to boycott a planned address by a member of Gov. Kristi Noem's Cabinet. Lawmakers on Monday invited Lester Thompson Jr. to deliver the address next week. The move is a switch from plans to have Secretary of Tribal Relations Dave Flute give it. The annual speech is supposed to promote cooperation between the state government and the tribes but instead became a point of friction when tribal leaders objected to having a state employee give the speech. Last week, some tribal leaders said they would hold their own event called the Great Sioux Nation Tribal address. That event will still happen in Fort Pierre across the Missouri River from the Capitol but has been rescheduled for after the State of the Tribes address.
Tucson: Like many city libraries, the one in downtown Tucson is a refuge for homeless people looking for a bathroom, a computer or just a respite. But staff at the Valdez Main Library want to be even more of a resource for men and women having a hard time. For more than a year now, the librarians here have been holding monthly meetings as part of the On the Streets program. Those experiencing homelessness can once a month get a meal and connect with services. The program has helped temper friction that can develop when library staffers have to approach people who are sleeping, bathing or bringing in multiple items. An average of 50 people show up for the monthly sessions. They receive a meal prepared by a local food bank and can choose to stay for the meeting. They get to shape the topics of discussion, too.
This review and analysis disclosed a critical flaw in the domestic violence policies and procedures that currently exist statewide, the report stated. The report also raised concern with officers who are the subject of numerous internal affairs complaints.
Then he was led away to jail.
Jefferson City: Republican Gov. Mike Parson's campaign said it raised about $540,000 in recent months, outpacing the $445,000 brought in by Democratic challenger Nicole Galloway. Those numbers are dwarfed by fundraising by independent political action committees, which rose in power after voters put limits on political donations directly to candidates in 2016. There are no limits on donations to PACs, which can work to bolster a candidate but cannot coordinate with the official campaign. A PAC backing Parson raised close to $1 million in the latest reporting period, which covers October through December. Uniting Missouri PAC Chairman John Hancock said the committee has more than $5 million on hand to spend helping Parson in the gubernatorial race. A pro-Galloway PAC has not yet reported recent fundraising. The general election is Nov. 3.
Seidle explained how the fight over the children led to the ultimate tragedy.
Tamara's death at age 51 left their nine children without parents, prompted a multimillion-dollar legal claim by the kids and tainted the careers of two responding officers.
Seidle left Tamara in January 2012, he wrote.
In Tinton Falls one night in 2012, Tamara admitted she had been drinking and followed Seidle to the gym because she thought he was headed to see his mistress. Seidle called the police, she left by the time they arrived and Seidle declined to file a complaint.
LAKE FOREST, Ill. (AP) — The Chicago Bears might be ready to split with quarterback Jay Cutler.
Mutko said he continues to have a key role overseeing the government's multi-billion-dollar investments in World Cup stadiums and infrastructure. Leaving the organizing committee, he said, was simply not to give any extra reason for criticism of Russia from abroad.
The highest number of lightning deaths occurred in Florida, which recorded five fatalities. Alabama followed with three and Colorado, Texas and North Carolina had two each. The other two lightning deaths occurred in Ohio and Puerto Rico. All but one of the victims were male. On average, 79% of lightning victims are male, based on data from 2006 to 2016.
St. George: More than 16,000 public comments have been submitted for a proposal on whether to allow a highway to be built through a protected Mojave desert tortoise habitat in southern Utah, federal officials said. The proposed four-lane road has drawn criticism from conservationists because the corridor would run through land set aside to protect the tortoise. The Bureau of Land Management opened the public comment period last month and will now go through all of the comments before releasing the draft environmental impact statement, The Spectrum newspaper reported Wednesday. BLM is not permitted to say where the people submitting comments were from, but there was a mix of people who submitted comments locally and nationally, Venhuizen said. Details on the nature of the comments were not disclosed. The draft is the first step in the year-long National Environmental Policy Act, officials said. The Utah Division of Transportation and Washington County proposed building the Northern Corridor that would pass through the Red Cliffs National Conservation Area, officials said. A definite route for the road has not yet been determined, but the draft statement would take alternatives into consideration, officials said. After the department releases the draft environmental impact statement, a new 90-day public comment period will open, officials said. A decision is expected by 2021.
Rittman never expected violence from Seidle, she said. Seidle didn't seem like that kind of person.
Six days before the shooting, a letter shows Bradley Beach Municipal Court Judge Richard B. Thompson found no probable cause for Seidle's criminal complaint, saying the issue was a civil matter.
Seidle said he told the doctor that I was extremely upset by Tamara's lies, and did not want to be at work during this time, as I would have trouble focusing.
Hey Phil! Drop that gun Phil! Lawson yelled before ducking back behind his patrol car.
Tamara's allegations were made in publicly available documents that were later obtained by the Press, but the Monmouth County Prosecutor's Office ignored them in its final report.
Seidle provided notes from a psychologist, Raymond Hanbury, who counseled Seidle and documented his struggle starting in 2012, after he was found unfit for duty by a department psychologist. Hanbury didn't respond to calls seeking comment.
Great Falls: A Native American tribe has planned a celebration after recently gaining federal recognition. The Little Shell Tribe of Chippewa Indians of Montana has announced plans to host a celebration Jan. 25 in Great Falls. The celebration comes about a month after President Donald Trump signed the National Defense Authorization Act containing an amendment giving the Little Shell Tribe federal recognition, officials said. The free celebration will be held at the Holiday Inn from 5 to 10 p.m. and is open to the public, tribal council members said. The celebration includes dinner, traditional music played by fiddlers, and speeches by dignitaries and council members. Other tribes are expected to be represented at the event, councilmembers said. The public is also invited to attend a pipe ceremony the same day at 1 p.m. at the Shawn Gilbert Event Center, tribal members said.
A congratulations banner was still over the door. The family threw a party the weekend before for two of the eldest children. They were the first in Seidle's lineage to graduate from college.
Montpelier: The number of fatalities on Vermont roadways went down by about 30% in 2019, according to state figures. Vermont State Police and the Vermont Agency of Transportation released figures that show the tentative number of deaths on the state's roads in 2019 was 47, down from 69 in 2018, the Times Argus reported. But state officials are not sure what to attribute the decrease in road fatalities. Lt. Tara Thomas, commander of safety programs for the Vermont State Police, said the reduction was unexplainable. Thomas said that 47 deaths are still too many for state police. We wish we knew what the formula was to keep the numbers down. 47 is still too many for the state police. That's 47 families that don't have a loved one with them, so in our eyes, it's still high. We're averaging just way too many each month, she said. The 47 deaths resulted from 44 crashes last year. The figure is tentative because if someone dies as a result of injuries from a 2019 crash within the first 30 days of 2020, that person's death would be added to the list of fatalities from 2019. Vermont also had no fatal crashes reported in the state on any of the holidays last year.
Juneau: One of the longest-serving members on the state Supreme Court plans to retire later this year. The Alaska Judicial Council is accepting applications for the seat held by Justice Craig Stowers, who plans to retire effective June 1, according to Mara Rabinowitz with the state court system. Stowers, a former Superior Court judge, was appointed to the Alaska Supreme Court in 2009 and later served as a chief justice. Of the current justices, only Daniel Winfree has served on the Supreme Court longer. Winfree was appointed in 2007. The judicial council plans to meet in May to interview applicants. The names of finalists advanced by the council will be sent to Gov. Mike Dunleavy, who will make the appointment.

Jackson:A prison inmate said he was transferred and lost his job as a tutor after complaining that teachers were supplying answers to a high school equivalency test. U.S. District Judge Mark Goldsmith declined to dismiss the lawsuit, the Detroit Free Press reported Thursday, which means it will go to trial or be settled. Munin Kathawa, 57, who is serving a life sentence for murder, sued five people, including a deputy warden, claiming his rights were violated. He said he reported his concerns about cheating in 2018 to a state lawmaker and a Catholic priest. Corrections Department spokesman Chris Gautz declined to comment. Kathawa said he was falsely accused of being a safety threat and removed as a tutor. A teacher, Laura Bendele, testified in a deposition that she was pressured by officials to stick to that story but refused.
Then all of this started just hitting me, Seidle said. That was where the emotion started spiraling out of control.
JEFFERY'S FUTURE: Though it's not clear if he will still be with them, Jeffery guaranteed a Super Bowl championship for the Bears next year. He even compared them to the New England Patriots.
Des Moines: To keep up with a sharp increase in passengers, Des Moines International Airport is adding gates to its planned new terminal years before construction even begins. Planned with 14 gates when it opens in 2028, the terminal will instead need 18 to handle the additional load, airport officials said Monday. The extra four gates hadn't been slated to be built until 2040. The airport will have a combined $60 million in additional capacity-boosting projects, including the $40 million cost of the extra gates. But because the growth in passenger traffic has generated additional revenue, the shortfall in funding for the $500 million project remains at $194 million – similar to two years ago, when airport leaders were looking at scaling back the project to cut costs.
I was ordered by my chief to 'stay away' from Tammy for my 'own good,' he wrote of his return to work. Then-police Chief Robert Adams could not be reached for comment.
All of it was unbelievable, he said.
The action starts immediately and triggers a series of important choices. The overall path that helps the most Americans is, as it usually is, also the path that makes the most political sense.
Seidle slid into an emotional tailspin because her boyfriend was being left alone with Seidle's kids, taking over the role of the father, Seidle said.
There's no doubt about it, Seidle said. I will walk out of these walls one day.
Seidle was shocked and hung up the phone.
This firm defended Phil Seidle under extremely difficult circumstances to the very best of our ability, said his attorney, Edward Bertucio. He avoided a murder conviction with a possibility of a sentence he could not outlive. Instead we negotiated aggravated manslaughter and the sentence he received was lengthy. We appealed it. We did everything we could for him. I wish him the very best.
Seidle said he doesn't remember fatally shooting his ex-wife, Tamara Wilson-Seidle on June 16, 2015, in the middle of an Asbury Park street, in front of their 7-year-old daughter.
Seidle said he doesn't remember what happened next.
WHO'S THE QB?: The biggest question facing the Bears? That's easy.
Neptune township officials refuse to release documents showing what they knew about Seidle's problems and when they knew it.
Seidle said he began to unravel during Tamara's pursuit of child custody, which he felt rose to criminal interference. The day he killed her, he shouted about his kids as he stood in the street with his pistol to his head.
Helena: Urban deer culling for the fall and winter seasons was suspended by city officials amid budget cuts. The Montana Fish and Wildlife Commission recommended the city of Helena be allowed to continue culling despite budget cuts, The Helena Independent Record reported Tuesday. Former Police Chief Troy McGee made the decision to cut the program when the department was ordered to make more than $470,000 in cuts, city officials said. The program costs the city about $30,000 a year, officials said. The commission sets a quota range of up to 250 designated to maintain the population at desire levels and the city determines the exact number to cull each year within that range, officials said. This will be the first fall and winter the city has not culled deer since 2008, officials said. The city has plans to survey the deer population to determine if it will resume culling operations, Police Chief Steve Hagen said. The city has usually culled about 100 deer a year and populations have remained steady, officials said.
Seidle thought he would never get his kids back.
What is known is that police responded to at least nine domestic incidents between the Seidles and 10 custody disputes – with police providing an escort during at least one custody confrontation.
Capt. Lawrence Fisher was there for me in every way during this whole ordeal, Seidle said. He saw me crying and things that went on with me emotionally when nobody else was around. Fisher could not be reached for comment
Three years before the shooting, ongoing domestic incidents were discussed by a lieutenant in Neptune and a sergeant in Tinton Falls when they handled a confrontation between the Seidles, according to a police report. Higher ranking officers in both departments were notified of the incident.
The former Neptune police sergeant spends his days mostly alone, locked in a maximum-security cell at New Jersey State Prison, the facility for the state's toughest inmates.
Evansville: A recently retired University of Southern Indiana professor already has a new job, as the state's newest poet laureate. The Indiana Arts Commission says Matthew Graham of Evansville began his two-year term as state poet laureate last week. He succeeds Adrian Matejka, an Indiana University professor. Graham's duties will include making public appearances at poetry readings or literary events and promoting poetry. Graham is the author of four books of poetry, including The Geography of Home, released in 2018. He's received a number of national, regional and local awards, including a Pushcart Prize, an Academy of American Poets Award and two grants from the Indiana Arts Commission. Graham co-founded and co-directed The Ropewalk Writers' Retreat in the historic southwestern Indiana town of New Harmony.
Seidle said he struggled to deal with stress at home. He said he should have been on medication, maybe an antidepressant or antianxiety drug. He should have moved away from the situation with his ex-wife.

Seattle: Mayor Jenny Durkan said Seattle will no longer use fossil fuels like natural gas to heat, cool and cook in new and substantially altered city-owned buildings and will come up with a plan by 2021 to transition all city-owned buildings to clean electric systems over time. Durkan included those directives in a Green New Deal executive order Wednesday. Neither the new KeyArena now under construction at Seattle Center nor the massive Seattle Aquarium expansion pavilion planned for construction starting next year will be covered by the city's new fossil-fuel ban, however, Durkan said. That's because the projects are underway, she said. Both city-owned structures will use a lot of energy. The $930 million new arena and 50,000-square-foot aquarium pavilion will initially be allowed to include some fossil-fuel infrastructure, though both will be included in the city's longer-term electrification plans, Durkan's office said. There's no deadline yet for all city buildings to be fossil-fuel free. Last year, the council passed a Green New Deal resolution that said Seattle would seek to eliminate climate pollutants in the city by 2030.
Although Mutko is no longer sports minister, he is still in overall charge of sports policy and the government's preparations for soccer's World Cup.
In evenly spaced, all-capitalized letters, Seidle wrote his life story on 27 yellow sheets of legal-size paper after being contacted by the Press in the summer to discuss his crime. The prison allows him to write with a flex pen – a crude ink tube with a rudimentary ballpoint used by inmates. The floppy writing tool is designed to not become a weapon in lockup.
Wilmington: An 18-year-old man has been charged with throwing an incendiary device at a Planned Parenthood location in the state, a federal prosecutor's office announced. Samuel James Gulick, of Middletown, was charged Monday in federal court. Security video recorded Gulick spray-painting the phrase Deus Vult, a Latin expression meaning God wills it, in red letters across the Newark building's exterior Friday, the U.S. attorney's release said. Gulick then stepped away, lit an object and threw it at the front window before running for cover. The object exploded, and a fire burned for a minute before going out, the court documents said. Gulick was arrested by the FBI on Saturday after investigators identified his car through the security video and found social media posts under his name containing the same phrase he scrawled on the building, as well as several anti-abortion messages.
Seidle lowered his gun. He placed it on the ground.
He never turned his back on me, she said. Ever.
Galveston: Remains found on a tiny South Pacific island where a bloody World War II battle happened have been identified as those of a missing Marine from Galveston, a federal agency said Wednesday. In a statement, the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency announced that the remains of 1st Lt. Justin G. Mills of Galveston, Texas, had been identified. The remains were found in 2015 on the island of Betio in the Tarawa Atoll of the Gilbert Islands. The remains were turned over to the DPAA laboratory for genetic identification. Mills had been missing since the November 1943 Battle for Tarawa, which left about 1,000 U.S. Marines and sailors dead and more than 2,000 more wounded from fighting that stretched over four days. The DPAA said Mills died on the battle's first day. Mills is to be buried April 29 at Arlington National Cemetery in Virginia.
At least three times, the Seidle drama reached as high as the Monmouth County Prosecutor's Office, the top law-enforcement agency in the county.
How Republicans decide to handle the Children's Health Insurance Program as part of the 2018 budget process this month will set a clear tone for the year. Not renewing this program serving 9 million children was one of their biggest blunders of 2017. Now they have a chance to pass a long-term renewal without any of last year's poison pills in the form of House proposals to cut Medicare and ACA coverage.
Killingly: The Killingly Board of Education voted to bring back a controversial Native American-themed athletic mascot. The board decided to reinstate the Redmen mascot at a meeting Wednesday, the Norwich Bulletin reported. In October, the same board approved the new Red Hawks mascot after it was overwhelmingly approved by students at Killingly High School. Several students, faculty members and local tribal representatives have criticized the original mascot as inappropriate, racist and stereotypical. It featured the profile of a Native American man wearing a headdress. Newly elected Republican members of the education board made a campaign promise to reverse the change. The board, with a Republican majority, held a public meeting on Dec. 11 where it voted to remove the Red Hawks mascot but tied on whether to return to the original mascot. More than a dozen people, including students and Native American representatives, spoke out against the decision to keep original mascot at the meeting. They also sought some other compromise, the Bulletin reported. At the Wednesday meeting, the board also voted to appoint a subcommittee that would update the high school logo so it doesn't portray Native Americans in a negative stereotype.
The prosecutor's detective explained that he would let Seidle speak to the children, but Seidle couldn't mention what he did to their mother.
Seidle helped Tamara with her treatment, feeding her, helping her in and out of bed, to the toilet and shower, taking her to surgeries and chemotherapy and radiation treatments, he wrote. Seidle was photographed standing with his family for the high school graduation of their eldest son, with Tamara wearing a head covering consistent with the hair loss that comes with cancer treatment.
In an undated final entry, Hanbury wrote: On June 16, Phil shot his ex-wife, fatal, and was arrested. There were no indications or signs of something like this to happen. He denied in sessions that he would do anything to jeopardize his being with the children, especially the younger ones.
Seidle wrote often about his children. He was there for each of the nine births, he wrote. He coached sports, chaperoned class trips and attended their parent-teacher conferences and religious sacraments. Seidle's younger half-brother provided photos of Seidle with his kids at a wrestling match, a soccer game, in an ice cream shop.
I had a few bumps the first couple years, he wrote of his career. I had a number of car accidents (minor), and fell and cut my eye open. I studied on and off the job hard to learn the law, and how to survive on the streets as a proactive officer. I earned a reputation for being very knowledgeable in the law, and for making good arrests.
Phoenix: The National Weather Service said there were seven confirmed tornadoes in Maricopa and Pinal counties last year, the most in nearly five decades. Meteorologists said last year's total is second only to the 10 confirmed tornadoes that hit the Phoenix metro area in 1972. They said all of the 2019 tornadoes were considered weak, ranking as either F0 or F1 in intensity. But in June 1972, an F2 tornado damaged about 200 homes in Paradise Valley and caused extensive damage to canals and power lines in Scottsdale and east Phoenix. The National Weather Service in Phoenix has data on tornadoes going back to 1950. Meteorologists said there were five confirmed tornadoes in the metro Phoenix area in both 1992 and 1993 with four tornadoes in 1971. Tornadoes are considered a rare event because the Phoenix area generally doesn't get the wind shear and unstable air mass needed to whip up the twisters.
Westport: Gov. Ned Lamont is scheduled to appear at a public meeting this weekend to discuss his proposed transportation plan, which could include highway tolls. The town hall-style meeting is planned for Sunday at a school in Westport, where the Democratic governor is expected to be joined by Transportation Commissioner Joseph Giulietti. It will be hosted by state Sen. Will Haskell and state Rep. Jonathan Steinberg, both Democrats. A transportation forum that originally was planned for Tuesday evening in Westport had been postponed. Improving our infrastructure is a top concern for my district. That's why I'm so excited to host Gov. Lamont and leaders from his administration to hear directly from my constituents at this town hall meeting, Haskell said.
Seidle said the fight over child custody hurt him deeply.
Hancock County: A huge component of a new rocket system was wheeled slowly from a New Orleans spacecraft factory on Wednesday to a barge that will float it up the Mississippi River for testing. The recently completed core stage of NASA's Space Launch System, which dwarfed the hundreds of NASA and Boeing employees, was to be taken to the Stennis Space Center in Hancock County, about 50 miles northeast of New Orleans. Space Launch System rockets are expected to take astronauts to the moon as part of NASA's Artemis program. The core stage – which measures 212 feet from end to end and more than 27 feet in diameter – was transported like a giant Carnival float from the Michoud Assembly Center in eastern New Orleans to the barge as workers took pictures. It will undergo tests at Stennis ahead of the first Artemis launch, planned for 2021, said Tony Castilleja, a systems engineer with the Boeing Space Team. The SLS core stage, with four huge engines, is the largest rocket stage NASA has assembled since the Apollo stages that first powered crewed missions to the Moon. It will be used for Artemis I, a test-flight without a crew. Artemis II is to send up a crewed spacecraft. The third mission, Artemis III, would put a man and woman on the south pole of the moon, with an eye toward a continued presence that would lead to a trip to Mars.
For years, Seidle had fought in court to get more time with his kids. The custody disputes with Tamara derailed his career. The thought that another man was moving into their lives triggered a breakdown.
In Asbury Park the year before the shooting, Seidle said he and Tamara got into a custody dispute at Our Lady of Mount Carmel, a church and school where Seidle would later confront Tamara the day she died.
The argument prompted an Asbury Park police response, according to Seidle. He provided a copy of a report showing a custody dispute at the school on the date Seidle claimed it happened, though the report doesn't name who was involved in the dispute. The city denied having access to the document.
West Palm Beach: Doctors told a woman she had a better chance of winning the lottery than of giving birth to two sets of twins in the same year. But Alexzandria Wolliston said she won the jackpot with the births of Mark and Malakhi in March and Kaylen and Kaleb in December. Oh, yes, I feel like I hit the twin lottery, Wolliston told WPTV. She said her 3-year-old daughter helped her prepare for the double dose of twins. Two months after the first set of twins arrived, Wolliston said she learned about the second set. They were born in West Palm Beach on Dec. 27. Wolliston said Kaleb was dismissed from the hospital on Monday and she's hoping to bring Kaylen home soon. She said she recently learned that both of her grandmothers lost twin boys at birth, which makes her believe her four babies are a blessing from above. I always say that I feel like my grandmothers gave me their kids because two sets of twins and their twins passed away, she said. I feel like they just sent them down for me.
I believe that God forgives us for all of our sins, especially when we ask him, he said. And I think that one day, you know, I will have the opportunity to tell Tamara, hopefully, how sorry I am for what I did to her.
New York City: Nearly 300 of the city's new subway cars were removed over concerns that the doors could open while the trains were in motion, The New York Times reported Wednesday. The 298 cars on the A, C, J and Z lines were supposed to replace subways that date to the 1960s. They were removed after two recent incidents signaled trouble, the Times reported, citing people who were told about the malfunctions. The Metropolitan Transportation Authority did not say what specific incidents led to removing the cars, but said no riders were injured, the newspaper reported. The new cars, known as R-179s, were purchased for $600 million under a contract between the authority and the Canadian manufacturing giant Bombardier. A Bombardier spokeswoman told the Times that the company's investigation of the cars showed that the doors had not been properly calibrated by a supplier, Nanjing Kangni Mechanical & Electrical of China. Transit workers complained that the new cars speedometer was hard to see, that the master controller used to drive the train was uncomfortable and the space between cars was too narrow for some workers to operate in. Riders also complained that new cars broke down much more often than older subway cars, the Times reported. An outside firm has been hired by the MTA to inspect the troubled cars.
DeSane left the scene to get Seidle's kids, sending a photo of them to another detective who remained at the scene. That detective slid his phone to Seidle.
These days, Seidle is locked alone in a prison cell. He is let out for a few hours each day to perform tasks as a runner, passing out juice and hot water to inmates, collecting their trash after dinner, picking up their laundry. He takes an antidepressant. He gets recreation time with other inmates, indoors, separated in individual cages with a port through which they can play cards or chess.
Yet Seidle returned to duty, armed and frustrated.
Is this guy living there? He asked.
Las Vegas:Lincoln County authorities have announced that a reward is being offered for information surrounding the starvation and death of a herd of cattle. The Lincoln County sheriff's office announced the $10,000 reward Monday after the herd of six were locked into a corral in rural south Nevada, officials said. Authorities believe at least one person intentionally isolated the herd in a coral where all but one cow starved to death. The herd was in the Tule Spring area about 30 miles north of Mesquite when weather made travel to the area difficult, Sheriff Kerry Lee said. The rancher who owns the cattle last saw them alive the first week of December before the weather cleared and he returned to his cattle, authorities said. The area is a popular location for hunters, authorities said. Anyone with information or trail camera footage of vehicles in the area is asked to contact the Lincoln County sheriff's office.
Over a period of two years, my performance suffered, and I received poor evaluations for what was described as poor decision making (lack of focus). On the evaluations they repeatedly indicated I was an outstanding officer with a good reputation, but my performance was suffering due to personal problems.
But he doesn't pass blame for the killing.
Seidle cut off the highway at Route 66 and drove to the church.
And his department knew about that dysfunction.
Monmouth County Prosecutor Chris Gramiccioni said the killing couldn't have been anticipated. He issued a report he touted as comprehensive and extensive. But that report excluded the Seidle divorce and police escorts during their custody dispute, a conflict that drove Seidle to kill.
Seidle and the children exchanged few words.

Despite trouble at home, Seidle worked his way up the police ranks eventually earning $140,000 a year as a sergeant. He was the breadwinner, providing his family with a 2,286-square-foot home with a large yard on a quiet cul-de-sac in a recently-developed subdivision.
Responding to a fender bender on the corner, Asbury Park Patrol Officer Ahmed Lawson followed the routine procedures, asking for driver's license, insurance and registration.
In every sport we have a lot of interesting young athletes with potential and we hope they can realize their potential, Mutko said. We'd like them to compete in equal conditions. We're trying to abstract them from all these political scandals, though it's extremely difficult because we see the date on the calendar and it's not clear if (a particular athlete) is going to the Olympics or not, because each of them needs to receive an invitation.
Chicago: O'Hare and Midway international airports have added boxes where travelers can dispose of recreational marijuana before they board their flights. The cannabis amnesty boxes, as they're called, were installed at each airport last week, just as legal marijuana sales began in Illinois. The boxes are located just past the airports' Transportation Security Administration checkpoints, the Chicago Tribune reported. Although police aren't targeting travelers with cannabis, and it's not illegal to have it at the airport, possessing is still illegal under federal law, and air space is regulated by the federal government, Chicago Police Department spokeswoman Maggie Huynh said. The boxes give people an opportunity to ensure that they're not breaking federal law and won't run into an issue when they land at their destination, she said. The boxes are owned by the Department of Aviation and serviced by the police. Police officers will regularly empty the boxes, file a report for the items inside and dispose of any surrendered marijuana like they would narcotics, Huynh said. Illinois residents can legally possess up to 30 grams of marijuana, or about an ounce, in Illinois and out-of-state residents can have half that.
Between the work issues and the domestic violence complaints and the 911 calls to his house, someone, someone has to take the responsibility and tying all that together and saying there's a significant concern, said Michael D'Angelo, a retired police captain who served 23 years in South Miami Police Department, including performing internal affairs duties, and now works as a consultant on civil cases involving police.
Seidle was suspended for two days in February 2012 because his department felt he interfered with the police response. Seidle said he was trying to make sure proper protocol was followed. Seidle was sent to a police psychologist. Seidle was deemed unfit for duty.
Prior to doing so, I took the six oldest (children) and spoke to them, telling them I was leaving because I was unhappy, and that their mom and I were not getting along, he wrote. I did nothing to embarrass either of us, and wanted to do nothing to make the children feel responsible, or be in the middle.
Officers begged Seidle to put the gun down, many calling to him by his first name.
Him and I were very close over the years, Seidle said. And I wanted to kill myself. But at that moment I just felt like I couldn't do it because him and I were very close and I didn't want to leave him with that memory.
Cutler, Long, White, nose tackle Eddie Goldman and linebackers Lamarr Houston and Danny Trevathan all wound up on IR. Other important players shuffled in and out of the lineup because of injuries.
The dispute over child custody led to more police calls to the Seidle home, departmental discipline for Seidle and rising tension between the Seidles.
I couldn't cope, he wrote. I couldn't sleep, I couldn't concentrate. I suffered from depression, anger, anxiety, high blood pressure. I was a mess. My emotional well-being spiraled out of control.
That particular phrase chaffed him. The term is unnecessary, Seidle wrote. It feels a bit like an attempt to disparage me.
This new year brings brings fresh choices and fresh controversies in health care. President Trump and Republicans tried last year to repeal the Affordable Care Act and, when that failed, to chip away at the law in other ways. But in the end, with no legislation passed, the principal result was to galvanize a once ambivalent public.
Seidle said he doesn't remember chasing Tamara's car through the streets of Asbury Park with his 7-year-old daughter in his passenger seat. He doesn't remember running Tamara's car off the road in front of bewildered residents. He doesn't remember firing 13 rounds at close range in two volleys two minutes apart.
Whose car is that in the driveway? He asked.
Jordan Howard broke Matt Forte's franchise rookie rushing record with 1,313 yards. Rookie Cody Whitehair looks as though he has a home at center.
Rumors have swirled for decades about the identity of the man killed in Chicago and buried in Crown Hill Cemetery. Efforts allegedly made by Dillinger to alter his appearance – including plastic surgery and burning off his fingerprints with acid – have led some historians and Dillinger enthusiasts to believe the body belonged to a doppelganger. Earlier this year, the FBI took the rare step of issuing a statement regarding the case, acknowledging the common myth that there was a Dillinger lookalike killed that night, but such claims have been advanced with only circumstantial evidence.
Seidle denied claims that he abused his ex-wife.
Charleston: The Department of Natural Resources says anglers should expect trout stocked in state waterways during the winter months to be smaller than usual. A long dry spell across the state from late summer through fall is thought to have affected the average catchable size of the fish, Jim Hedrick, the division's hatchery supervisor, told the Charleston Gazette-Mail. When the drought broke in October, the hatcheries' water supplies were replenished and allowed workers to begin feeding trout at the normal rate. But winter weather soon slowed the growth rate again, Hedrick said. The growth rate is expected to return to normal as the weather gets warmer, he said. The division is also adding feed to try to increase trout size. Hedrick said each of the 31 streams and 30 lakes designated for January stockings will receive as many pounds of fish as last year.
She texted him back: What do you want.
Columbus: Gov. Mike DeWine has asked the state's Medicaid official to look into what can be done in response to the recent increase in the number of children without health insurance. The governor's directive came after a recent report showed Ohio's uninsured rate for infants, toddlers and preschoolers is now the third-highest in the nation, with nearly 12,000 more children without coverage in 2018 than in 2016, the Columbus Dispatch reports. DeWine said he asked Medicaid Director Maureen Corcoran to see what steps that we can take to deal with this and to see if there is a way to make re-enrollment easier so that it is not a hurdle for those looking to get insured. The number of children without health insurance coverage climbed to 5% in 2018 from 3.6% in 2016, according to report released in December by the Georgetown University Center for Children and Families.
While the law enforcement response to this matter had its flaws in some regard, none of them caused the death of Tamara Seidle. Philip Seidle did, Gramiccioni said at his 2016 press conference. With hindsight being 20/20, the unfortunate reality is that no alternative or additional police action that could have prevented Seidle from brutally killing Tamara Seidle on that fateful day in Asbury Park. It's simply a crime of passion that could not be anticipated.
Kellogg:Shoshone County Sheriff Mike Gunderson told KHQ-TV that a third body buried under an avalanche at a resort was located Thursday by searchers in a helicopter. But that body has not yet been identified and authorities are not sure it is the person who was reported missing on Wednesday, Gunderson said. He said there were no other reports of missing persons on the mountain. The Silver Mountain Resort said it received a telephone call Wednesday morning from a concerned family member of the missing skier who was confirmed to be skiing there at the time of the avalanche. An avalanche happened at about 11 a.m. Tuesday on Wardner Peak, an area of the resort where the ski runs are rated at the highest difficulty level, according to resort officials. The runs had just been opened for a short period after crews performed avalanche control blasting in the area Tuesday morning, using explosives to trigger avalanches in hopes of leaving only the stable snow layers on the runs, officials said. Rescue crews and volunteers searched the avalanche area Tuesday with dogs and probes. The resort previously said five people had been recovered with minor injuries but said Wednesday afternoon that there were four people. Another skier was discovered Tuesday under about 10 feet of snow and did not survive. Yet another was found after dark. He was taken to a local hospital and pronounced dead. Experts said most avalanche survivors are dug out within 30 minutes. Names of the victims have not been released.
But after an ordeal that might draw couples closer together, the Seidles grew further apart.
And then came more calls to the police.
In the community, Seidle was known as an upstanding officer – respected by citizens, looked up to by colleagues, a loving father of nine.
When it was all over, I just felt like falling out, like collapsing, Seidle said. And I remember when he came, when he came into the street I just, I don't know, I fell into his arms.
Macungie: Mack Trucks plans to lay off 305 employees at its assembly plant north of Philadelphia, the company said Wednesday. Mack blamed the layoffs at its Lower Macungue Township plant on a downturn in the heavy-duty truck market. They will take effect at the end of February, The (Allentown) Morning Call reported. The cuts represent about 13% of the plant's payroll. We regret having to take this action, but we operate in a cyclical market, and after two years of extremely high volumes, we have to adapt to reduced market demand, said Mack spokesman Christopher Heffner. Employees, most of whom belong to the auto workers union, were informed of the news Wednesday. The cuts were expected after Mack said last month that it would need to slow production to cope with reduced demand. Mack expects the North American truck market to be down nearly 30% this year.
Topeka: Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly proposed Monday that the state give itself more breathing room in its budget by slashing annual payments to its pension system for teachers and government workers, offering a new version of a plan that the Republican-controlled Legislature spiked last year. Kelly's proposal would give the state an extra 10 years to close a long-term gap in funding for the state pension system. The move would free up tens of millions of dollars each year for more than a decade, money that could be used for schools and social services. But it's not clear if her new plan will fare any better than last year's proposal – which was dead from almost the moment she presented it to lawmakers. The Kansas Public Employee Retirement System projects Kelly's proposal would increase the cost of closing the gap by a total of $4.4 billion – comparing it to extending the length of a home mortgage.
Everything just went downhill from there, Seidle said. I just blacked out. Spiraled. My emotions were – I just got overloaded with the emotions.
Boston: The City Council swore in the most diverse group in its history Monday. The council made up more than half by women and people of color was ushered in by Mayor Martin Walsh during a ceremony at Faneuil Hall, the Boston Herald reports. The mayor swore in 13 members who included four new faces, which is an unusual amount of turnover for the council. Voters in November also elected the council's first Latina member, Julian Mejia, as well as district councilors Ricardo Arroyo, Kenzie Bok and Liz Breadon, the first openly gay woman to serve on the council. City Councilor Kim Janey will also make history as the third woman of color to serve as the body's president. The council was a white male bastion for decades, but Boston is now a majority minority city where whites comprise roughly 47% of the population.
The Bears have a big task ahead of them after finishing their worst season in decades last in the NFC North with a 3-13 record. They got shredded by injuries, suspensions and poor play overall.
Seidle shared his psychologist's notes that detail the emotional devastation he said he felt during the custody battle with his ex-wife. Both Seidle and his ex-wife filed for domestic violence restraining orders, alleging past abuse.
I grew impatient over the next couple years, and in the later part of 2004, I had an extramarital affair, Seidle wrote. It lasted three months. I ended it because I knew it was wrong, and did not want to continue to mislead my wife, and commit adultery.
She recalled that Seidle was distressed about not being with his children.
Allegations made by Philip and Tamara Seidle in the context of their divorce or any other civil actions were not a part of this analysis, as those fall outside the purview of any law enforcement agency and cannot be verified, the prosecutor's report stated.
Dallas: A contempt of court charge has been dropped against the Dallas County district attorney over a television interview he gave on the eve of a high-profile murder trial involving a police officer. Both sides filed a motion to drop the contempt charge against Dallas County District Attorney John Creuzot, who gave an interview before the start of former officer Amber Guyger's murder trial despite a gag order by Judge Tammy Kemp. The white officer was convicted of murder for the shooting death of her unarmed black neighbor, Botham Jean, inside his own apartment. Kemp said in an order that the interview, in which Creuzot explained why he thought Guyger was correctly charged with murder rather than manslaughter, was a direct violation of the gag order she'd issued in the case.
ACA fixes: If there's a way for Trump and the Republicans to score a win of sorts, it is simply by undoing some of the damage they did to the ACA in 2017. The administration stopped paying Cost-Sharing Reduction payments to insurers, designed to keep insurance affordable for low-income people, and repealed the individual mandate that encourages broad participation by both the healthy and the sick. Those steps collectively raise premiums by as much as 30% for families.
Seidle fired another volley of four shots through the front window two minutes after the first.
Her killing shocked those in the community who knew Seidle as a police officer, a father of a large family, a teacher of Catholic faith and a kids' soccer coach.
But there he was, arrested on a murder charge the week of Father's Day.
PROTECTING THE SHIELD: Read our investigative series
Ahead of last month's IOC decision to force Russians to compete under a neutral flag, some officials said that option would not be acceptable. However, no boycotts ... were ever considered, Mutko said Saturday.
For those issues, Seidle agreed that he would take a 30-day suspension, Hunt said in the deposition, spreading that time off over one week per month for six months. Seidle agreed that he'd keep seeing his psychologist and that his psychologist would report back to a township doctor.
Hunt described three issues with Seidle at work: one in which he screwed up with evidence, one in which he screwed up the readings on a breathalyzer test, causing the department to dismiss a DWI case, and the incident in which he argued with township police officers who responded to a custody dispute between him and Tamara.
Seidle, though, was suspicious of a car with Georgia plates in the driveway. He jotted down the license plate number. He assumed it was her boyfriend.
Seidle's chief acknowledged investigations uncovered major problems with Seidle, according to a court document.
Seidle hopes someday he can apologize directly to his children.
It didn't help that 19 players finished the season on injured reserve, including Cutler and guard Kyle Long. Jeffery and linebacker Jerrell Freeman also served four-game suspensions for violating the league's policy on performance-enhancing drugs.
He was placed in a chair and given a bottle of water. They led his children into the room in two groups.
The teen's employer called police, according to the prosecutor's office report. Police interviewed the children, who said they didn't want a relationship with Seidle, according to the report.
Police Chief Hunt took over in September 2014 from Chief Adams, who retired.
He didn't disclose in depth that he was having – it was kind of everyone knew he was having problems, Hunt said. He was close to certain officers in the police department, but he didn't come to me and say hey, Chief, I am having major league problems.
There were many good times, Seidle wrote. To most people on the outside, we had the perfect family, because we were always together. We did everything as a family…But the marriage was dysfunctional.
Albuquerque: The head of New Mexico's largest Catholic diocese has issued directives aimed at protecting parishioners during flu season. Santa Fe Archbishop John Wester cited the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, saying New Mexico is one of the states experiencing widespread flu outbreaks. He's urging people not to shake hands or hug when they attend Mass. Parishioners also are being asked not to hold hands while reciting the Our Father and those who are ill should stay home to avoid spreading the virus. Priests and other church officials also are being asked to wash their hands before and after distributing communion. Wester said the directives will be revoked when the situation improves. He said the archdiocese was instituting the directives not to limit expression of faith, but rather as a preventive measure against a widespread and potentially deadly disease.
The Seidles' multiple domestic disputes were handled by authorities as isolated incidents, not looked at as a continuing pattern, public police records show.
It added up to the Bears finishing with their highest loss total since 1969 and missing the playoffs for the ninth time in 10 years.
A reporter sought official copies of documents provided by Seidle and his half-brother, though many were denied by the government.
He said he does believe in an afterlife.
I'm tired of it! I'm tired of it! I got nine f------ kids she stole from me! Seidle ranted, all of it picked up on a police dash camera recording.
The Bears are 9-23 in two seasons under John Fox, and they just posted their lowest win total in a non-strike year since the 1973 team went 3-11.
More than three years before the shooting, Tamara filed for a domestic violence civil complaint and restraining order, court documents provided by Seidle show. She claimed Seidle put a gun to her cheek, gave her a black eye and kicked her stomach while pregnant. Seidle said in an interview those allegations were false. Tamara's quest for a restraining order was denied.
Seidle's SUV smashed into the rear of Tamara's black sedan, ramming it into another parked car.
In legal testimony, Hunt said he became aware of Seidle's issues before the shooting.
He informed me that there has been ongoing domestic incidents with the Seidles, and after a brief discussion on that, I assured the lieutenant that a report for harassment would be written documenting the incident, McEntegart wrote.
But there's less appetite for deep Medicaid cuts in the Senate and even less in the electorate. If Ryan is serious about reforming Medicaid, his best bet would be a bipartisan panel to recommend solutions that reduce long-term costs while improving care. I partnered with a Republican from the first Bush administration, Gail Wilensky, to propose such an approach last year. It would be a smart move now.

Maybe he and general manager Ryan Pace will provide more clarity on the status of defensive coordinator Vic Fangio and offensive coordinator Dowell Loggains when they meet with the media on Wednesday.
ACA repeal: Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C. still burns a candle for repealing and replacing the ACA. He and Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., last year proposed a system of block grants to states, with fewer strings attached to the money and fewer protections for sicker or older people.It didn't have the support to pass then.Should Congress take it up again, it will be sure to aggravate a very active and alert public in an election year. Perhaps more to the point, the Republican majority in the Senate is narrower than last year, and moderates and many conservatives aren't excited to live through the last year again.
Seidle was stern with Rittman when she got in trouble as a teenager, Rittman recalled. He was supportive of Rittman when she struggled later in life following the birth of her first son.
One complaint in 2004 claims Seidle threw a man on top of the police cruiser then punched him in the jaw and kicked him in the ribs. The second claims he hit a man on a bicycle with his police car then kneed and kicked him. The official outcomes of those complaints remain obscured by Neptune's denial of records. These complaints aren't mentioned in Gramiccioni's report.
He plans to make it there.
Louisville:A billboard calling on Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to vote to remove President Donald Trump from office is making its rounds in Louisville this week. Trump broke the law, according to the billboard, which includes McConnell's face. Senator McConnell, don't help him cover it up. Vote to convict & remove. The mobile billboard appears on a white van sponsored by four progressive organizations: Need to Impeach, Daily Kos, MoveOn and Public Citizen. Organizers said it will be parked along West Broadway through Saturday. It will make stops in front of McConnell's office and also go to Bishop Lane in front of Jefferson County Republican Headquarters. The four organizations are spending more than $400,000 on the billboard and ad campaign, according to a press release. McConnell has said he wants a quick trial that would have the Senate first hear arguments from the prosecution and defense before deciding if witnesses should be called – conditions Democrats oppose.
Madison: Republicans decided Tuesday to place only President Donald Trump's name on the state's primary ballot this spring, setting up obstacles for any long-shot candidates to challenge him in the state. A committee made up of Republicans and Democrats met with state election officials in the Capitol to decide which candidates will be placed on the April 7 primary ballot. The Republican committee members submitted only Trump's name; he was approved on a unanimous voice vote. The Democratic committee members submitted 14 candidates. The Republican move will make it more difficult but not impossible for other GOP hopefuls such as former Massachusetts Gov. Bill Weld and former Illinois Rep. Joe Walsh to get on the GOP primary ballot. They could still be included if they each collect 8,000 signatures by Jan. 28.

Local law enforcement – from fellow officers to the prosecutor's office – were long aware of problems in the Seidle household.
The morning of June 16, 2015, Seidle said he drove past the family's house. He had a few hours before he had to report to duty that day and he was going to take his girl to buy a dress for a father-daughter dance on Father's Day.
Russian athletes are appealing against certain conditions of eligibility, but no appeal has been filed by Russia against the central point of the IOC sanctions, banning the Russian team from competing with its own flag and anthem. Mutko said that was because he believed the Court of Arbitration for Sport would dismiss any appeal.
Two months before the shooting, Seidle filed a criminal complaint alleging that Tamara violated a judge's custody order by preventing Seidle's visits and phone calls, the court document shows.
The Press sued, saying the public deserves to see the documents to examine how Seidle's case was handled by police in the years leading up to the shooting.
Atlanta: The city's police chief has ordered a halt to all police car chases after crashes that killed or injured people. I don't want to see us cost someone their life in pursuit of an auto theft person or burglar when the courts aren't even going to hold them accountable. I mean, how can we justify that? Chief Erika Shields said at a news conference. Two men were killed last month in Atlanta when their car was hit by a stolen car evading authorities, police said. The chief said the order will stay in effect while she reviews a chase policy that has been in place since 2018. Changes might include allowing only highly trained officers to take part in chases, Shields said. I have not heard of any department totally restricting pursuits without some exception for extreme situations such as active shooters or terrorists, said Jack Rinchich, president of the National Association of Chiefs of Police in Titusville, Florida.
He was supposed to pick up their youngest daughter at the family home on Heritage Court but she didn't come outside. Tamara was already at work.
He remained off duty until May 2012.
Seidle said Tamara wanted to get back at him.
Mutko — who was sports minister at the time — has been banned from the Olympics for life along with 43 athletes, though he and all but one of the athletes have filed appeals.
It went wrong from day one, from the minute she was allowed to keep the children away from me, Seidle said. That's where it went wrong. It was just a continuum. There was a buildup and a buildup and a buildup… I love my children, my children were everything to me, they were my life. More than anything in the world I cared about my children and it was important for me to be a father to them. I wanted to be the father that I never had.
Boise: Gov. Brad Little says education funding will be his top priority for the state budget, continuing a theme from his just-completed first year in office. The 65-year-old Republican governor delivered his second State of the State address to lawmakers Monday in what is considered the kickoff to the legislative session. I am committed to working with you to invest in education, continue reducing regulatory burdens, and increase all Idahoans' prosperity and quality of life, Little declared. His budget limits general fund spending growth to 3.75%, a reduction from recent years. His budget leaves a surplus of $60 million and increases the state's rainy-day funds by $102 million as protection against a possible economic slowdown. The state spends about half its budget on K-12 education, or about $2 billion annually. Little's budget increases that by about 4%. In particular, Little is keen on increasing the reading ability of young students.
Signs of domestic problems in the Seidle home were long known to Seidle's colleagues, his supervisors, his chief, neighboring police departments, and the Monmouth County Prosecutor's Office, documents and interviews show.
Police reports show Neptune officers acted as escorts for two incidents involving the Seidles, including a custody dispute. Both Seidles and the Seidle children made note in publicly available legal filings of the practice of officers making escorts.

Wichita: An animal rescue group said an emaciated dog is recovering after he was found in a locked kennel that was thrown in a dumpster. The Wichita Animal Action League said in a Facebook post that the pit bull was found Wednesday at an apartment complex and taken to a veterinarian, where he is eating food as fast as it's put in front of him. He is around 2 years old and weighs just over 20 pounds, less than half the amount a dog of his size should weigh.The post described the dog as very sweet and loving. The group is asking for donations for his medical care. The post said the dog is dehydrated and will need slow, small meals over a long period of time because feeding him too quickly could be dangerous. It will likely be months before he is eligible for adoption. Wichita Officer Charley Davidson said an investigation is underway.
Seidle was born to unmarried parents in April 1964 in Philadelphia.
I carry the guilt every day of what I've done, the life I've taken, and the lives I've ruined, he wrote. I know I've written a lot about how I was wronged, and what I went through. I can sound like I'm trying to justify what I've done. That's not at all true. I want you to know I hate what I did. I am horrified and deeply saddened. It is reprehensible, and unjustifiable. I killed the woman who at one point I loved, and even though I hated what she did to me, I didn't hate her. I still cared for her as the person who I spent almost twenty-two years raising nine beautiful children with. Although our marriage failed, there were many good times.
As a lay person, it seems to me like an excessive amount, she said.
Philip Seidle hates being called a killer cop.
The township denied the Press access to the 682-page internal affairs report on Seidle on the grounds that it was a confidential employee record. Seidle's internal affairs history was not released in Gramiccioni's report.
It is true I killed and I was a police officer, Seidle wrote in an online message to the Asbury Park Press following a November court hearing in which a headline termed him a killer cop.
Chavarriaga told Tinton Falls police she suspected Tamara once flattened four tires on Chavarriaga's car because of who Chavarriaga was dating, according to a December 2011 report. But Tamara denied it and Chavarriaga later told police she wasn't sure who caused the damage.
Lawson can be seen in video ducking behind his patrol car, away from Seidle.
Reno: An Australian mining company has agreed to a moratorium on new activities at a planned lithium mine in the state in exchange for conservationists dropping a lawsuit to protect a rare desert wildflower they say doesn't exist anywhere else in the world. The Center for Biological Diversity filed notice in U.S. District Court in Las Vegas that it was voluntarily withdrawing its lawsuit against the Trump administration seeking a ban on all drilling and road building at the site on federal land as a result of the newly reached agreement with Ioneer USA Corp. The center filed an emergency petition with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in October to list Tiehm's buckwheat as an endangered species. The lawsuit filed weeks later accused the Bureau of Land Management of illegally dividing the mining operations into two separate projects so as to bypass its own regulations for any land disturbances larger than 5 acres.
Annapolis: A newspaper's review of state court records has found an apparent loophole that allows documents filed electronically to be kept from the public. The Capital reports court documents filed through the state's electronic record-keeping system can be made secret by attorneys, judges and clerks and their staffers without a court order or public notice. In contrast, attorneys who want a record kept secret must obtain an order from a judge when filing by paper. That process requires notice and an opportunity for any interested party to intervene. The newspaper reports it's unclear how many records have been so easily sealed across the state. In the case of the man accused of opening fire in the Annapolis newsroom in 2018, killing five employees, the newspaper learned through a public records request that almost 70% of the documents were designated confidential, keeping them from public view.
Mutko's position as deputy prime minister gives him oversight of all government sports policy in a country with a vast state-run system of sports academies and where most top coaches are government employees. However, he has taken a step back in recent months, leaving his posts as president of the Russian Football Union and chairman of the organizing committee for the World Cup.
He said he didn't expect to find her in the parking lot. When he saw her there, he thought they would talk, but she pulled away in her car.
I met Tamara in Oct. of '89 through a mutual friend of ours, with whom I'd been stationed with onboard both (U.S.S) Nitro and the Philly commissary. We talked on the phone for several months and began dating in February of 1990. She became pregnant in April 1990…
Des Moines:It will cost more to attend the Iowa State Fair this year. Gate prices for adults will rise to $14 from $12 last year, and tickets for children ages 6 to 11 will increase to $8 from $6, the fair announced Wednesday. Advance purchase prices are going up a dollar: to $9 for adults and $5 for children ages 6 to 11. Children 5 and under still will get in free. Building and security improvements, roads and entertainment are driving the increases, said the fair's marketing director, Mindy Williamson. There will be ticket discounts on some days for certain groups, including veterans on Aug. 17 and Older Iowans Day on Aug. 19. The fair runs Aug. 13-23 this year.
Seidle said he was called into Hunt's office to talk about the incident and that the chief told Seidle his daughter accused Seidle of harassing her at her job. Seidle felt the kids had been put up to this by Tamara.
In addition to denying the hundreds of pages of Seidle's internal affairs history, Neptune also denied access to 15 police reports naming Seidle, including 11 which also name Tamara, saying they are criminal investigatory reports. The purported criminal investigations were dated within the last four years of Seidle's career. Seven of the police reports correspond with short incident reports the township did provide which indicate the obscured documents relate to custody disputes.
Midland: It's not what the Egyptians had in mind, but it worked: A group of high school students made a pyramid out of toilet paper – 27,434 rolls. It took 16 hours for students to assemble the pyramid at Bullock Creek High School in Midland County. They are hoping to be recognized by the Guinness Book of World Records and sell the toilet paper as a fundraiser for the 20-member robotics team. There was a lot of excitement when we got to the last few layers, but the final roll at the top was actually pretty anti-climactic, Maxton Herst told MLive.com. Every single roll you place, you want it to be in the correct spot. It was just kind of mind-numbing work. Herst got the idea three years ago after seeing a similar pyramid on YouTube. The students built the pyramid during holiday break. Rolls of the two-ply toilet paper have since been placed into 96-count boxes for purchase.
He returned and the department gave him back his .40 Glock.
I never, you know, was written up or had any incidents where I abused my authority or where I used excessive force against someone, Seidle said generally about his discipline. I never was punished for anything like that.
Hunt said in the deposition: Just through our investigations into this and internal affair investigation is where we learned what the major problems were.
Tamara did not become a victim until I killed her that day, he wrote.
Seidle mentored Chavarriaga's daughter, Samantha Rittman, who is now 24 and living in Virginia Beach.
He does get emotional when he talks about his lack of contact with the children because Tammy makes it difficult, Hanbury wrote in an entry dated March 28, 2012.

Chapel Hill: The University of North Carolina Board of Governors violated the state's open meetings laws by secretly negotiating and approving a deal to dispose of a Confederate monument from the campus of the system's flagship school, according to a lawsuit filed by a student newspaper. DTH Media Corp., which publishes The Daily Tar Heel student newspaper on the UNC-Chapel Hill campus, wants a court to void two agreements between the Board of Governors and the state chapter of the Sons of Confederate Veterans, news outlets reported on Wednesday. The deal has been denounced by students and faculty members as paying money to support white nationalism. UNC-Chapel Hill lost a $1.5 million research grant because of it. Superior Court Judge Allen Baddour said last month that he is reconsidering his approval of the deal. Baddour approved an agreement on Nov. 27 in which the SCV agreed to take ownership of the Silent Sam statue and build a center to preserve it. The statue stood for more than a century on the Chapel Hill campus before protesters took it down in August 2018. The university agreed to put $2.5 million into a trust to help defray the costs of the new center. In addition, UNC-Chapel Hill paid the SCV about $75,000 not to display Confederate flags or similar banners on any UNC system campus during any meetings or demonstrations for five years.
I just feel like what he did was selfish, she said.
Seidle was honorably discharged from the Navy and hired by Neptune Township Police Department in July 1993.
Congress should pass a permanent program allowing insurance companies to buy reinsurance to offset the risk of their most expensive cases. That would reverse some of that damage and decrease rates across the country, according to an analysis by Oliver Wyman. This would be a smart political move as these premium decreases would come out right before the election. You can imagine Trump's tweets on how he's fixed things. No matter that he would be only partially fixing what he just broke.
Lincoln: The City Council is cracking down on illegal dumping at recycling collection sites. The council voted unanimously Monday to make it illegal to put recyclables anywhere but in the proper containers at the 19 collection sites available to residents. The new ordinance also bans dumping at the sites or in the recycling containers anything that can't be recycled. People have left garbage and other objects at the sites, including hot tubs, tires, beds, televisions, wood pallets and pianos – all items that can't be recycled. Cleaning up the resulting messes fell to the businesses hosting the sites, Lincoln transportation and utilities assistant director of utilities Donna Garden told the council last month. The ordinance also applies to recycling processing centers, salvage operations and commercial composting operations. Violators face fines of up to $500 for the misdemeanor offense.
Montgomery: A judge on Tuesday set a final hearing in a lawsuit over control of the Alabama Democratic Party. Montgomery Circuit Judge Greg Griffin scheduled the hearing for Jan. 30. The hearing could signal that a resolution is on the way in the legal dispute over who is party chair. Longtime state party leader Nancy Worley had filed the lawsuit to block state Rep. Chris England from taking control as party chair. A revamped governing board of the party elected England as chair this fall, but Worley and her supporters maintained his election was illegitimate. The ongoing feud has pitted longtime party leaders, such as Worley and Joe Reed, against an upstart faction. The Democratic National Committee supports England and recognizes him as state chair. Barry Ragsdale, an attorney representing the defendants in Worley's suit, said last month that England is functioning as party chair.
Oklahoma City: The Oklahoma Corporation Commission said it has approved a plan for an additional area code for 19 central Oklahoma counties in the 405 area, including Oklahoma County and Oklahoma City. The commission said the North American Numbering Plan Administrator will announce the new area code later this month and it will be available in July. Starting in January 2021, callers will have to dial 10 digits that include the area code plus the seven-digit number. Commission spokesman Matt Skinner said existing phone numbers will not be affected or changed, but callers will have to dial all 10 digits to make a phone call. The area code overlay is similar to one adopted in 2011, when the 539 code was added in the 918 area code region that includes Tulsa. The commission said the additional area code is needed because the administrator has determined that the 405 area code will run out of available numbers in December 2021.
I've got to go, Tamara replied, he said. She told Seidle that one of their children would have a father with or without you.
Town: A man from Illinois drove through Wisconsin last week with a snowmobile strapped to the roof of his car, creating a bit of a stir. Tommy Mecher, an electrician apprentice from Chicago, said he could not afford to get a trailer and pay for the extra gas to tow his snowmobile up north. I only burned $10 more in gas on a 430-mile trip, Mecher said. I put it on the roof in Lemont, Illinois, where the snowmobile was and drove it up to Bessemer, Michigan. Snowmobiling can be an expensive pastime. There's the expensive machine, helmet and cold-weather clothing, the cost to travel to a spot with enough snow and the expenses of a weekend of roaring across groomed trails. But Mecher purchased the 1990 Polaris Indy 500 snowmobile a few weeks ago, made a few minor repairs to get it running and left for his father's house in Bessemer last Friday. Mecher said It took about an hour to load the snowmobile on the roof of his 2005 Chevy Malibu, using an old blue Ford tractor with a bucket. He modified the end of the snowmobile to keep the machine's track from caving in the roof or breaking the rear window. Mecher made a support rack of boards to shift the snowmobile's weight to the sides of the roof, away from the middle. He secured his sled with several straps that he looped through the open rear doors before tightening them and closing the doors.
Seidle was cleared by a psychologist after an evaluation in August 2014.
Once he exited the vehicle, he began shooting, Lawson told investigators.
Tamara filed for divorce in June 2013, claiming abuse. Seidle denied those claims in court and interviews.
Tamara sought sole custody of the children. At the time, six were younger than 18. Seidle was ordered in October 2013 to pay $3,000 in alimony and $2,606 in child support each month, based on earnings in 2012 worth $11,930 before taxes, according to a court document.
The Bears' all-time leading passer, Cutler has no guaranteed money left on the seven-year contract extension he signed in 2014. At 33, he was limited to five games because of a thumb injury and then a torn right labrum that led to him being placed on injured reserve.
Somewhere in here, there just reads of a complete – I don't know if it was a conscious decision – but just a complete disregard for her well-being, D'Angelo said. You investigated your officer several times. If you think that your obligation has ended when you complete that investigation and dish out whatever punishment that the higher ups have deemed fair to him, I mean, when there's domestic violence, the department knows that their obligation hasn't ended.
Olympia: The state Supreme Court on Monday swore in a new chief justice, as well as its first-ever Native American justice. The Spokesman-Review reports Justice Debra Stephens became the court's 57th chief justice. A former Appeals Court judge and adjunct professor of law at Gonzaga University, she called it the greatest privilege I can imagine. Raquel Montoya-Lewis, a former Whatcom County Superior Court judge who is a member of the Pueblo Iselta tribe of New Mexico, was sworn in at the same ceremony. Montoya-Lewis is the first Native American to serve on Washington's highest court and only the second to serve on any state supreme court in the nation. Stephens called it a historic day. Gov. Jay Inslee said Monday was a day when a daughter of Spokane ascends to chief justice, and the court gets Lewis-Montoya, a judicial superstar who is a good listener, decisive, caring and compassionate.
New Orleans: John White, who helped strengthen the role of charter schools, backed a taxpayer-funded tuition voucher program for private schools and oversaw overhauls of the state's school accountability efforts, said he is stepping down as Louisiana's education superintendent. He told state Board of Elementary and Secondary Education members in a letter that he will leave the job March 11. He did not state his reasons. The board said a search for his replacement would begin immediately and the process will be discussed at an upcoming meeting. White can point to numerous improvements made during his eight years as education chief, including improved graduation rates and better performance on college preparation tests. His tenure was also marked by a rocky relationship with teacher unions and Gov. John Bel Edwards. And the state continues to lag others in nationwide education rankings. Still, his departure comes as his job seemed secure, following the election last year of a slate of state education board members who were backed by the state's business lobby, which was supportive of White. Although he didn't discuss his future, The Advocate reported in April that he had quietly co-founded a national nonprofit group, Propel America, aimed at connecting low-income high school graduates with solid jobs. White has been education superintendent since 2012 but he had been working on a month-to-month basis since 2016. Although he had the support of a majority of the 11-member state Board of Elementary and Secondary Education, he lacked the two-thirds majority needed to get a new contract.
Even Seidle acknowledged the repeated calls should have warranted further scrutiny, though he contends that his ex-wife was lying to the police.
Six days later, Neptune Township police responded to a confrontation at the Seidle home. Seidle said he showed up to get a training document, the prosecutor's report shows the couple got into an argument. When police arrived, Tamara made allegations of past abuse similar to claims she would make when she filed for divorce and for a restraining order. Seidle said these were lies.

Providence: Nonprofits in the state have been awarded grants totaling nearly $300,000 for outreach to boost participation in the 2020 census. The Rhode Island Foundation announced the grants Monday from the Rhode Island Census 2020 Fund, a statewide, collaborative funding initiative. The goal is to protect the $3.8 billion a year Rhode Island receives in federal funding for education, health care, transportation and housing based on census data, the foundation said. Twenty-six organizations received funding for programs to reach hard-to-count communities, including the Alliance of Rhode Island Southeast Asians for Education in Providence, Progreso Latino in Central Falls, and Meals on Wheels in Providence. Nonprofits, municipalities, houses of worship, and public agencies including libraries and schools can apply for grants in the second round of funding.
Washington: The viral art phenomenon known as Infinity Mirrors is returning to the Hirshhorn Museum on April 4. The Hirshhorn announced Monday that a mini exhibit of Yayoi Kusama's work, One with Eternity: Yayoi Kusama in the Hirshhorn Collection, will be on display through Sept. 20, WUSA-TV reports. The exhibit includes two Infinity Mirror rooms, including Kusama's 1965 installation Phalli's Field and a new room that will be announced soon. An early painting, photographs of Kusama and the 1964 sculpture Flower Overcoat will also be part of One with Eternity. The Japanese artist has created more than 20 of the mesmeric mirror rooms, allowing visitors to physically partake in the infinite repetition for which her paintings are known.
GETTING HEALTHY: The Bears might need to determine if the organization can do anything to prevent another rash of injuries.
When Seidle was sentenced to 30 years in prison after pleading guilty to aggravated manslaughter, their eldest daughter described Tamara as the soul and the light of their family.
Dana Point: A baby gray whale heading south with its mother was spotted swimming alongside dolphins and sea lions off the Southern California coast. Crew members on a whale-watching boat recorded video of the pair in about 100 feet of water near Salt Creek Beach in Dana Point on Tuesday. Capt. Frank Brennan aboard Dana Wharf's Ocean Adventure estimated that the calf was just a day or so old. You could still see the fetal folds on it behind the blowhole, he said of the young whale. Brennan told the Orange County Register he followed the pair as white-sided dolphins stopped feeding to check the whales out. The dolphins and whales were then joined by a group of sea lions. The whales are migrating to the lagoons of Baja, Mexico.
He wrote that he felt his father abandoned the family.
Serious proposals from both sides should be listened to. Republican ideas for more flexibility, more innovation and the role of personal responsibility have a place in any debate about how to improve health care. Democrats want to address drug costs. But instead of considering those ideas, the 2017 dividing line was over cuts —specifically, cutting Medicaid and the ACA to pay for corporate and personal tax cuts.
Seidle said he drove up Route 18 in his silver Honda Pilot, heading toward Monmouth Mall.
In the government now, the president and prime minister, they've decided that I will continue to do all of this and finish this project, Mutko said. So we're doing it and everything will be at a high organizational level. I'm absolutely sure.
Seidle left his home with his 7-year-old daughter and his gun belt. The off-duty 6-foot-4, 230-pound police sergeant was dressed in a peach polo shirt, navy shorts and brown sandals on the sunny day. He wore a Bluetooth earpiece.
The Russian government insists it never supported dopers or covered up for them. Mutko painted WADA's star witness, former Moscow and Sochi laboratory director Grigory Rodchenkov, as untrustworthy and erratic, and said the Russian government wasn't responsible for any malpractice in the state-funded Sochi drug-testing lab during the Olympics. Instead, he laid the blame at the feet of the IOC and WADA.
Charleston: The Citadel is evaluating the college's existing buildings, infrastructure and landscapes to create a long-term plan that will guide future building projects and campus renovations. The campus master plan will create a vision of what the public military college could look like 15 years from now, The Post and Courier reports. Once we have a plan in place, it will guide all of our facility decisions going forward, said Jeff Lamberson, vice president of facilities and engineering. The college finalized a $450,000 contract with Ayers Saint Gross, an architectural design firm spearheading the project, in October. College officials have talked with hundreds of students, faculty and staff in more than 35 focus-group meetings.

Denver: Wildlife officials have discovered evidence of wolves living in northwestern Colorado after hunters reported a suspected pack and residents found a scavenged elk carcass. The Colorado Parks and Wildlife Department announced the discoveries Wednesday, suggesting a pack of gray wolves might be residing in the state, The Denver Post reported. The news was first reported Tuesday by the Craig Press. The hunters provided a video shot in October of two wolves shown near the Wyoming and Utah borders, officials said. It was the first time in a few years multiple wolves were seen traveling together in Colorado, officials said. The announcement comes days after state election officials placed a measure to reintroduce wolves on this year's ballot, officials said. The ballot will ask voters whether to require state wildlife commissioners to reintroduce gray wolves by the end of 2023 on public land in western Colorado, officials said. State wildlife officials have studied the possibility of reintroducing wolves in Colorado and decided to oppose such efforts, officials said. Local leaders in 23 counties have also opposed reintroduction.
'But they're gone,' the psychologist wrote, apparently quoting Seidle. 'I need to focus on the children.'
She was pronounced dead minutes later at Jersey Shore University Medical Center.
Seidle said his colleagues knew of his troubles.
Columbia: Gov. Henry McMaster wants to expand full-day pre-kindergarten for low-income 4-year-olds to every school district across the state. The program was created in 2006 in response to a lawsuit by poorer, more rural school districts and didn't cover all the districts in the state. McMaster's $53 million proposal would expand the 4K program to the remaining 17 districts. Several are among South Carolina's largest districts, including Beaufort, Charleston, Greenville and Richland District 2, according to The Post and Courier of Charleston. McMaster told the newspaper the expansion of the 4K program is crucial to his efforts to improve education to keep economic development humming in South Carolina. Several senators and House members praised the Republican governor's proposal. Democratic Sen. Vincent Sheheen of Camden has been pushing for universal pre-kindergarten for years and said it can only improve education across all grades.
Born in Munich, West Germany, Tamara Wilson-Seidle often reminisced about milking cows and wearing traditional dirndl dresses as a child, her obituary said. She was a cheerleader and Neptune High School homecoming queen in 1982. She coached soccer. She was a devout Catholic, serving as director of religious education for the Mother of Mercy Parish.
Hanbury wrote in May 2014 that Seidle's issues with Tamara, the children and the divorce appeared to be affecting the officer's performance at work. Hanbury shared findings with another psychologist, who worked for Seidle's department, according to legal testimony from current Neptune Police Chief James Hunt.
Manchester: Monks at a Catholic college faced off in court Monday against the school's board of trustees in a dispute over an effort to limit the the monks' power – a move some worry could lead to increased secularization. A judge heard motions in Hillsborough Superior Court related to a lawsuit filed against the Saint Anselm College board last year. The unusual clash was set in motion when the board moved to take away the monks' ability to amend the school's bylaws. Michael Tierney, representing the monks, said the school's charter dictated that they retain the power to amend laws governing the school. The school was set up and run by Benedictine monks for 130 years. The board has argued that it has the authority under state law on nonprofit organizations to amend the bylaws. It argues the move is necessary to ensure it has the required independence for reaccreditation.
New Orleans: Residents who had real Christmas trees to celebrate the holidays are being asked to help the state's fisheries. Jefferson Parish is seeking volunteers to help with its annual Christmas tree recycling program. It's the parish's 30th year doing the project. Volunteers, especially people with shallow draft boats, are needed Feb. 1 to help move the trees out to Goose Bayou, according to Seamus Riley with the parish's Coastal Management Department. The staging area is at Cochiara's Marina in Lafitte and begins at 9 a.m. The parish collects trees from residents and uses them to protect Louisiana's coastline. The trees are used to build wave-reducing fences and to fill in man-made canals, The Times-Picayune/The New Orleans Advocate reports. In 2019, more than 6,000 Christmas trees were collected in Orleans Parish and airlifted by the Louisiana National Guard into the Bayou Sauvage National Wildlife Refuge.
Seidle was taken to the Monmouth County Jail a few miles away in Freehold. His clothing, his photograph and his fingerprints were taken. It was a process the veteran cop had performed on detainees many times, but now Seidle was on the other side. Besides training at the police academy, he said that was the only day he had been in handcuffs.
Salem: Lagging snowfall early in the season could mean a tough, dry summer for farmers and ranchers around the state. The U.S. Department of Agriculture Resources Conservation Service says the amount of water from snow that's fallen in Oregon right now is just 45% of normal statewide, the Capitol Press reports. Water from melting snow is crucial for replenishing streams and reservoirs for farms and fish, particularly in eastern Oregon where the climate is drier. Every water basin is measuring below average for snow except for the Owyhee Basin in southeastern Oregon, which stands at 117% of normal. The lowest totals are in the Hood, Sandy and Lower Deschutes basins at 25% of normal and the Willamette Basin at 26%. The water year, as defined by hydrologists, begins Oct. 1 and runs through Sept. 30 of the following calendar year.
Seidle's department grew concerned enough to confiscate his service weapon in 2012 and again in 2014. His .40-caliber Glock, though, was returned to him. It was the weapon he used to gun down Tamara.

Louisville: The Kentucky Humane Society had its largest adoption year on record with about 6,902 animal adoptions in 2019. The Humane Society said it was the first year that cat adoptions outnumbered dogs. In total, 3,424 cats found new homes compared to 3,398 dogs. Adoption officials said cat adoptions have been increasing over the past few years. Humane Society spokeswoman Andrea Blair said cats are popular with seniors, busy families, renters and people who travel for work. Blair said 1,583 cat adoptions took place at Purrfect Day Café, which opened in August 2018. The cafe serves coffee, snacks and cocktails while patrons interact with adoptable kittens and cats. Total adoptions were up 816 from 2018.
Problems persisted, and worsened, Seidle wrote.
Sending me to counseling was stitching up a wound week to week, to have her rip it open every time, Seidle wrote. I would go to counseling to talk about what she did, and how it upset me, to leave the sessions and have her do the same thing through to the next session. So where was the healing to take place? Tell me? Every day I missed being a part of my children's lives was a day neither her, nor anyone else could give me back. There was no amount of money, or anything else she could compensate me with for the loss of that time. Missing my son's first communion, because she couldn't have the courtesy to tell me, because she couldn't swallow her gall, couldn't ever be gotten back. Having people constantly tell me about events my children participated in, that I missed simply for her inability to be civil, or of accomplishments they had, that she wouldn't tell me about for her spite, couldn't in a lifetime be made up for. My children would never be able to say, 'my dad was always there.' Not because I left, but for her malice.
Jackson: Foul weather has postponed plans to kill nonnative mountain goats in Grand Teton National Park. Park officials closed a large area of the Teton Range to the public this week so that hunters could shoot goats by helicopter without endangering people on the ground. Park officials now say snow and poor visibility are postponing those plans. Grand Teton spokeswoman Denise Germann said another attempt could take place in late January or early February. Mountain goats aren't native to the park and biologists worry the 100 or more goats could spread disease to native bighorn sheep. The National Park Service has contracted Oregon-based Baker Aircraft to shoot goats with nonlead shotgun or rifle rounds, the Jackson Hole News & Guide reported. Wintry weather kept Baker from making it to the area, Germann said. Park officials also plan to use volunteer hunters on the ground.
Montpelier: A bakery is hosting a raffle to find the lucky person who gets to tear down a gingerbread village. In a first for Birchgrove Baking, the sweet treat establishment is selling customers tickets for the chance to win the right to destroy the village. Initially, after the holiday season was over, the bakery struggled to find a creative way to raze its gingerbread village. Birchgrove co-owner John Belding says the owners have in the past resorted to destroying it themselves, getting out their own tension from the hectic year. Sales from this year's raffle will go toward the Central Vermont Humane Society, an ongoing collaborator with Birchgrove Baking. Winners will be announced Friday.
Seidle said department supervisors knew of his problems.
The sharp drop in lightning deaths over the past 75 years  coincides with a shift in population from rural to urban regions, wrote meteorologist Ronald Holle in an article in the Journal of Applied Meteorology.
Jackson: Prisoner advocates are calling on the federal government to investigate the state's prison system for possible civil rights violations, saying the violence of recent days highlights deliberate violations of inmates' constitutional right to be free from cruel and unusual punishment. The Southern Poverty Law Center and other groups said they were sending the letter Tuesday to the U.S. Department of Justice. The letter warns that it is no exaggeration to say more lives will be lost absent immediate intervention. U.S. Rep Bennie Thompson, Mississippi's only Democrat in Congress, called Sunday for a federal investigation after inmates were killed by fellow prisoners across three prisons and an unknown number of inmates were injured in disturbances. Mississippi prison officials, who called in state troopers and a special team of prison guards from Tennessee to help regain control of the situation, have said four of the deaths are related to violence between gangs.
Seidle considered a separation in 2006, he wrote, but Tamara was opposed to it. Neptune police came to their home in March that year for a verbal dispute, according to the prosecutor's report.
The prosecutor's report acknowledged the incident in which Seidle argued with officers, and his suspension, but didn't mention the issue Seidle had with evidence or the botched DWI case.
I'm tired of being intimidated and threatened by my wife every time we have a disagreement or something goes on between the kids, he recalled telling the chief.
Medicaid cuts: Republicans failed in their attempts to cut health spending last year in various repeal bills, but that didn't stop them from going ahead with the sizable tax cuts the repeal was intended to fund. That created a $1 trillion-plus IOU. Now House Speaker Paul Ryan wants to pay it off — arguing that with less revenue coming in, it's even more important to cut spending on Medicaid and Medicare.
Then again, the Bears have no logical long-term replacement on the roster. That's an issue they need to address, whether they keep Cutler or bring in another veteran.

Williston: A proposed gas plant could help reduce wasteful flaring in the northern region of the Bakken oil patch. Outrigger Energy of Denver wants to build a plant in Williams County west of Williston capable of processing up to 450 million cubic feet of gas per day. Crude oil prices surpassing $50 per barrel have attracted the company to oil drilling in the Bakken, according to CEO Dave Keanini. The company also plans to build a 70-mile gathering pipeline that starts in eastern Williams County and ends at the processing plant, according to the Bismarck Tribune. It has entered into an agreement with XTO Energy to transport gas from the producer's wells. The Outrigger processing plant is the sixth facility of its kind in the works in North Dakota. Officials hope the investments will significantly curb the amount of excess gas that is flared in the state.
So, he said he was retiring.
In addition to better lightning safety awareness and medical advances, all phones were corded decades ago, leading to quite a few deaths due to people speaking on the phone. Additionally, there has been better lightning protection, suppression and grounding in electrical and phone lines, he said.
Officers told Seidle if he dropped the gun he would get to see his kids.
Charleston: The U.S. Labor Department awarded $866,675 for flood recovery in West Virginia, the state's U.S. senators announced. The funding is through the Disaster Recovery National Dislocated Worker Grant Program. Flooding in February 2018 destroyed homes, displaced residents from jobs and caused more than $22 million in public infrastructure damage, U.S. Sen. Joe Manchin said in a news release. Sen. Shelley Moore Capito said the grant will provide Workforce West Virginia with assistance to rebuild.
Salt Lake City: The state Department of Transportation has started making safety improvements near a homeless resource center where cars killed three men, officials said. The department has installed electronic message signs to urge drivers to be cautious and alert for pedestrians near the South Salt Lake center, The Salt Lake Tribune reports. Salt Lake City leaders called for immediate pedestrian safety improvements after three men were fatally struck while trying to cross the street near the center. Police believe all three men were homeless and seeking shelter at the center. Four crashes, including those involving the fatalities, have occurred in the area since the November opening of the 300-bed men's resource center, police said.
Three people lingered on their home porch on Sewall Avenue in Asbury Park. A worker ate a sandwich in his nearby car. An employee at a plumbing supply company down the street retrieved tools from a truck.
