{"original": "Salem: An anti-mask rally is planned for Saturday outside the WinCo Foods store in south Salem after an employee allegedly denied service to a customer who refused to wear a mask. WinCo stores, like many businesses, have adopted a policy requiring customers and employees to wear masks inside the store. Their policy allows for some medical exemptions. It is unclear whether a video of the incident – titled Senior Citizen Denied Food at WinCo Grocery Store for Not Bowing to the Mask Police – is connected to a string of videos showing people entering businesses in Oregon and refusing to put on masks while filming employees. The video was posted on YouTube and Parler, a microblogging website favored by conspiracy theorists, right-wing extremists and those fleeing what they claim is censorship on other social media sites. The rally, set to take place outside the store at 1 p.m. Saturday, comes in the wake of a string of right-wing protests that have resulted in violence, arrests and property damage in Salem.", "augmented": []}

The Republican governor said he will issue an executive order requiring facilities to allocate their doses the week they are received and have local health departments manage distribution, with an expectation of administering 50,000 doses a week. This virus does not sleep, Cox said at his first COVID-19 media briefing as governor. This virus does not take weekends off. And neither should we. The state's 50,000 teachers and in-person school staff will be eligible to receive the vaccine as of Monday, Cox said. School districts will be expected to prioritize people over 65 or with underlying health conditions. Republican state leaders have been pushing the online-only Salt Lake City school district to return to in-person learning. Following the governor's announcement, Senate President Stuart Adams called on the district to stop making excuses and open in-person learning immediately now that vaccines will be available.

That means there are more places where water can bubble up to the surface from warm, sulfate-rich springs. When it hits the cold air, a mineral called Glauber's salt, or mirabilite, separates out. The tiny crystals have built up over the past several months, eventually creating flat terraces stacked atop one another like the travertine rimstone and dam terraces at Yellowstone's Mammoth Hot Springs.

If you work in mental health, it is pretty clear there is a lot of overlap in the symptoms of someone who is using opiates and someone who may be suicidal, Nestadt said. State health officials say roughly 630 Utahns die from suicide and about 4,570 attempt suicide every year.

The Louisiana Department of Health quickly reworked the website to get the list back online.

Workers such as those in public transit, grocery stores and agriculture would add 115,000. Group home residents and inmates would add 100,000.

The governor warned that the supply of vaccines available to people other than health care workers and nursing home patients would be very limited at first. New York has used roughly half of the 900,000 doses received so far, but Cuomo claimed it hasn't received nearly enough to vaccinate all health care workers. Cuomo said a beefed-up statewide distribution network will include more than 1,000 pharmacies, doctors' networks and county health departments. The 3.2 million New Yorkers newly eligible for the vaccine under the 1B designation include teachers, first responders, firefighters, public transit workers and police. There are 1.4 million people 75 or older who will be eligible. Caution, caution, caution, because the supply is a major problem, Cuomo said. You'll wind up having 3,000 distribution points in a couple of weeks, but none of them will have nearly enough vaccine.", "augmented": []}

The Alternate Care Site in Austin was initially established during a summer surge of the coronavirus but has not yet taken patients, according to a statement from the Austin-Travis County Health Authority.

The site is for patients who do not need high-level or intensive care, according to the statement. Patients needing that level of care will remain at hospitals. The seven-day rolling average of new cases in Texas has risen from 14,553.7 per day Dec. 25 to 20,396.8, according to data from Johns Hopkins University, and the average positivity increased from 14.18% to 20.88%.", "augmented": []}

Farmers with quarantined fields aren't allowed to sell potatoes grown in them. Nematodes feed on potato roots and can reduce crop production by 80%.

{"original": "South Whitley: A northern Indiana dam that was the scene of a deadly 2017 kayaking accident has been demolished, making the region's Eel River safer for recreation and removing a barrier to migrating fish. A crew that began demolishing the Collamer Dam on Wednesday finished removing the last of the concrete structure Thursday, said Jerry Sweeten, a retired Manchester University biology professor. The dam's removal means the Eel River now includes about 95 miles of free-flowing open waterway that will promote both safer recreation and the river's ecological health, Sweeten said. This is a remarkable thing, to open up this much of the river, he told The Journal Gazette. There's now no barrier to migrating fish, including small-mouth bass and several species of suckers, including the great red horse sucker, which is an endangered species in Indiana, Sweeten said. The river has 52 fish species, 43 of which migrate upstream, he said.", "augmented": []}

(January 15, 2019) – USADA announced today that Jennifer Maia, of Curitiba, Brazil, has accepted a six-month sanction for a violation of the UFC® Anti-Doping Policy after testing positive for prohibited substances from a contaminated dietary supplement. Maia, 30, tested positive for furosemide, hydrochlorothiazide, chlorothiazide, and the thiazide metabolite 4-amino-6-chloro-1,3-benzenedisulfonamide (ACB), following an out-of-competition test conducted on August 16, 2018. These substances are Specified Substances in the class of Diuretics and Masking Agents and are prohibited at all times under the UFC Anti-Doping Policy, which has adopted the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) Prohibited List. During an investigation into the circumstances of her case, opened and sealed containers of a dietary supplement she was using at the time of the August 16, 2018 sample collection, and that she declared on her doping control form, were sent to the WADA-accredited laboratory in Brazil for analysis. Although no prohibited substances were listed on the supplement label, the analysis revealed that both contained the prohibited substances for which Maia tested positive. Accordingly, this product has been added to the High Risk List of supplements maintained on USADA's online dietary supplement safety education and awareness resource – Supplement 411 (www.Supplement411.org). Further, USADA reminds athletes that dietary supplement products marketed for weight loss carry significant risk to contain prohibited prescription medications, such as diuretics. Under the UFC Anti-Doping Policy, as well as the World Anti-Doping Code, the determination that an athlete's positive test was caused by a contaminated product may result in a reduced sanction.", "augmented": []}

Dr. Brian Rifkin, a nephrologist with Forrest General Hospital in Hattiesburg who is working with pulmonologist Dr. Steven Stogner, said the Seraph 100 Microbind Affinity Blood Filter has helped most of the patients who have received the treatment as part of their recovery. We have treated 17 patients to date, he said in an email. Twelve have been discharged, four are still hospitalized and one died of complications unrelated to COVID or Seraph treatment. In general, it only takes one treatment, which lasts four to six hours, to begin seeing results, Rifkin said, with patients beginning to see improvement in the first 48 hours after treatment. The filter works in a manner similar to dialysis, which removes blood from a patient, filters it and reintroduces the cleansed blood to the patient's bloodstream. A dialysis filter has pores to remove waste and water from the body in a patient with kidney failure, Rifkin said. The Seraph filter, in contrast, has coated beads that bind various particles.", "augmented": []}

In some cases, vaccine hesitancy has contributed to lower demand as well, they say. Shipments also have been unpredictable, sometimes arriving later than expected or in smaller quantities than previous allotments, making it difficult to plan for distribution. Protocols require a 15-minute observation window for each patient, limiting the number of people who can cycle through a chair each day. This is not your routine stop by the primary care office to get a flu shot. This is a whole different operation, said Dr. Andy Thomas, chief clinical officer at Ohio State University's Wexner Medical Center.
