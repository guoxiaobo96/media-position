{"original": "the way currency etfs generally work is fairly simple. the underlying fund opens positions in the underlying foreign currency, either through direct short-term investments or by using futures contracts. the value of the positions moves up or down in line with the appreciation or depreciation of the specified foreign currency, less any expenses that the fund bears. for the currencyshares funds above, one share of a currency etf is equivalent to a fixed amount of currency, although that amount has fallen over time because of the need for the funds to pay expenses from their own resources. low interest rates have meant that the income that these funds produce internally is insufficient to cover expenses in some cases.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "on the pacific rim, initial projections had expected dollar weakening against currencies in japan and china as well, but the damage was not nearly as substantial as some had feared. gains in economic strength haven't been as substantial in asia as they have been in europe, and so cross-currency trading between the euro and the major asian currencies has helped keep exchange rate gains in u.s. dollar terms somewhat in check. the same impact helped hold the swiss franc down, with efforts to prevent its appreciation against the euro in past years finally leading to a shift back down toward the relative levels that had prevailed before 2015.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "in the centennial year of the 19th amendment, blee's research connecting suffrage with white women's rise in the notorious hate group presents a nuanced understanding of the voting milestone that hardly expanded voting rights for non-white women. in interviews with indiana klanswomen nearing the end of their lives, blee was surprised to learn that many did not feel remorseful for their role in the wkkk.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "blee spoke to the 19th, which has been covering the centennial of the amendment, about how a voting rights movement facilitated an extremist one, the role gender plays in extremism today, and what she wishes she could ask klanswomen now.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "this interview has been edited for length and clarity.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the 19th: this year marks 100 years since the 19th amendment was passed. this is also roughly the centennial marker of when the wkkk was established. so can you talk a little bit about how that 19th amendment milestone made the wkkk possible?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "kathleen blee: the women's suffrage movement existed for decades before the passage of the 19th amendment. so a lot of people, clearly the majority of women and some men who were involved in it, were interested in suffrage for women. they believed in equality and bringing more people into public life and having women's interests and the interests of children better represented in politics.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "but, that wasn't everybody. there were women — primarily in the south, but not exclusively — who wanted to ensure votes for women, and really they're thinking of white women here, because they wanted white women's votes to counteract the votes that had earlier been given to black men. there was always within the suffrage movement a pretty openly racist segment. the fact that, actually, very few black men actually got to exercise their vote was not relevant to their topic.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "so the other thing that is relevant here in terms of the ku klux klan of the 1920s, is that the women's suffrage movement was an opportunity for a very large number of women to develop political skills that they hadn't had before. in trying to pass the suffrage amendment and working at a local level, the state level or the national level, women essentially started to become political agents themselves. they developed their own political networks. they traveled. they made connections with other women. they understood the mechanisms of political power and elections and so forth. and that was true for women who were trying to push a progressive agenda, but it was also true for women who are trying to move a much more reactionary and racist agenda.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "right after the 19th amendment was passed, the male klan started saying positive things about women's suffrage. they started encouraging women to come in, and women did. some of the leaders of the klan in the 1920s were women who had been women's suffrage leaders themselves. eventually they pulled away from the men's klan and became antagonistic toward the men's klan, primarily because they didn't want to share dues money and there's conflicts and lawsuits and even physical brawls between the men's and women's klans.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the women brought into their klan horrible anti-semitic, anti-catholic, terribly racist views and agendas, but they also brought in this idea of women's rights. but they only meant the rights of white native-born protestant women, just women's rights for people like them. within that, they argued in favor of an eight-hour day for mothers, pay for housewives, and all these kinds of agenda that are similar to what progressive women are arguing for in the 1920s, but in the case of the women's klan, a very racially defined set of rights.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "it's an interesting story, but it's also a terrible story. it shows the ability of extremist, racist groups to co-opt and build upon even progressive agendas like women's suffrage, and how easily and completely it could be harnessed to one of the worst and certainly one of the largest racist movements in the country's history. they had horrible success by demonizing people by their country of origin and imprinting anti-semitism and racism really deeply into the body politic, ripping it out of just being a southern phenomenon and making it a national phenomenon. sadly, women had a really significant part in that.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "one of the things you grapple with in the book is the tendency to frame extremist groups as fringe and on the margins, their members as brainwashed, even as lower-class and uneducated. similarly, there becomes this very sexist rhetoric about women in the klan only being there because of pressure from the men in their lives. can you talk about what your research says about the importance of understanding recruitment tactics that brought in church leaders and politicians and women organizing for suffrage into the klan?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "blee: when we think about how women fit into these kinds of politics, it's often the case that people look at women in extremism through the blinders that we have about what those kinds of women are like. people looked at women in the 1920s klan, and they'll say, oh, she's married to or with some man who's also in the klan or in the movement, therefore she must have followed him there. but in my research on the 1920s klan, and in my research on current far-right extremism in the united states, it's often the case that the woman and the man independently went into those organizations and met each other there. a lot of what we assume about women and their motivations are based on really gender stereotypes, not the reality of women in those groups.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "another thing that people often think is that women have no role in those groups. but that actually isn't true. so let's take the 1920s klan. historians knew for many, many decades that there were women's klans all over the country. but nobody ever studied them because the historians that looked at the klan thought only the men were really political actors. if there were women's klans, they just denoted them as auxiliaries. if you actually look at what was going on in the 1920s, and i did a deep case study of indiana, where the klan was extremely strong, is that in a lot of ways, the women were more effective at the horrible agenda of the klan than the men.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "in the 1920s, the men's klan was different than klans before and after because it was not very involved in physical violence; they were mostly interested in trying to get people to run for office and collecting dues. the women's klan, however, was much more effective in carrying out the racist politics of the klan because these women created networks among themselves and established what they called whispering campaigns that would target someone they suspected of being catholic or jewish and started spreading gossip about them. they were really effective at collapsing the stores of jewish owners and getting catholic school teachers run out of communities and targeting african americans in white communities and getting them pushed out.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "obviously keeping in mind that women of the ku klux klan were perpetuating hate, you also write about the sexism they dealt with from klansmen but also from outsiders. you write about a newspaper editor who was critical of the klan and described the women as coarse-featured and having abandoned their husband and children. what can be gleaned from this sexism and misogyny at large?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "blee: misogynist society permeates into these racist groups, very clearly. racist groups from the 1920s, when you have a lot of women, and then today when you have a certain number of women in racist groups, there is a double speak about women. on the one hand, women can be racial warriors — that would be language people use today — women are valued allies to men and racist movements. on the other hand, these are movements that are deeply based on inequality and discrimination and hierarchy and masculinity and misogyny. that is the lifeblood of racist movements; they're racist but they're also just deeply misogynistic despite any kind of rhetoric they have about enlisting our sisters in the struggle.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "so women in the 1920s klan, or women in racist groups now, face the same kind of situation. they come in with expectations about their value and the respect they'll have in the racist movement that white women don't get in the larger society. then they confront groups whose men are deeply misogynist, and so these women tend to be quite disillusioned and angry. and interestingly enough from the 1920s klan to today, conflicts around gender are one of the most splintering things that happens in right-wing extremist groups. flash-points for groups to dissolve tend to be over either money and gender — those are explosive issues, in right-wing extremist groups. interesting that it still continues to today.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "so, women are involved in the '20s, then for a long time there's no women in racist groups to speak of. and david duke, whom you may have heard of, is the person who opened the racist movement to women again. duke brought in both women and catholics into organized racism in the late '70s, and women have been there ever since. and you notice that those are both times in which there's a women's movement in the larger society. so women come into hate on the heels of the suffrage movement, then they're pushed out. women return into hate on the heels of the second feminist movement in the '70s. but, you know, just like in the larger society, there's an opening to women, politically, in hate, but it's accompanied by a deep misogyny.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "your book was originally published in 1991, and the version i have includes a preface from 2009. in that preface, you mention that in interviewing aging klanswomen, there were questions you didn't get to ask or that you were too timid to pose. i'm wondering if you've reflected on that or have been able to work through it in some of your subsequent and continued research on extremism?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "blee: i interviewed these people literally at the last possible moment to interview them. many of them died very quickly after. i asked the questions that were on my mind then, and i knew very little. in fact, nobody knew very much about (them) then. and so i kind of asked the most obvious questions, and i was shocked by their answers in a way that wouldn't shock me now. people just had no regrets; i really expected them to be confessional, regretful or embarrassed, or any of those kinds of things. and they really weren't.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "one of my regrets is how thin my foundation of knowledge was going into that. women and those movements were really unexplored. if i could interview these women now, i think i could ask much more interesting questions. how did they get pulled into this? what did they tell their kids? why did they hide this from their kids?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "i think there's some interesting things to think about when a whirlwind of extremism takes over an entire state or parts of the country, and how people think about what they're swept up in. then they're just dumped out in the end when the whole thing turns out to be kind of a fraud — sex scandals, financial scandals and the whole thing blows up. i was too timid, i should have pushed them a lot more about that. what did you think when your whole world exploded? everybody that seemed like a great leader was exposed as this big fraud. i do think about that now.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "we test mattresses the same way you might: we sleep on them for at least 30 nights to see how they hold up. unlike you, though, we also subjected some of these mattresses to a series of standardized tests into our state-of-the-art testing labs in cambridge, mass. between the at-home testing and the lab testing, we gather data related the following attributes:", "augmented": []}
{"original": "comfort: perhaps the most important part of a mattress is the comfort it provides. of course, comfort is subjective and differs from person to person. instead of assessing how just one tester felt on the bed, testers considered how supported their body felt throughout the night, and in different sleep positions. testers were mindful of their own sleep habits, even considering whether or not they found themselves rolling around at night to find a cooler spot on the bed.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "motion transfer and bounciness: we asked our testers to have another person (or sometimes a pet) join them on the mattress to see how noticeable the movement caused by a bedmate might be. if you're a light sleeper, sleeping on a mattress that does nothing to insulate you from a tossing and turning bed partner isn't going to do your sleep quality any favors. for most of the mattresses, we double-checked our assessment of the mattress's motion transfer by placing a water-filled wine glass or a newton's cradle (that famous desk toy with the ball bearings suspended on strings) on one side of the bed, and asking our testers to climb onto the other side and move around a bit. if their movements were enough to spill water from the wine glass or make the balls in the newton's cradle clack together, then we could confirm that that mattress would not be a good pick for a light sleeper.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "unsurprisingly, motion transfer is closely related to bounciness. in some cases, we gauged a mattress's bounciness by jumping up and down on the mattress like small children with energy to burn. in the lab, though, the bounciness test is much more sedate. the tester makes a video recording of dropping a bowling ball onto the center of the mattress from about waist height; after checking the video, we determined the bounciness by noting how much air (if any) the bowling ball got on the first bounce.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "edge support: testers assessed the support provided by the edge of the bed by determining whether the mattress edges sloped beneath their weight while they were lying down along it or sitting down on it. while this may not matter to some sleepers, when a mattress is crowded with a partner or a pet, too-little edge support can mean the difference between staying aloft or falling off the bed. if the mattress edges provide too little support, it could also make it difficult for you to put your shoes on in the morning, or complete any other task that is often done while sitting on the mattress corners or edges.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "for the mattresses that were tested in our labs, we placed a bowling ball on the edges and corners of the mattress. if the bowling ball stays in place and doesn't roll away, then we conclude there's enough support at mattress edges for you to sleep on without having to worry about falling out of bed in the middle of the night.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "heat retention: one of the more recent hot-button issues in mattresses is heat retention. if a mattress cannot vent or disperse the heat you give off quickly enough, you might be in for a warmer sleeping experience than you were expecting. while this is ideal for those of us who sleep cold, people who sleep warm can end up sweating and miserable in the middle of the night.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "in our earlier tests, we relied on our testers' subjective responses to heat retention. in more recent iterations of our mattress testing, we started measuring it in our labs. first, we place temperature sensors on the mattress, cover the mattress with a heated blanket, and turn it on a high setting for an hour. then, we turn the heated blanket on and off every fifteen minutes. in order to see if a mattress retains heat, we check the temperature spikes over time. if a mattress vents the heat from the heated blanket efficiently, then the temperature peaks should not rise over time (in fact, with cooling mattresses, those peaks should go down over time). for mattresses that retain heat, though, we'd expect to see those temperature values go up over time. by looking at the temperature, it's easy to see whether a given mattress will keep you (too) warm or leave you cool.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "support: while you know your body's needs best, we can give you a rough idea of the amount of support a mattress provides, whether we test it in someone's home or in the lab. for at-home testing, our testers lie on their backs on the mattress and check for any gaps between their lower back and the top of the mattress. if the gaps are present, then it is unlikely that the mattress will be able to provide you with adequate back support.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "odor: foam mattresses aren't known for smelling like daisies, especially when they first are sprung from their packaging. the packaging and manufacturing processes cause chemicals to become trapped within the mattress; these smelly chemicals are released into the air once the plastic around the mattress is cut open. testers noted the smell of the mattress when they first opened it, and again 24 hours later (the minimum time it's recommended you let a mattress off-gas before sleeping on it).", "augmented": []}

{"original": "what level of firmness do you want? mattresses range from extra firm, almost like sleeping on a carpeted floor (or a slab of rock, depending on your preferences), to soft and squishy, like a cloud (or quicksand). finding the right firmness for you is essential to getting a good night's rest. if you're not sure what you want, you can always visit a mattress showroom to get a sense of your preferences before buying online.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "what fabrication are you looking for? boxed mattresses come in a myriad of materials. you can choose among memory foam, traditional coiled springs, hybrid mattresses (which combine foam and coils), or something off the beaten path, such as purple's unique polymer. each type has benefits and drawbacks. memory foam, for example, contours well to your body under the pressure of your weight, but can feel too enveloping to some people and retain heat. coils can provide more support, but will also feel bouncier and may transfer more motion, say, from a restless partner.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "do you want more edge support? if you're an active sleeper, or your bed is home to a party of more than one, edge support can help prevent you, a partner, the kids, and even pets from rolling overboard, which can be an issue with some memory foam mattresses. or if you like to sit on the edge of the bed as you put on shoes or socks, you might not want to feel the mattress sloping down or collapsing underneath you. coil and some hybrid mattresses have an encasement around the bed to help provide support around the edges.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "does the mattress require a box spring or a foundation? many newer mattresses work fine without a box spring (a fabric-covered wood frame that contains springs to increase bed buoyancy and boosts up the mattress for additional height), as long as you have a platform bed or adequate slats to provide support and/or the height you'd like your bed to be. just be sure to check the mattress specifications before it shows up at your door. if you do need a base, these companies sell them to match their mattresses.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "does the mattress require special accessories? some mattresses, such as the extra-thick saatva, may not work well with standard sheets or bed frames. that might mean you need to replace your favorite sheets with a deep-pocket set or, if your bed frame isn't compatible, new furniture, which can get expensive.", "augmented": []}

(it dissipated in about 24 hours, though.) when our tester laid down on the zinus, the first thing she noticed could be a plus or a minus, depending on personal preferences: it's extremely soft. the mattress is composed of different kinds of foam, so it molds to pressure and weight, creating what felt to our tester like a divot underneath the body. in some ways, this is good—it has a nesting effect, so it's cozy—but she tends to sleep hot, and found that the zinus retained body heat more than other mattresses she's tested (namely, the helix). it also made it difficult to get out of bed in the morning because her 130-pound body had sunk so deep into the mattress.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "5. the market's best days have historically followed substantial drops. in 2015, both the dow's best day and the s&p 500's best day came in the aftermath of the august decline. those who panic-sold after the declines missed out — and likely didn't manage to get their money back into the market until after stocks had recovered even further.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "6. calendar-driven thinking is irrational. one big reason why the market's drop is getting so much attention is that it's coming at the beginning of the year. it's another example of how too great a focus on annual performance can distort investor perception. the fundamental prospects for companies aren't tied to the calendar year, so your expectations about stock-price movements shouldn't be either.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "7. the market first hit this level in may 2014. even after the decline, the stock market has only given up gains from about a year and a half. from 2009 to mid-2014, the s&p 500 nearly tripled. overall, markets typically haven't tripled even over seven-year periods.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "8. the best-performing stocks have routinely undergone big losses along the way. look at the top-returning stocks over the past decade, and you'll find plenty of times when shares traded well below their best levels. to get truly large returns, you have to be willing to wait through large pullbacks.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "all-electronic tolling first went into effect on florida's turnpike in february 2011, when the southern 47 miles of the turnpike mainline in miami was converted to a cashless system, according to chad huff of florida's turnpike enterprise, a unit of the florida department of transportation. florida's turnpike administers most, but not all, of the state's toll roads.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "all-electronic tolling isn't exclusive to florida; drivers encounter cashless roads and bridges across the u.s., including in california, colorado, and new york, as well as countries around the world. the system certainly has its benefits: cashless toll roads are faster and safer, since drivers don't get stuck in toll-plaza backups or need to fumble for change, raising the risk of accidents. in florida, ever-increasing miles of road will use all-electronic tolling, as existing highways are retrofit to remove toll plazas. a decade ago, the florida department of transportation mandated that all new toll roads must utilize cashless tolling.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "kraemer incurred a $2 toll on the spence parkway, an 11-mile stretch of highway that connects to the mid-bay bridge in the florida panhandle, but is tolled separately from the bridge itself. the tolls are collected by the mid-bay bridge authority. while the bridge itself still has booths where you can pay tolls in cash, the spence parkway does not; it's been all-electronic since 2015. its open-road, all-electronic tolling means drivers can pay without stopping or even slowing down.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "kraemer could have paid the toll herself had she purchased a sunpass transponder beforehand. sunpass is the state's most widely used prepaid tolling program. for a short-term visitor like kraemer, the sunpass mini sticker transponder is the cheapest and easiest option. the mini sticker is $4.99 and can be purchased online or at one of almost 5,000 retail locations including cvs, walgreens and publix. you must load it with $10 minimum for tolls. after your trip, you can close your account and request a refund check by mail from sunpass. the sticker goes on your rental car's windshield, and you remove it when returning the car. it's not reusable; it'll be destroyed when you peel it off. repeat visitors might invest in portable sunpass transponder, which costs $19.99, plus $10 for the account minimum balance. as an incentive, sunpass customers pay lower tolls than cash customers, if cash is even an option.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "with these rental car companies, drivers don't need to decide at the counter if they're going to use the company's toll-payment system. once they trigger a toll, they're automatically opted-in for the rest of their rental, according to avis representative alice pereira — and like kraemer, they're charged a daily free from that point on regardless of whether they actually use additional toll roads.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "opting in at the counter may not be such a bargain, either. at dollar and thrifty, drivers also have to buy the toll-payment option for their entire rentals, not just for days they need it. dollar and thrifty charge $10.49 per day, capped at $52.49 per week, for their all-inclusive tolling with platepass, which includes the actual tolls. that would have cost kraemer quite a bit more than she paid avis for her one jaunt down the parkway.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "selena maranjian: one way to save thousands of dollars in 2016 is to make good use of retirement accounts. most of us can enjoy tax breaks by contributing to traditional iras and 401(k)s. our contributions are made with pre-tax dollars, and for 2015 and 2016, the contribution limits are $5,500 for iras and $18,000 for 401(k)s (with an extra $1,000 and $6,000 allowed, respectively, for those 50 and older). thus, if your taxable income is $60,000 and you contribute $10,000 to these accounts, your taxable income is reduced, to $50,000.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "if you're in the 25% tax bracket and you avoid paying $10,000 in taxes in 2016, you save $2,500! if you're able to be more aggressive, and contribute $20,000 to these accounts, you can save a whopping $5,000. better still, your contributions will go to work for you, and will, ideally, grow over time. most of us need retirement savings accounts to draw on in retirement, so using iras and 401(k)s is a smart thing to do.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "it's not a no-brainer thing to do, though. there are a few more considerations. for one thing, understand that traditional iras and 401(k)s let you save tax dollars up front, but you do get taxed eventually -- when you withdraw your money, typically in retirement. at that time, the money is taxed at your ordinary income tax rate, which is often lower in retirement than when you're working.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "so also consider the roth ira and the roth 401(k), which accept post-tax money (i.e., they don't reduce your taxable income for the year of contribution) but are designed to ultimately let you withdraw your money in retirement tax-free. opt for them and in 2016 you can set yourself up to save thousands in future years.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "according to a recent nerdwallet report, the average u.s. household carries a whopping $15,355 in credit card debt; and based on the latest weekly reading from creditcards.com, the average apr paid on a credit card is 15.07%. these figures imply that the average household is on track to pay in excess of $2,300 this year in credit card interest. understandably, what you pay will depend on your credit history, credit score, and other variables, but this is money that can be put to better use.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "while i'm not a huge fan of suggesting that heavily indebted people open a new credit account, i believe opening an account with an extended special offer of 0% apr (say 12 or 18 months), and transferring your interest-bearing balances to your new account, could help save you thousands in 2016. instead of paying $2,300-plus in interest, you can take that money and apply it, dollar-for-dollar, toward your debt. historically low lending rates have allowed credit card providers to offer these extended periods of 0% apr, but as lending rates rise you may find these offers to be fewer and far between. consumers who have this option available probably won't want to sit on this idea for too long, otherwise those special apr deals may disappear.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "north korea experts like jonathan pollack and jung pak have documented how unlikely kim would be to give up all his nuclear bombs (u.s. intelligence estimates he has as many as 60 by now). they represent the collective accomplishments of a program that kim's grandfather and father prioritized when they led north korea, so giving up all those bombs quickly would almost seem to dishonor the memory and legacy of his forefathers. and perhaps even more importantly, kim as well as his generals remember the one cardinal mistake saddam hussein, mohammar quadhafi, and the taliban all committed — leaving themselves vulnerable in war against the united states because of the lack of a nuclear deterrent. for kim to give up the bomb, he would need a great deal of confidence that relations will remain peaceful.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "with this approach, the united states would keep enough sanctions in place to stay true to its principle that north korea cannot be accepted as a nuclear-weapons state; before being fully welcomed into the community of nations, it will in fact have to honor its obligations under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and give up all its bombs. yet as a practical matter, that second stage of nuclear talks can wait for a number of months or years. that is ok. the world will be much safer if north korea stops enlarging and improving its nuclear and long-range missile arsenals that could threaten not only south korea and japan (and the almost 300,000 americans living in those two countries combined), but also eventually north america.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "another possible problem: john bolton, trump's national security advisor, and secretary of state mike pompeo may consider a deal that only freezes, rather than eliminates, north korea's nuclear arsenal inadequate for purposes of american and allied security. but they should reassess, or trump should overrule them.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "this compromise deal would go further than the iran deal, in fact, if north korea were willing to see its nuclear production facilities dismantled permanently. yes, kim would keep his nukes for a while. but he would have powerful economic and military reasons to behave himself. in this case, taking half a loaf is far more realistic than hoping for a complete denuclearization accord that just isn't in the cards anytime soon. we should immediately engage in serious talks to see just how serious kim really is about this intriguing and promising offer.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "a notable problem tscl has identified with social security is the method by which cost-of-living adjustments, or colas, are calculated. social security colas are the raises beneficiaries receive most years.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "social security's cola is calculated based on changes in the consumer price index for urban wage earners and clerical workers (cpi-w). the cpi-w is designed to measure the change in the price of a predetermined basket of goods and services. to calculate social security's cola, the average cpi-w reading from the third quarter of the previous year acts as the baseline figure, while the average cpi-w reading from the third quarter of the current year serves as the comparison. if there's a year-over-year decline in the average cpi-w readings, no cola is given. if, however, there is an increase, social security beneficiaries receive the difference, rounded to the nearest 0.1%.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "but, as tscl points out, the cpi-w has a fatal flaw: it represents the spending habits of working americans, not senior citizens, despite the fact that two-thirds of all social security recipients are retired workers.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "this fix could put nearly $30,000 in retirees' pockets over their lifetime", "augmented": []}

{"original": "as you can see by the dec. 2011 comparison of the cpi-w and the cpi-e below, the weighting of expenditures is quite different for certain categories. for example, seniors spend twice as much on medical care as do working americans. they also tend to spend more on housing. by comparison, the cpi-w places a higher emphasis on education, apparel, entertainment, and transportation expenses.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "these percentages may not look large on this bureau of labor statistics comparison, but over the course of 25 years using the cpi-e instead of the cpi-w could be expected to increase annual payouts by an average of 8.9%, or $29,568 in aggregate, based on the current average monthly payout of $1,355 a month for retired workers.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "what's more telling is that over the past 33 years, the cpi-w would have resulted in a greater annual cola than the cpi-e on just three occasions (2006, 2009, and 2012). in the remaining 30 years, the cpi-e would have provided a substantially higher cola, which would presumably allow seniors to more comfortably afford the rising cost of medical care. not surprisingly, medical care inflation has outpaced social security's cola in 33 of the past 35 years.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the cpi-e has its flaws, too", "augmented": []}
{"original": "on one hand, tscl makes a strong case for the cpi-e considering that seniors make up a majority of social security recipients, and given that they're falling far behind the medical care inflation curve. but the cpi-e brings its own set of problems to the table.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "to begin with, there are far more working americans than there are seniors. in other words, even though the cpi-w doesn't perfectly match the spending habits of seniors as outlined in the bls chart above, it arguably creates a more accurate picture of the spending habits of americans than the cpi-e because it has so many additional data points for analysis.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "another concern is that the cpi-e doesn't factor in the rising cost of medicare part a expenses. part a is the hospital insurance component of medicare, and it covers in-patient costs, surgeries, and long-term skilled nursing care. part a costs can be extensive, and if they aren't factored into the cpi-e seniors could still wind up falling way behind the medical care inflation curve, even if the cpi-e were being used to calculate colas instead of the cpi-w.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "lastly, and this could arguably be the biggest issue of all, switching to the cpi-e, could also expedite how quickly the social security trust burns through its spare cash. tscl's calculations demonstrate that seniors would receive a higher cola in most years than with the cpi-w, which means even more pressure on social security.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "will the cpi-e debate gather steam on capitol hill? it's really anyone's guess at this point, but considering that republicans are in charge of congress for at least the next couple of years, and many of them favor moving to a chained cpi (a measure that produces even slower growing colas than the cpi-w), i wouldn't hold my breath.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "vaccine administration is much harder than it sounds for at least two reasons: logistics and vaccine refusal.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the logistical problem begins with shipping and storage, since the pfizer and moderna vaccines must be kept in the freezer.

{"original": "the best way to accomplish this would be with a covid vaccine app. at least one state will launch an app soon, but every state needs one. additionally, an app that can factor in age, gender, and other underlying health conditions could help prevent line jumping. medicare might be in a good position to create a federally coordinated registration app, but they have no expertise in scheduling programs. therefore, there is no national covid app, and we are unlikely to get one.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "another logistical problem is the observation period required after a person receives the jab. patients must remain socially distanced, but waiting rooms in most facilities aren't all that big. therefore, the rate at which people can be vaccinated is capped. to help address that, we need to work around the clock. after all, president-elect biden's goal of fully immunizing one million people a day translates to 1,388 vaccinations per minute (since two doses are required).", "augmented": []}
{"original": "angry politicians have made things worse. new york governor andrew cuomo's solution is to fine everyone. healthcare providers that are too slow to vaccinate will be fined $100,000, while those that speed things along by giving the vaccine too freely will be fined $1,000,000. the result is predictable: 54% of new york's vaccines are sitting idle, and some have been thrown in the trash. apparently, fines don't fix logistical problems.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "in fact, the average employee who doesn't receive a full company match passes up $1,336 annually. and not surprisingly, it's lower earners – those who need that extra money the most – who are increasingly likely to miss out. among those earning less than $40,000 a year, 42% don't contribute enough to pocket company matching dollars in their entirety. higher earners – those making more than $100,000 a year – are far more likely to get a full match, though 10% still end up falling short.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "but no matter your reason for passing up free money, it's a major mistake, and one that might prove costlier than anticipated in the long run. the thing to remember about passing up a 401(k) match is that you're not just losing out on the base amount you fail to collect; you're also forgoing the opportunity to grow that money into a larger sum.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "cut back on one major spending category. if you take one large expense and lower it, whether it's housing, transportation or food, you might feel the effects less so than you would by cutting numerous corners elsewhere. think about it: you're probably better off living in a smaller apartment and shaving $300 off your rent than slashing your cable package, getting rid of your internet service, and being homebound every friday and saturday night to save money on leisure.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "taking out the correct required minimum distribution, or rmds for short, is essential each year, especially since the penalty for not doing so is 50% of what you should have taken out that year. the penalty is in addition to the ordinary income tax you pay on the money you withdraw from the retirement accounts. (tax experts at h&r block note, though, that it is possible to get a waiver by making the appropriate withdrawal as soon as the mistake is discovered and filing form 5329 with an explanation of the error. if the irs considers the error to be reasonable, the penalty will be waived. it may help to talk with a tax professional.)", "augmented": []}
{"original": "given that many americans are living longer and working longer, it can make sense for some to try to keep their hands off their retirement savings for as long as possible.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "this isn't necessarily a one-size-fits-all-situation, said keith bernhardt, vice president of retirement income for fidelity investments.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "keeping the money in a tax-deferred ira or 401(k) can help the account grow more in the future, too, depending on the success of your investments.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "the new threshold applies to people who turn age 70½ in 2020 and later.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the new 72 is simpler to track than the old age rules. after all, it's a little odd to try to figure out when you turn age 70 and a half.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "one potential point of confusion: if you turned 70½ in 2019 or earlier, you don't get the benefit of the new delay. you're still required to take the rmd for 2019 and in future years.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the new rules can give you more flexibility for minimizing the tax hit in some years, too. maybe you'd rather spend money from a regular brokerage account earlier in your retirement years.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "say that investment outside of a retirement account is worth $10,000 but only $2,000 of that money represents actual earnings. then, you'd only be taxed on the $2,000 not the entire $10,000.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "take $10,000 out of the ira and you'd be taxed on the full amount if you saved that money on a pretax basis while working.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "take a hard look at your own numbers and talk to a tax professional or financial adviser.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "outliving your money remains a real risk for many. once people retire, they can run the risk of dipping too heavily into their retirement savings and running short of money as they age.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "though people retire at different ages, fidelity noted that participants in the 401(k) plans it manages often retire around age 65.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "regardless of age, most make withdrawals in the first year, then the withdrawal rate declines until the required minimum distribution age, according to fidelity.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "one drawback for withdrawing money from a tax-deferred retirement account is that withdrawals are taxed at your regular income tax rate. you might face a 10% penalty if you withdraw the money before age 59½ as well. if you take out too much money, you're at risk of driving up your annual income tax bill.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "2) retirement savings can help young families, too.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "new parents would be allowed to withdraw up to $5,000 without the 10% penalty if the money is withdrawn within a year of the birth or adoption. you'd have to check with your plan sponsor to see when this might be allowed within a given plan.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "3) working part time won't hurt your ability to save.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "going forward, the new law requires companies that offer 401(k) plans to allow part-time employees who have worked at least 500 hours a year for at least three consecutive years to set aside money from their paychecks into the plan. the employer isn't required to make matching contributions until the worker meets the plan's normal eligibility requirements.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "in the past, someone who was steadily working part time could legally be excluded from saving for retirement in a 401(k) or similar plan if he or she worked less than 1,000 hours a year. so the change is expected to open the doors for many people who work in retail, health care and other part-time heavy fields. the change may be particularly beneficial for women.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "how soon will you be able to save? it might be sometime in 2024 or earlier.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "some plan sponsors could wait until 2024 to make this change relating to part-time workers based on the statute, said mark iwry, a nonresident senior fellow at the brookings institution. iwry was responsible for national retirement policy and regulation of the private pension system while serving as senior adviser to the u.s. secretary of the treasury during the obama administration.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "this lifetime income benchmarking will help both, gotbaum said.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "many government services have income and asset limitations. for example, to qualify for ssi, you must have less than $2,000 in assets. a child who is left an inheritance or designated the beneficiary of a life insurance policy may inadvertently be disqualified from receiving benefits, says jay robert, a new york-based attorney with kassoff, robert & lerner, who specializes in special needs planning.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "depending on the state, that could cost the adult child hundreds of thousands of dollars a year, says benjamin rubin, an attorney and mitchell's brother. this is an astronomical sum that most families cannot afford for the rest of that child's lifetime, benjamin says. the rubins estimate that mitchell receives approximately $90,000 per year for such services as his day program, job coaches and housing.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "a special needs, or supplemental needs, trust is a legal vehicle that will hold the assets of a person with disabilities without costing them their government benefits. those trusts will essentially protect any assets held for the benefit of the children, robert says.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "there are two types of special needs trusts — first-party and third-party trusts. first-party trusts have a payback provision, meaning that when the beneficiary dies, any money left in the trust will first be used to repay the states that paid out benefits on their behalf. with third-party trusts, any money left in the trust could pass back to family members.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "another financial vehicle is an able account, a tax-advantaged savings account that lets you save up to $100,000 without losing government benefits. like first-party trusts, able accounts have a payback provision.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "►run everywhere and anywhere. in order to have the chance to exploit first moore's nomination and then his scandal, democrats needed a credible candidate. jones, while never having run for office before, was a successful prosecutor and respected attorney with a broad network of contacts in alabama. we need similar people to step forward to run for office throughout the south, such as senate candidate phil bredesen, the former tennessee governor — but also in the midwest and other supposedly trump or republican strongholds. the wave will reach its full power only if there are plenty of surfers who know what they are doing atop it.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "►don't trim your sails. jones is a moderate democrat willing to work across the aisle and find common ground to get things done for alabama and our country. however, he did not alter his support for reproductive rights, immigration or gay marriage — or downplay his role in prosecuting and convicting two of the ku klux klan members who murdered four african-american girls at a birmingham church in 1963 — to curry favor with certain constituencies. not every democrat will agree with every other democrat on policy issues. we have had, and still possess, a big tent. voters would rather you say what you mean and mean what you say than believe you are willing to sacrifice your principles in exchange for a few votes.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "►common ground works as a message, even in, and perhaps especially because of, these polarized times. jones' willingness to cross the aisle was an integral part of his message from the beginning of the campaign and became a constant in our advertising. our polling showed that jones won two in five voters who had favored luther strange (the establishment choice) in the september gop runoff, and jones also won independents by nearly 10 points on election day. the truth is that the actions of president trump and his gop majority in congress have made them vulnerable to the charge that they are unwilling to compromise — thus failing to achieve any progress on health care and other key issues. in contrast with jones' strengths, by election eve, 49% of alabamians felt that moore would make things worse in washington.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "►we have an energized coalition that can produce electoral magic. african americans, particularly black women, made a heroic demonstration of their political clout in alabama: 96% favored jones. and they punched way above their weight on turnout — exceeding their share of the overall electorate by several points while the white electorate that fueled the 2016 trump win shrank substantially.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "college-educated white suburbanites and millennials of all races and ethnicities helped produce the jones victory margin as well. in each case, our campaign and various complementary groups used traditional forms of communication — television, radio and mail — as well as social media and direct voter contact in substantial volume. campaigns must use every medium to communicate urgency to these voters.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "the constitution is clear: it is the role of congress to make laws, the judiciary to interpret the laws, and the president to enforce the laws. this system was wisely set in place by the founders well over 200 years ago because they knew firsthand that the concentration of power was a threat to individual liberty and the rule of law. as james madison eloquently wrote in federalist no. 47: the accumulation of all powers, legislative, executive, and judiciary, in the same hands, whether of one, a few, or many, and whether hereditary, self-appointed, or elective, may justly be pronounced the very definition of tyranny.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "although the bridgegate case has become legally complex, the scheme itself was relatively simple. after fort lee mayor mark sokolich declined to endorse christie's reelection in 2013, close allies of the governor cooked up a payback plan: to embarrass the mayor by causing traffic jams on his borough's streets.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "just after dawn on monday, sept. 9, 2013 — the first day of public school classes in fort lee — workers from the port authority of new york and new jersey were ordered to block two of the three access lanes from fort lee to the george washington bridge. the port authority did not warn fort lee police or sokolich. later, the port authority tried to cast the lane changes as part of a traffic study.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "roth claims the federal prosecutors essentially looked to the politics behind the bridgegate plan — to punish fort lee's mayor — to file criminal charges. in his brief to the supreme court, roth wrote that such a precedent was dangerous — and unconstitutional — because it could give prosecutors the opportunity to turn the political motives of government officials into possible crimes.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "taken seriously, it would allow any federal, state, or local official to be indicted based on nothing more than the (ubiquitous) allegation that she lied in claiming to act in the public interest, roth wrote. consider a cabinet secretary who appoints a friend to a public post, declaring him to be best-qualified. or a deputy mayor who orders pothole repair to reward her boss' political base, justifying it on neutral policy grounds.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "if you've been working for a couple of decades or more, then you're probably thinking about the day when you'll be able to clock out for the last time and start living life on your own terms. retirement represents a huge change in your lifestyle and your financial situation, so if you want to enjoy it to the fullest, you'll need to do some serious planning and saving before you make the leap.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "if you're near the finish line and thinking of retiring within the next five years, then first make sure you can answer yes to the three questions below.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "1. are your retirement savings on track?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "if you have been saving diligently for many years and have reaped the growth of the stock market over that time, then you should have a sizable balance saved in your retirement accounts. if your savings are minimal or nonexistent, then you will probably need to continue working for more than five years -- and ramp up your retirement savings as well.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "so how do you know when you have enough money saved up? start by figuring out how much annual income you'll need in retirement (for most people, it's about 70% to 80% of their pre-retirement income). then subtract the yearly income you expect to receive from social security (you can get an estimate by creating an account at ssa.gov), a pension, or any other income source besides your retirement savings. what remains is the amount of income your retirement savings will have to provide. if you have enough money saved up to provide that income for as long as you expect to live, then you're in pretty good shape. for context, if you plan to retire around age 65, many experts say your savings should be sufficient to provide at least 25 years' worth of income.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "it is wise to enlist the help of a financial planner when estimating your future income needs, as planners can take all of your financial information and plug it into a sophisticated program that incorporates historical market returns and other factors such as your tax bracket, social security and pension benefits, investment objectives, risk tolerance, and time horizon.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "2. is your portfolio allocated correctly?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "if you are nearing retirement and your portfolio is invested almost exclusively in stocks, then it's probably time to start moving some of that money into safer alternatives such as bonds or annuities. stocks can provide a greater rate of growth over time, but they can also result in large losses when a bear market hits. and this is something that you can't afford if you plan to retire in five years, as it may take longer than that to recoup your losses (as many investors have discovered since the bear market in 2008). a good rule of thumb is to subtract your age from 110, turn the result into a percentage, and allocate at least that much of your portfolio to bonds and similarly safe investments. for example, if you're 65, then you should have at least 45% of your portfolio invested in safer investments.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "that said, no matter your age, you'll want at least 25% of your portfolio in equities in order to maintain a hedge against inflation.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "3. are you prepared to pay for long-term care expenses?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "although this issue won't likely arise in the next five years, it is still something you need to prepare for before you retire. long-term care expenses can devastate even the best-laid retirement plans if you lack insurance coverage or dedicated funds to pay for them. although the cost of long-term care can vary considerably depending upon the level of care you need and where you live, it can easily cost $50,000 to $100,000 a year or more.and the average stay in a nursing home generally lasts about two-and-a-half years.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "one of the latest innovations in the life insurance industry is the introduction of policies that have accelerated benefit riders allowing the policy holder to access some or all of the death benefit in order to pay for expenses related to disability or long-term care. this can be a more economical way to insure yourself against the high cost of this form of care.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "these are just some of the questions you'll need to be able to answer if you would like to retire in the next five years. if you are unsure of whether you are prepared to retire in the next five years, find a financial advisor who can provide you with advice on when you can safely retire and what you need to do to prepare.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "it's easy enough to come up with a reason for not putting together an estate plan. among those surveyed by caring.com, the most common excuses for neglecting a will or trust were not having enough assets or just not getting around to it. and then there's the reason some of us don't want to share out loud: contemplating mortality can be a disturbing process, and many people can't bring themselves to sit down and face it.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "but if you don't create a formal will or trust, there's no guarantee that your wishes will be carried out once you pass. and even if you don't have a ton in the way of assets, that can still cause the loved ones you leave behind an undue dose of anguish during an already trying time.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "one of the most significant arguments for having a will is that without one, there's no telling what might happen to your minor children once you're no longer around. but if you do create a will, you'll be able to appoint a guardian for your children so you know they'll be well taken care of.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "a will can also help ensure that your assets are distributed equitably among your heirs. furthermore, if you die without a will, your assets will be distributed based on the laws of your state – laws that won't necessarily match your actual wishes. for example, the laws of your state might dictate that in the absence of a will, your assets will automatically be divided among your children. but if you'd rather leave a chunk of cash to your nieces and nephews, your desired beneficiaries might never see that money if there's no will to spell that out.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "in addition to creating a will, you might also consider establishing a trust, the exact type of which will depend on your specific needs and level of assets. while trusts can be costly to set up, in many circumstances, the benefits they offer far outweigh the expense.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "a revocable living trust, for example, gives you the flexibility to manage your assets during your lifetime while ensuring that your wishes are carried out once you pass. these trusts also allow you to avoid the costly, time-consuming process that is probate. irrevocable trusts offer less flexibility during your lifetime, but they can be a smart solution for larger estates.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "because there are several trust fund options to choose from, your best bet is to sit down with an estate planning attorney and get help identifying the one that's right for you. keep in mind that without a trust, you could subject your heirs to a larger estate tax bill than is necessary. though most americans don't have to worry about estate taxes, they're a concern among wealthy families looking to preserve more of their assets for future generations.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "that said, you don't need to be wealthy to establish a trust, and you certainly don't need to be wealthy to create a will. even if you have few assets and no dependents, it still pays to set up an estate plan -- if not for your own sake, then for that of the people who are most important to you.", "augmented": []}
