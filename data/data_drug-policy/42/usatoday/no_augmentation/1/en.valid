of course, the sooner you begin socking away money for retirement, the better your chances of actually getting to leave the workforce when you want to. keep in mind, however, that the $300 figure above doesn't even come close to maxing out an ira or 401(k). for the former, you can contribute up to $5,500 a year if you're under 50, or $6,500 if you're 50 or older. for the latter, these limits just increased to $18,500 and $24,500, respectively. max out for even a couple of years while contributing smaller amounts consistently, and you stand a much better shot of retiring than you'd think.

the advantages of this approach go well beyond the reduction in force numbers. by laying out a plan designed to last for several years, washington would be avoiding the drama and the huge consumption of policy bandwidth associated with annual afghanistan policy reviews that have typified the latter obama and trump years.

annapolis: a newspaper's review of state court records has found an apparent loophole that allows documents filed electronically to be kept from the public. the capital reports court documents filed through the state's electronic record-keeping system can be made secret by attorneys, judges and clerks and their staffers without a court order or public notice. in contrast, attorneys who want a record kept secret must obtain an order from a judge when filing by paper. that process requires notice and an opportunity for any interested party to intervene. the newspaper reports it's unclear how many records have been so easily sealed across the state. in the case of the man accused of opening fire in the annapolis newsroom in 2018, killing five employees, the newspaper learned through a public records request that almost 70% of the documents were designated confidential, keeping them from public view.

jonathan bernstein, bloomberg: what president donald trump has been doing so far is, as political scientist dave hopkins points out, following the lead of the house freedom caucus. but freedom caucus radicals don't have plans for either policy gains or public-relations wins. what they care about is proving that they're true conservatives by differentiating themselves from mainstream republicans. in practice, that means finding irrational but tough-sounding tactics to endorse. that's this shutdown in a nutshell. instead of making a deal last year, when republicans held unified control of government, trump has chosen to negotiate from a position of relative weakness as democrats take over the house majority.

trenton: all 37,000 of the lead water pipes in the state capital will be replaced over the next five years at an estimated cost of $150 million, trenton officials said thursday. the announcement comes about five months after the state's largest city, newark, said it would speed up the replacement of its 18,000 lead lines over the next 21/ 2 years – and as the state grapples with how to move forward with its old water infrastructure. trenton's publicly owned water utility draws water from the delaware river and serves some 200,000 customers in the city, in addition to surrounding communities of ewing, hamilton, hopewell and lawrence. pipes will be replaced in phases as the city and trenton water works, the public utility, continue to secure funds, which are coming from the state infrastructure bank, as well a federal program, according to david smith, the water works chief engineer. residents must register on the utility's website and pay $1,000 to have their lines replaced, democratic mayor reed gusciora said. that's a savings, he said, because replacement typically costs about $2,000-$5,000 per line. about 7,000 people have registered to have their pipes replaced, and officials said they hope to make the replacement mandatory and at no cost at some point.

portland: the state with the largest fishing industry for lobster likely experienced a drop in catch last year, but the dip in harvest was probably not as dramatic as initially feared. patrick keliher, commissioner of the maine department of marine resources, told maine public that initial reports showed a harvest of about 100 million pounds of lobster. that would be a drop of nearly 20 million pounds from last year, but still a much higher number than the industry was used to in the 1990s and 2000. the season initially looked like it could produce a substantial drop in catch, but maine's lobstermen finished strong, keliher said. the price for maine lobster was also strong, he said. it's possible for the state's lobster catch to be slowed by lobsters shedding their shells late in the year. the biggest surge in catch happens after many lobsters lose their old shells and reach legal harvesting size.

the obama administration has already shown its weakness in responding to iran's deal-breaking behavior. in october iran tested an illegal ballistic missile, and on the last day of 2015 iran's president hassan rouhani ordered accelerated missile production in violation of numerous u.n. security council resolutions. none of this is covered by the new nuclear deal and should trigger a harsh response. however, the white house chose to delay punishing iran for these violations, though reuters reported that spokesman josh earnest said president obama would not stand in the way if u.s. officials deemed such measures useful and if they would benefit u.s. national security. this frank abrogation of presidential leadership tells tehran that anything goes.

town: a man from illinois drove through wisconsin last week with a snowmobile strapped to the roof of his car, creating a bit of a stir. tommy mecher, an electrician apprentice from chicago, said he could not afford to get a trailer and pay for the extra gas to tow his snowmobile up north. i only burned $10 more in gas on a 430-mile trip, mecher said. i put it on the roof in lemont, illinois, where the snowmobile was and drove it up to bessemer, michigan. snowmobiling can be an expensive pastime. there's the expensive machine, helmet and cold-weather clothing, the cost to travel to a spot with enough snow and the expenses of a weekend of roaring across groomed trails. but mecher purchased the 1990 polaris indy 500 snowmobile a few weeks ago, made a few minor repairs to get it running and left for his father's house in bessemer last friday. mecher said it took about an hour to load the snowmobile on the roof of his 2005 chevy malibu, using an old blue ford tractor with a bucket. he modified the end of the snowmobile to keep the machine's track from caving in the roof or breaking the rear window. mecher made a support rack of boards to shift the snowmobile's weight to the sides of the roof, away from the middle. he secured his sled with several straps that he looped through the open rear doors before tightening them and closing the doors.

5 things to do if an airline damages your bag
providence: legislative leaders said wednesday they're working to undo a change to how medical marijuana dispensaries are regulated, to address a lawsuit by the governor. a provision in the state budget approved last year gave lawmakers the right to veto regulations imposed on the industry. democratic gov. gina raimondo sued, arguing the new law violates the state constitution's separation of powers clause because it gives lawmakers unchecked control over executive rulemaking authority. democratic house speaker nicholas mattiello and senate president dominick ruggerio said wednesday they're filing legislation to repeal the language that required lawmakers to approve rules and regulations relating to the expansion of licenses for medical marijuana dispensaries. however, they still took issue with how the department of business regulation proposed regulations for dispensaries, with mattiello calling it blatant overreach by the executive branch. the legislation not only removes the controversial provision, but also imposes limits on regulators. among them, regulators would be barred from limiting dispensaries based on geographical zones and from preventing any center from growing its own supply of medical marijuana or limiting the number of plants. lawmakers authorized six new medical marijuana dispensaries last year, for a total of nine.

in fact, with a handful of exceptions, the only information the public has had about house ethics cases during the past seven years has come from oce reports. the rules as currently written require that once oce has referred a matter to ethics for further review — since oce has no ability to rule on violations or issue punishments — the ethics committee has to publicly release the report even if it has made no decision on guilt or innocence. the most common action by ethics is to release the report and declare that they are still looking onto the matter ... and no conclusion is ever announced. the new rules proposal raised questions about how much of the oce work would still be public.

trump's actions: with his executive order last year, trump signaled that he would undermine the aca's protections by allowing insurance plans that don't have to cover even the basics. trump calculated that would bring the democrats to the table, but democrats are wise to stay away on those terms. early in 2018, the administration has to decide if and how to implement this executive order as well as whether to approve requests from states to impose work requirements or require drug testing for medicaid beneficiaries. these decisions are likely to draw a range of legal challenges and protests. trump may welcome the controversy, and if he proceeds with more unilateral action, he and the entire party will certainly get it.

wilmington: an 18-year-old man has been charged with throwing an incendiary device at a planned parenthood location in the state, a federal prosecutor's office announced. samuel james gulick, of middletown, was charged monday in federal court. security video recorded gulick spray-painting the phrase deus vult, a latin expression meaning god wills it, in red letters across the newark building's exterior friday, the u.s. attorney's release said. gulick then stepped away, lit an object and threw it at the front window before running for cover. the object exploded, and a fire burned for a minute before going out, the court documents said. gulick was arrested by the fbi on saturday after investigators identified his car through the security video and found social media posts under his name containing the same phrase he scrawled on the building, as well as several anti-abortion messages.

it is not the first time oce has provided information to the public that the ethics committee could not or would not release. in 2010, then-congressman nathan deal, r-ga., resigned while the ethics committee was reviewing allegations that he had used his congressional office to pressure state officials in georgia on a vehicle policy that would help his family's auto-salvage business. his resignation meant that the ethics committee lost jurisdiction over him, but oce decided to issue the report anyway, saying it had a right to release to the report on its own. under the new rules, it would have lost that right.

midland: it's not what the egyptians had in mind, but it worked: a group of high school students made a pyramid out of toilet paper – 27,434 rolls. it took 16 hours for students to assemble the pyramid at bullock creek high school in midland county. they are hoping to be recognized by the guinness book of world records and sell the toilet paper as a fundraiser for the 20-member robotics team. there was a lot of excitement when we got to the last few layers, but the final roll at the top was actually pretty anti-climactic, maxton herst told mlive.com. every single roll you place, you want it to be in the correct spot. it was just kind of mind-numbing work. herst got the idea three years ago after seeing a similar pyramid on youtube. the students built the pyramid during holiday break. rolls of the two-ply toilet paper have since been placed into 96-count boxes for purchase.

esper's honesty, especially in an administration whose hallmark is daily dissembling, is refreshing. but again, it raises the baffling problem of why the trump team didn't just make the case that soleimani, like libyan leader moammar gadhafi and others before him, was a legitimate target and that u.s. forces finally had a clear shot at him. why lie when the truth is compelling? why create a story that will fall apart in a matter of hours?

montpelier: the number of fatalities on vermont roadways went down by about 30% in 2019, according to state figures. vermont state police and the vermont agency of transportation released figures that show the tentative number of deaths on the state's roads in 2019 was 47, down from 69 in 2018, the times argus reported. but state officials are not sure what to attribute the decrease in road fatalities. lt. tara thomas, commander of safety programs for the vermont state police, said the reduction was unexplainable. thomas said that 47 deaths are still too many for state police. we wish we knew what the formula was to keep the numbers down. 47 is still too many for the state police. that's 47 families that don't have a loved one with them, so in our eyes, it's still high. we're averaging just way too many each month, she said. the 47 deaths resulted from 44 crashes last year. the figure is tentative because if someone dies as a result of injuries from a 2019 crash within the first 30 days of 2020, that person's death would be added to the list of fatalities from 2019. vermont also had no fatal crashes reported in the state on any of the holidays last year.

seattle: mayor jenny durkan said seattle will no longer use fossil fuels like natural gas to heat, cool and cook in new and substantially altered city-owned buildings and will come up with a plan by 2021 to transition all city-owned buildings to clean electric systems over time. durkan included those directives in a green new deal executive order wednesday. neither the new keyarena now under construction at seattle center nor the massive seattle aquarium expansion pavilion planned for construction starting next year will be covered by the city's new fossil-fuel ban, however, durkan said. that's because the projects are underway, she said. both city-owned structures will use a lot of energy. the $930 million new arena and 50,000-square-foot aquarium pavilion will initially be allowed to include some fossil-fuel infrastructure, though both will be included in the city's longer-term electrification plans, durkan's office said. there's no deadline yet for all city buildings to be fossil-fuel free. last year, the council passed a green new deal resolution that said seattle would seek to eliminate climate pollutants in the city by 2030.

but that latter argument ignores history, as well as the geographic suppleness of global extremist movements in general. few saw the isis caliphate coming in iraq and syria before 2014 but then, all of a sudden, it was there. and the former argument shows a poor appreciation of how counterterrorism intelligence is developed — usually by cooperation with partners on the ground — as well as an unrealistic appreciation for the geographic remoteness or ruggedness of the hindu kush. standoff counterterrorism is generally an oxymoron.

trenton: the state could see a significant increase in the number of electric cars traveling on local roads under a bill gaining momentum that would expand the state's network of charging stations and give motorists a sizable rebate on a purchase or lease. the measure is seen as a cornerstone of efforts to reduce air pollution, including greenhouse gases, in a state that continually receives failing grades for smog. the bill was approved by two assembly committees monday as lawmakers push to pass it before the legislative session comes to a close next week. to achieve those clean air reductions, motorists will be given one of the best incentive packages in the nation to buy an electric car. at the center of the bill is a rebate of up to $5,000 intended to lower an electric vehicle's sticker price to make the sector more competitive with gasoline-powered cars.

helena: urban deer culling for the fall and winter seasons was suspended by city officials amid budget cuts. the montana fish and wildlife commission recommended the city of helena be allowed to continue culling despite budget cuts, the helena independent record reported tuesday. former police chief troy mcgee made the decision to cut the program when the department was ordered to make more than $470,000 in cuts, city officials said. the program costs the city about $30,000 a year, officials said. the commission sets a quota range of up to 250 designated to maintain the population at desire levels and the city determines the exact number to cull each year within that range, officials said. this will be the first fall and winter the city has not culled deer since 2008, officials said. the city has plans to survey the deer population to determine if it will resume culling operations, police chief steve hagen said. the city has usually culled about 100 deer a year and populations have remained steady, officials said.

omaha: despite more than doubling releases from its reservoir system, the u.s. army corps of engineers still doesn't expect to eliminate all the leftover water from last year's near-record runoff that led to massive missouri river flooding. the corps had been discharging about twice the usual winter amount from gavins point dam – the southernmost in the six-dam system. the corps said it was raising the discharge this month to 30,000 cubic feet per second, an increase of more than 11%. until a seasonal decrease that began in november, the amount being released had been 80,000 cubic feet per second for months, also more than twice the average. areas along the missouri river and its tributaries in parts of nebraska, kansas, iowa and missouri were ravaged by floodwaters in the early spring. heavy rains later in the year reflooded many areas that had been left unprotected because of levee failures. john remus, chief of the corps' missouri river management, told the omaha world-herald the reservoir system needs to make as much space as possible in light of the national weather service forecast for warmer than normal weather and higher than normal runoff in january and february. the corps normally doesn't release more during the winter because of the potential for ice jams and dams upriver, remus told the associated press on wednesday. once the river freezes over it essentially becomes a pipe, remus said, limiting its capacity.

why does this matter for baby boomers? because it will affect how much of their benefit they'll receive, based on how early you retire. for instance, someone born in 1954 would have turned 62 in 2016, thus eligible for social security at a reduced level. since their full retirement age is 66, they would receive 75% of their full benefit if they retired at age 62.
social security is structured to provide a lot of flexibility, since you can take benefits as early as age 62 or as late as age 70, depending on what works for your situation. and while the monthly benefit is significantly lower if you file early and much higher if you delay, the total dollars paid to someone who lives the average lifespan wouldn't be that much different.

topeka: democratic gov. laura kelly proposed monday that the state give itself more breathing room in its budget by slashing annual payments to its pension system for teachers and government workers, offering a new version of a plan that the republican-controlled legislature spiked last year. kelly's proposal would give the state an extra 10 years to close a long-term gap in funding for the state pension system. the move would free up tens of millions of dollars each year for more than a decade, money that could be used for schools and social services. but it's not clear if her new plan will fare any better than last year's proposal – which was dead from almost the moment she presented it to lawmakers. the kansas public employee retirement system projects kelly's proposal would increase the cost of closing the gap by a total of $4.4 billion – comparing it to extending the length of a home mortgage.

indianapolis:family members of hoosier bank robber john dillinger have dropped their lawsuit seeking rights to open his grave at crown hill cemetery. the lawsuit, filed in august by dillinger nephew michael c. thompson, was initially dismissed without prejudice by marion county superior court judge timothy oakes on dec. 4, but thompson was granted an extension of time to file an amended complaint. that deadline would have been jan. 15. but on tuesday, a motion to voluntarily dismiss the lawsuit was submitted to the court on thompson's behalf. it has been granted, effectively putting the issue to rest. since the lawsuit was dismissed without prejudice, the family could revisit the issue in court. it's unknown what thompson's plans are moving forward or how this affects the status of the proposed documentary. attempts to reach the thompson family and their attorney, andrea simmons, were unsuccessful. crown hill cemetery objected to plans to exhume dillinger's body, citing a duty to ensure the safety and integrity of the grounds and those buried there. in a written statement sent to indystar, cemetery management said they were pleased the matter has been resolved. dillinger, born in indianapolis in 1903, gained notoriety after a string of bank robberies in 1933 and several high-profile escapes from police custody. his name became legend when fbi director j. edgar hoover labeled him public enemy no.

montgomery: a judge on tuesday set a final hearing in a lawsuit over control of the alabama democratic party. montgomery circuit judge greg griffin scheduled the hearing for jan. 30. the hearing could signal that a resolution is on the way in the legal dispute over who is party chair. longtime state party leader nancy worley had filed the lawsuit to block state rep. chris england from taking control as party chair. a revamped governing board of the party elected england as chair this fall, but worley and her supporters maintained his election was illegitimate. the ongoing feud has pitted longtime party leaders, such as worley and joe reed, against an upstart faction. the democratic national committee supports england and recognizes him as state chair. barry ragsdale, an attorney representing the defendants in worley's suit, said last month that england is functioning as party chair.

this table is based on a full retirement age of 66 and a full retirement age benefit of $1,000 per month. and as you can see, if you aren't likely to live beyond your mid-70s, it's almost certainly in your best interest to file at age 62 (with the caveat that you should consider how that would affect your surviving spouse). on the other end of the spectrum, if you're fortunate enough that you'll probably live well into your 80s or beyond, delaying social security will almost certainly mean more total income, not to mention a bigger check later in life when your ability to earn a wage is far more limited.

minneapolis:two prominent leaders have proposed an amendment to the minnesota constitution aimed at closing the state's dismal academic achievement gap. the proposal comes from alan page, a former minnesota supreme court justice, and neel kashkari, president of the federal reserve bank of minneapolis. they want to change the state's constitution to guarantee all children the fundamental right to a quality public education, the star tribune reported wednesday. page and kashkari told the newspaper in an interview that making quality education a civil right for all children is the catalyst that's needed to break the logjam that has blocked effective reform. even though minnesota has spent billions of dollars to solve the problem, the state still has some of the worst educational disparities in the nation, as measured by race and socioeconomic status, according to the federal reserve bank of minneapolis. courts have interpreted the minnesota constitution as giving students a fundamental right to an adequate education. page and kashkari want to raise that standard to a quality education. page and kashkari said similar amendments have driven improvements in other states. to amend the minnesota constitution, they will need the legislature's approval to put the question to voters. the two hope to get it on the ballot this fall. but they'll face opposition from the state's powerful teachers' union, education minnesota, which said it will resist the proposal.

chicago: o'hare and midway international airports have added boxes where travelers can dispose of recreational marijuana before they board their flights. the cannabis amnesty boxes, as they're called, were installed at each airport last week, just as legal marijuana sales began in illinois. the boxes are located just past the airports' transportation security administration checkpoints, the chicago tribune reported. although police aren't targeting travelers with cannabis, and it's not illegal to have it at the airport, possessing is still illegal under federal law, and air space is regulated by the federal government, chicago police department spokeswoman maggie huynh said. the boxes give people an opportunity to ensure that they're not breaking federal law and won't run into an issue when they land at their destination, she said. the boxes are owned by the department of aviation and serviced by the police. police officers will regularly empty the boxes, file a report for the items inside and dispose of any surrendered marijuana like they would narcotics, huynh said. illinois residents can legally possess up to 30 grams of marijuana, or about an ounce, in illinois and out-of-state residents can have half that.
