Manchester: Monks at a Catholic college faced off in court Monday against the school's board of trustees in a dispute over an effort to limit the the monks' power – a move some worry could lead to increased secularization. A judge heard motions in Hillsborough Superior Court related to a lawsuit filed against the Saint Anselm College board last year. The unusual clash was set in motion when the board moved to take away the monks' ability to amend the school's bylaws. Michael Tierney, representing the monks, said the school's charter dictated that they retain the power to amend laws governing the school. The school was set up and run by Benedictine monks for 130 years. The board has argued that it has the authority under state law on nonprofit organizations to amend the bylaws. It argues the move is necessary to ensure it has the required independence for reaccreditation.

California and D.C. join a wave of states and territories that are extending time for survivors of child sexual abuse to press charges and seek civil damages. Since 2009, lawmakers in 38 states have introduced such bills, according to a USA TODAY analysis.

Richmond: More people earned bachelor's degrees in the state last year than ever before. Data from the State Council of Higher Education for Virginia shows that a record number of degrees were awarded in science, technology, engineering, mathematics and health fields. During the 2018-19 school year, public and private nonprofit colleges and universities awarded 122,168 degrees and certificates – an increase of nearly 50% from a decade ago. In-state students accounted for 86,325, or more than 70%, of those awards. Bachelor's degrees accounted for 46% of the total, while graduate degrees made up 25%. Associate degrees made up 16%, and certificates made up 13%. The three most popular bachelor's degree programs remained unchanged from previous years: business administration and management; psychology; and biology/biological sciences. Those three majors accounted for 19% of all bachelor's degrees.
Atlanta: The city's police chief has ordered a halt to all police car chases after crashes that killed or injured people. I don't want to see us cost someone their life in pursuit of an auto theft person or burglar when the courts aren't even going to hold them accountable. I mean, how can we justify that? Chief Erika Shields said at a news conference. Two men were killed last month in Atlanta when their car was hit by a stolen car evading authorities, police said. The chief said the order will stay in effect while she reviews a chase policy that has been in place since 2018. Changes might include allowing only highly trained officers to take part in chases, Shields said. I have not heard of any department totally restricting pursuits without some exception for extreme situations such as active shooters or terrorists, said Jack Rinchich, president of the National Association of Chiefs of Police in Titusville, Florida.

Jackson: Foul weather has postponed plans to kill nonnative mountain goats in Grand Teton National Park. Park officials closed a large area of the Teton Range to the public this week so that hunters could shoot goats by helicopter without endangering people on the ground. Park officials now say snow and poor visibility are postponing those plans. Grand Teton spokeswoman Denise Germann said another attempt could take place in late January or early February. Mountain goats aren't native to the park and biologists worry the 100 or more goats could spread disease to native bighorn sheep. The National Park Service has contracted Oregon-based Baker Aircraft to shoot goats with nonlead shotgun or rifle rounds, the Jackson Hole News & Guide reported. Wintry weather kept Baker from making it to the area, Germann said. Park officials also plan to use volunteer hunters on the ground.

Dana Point: A baby gray whale heading south with its mother was spotted swimming alongside dolphins and sea lions off the Southern California coast. Crew members on a whale-watching boat recorded video of the pair in about 100 feet of water near Salt Creek Beach in Dana Point on Tuesday. Capt. Frank Brennan aboard Dana Wharf's Ocean Adventure estimated that the calf was just a day or so old. You could still see the fetal folds on it behind the blowhole, he said of the young whale. Brennan told the Orange County Register he followed the pair as white-sided dolphins stopped feeding to check the whales out. The dolphins and whales were then joined by a group of sea lions. The whales are migrating to the lagoons of Baja, Mexico.

It's somewhat surprising, then, to learn that despite all of these factors, more adults have a negative financial outlook than a positive one. In a recent GOBankingRates report that cited MoneyLion.com data, 28% of Americans say they feel anxious about their finances, compared with just 19% who feel optimistic. And that's a pretty startling pill to swallow, especially since most Americans also believe they'll earn more money in 2018 than they previously did.

Townsend: One of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park's most popular sites has been closed to all vehicles until repairs to a main access road tunnel are finished. The Cades Cove closure started Sunday night and is expected to last until March. Major repairs are needed for the internal drainage system in the 121-foot long Bote Mountain Tunnel on Laurel Creek Road, according to the National Park Service. The tunnel hasn't undergone significant work since it was built in 1948. The cove's campground also will be closed until March. The nearby Elkmont Campground and the Smokemont Campground in North Carolina will remain open year-round to accommodate displaced cove campers, according to WATE-TV.

Providence: Nonprofits in the state have been awarded grants totaling nearly $300,000 for outreach to boost participation in the 2020 census. The Rhode Island Foundation announced the grants Monday from the Rhode Island Census 2020 Fund, a statewide, collaborative funding initiative. The goal is to protect the $3.8 billion a year Rhode Island receives in federal funding for education, health care, transportation and housing based on census data, the foundation said. Twenty-six organizations received funding for programs to reach hard-to-count communities, including the Alliance of Rhode Island Southeast Asians for Education in Providence, Progreso Latino in Central Falls, and Meals on Wheels in Providence. Nonprofits, municipalities, houses of worship, and public agencies including libraries and schools can apply for grants in the second round of funding.
Honolulu: Road crews are working to repair a section of highway that collapsed into the ocean as some residents question the state's actions to fight road deterioration. Repair crews began working Sunday on Kamehameha Highway in Hauula after coastal erosion caused the collapse of the shoulder and part of a lane. An area north of Pokiwai Bridge will remain closed until further notice, the Hawaii Department of Transportation said. Ed Sniffen, the state deputy director for highways, estimated the repairs would cost about $120,000 and take about a week to complete. The collapsed area of road is 12 feet long and 6 feet above the beach. Inspectors found the shoulder had been undercut for approximately 20 feet in both directions, the department said.

Seattle: Mayor Jenny Durkan said Seattle will no longer use fossil fuels like natural gas to heat, cool and cook in new and substantially altered city-owned buildings and will come up with a plan by 2021 to transition all city-owned buildings to clean electric systems over time. Durkan included those directives in a Green New Deal executive order Wednesday. Neither the new KeyArena now under construction at Seattle Center nor the massive Seattle Aquarium expansion pavilion planned for construction starting next year will be covered by the city's new fossil-fuel ban, however, Durkan said. That's because the projects are underway, she said. Both city-owned structures will use a lot of energy. The $930 million new arena and 50,000-square-foot aquarium pavilion will initially be allowed to include some fossil-fuel infrastructure, though both will be included in the city's longer-term electrification plans, Durkan's office said. There's no deadline yet for all city buildings to be fossil-fuel free. Last year, the council passed a Green New Deal resolution that said Seattle would seek to eliminate climate pollutants in the city by 2030.

Casper: A school district has paid off more than $4,000 in student lunch debt after a crowd-sourced check bounced. The Casper Police Department has opened an investigation into the Feed Casper Students fundraising campaign on GoFundMe aimed at paying off the Natrona County School District's student lunch debt, The Casper Star-Tribune reports. The district accepted about $19,000 in fundraising donations in April, the same month the check bounced, school officials said. The district paid off the lunch debt for about 250 students out of its general fund, rather than reopen the outstanding debt for the students, officials said. A school district administrator made several attempts to reach the woman who started the fundraiser, Brittny French, authorities said. Multiple attempts by the Star-Tribune to contact French were unsuccessful last week, including through GoFundMe. Police asked anyone who had donated to the campaign to get in touch with police.

They were born in West Palm Beach on Dec. 27. Wolliston said Kaleb was dismissed from the hospital on Monday and she's hoping to bring Kaylen home soon. She said she recently learned that both of her grandmothers lost twin boys at birth, which makes her believe her four babies are a blessing from above. I always say that I feel like my grandmothers gave me their kids because two sets of twins and their twins passed away, she said. I feel like they just sent them down for me.

Just like many Americans, I'm struggling to make ends meet.

Rumors have swirled for decades about the identity of the man killed in Chicago and buried in Crown Hill Cemetery. Efforts allegedly made by Dillinger to alter his appearance – including plastic surgery and burning off his fingerprints with acid – have led some historians and Dillinger enthusiasts to believe the body belonged to a doppelganger. Earlier this year, the FBI took the rare step of issuing a statement regarding the case, acknowledging the common myth that there was a Dillinger lookalike killed that night, but such claims have been advanced with only circumstantial evidence.

Virginia Beach: An animal shelter took in 20 cats after they were found living in a storage unit with their owner who had recently lost her home, the adoption center said in a social media post. The woman and the felines were found living in a Virginia Beach self-storage unit this week, the city's Animal Care and Adoption Center said on Tuesday. The city doesn't have a limit on how many cats residents can own, Animal Control Supervisor Meghan Conti told The Virginian-Pilot. The adoption center said the cats were understandably scared, but are otherwise in good health and didn't show signs of neglect. They're being housed together and awaiting adoption into new homes. The animal shelter didn't say how long the cats and their owner had been living in the storage unit or what happened with the woman.

Hancock County: A huge component of a new rocket system was wheeled slowly from a New Orleans spacecraft factory on Wednesday to a barge that will float it up the Mississippi River for testing. The recently completed core stage of NASA's Space Launch System, which dwarfed the hundreds of NASA and Boeing employees, was to be taken to the Stennis Space Center in Hancock County, about 50 miles northeast of New Orleans. Space Launch System rockets are expected to take astronauts to the moon as part of NASA's Artemis program. The core stage – which measures 212 feet from end to end and more than 27 feet in diameter – was transported like a giant Carnival float from the Michoud Assembly Center in eastern New Orleans to the barge as workers took pictures. It will undergo tests at Stennis ahead of the first Artemis launch, planned for 2021, said Tony Castilleja, a systems engineer with the Boeing Space Team. The SLS core stage, with four huge engines, is the largest rocket stage NASA has assembled since the Apollo stages that first powered crewed missions to the Moon. It will be used for Artemis I, a test-flight without a crew. Artemis II is to send up a crewed spacecraft. The third mission, Artemis III, would put a man and woman on the south pole of the moon, with an eye toward a continued presence that would lead to a trip to Mars.

Great Falls: A Native American tribe has planned a celebration after recently gaining federal recognition. The Little Shell Tribe of Chippewa Indians of Montana has announced plans to host a celebration Jan. 25 in Great Falls. The celebration comes about a month after President Donald Trump signed the National Defense Authorization Act containing an amendment giving the Little Shell Tribe federal recognition, officials said. The free celebration will be held at the Holiday Inn from 5 to 10 p.m. and is open to the public, tribal council members said. The celebration includes dinner, traditional music played by fiddlers, and speeches by dignitaries and council members. Other tribes are expected to be represented at the event, councilmembers said. The public is also invited to attend a pipe ceremony the same day at 1 p.m. at the Shawn Gilbert Event Center, tribal members said.
Williston: A proposed gas plant could help reduce wasteful flaring in the northern region of the Bakken oil patch. Outrigger Energy of Denver wants to build a plant in Williams County west of Williston capable of processing up to 450 million cubic feet of gas per day. Crude oil prices surpassing $50 per barrel have attracted the company to oil drilling in the Bakken, according to CEO Dave Keanini. The company also plans to build a 70-mile gathering pipeline that starts in eastern Williams County and ends at the processing plant, according to the Bismarck Tribune. It has entered into an agreement with XTO Energy to transport gas from the producer's wells. The Outrigger processing plant is the sixth facility of its kind in the works in North Dakota. Officials hope the investments will significantly curb the amount of excess gas that is flared in the state.

Killingly: The Killingly Board of Education voted to bring back a controversial Native American-themed athletic mascot. The board decided to reinstate the Redmen mascot at a meeting Wednesday, the Norwich Bulletin reported. In October, the same board approved the new Red Hawks mascot after it was overwhelmingly approved by students at Killingly High School. Several students, faculty members and local tribal representatives have criticized the original mascot as inappropriate, racist and stereotypical. It featured the profile of a Native American man wearing a headdress. Newly elected Republican members of the education board made a campaign promise to reverse the change. The board, with a Republican majority, held a public meeting on Dec. 11 where it voted to remove the Red Hawks mascot but tied on whether to return to the original mascot. More than a dozen people, including students and Native American representatives, spoke out against the decision to keep original mascot at the meeting. They also sought some other compromise, the Bulletin reported. At the Wednesday meeting, the board also voted to appoint a subcommittee that would update the high school logo so it doesn't portray Native Americans in a negative stereotype.

Tallahassee: The state's environmental cops fine polluters today less than half as much as they did a decade ago, before former Gov. Rick Scott took office and shifted state regulators to a more pro-business posture, state data shows. Through the first week of December, the Florida Department of Environmental Protection assessed 352 penalties in 2019, totaling $4.4 million in fines for violating air, water, sewer, petroleum tank and other state environmental regulations. By comparison, in 2010 DEP assessed 1,249 environmental penalties in Florida, totaling $10.2 million – more than 3 1/ 2 times as many penalties and double the fines assessed this year. DEP holds that the lower figures prove the success of the agency's mission to help businesses, utilities and other polluters to clean up their acts. But the agency's critics say the steep drop in fines reflects an ever-softening stance.

Macungie: Mack Trucks plans to lay off 305 employees at its assembly plant north of Philadelphia, the company said Wednesday. Mack blamed the layoffs at its Lower Macungue Township plant on a downturn in the heavy-duty truck market. They will take effect at the end of February, The (Allentown) Morning Call reported. The cuts represent about 13% of the plant's payroll. We regret having to take this action, but we operate in a cyclical market, and after two years of extremely high volumes, we have to adapt to reduced market demand, said Mack spokesman Christopher Heffner. Employees, most of whom belong to the auto workers union, were informed of the news Wednesday. The cuts were expected after Mack said last month that it would need to slow production to cope with reduced demand. Mack expects the North American truck market to be down nearly 30% this year.

Reno: An Australian mining company has agreed to a moratorium on new activities at a planned lithium mine in the state in exchange for conservationists dropping a lawsuit to protect a rare desert wildflower they say doesn't exist anywhere else in the world. The Center for Biological Diversity filed notice in U.S. District Court in Las Vegas that it was voluntarily withdrawing its lawsuit against the Trump administration seeking a ban on all drilling and road building at the site on federal land as a result of the newly reached agreement with Ioneer USA Corp. The center filed an emergency petition with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in October to list Tiehm's buckwheat as an endangered species. The lawsuit filed weeks later accused the Bureau of Land Management of illegally dividing the mining operations into two separate projects so as to bypass its own regulations for any land disturbances larger than 5 acres.

Those steps collectively raise premiums by as much as 30% for families.

The rules as currently written require that once OCE has referred a matter to Ethics for further review — since OCE has no ability to rule on violations or issue punishments — the Ethics Committee has to publicly release the report even if it has made no decision on guilt or innocence. The most common action by Ethics is to release the report and declare that they are still looking onto the matter ... and no conclusion is ever announced. The new rules proposal raised questions about how much of the OCE work would still be public.

First, create a budget, which will help you see where your money is going and how much room for savings your expenses allow for. Only once you have that budget in place will you be in a good position to identify which bills to slash.

The biggest worry for bank stocks is the prospect of Fed rate hikes getting pushed out, says Ralph Bassett, head of North American equities at Aberdeen Asset Management.

The more ominous problem here is that the Trump team's deceptiveness looks much more like wag the dog than the elimination of a clear and present danger. It might well be true that any day when Soleimani is taken out of action is a good day. But Trump — like Bill Clinton ordering an airstrike on Iraq the day after the Republican House accused him of high crimes and misdemeanors in 1998 — is arguing that military necessity forced him to act.

Honolulu: Improvements in programs to address Hawaii's homeless population have allowed the state to fall from first to second in the national ranking of per capita homelessness, officials said. State homeless coordinator Scott Morishige informed lawmakers Tuesday that New York now holds the top position, The Honolulu Star-Advertiser reported. Morishige presented the data to the Hawaii Homelessness Summit for both houses of the state Legislature. The summit is designed to help lawmakers evaluate the success of programs funded by the Legislature and consider other solutions to homelessness. Placements of homeless people into permanent housing in Hawaii increased in 2018 from nearly 4,000 to more than 7,000. The state appears to have exceeded 7,000 placements again in 2019, he said. After trending upward from 2013 to 2016, Hawaii's official Point in Time count of homeless people showed a decrease over the past four years. The decrease corresponds with similar increases in housing placements over the same period and is reflected in other surveys related to homelessness, Morishige said. There has also been a nearly 40% reduction in homeless families with minor children since 2016.

Montpelier: The number of fatalities on Vermont roadways went down by about 30% in 2019, according to state figures. Vermont State Police and the Vermont Agency of Transportation released figures that show the tentative number of deaths on the state's roads in 2019 was 47, down from 69 in 2018, the Times Argus reported. But state officials are not sure what to attribute the decrease in road fatalities. Lt. Tara Thomas, commander of safety programs for the Vermont State Police, said the reduction was unexplainable. Thomas said that 47 deaths are still too many for state police. We wish we knew what the formula was to keep the numbers down. 47 is still too many for the state police. That's 47 families that don't have a loved one with them, so in our eyes, it's still high. We're averaging just way too many each month, she said. The 47 deaths resulted from 44 crashes last year. The figure is tentative because if someone dies as a result of injuries from a 2019 crash within the first 30 days of 2020, that person's death would be added to the list of fatalities from 2019. Vermont also had no fatal crashes reported in the state on any of the holidays last year.

Jackson:A prison inmate said he was transferred and lost his job as a tutor after complaining that teachers were supplying answers to a high school equivalency test. U.S. District Judge Mark Goldsmith declined to dismiss the lawsuit, the Detroit Free Press reported Thursday, which means it will go to trial or be settled. Munin Kathawa, 57, who is serving a life sentence for murder, sued five people, including a deputy warden, claiming his rights were violated. He said he reported his concerns about cheating in 2018 to a state lawmaker and a Catholic priest. Corrections Department spokesman Chris Gautz declined to comment. Kathawa said he was falsely accused of being a safety threat and removed as a tutor. A teacher, Laura Bendele, testified in a deposition that she was pressured by officials to stick to that story but refused.

Portland: The state with the largest fishing industry for lobster likely experienced a drop in catch last year, but the dip in harvest was probably not as dramatic as initially feared. Patrick Keliher, commissioner of the Maine Department of Marine Resources, told Maine Public that initial reports showed a harvest of about 100 million pounds of lobster. That would be a drop of nearly 20 million pounds from last year, but still a much higher number than the industry was used to in the 1990s and 2000. The season initially looked like it could produce a substantial drop in catch, but Maine's lobstermen finished strong, Keliher said. The price for Maine lobster was also strong, he said. It's possible for the state's lobster catch to be slowed by lobsters shedding their shells late in the year. The biggest surge in catch happens after many lobsters lose their old shells and reach legal harvesting size.

Trump's actions: With his executive order last year, Trump signaled that he would undermine the ACA's protections by allowing insurance plans that don't have to cover even the basics. Trump calculated that would bring the Democrats to the table, but Democrats are wise to stay away on those terms. Early in 2018, the administration has to decide if and how to implement this executive order as well as whether to approve requests from states to impose work requirements or require drug testing for Medicaid beneficiaries. These decisions are likely to draw a range of legal challenges and protests. Trump may welcome the controversy, and if he proceeds with more unilateral action, he and the entire party will certainly get it.

Casper: A school district has paid off more than $4,000 in student lunch debt after a crowd-sourced check bounced. The Casper Police Department has opened an investigation into the Feed Casper Students fundraising campaign on GoFundMe aimed at paying off the Natrona County School District's student lunch debt, The Casper Star-Tribune reports. The district accepted about $19,000 in fundraising donations in April, the same month the check bounced, school officials said. The district paid off the lunch debt for about 250 students out of its general fund, rather than reopen the outstanding debt for the students, officials said. A school district administrator made several attempts to reach the woman who started the fundraiser, Brittny French, authorities said. Multiple attempts by the Star-Tribune to contact French were unsuccessful last week, including through GoFundMe. Police asked anyone who had donated to the campaign to get in touch with police.

Even some of the harshest critics of the Iran nuclear deal now understand that the perfect is, indeed, the enemy of the good; that in volatile international situations, solid, incremental progress trumps chaos. The Iran nuclear deal was meant to prevent Tehran from getting a nuclear weapon. Such a capability would project even greater Iranian power in the Middle East and deter the ability of Washington and its allies to build a lasting peace in the region.

A future force of 5,000 U.S. troops in Afghanistan, aided by 2,000 to 3,000 other NATO military personnel, would contrast with the late-2019 figure of 13,000 GIs there. It would be 95% less than the 100,000 U.S. troops commanded there by Gen. David Petraeus and then Gen. John Allen at the peak of the American presence in 2010-11. This lower level could probably achieved by 2022, though the glide path could be slowed if conditions required.

Baltimore: A 24-year-old chimpanzee at the Maryland Zoo has given birth to a girl. The zoo welcomed the 2-pound new addition on Dec. 29, officials announced in a statement on Wednesday. The first-time mother, Raven, and the newborn chimp have spent their first week together bonding in a quiet off-exhibit area, according to the statement. The baby chimp will go on display for the public following the short period of bonding. Raven was the second chimpanzee to give birth at the zoo outside of Baltimore in 2019. Bunny, gave birth to Lola in July. There are now 14 chimps in its care, and officials said the births have been important as reproduction of the species at zoos nationwide has slowed in recent years. Officials haven't decided on a name, a spokeswoman for the Maryland Zoo told The Washington Post. Sometimes the animal's care team chooses a name and other times there's a contest that involves the public, she added.
For decades, United States policy has been that a nuclear North Korea is unacceptable. Yet Washington keeps on accepting it. Prior to its first surprise nuclear test in 2006, the U.S. said it would not permit North Korea to have a nuclear weapon. After the test, the policy became to not let the Kim regime have any more nuclear weapons. And after subsequent tests in 2009 and 2013, the government played the same tape over and over. The White House says it is deeply concerned; the North Koreans say, you should be.
Of course, Trump administration policy could change dramatically before Election Day as well. Absent a comprehensive peace deal with the Taliban by next fall that also involves the Afghan government — an extreme long shot, given the lukewarm interest that the Taliban as well as their sometimes-sponsor Pakistan likely have in the idea — President Trump will face a dilemma. He will have to choose between his original campaign promise to end forever wars and leave Afghanistan, on the one hand, or his promise to defeat global terrorism and protect America on the other.
The truth, after all, should be enough. Soleimani helped organize and plan attacks that killed thousands, and he helped to turn entire regions of the Middle East into a charnel house.

Indianapolis:Family members of Hoosier bank robber John Dillinger have dropped their lawsuit seeking rights to open his grave at Crown Hill Cemetery. The lawsuit, filed in August by Dillinger nephew Michael C. Thompson, was initially dismissed without prejudice by Marion County Superior Court Judge Timothy Oakes on Dec. 4, but Thompson was granted an extension of time to file an amended complaint. That deadline would have been Jan. 15. But on Tuesday, a motion to voluntarily dismiss the lawsuit was submitted to the court on Thompson's behalf. It has been granted, effectively putting the issue to rest. Since the lawsuit was dismissed without prejudice, the family could revisit the issue in court. It's unknown what Thompson's plans are moving forward or how this affects the status of the proposed documentary. Attempts to reach the Thompson family and their attorney, Andrea Simmons, were unsuccessful. Crown Hill Cemetery objected to plans to exhume Dillinger's body, citing a duty to ensure the safety and integrity of the grounds and those buried there. In a written statement sent to IndyStar, cemetery management said they were pleased the matter has been resolved. Dillinger, born in Indianapolis in 1903, gained notoriety after a string of bank robberies in 1933 and several high-profile escapes from police custody. His name became legend when FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover labeled him Public Enemy No. 1, but his life of crime came to an end when police and federal agents ambushed him outside Chicago's Biograph Theater on July 22, 1934.

Portland: Lawmakers have approved a $4.5 million contract with a hazardous waste removal company to clean up homeless encampments across the city. The City Commission unanimously voted to give the contract to Rapid Response Bio Clean on Wednesday after the agenda item was pulled late last month over concerns from homeless people and their advocates, Oregon Public Broadcasting reported Thursday. Opponents said the cleanups are traumatic for homeless residents and cause them to lose their property. Under a modified deal, Rapid Response workers will get training in nonviolent conflict resolution and to carry naloxone, an injection that can reverse drug overdoses. The workers generally disposed of the needles, shopping carts, trash and human waste that are left behind after a homeless camp is cleared. Notices about a clean-up must be posted at least two days before the work begins. The city has contracted with Rapid Response since 2016. But in recent weeks, the contract, which expands the scope of the company's responsibilities and significantly increases the amount of money approved for campsite cleanups. Mayor Ted Wheeler said the new contract strikes an excellent balance between keeping the city clean and respecting the homeless. Rapid Response was to resume its work by Thursday.

Montpelier: The number of fatalities on Vermont roadways went down by about 30% in 2019, according to state figures. Vermont State Police and the Vermont Agency of Transportation released figures that show the tentative number of deaths on the state's roads in 2019 was 47, down from 69 in 2018, the Times Argus reported. But state officials are not sure what to attribute the decrease in road fatalities. Lt. Tara Thomas, commander of safety programs for the Vermont State Police, said the reduction was unexplainable. Thomas said that 47 deaths are still too many for state police. We wish we knew what the formula was to keep the numbers down. 47 is still too many for the state police. That's 47 families that don't have a loved one with them, so in our eyes, it's still high. We're averaging just way too many each month, she said. The 47 deaths resulted from 44 crashes last year. The figure is tentative because if someone dies as a result of injuries from a 2019 crash within the first 30 days of 2020, that person's death would be added to the list of fatalities from 2019. Vermont also had no fatal crashes reported in the state on any of the holidays last year.
I carry the guilt every day of what I've done, the life I've taken, and the lives I've ruined, he wrote. I know I've written a lot about how I was wronged, and what I went through. I can sound like I'm trying to justify what I've done. That's not at all true. I want you to know I hate what I did. I am horrified and deeply saddened. It is reprehensible, and unjustifiable. I killed the woman who at one point I loved, and even though I hated what she did to me, I didn't hate her. I still cared for her as the person who I spent almost twenty-two years raising nine beautiful children with. Although our marriage failed, there were many good times.
Sending me to counseling was stitching up a wound week to week, to have her rip it open every time, Seidle wrote. I would go to counseling to talk about what she did, and how it upset me, to leave the sessions and have her do the same thing through to the next session. So where was the healing to take place? Tell me? Every day I missed being a part of my children's lives was a day neither her, nor anyone else could give me back. There was no amount of money, or anything else she could compensate me with for the loss of that time. Missing my son's first communion, because she couldn't have the courtesy to tell me, because she couldn't swallow her gall, couldn't ever be gotten back. Having people constantly tell me about events my children participated in, that I missed simply for her inability to be civil, or of accomplishments they had, that she wouldn't tell me about for her spite, couldn't in a lifetime be made up for. My children would never be able to say, 'my dad was always there.' Not because I left, but for her malice.
Jefferson City: Republican Gov. Mike Parson's campaign said it raised about $540,000 in recent months, outpacing the $445,000 brought in by Democratic challenger Nicole Galloway. Those numbers are dwarfed by fundraising by independent political action committees, which rose in power after voters put limits on political donations directly to candidates in 2016. There are no limits on donations to PACs, which can work to bolster a candidate but cannot coordinate with the official campaign. A PAC backing Parson raised close to $1 million in the latest reporting period, which covers October through December. Uniting Missouri PAC Chairman John Hancock said the committee has more than $5 million on hand to spend helping Parson in the gubernatorial race. A pro-Galloway PAC has not yet reported recent fundraising. The general election is Nov. 3.

The programs can be tough to implement.

That's good for children who participate, but it worries advocates who want to see language-minority students have equal access.

Anchorage: Alaska experienced its warmest year on record, according to federal climate officials.The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in its U.S. Climate report said Alaska had a statewide average temperature of 32.2 degrees, 6.2 degrees above the long-term average. It also surpassed the previous record statewide average temperature of 31.9 set in 2016, the agency said. Four of the last six years in Alaska have been record warm years, NOAA said. Ten cities experienced their warmest years ever, including Anchorage, Fairbanks, Utqiagvik, Kotzebue, King Salmon, Bethel, Northway, McGrath, Kodiak and Cold Bay. Alaska set the record despite a December that featured temperatures closer to average, NOAA said. NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Information compiled the annual summary. Among the other highlights was rainfall in other states. The contiguous 48 states experienced the second-wettest year on record with 34.78 inches, just 0.18 inches less than the total for the wettest year set in 1973.

Albuquerque: The head of New Mexico's largest Catholic diocese has issued directives aimed at protecting parishioners during flu season. Santa Fe Archbishop John Wester cited the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, saying New Mexico is one of the states experiencing widespread flu outbreaks. He's urging people not to shake hands or hug when they attend Mass. Parishioners also are being asked not to hold hands while reciting the Our Father and those who are ill should stay home to avoid spreading the virus. Priests and other church officials also are being asked to wash their hands before and after distributing communion. Wester said the directives will be revoked when the situation improves. He said the archdiocese was instituting the directives not to limit expression of faith, but rather as a preventive measure against a widespread and potentially deadly disease.

Augusta: Biologists with the state Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife are getting ready to round up some moose. Starting this week, biologists will be capturing and collaring 130 moose as Maine's moose survival study enters its sixth year and focuses on a new study area. The study began in the winter of 2014 in western Maine, and a second study area in northern Maine was added in 2016. Over five years, 475 moose were captured by helicopter-launched nets and fitted with a GPS collar. This year, the program will include a new area north of Moosehead Lake. The collars enable staff to remotely track moose locations and movements over time and to be notified if a moose dies. Adult cows are monitored each spring and summer to determine birth rates and survival rates of calves. For each collared moose, biologists collect detailed health information, including a blood sample, parasite loads, body condition and winter tick loads.

The size of the deployment could also be reduced further if the Afghan military started to develop greater strength and battlefield momentum. But for planning purposes, 5,000 for 5 would be the core premise.
Harrisburg: Voters in three Pennsylvania House districts will choose new state representatives during special elections scheduled for March, the state House speaker announced Tuesday. A top aide to Speaker Mike Turzai, R-Allegheny, said the March 17 date was chosen to fill seats that became vacant because the incumbents were elected in November to other offices. The seats were most recently held by Rep. Tedd Nesbit, R-Mercer; Rep. Gene DiGirolamo, R-Bucks; and Justin Walsh, R-Westmoreland. Nesbit and Walsh were elected to become county judges, and DiGirolamo is now a county commissioner. Rep. Tom Murt, R-Montgomery, will succeed DiGirolamo as chair of the Human Services Committee, and Rep. Gary Day, R-Lehigh, will chair Aging.
Parsi said Pompeo's claims amounted to complete nonsense and questioned why he waited until the waning days of the Trump administration to announce such potentially explosive allegations.
Serious proposals from both sides should be listened to. Republican ideas for more flexibility, more innovation and the role of personal responsibility have a place in any debate about how to improve health care. Democrats want to address drug costs. But instead of considering those ideas, the 2017 dividing line was over cuts —specifically, cutting Medicaid and the ACA to pay for corporate and personal tax cuts.
Trump portrayed a sense of unity among Republicans, though some have suggested opening portions of the government while negotiations over the wall continue.
The Washington Post, editorial: In the name of securing the border and keeping out illegal immigrants, President Trump has opted for a partial government shutdown. Irony of ironies, that shutdown has paralyzed the nation's immigration courts, shuttering many of them and allowing several hundred undocumented immigrants to dodge deportation orders each day the shutdown continues. They are among many hundreds of others whose cases will be postponed for years — or, in effect, indefinitely — for every day the closure lasts.

ACA repeal: Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C. still burns a candle for repealing and replacing the ACA. He and Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., last year proposed a system of block grants to states, with fewer strings attached to the money and fewer protections for sicker or older people.It didn't have the support to pass then.Should Congress take it up again, it will be sure to aggravate a very active and alert public in an election year. Perhaps more to the point, the Republican majority in the Senate is narrower than last year, and moderates and many conservatives aren't excited to live through the last year again.
Allegations made by Philip and Tamara Seidle in the context of their divorce or any other civil actions were not a part of this analysis, as those fall outside the purview of any law enforcement agency and cannot be verified, the prosecutor's report stated.

Even some of the harshest critics of the Iran nuclear deal now understand that the perfect is, indeed, the enemy of the good; that in volatile international situations, solid, incremental progress trumps chaos. The Iran nuclear deal was meant to prevent Tehran from getting a nuclear weapon. Such a capability would project even greater Iranian power in the Middle East and deter the ability of Washington and its allies to build a lasting peace in the region.

Sioux Falls: Legislators have invited the Crow Creek Sioux tribal chairman to deliver the annual State of the Tribes address after some tribal leaders threatened to boycott a planned address by a member of Gov. Kristi Noem's Cabinet. Lawmakers on Monday invited Lester Thompson Jr. to deliver the address next week. The move is a switch from plans to have Secretary of Tribal Relations Dave Flute give it. The annual speech is supposed to promote cooperation between the state government and the tribes but instead became a point of friction when tribal leaders objected to having a state employee give the speech. Last week, some tribal leaders said they would hold their own event called the Great Sioux Nation Tribal address. That event will still happen in Fort Pierre across the Missouri River from the Capitol but has been rescheduled for after the State of the Tribes address.
Then there were two reports of domestic incidents involving Seidle in January and February that year, according to the prosecutor's report. Tinton Falls police responded to a confrontation between Seidle and one of Chavarriaga's daughters, according to the prosecutor's report.

The purported criminal investigations were dated within the last four years of Seidle's career. Seven of the police reports correspond with short incident reports the township did provide which indicate the obscured documents relate to custody disputes.
Augusta: Biologists with the state Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife are getting ready to round up some moose. Starting this week, biologists will be capturing and collaring 130 moose as Maine's moose survival study enters its sixth year and focuses on a new study area. The study began in the winter of 2014 in western Maine, and a second study area in northern Maine was added in 2016. Over five years, 475 moose were captured by helicopter-launched nets and fitted with a GPS collar. This year, the program will include a new area north of Moosehead Lake. The collars enable staff to remotely track moose locations and movements over time and to be notified if a moose dies. Adult cows are monitored each spring and summer to determine birth rates and survival rates of calves. For each collared moose, biologists collect detailed health information, including a blood sample, parasite loads, body condition and winter tick loads.
One complaint in 2004 claims Seidle threw a man on top of the police cruiser then punched him in the jaw and kicked him in the ribs. The second claims he hit a man on a bicycle with his police car then kneed and kicked him. The official outcomes of those complaints remain obscured by Neptune's denial of records. These complaints aren't mentioned in Gramiccioni's report.

Trenton: All 37,000 of the lead water pipes in the state capital will be replaced over the next five years at an estimated cost of $150 million, Trenton officials said Thursday. The announcement comes about five months after the state's largest city, Newark, said it would speed up the replacement of its 18,000 lead lines over the next 21/ 2 years – and as the state grapples with how to move forward with its old water infrastructure. Trenton's publicly owned water utility draws water from the Delaware River and serves some 200,000 customers in the city, in addition to surrounding communities of Ewing, Hamilton, Hopewell and Lawrence. Pipes will be replaced in phases as the city and Trenton Water Works, the public utility, continue to secure funds, which are coming from the state infrastructure bank, as well a federal program, according to David Smith, the water works chief engineer. Residents must register on the utility's website and pay $1,000 to have their lines replaced, Democratic Mayor Reed Gusciora said. That's a savings, he said, because replacement typically costs about $2,000-$5,000 per line. About 7,000 people have registered to have their pipes replaced, and officials said they hope to make the replacement mandatory and at no cost at some point.
Of course, the sooner you begin socking away money for retirement, the better your chances of actually getting to leave the workforce when you want to. Keep in mind, however, that the $300 figure above doesn't even come close to maxing out an IRA or 401(k). For the former, you can contribute up to $5,500 a year if you're under 50, or $6,500 if you're 50 or older. For the latter, these limits just increased to $18,500 and $24,500, respectively. Max out for even a couple of years while contributing smaller amounts consistently, and you stand a much better shot of retiring than you'd think.

You tell me Mr. Ford. Tell me that isn't enough to bring someone to violence? I'm not saying it's right! I'm saying nothing stirs violence like a child. That's all I'm saying. I want this narrative of me being inherently violent to stop. Period. I want this idea that I was the one who needed to be stopped to cease. Tamara should have been stopped! Period. All I wanted was to share in my children's lives. If I had been allowed to, I'd have been fine. It was my right under every law on this earth, and I shouldn't have had to wait until she felt like abiding by the law.

If they say that when you find out someone's cheating on you – your husband or your wife is cheating on you, you can be driven to violence – you can't be driven to violence when your children are taken away from you and kept away from you until the point where finally, one day, you just snap? Seidle asked. Doesn't matter whether I was a cop or not, any man would have done the same thing, would have felt the same way.

President Trump rightly claimed that the law governing conflicts of interest specifically exempted him. The importance of the norm against presidents using their official positions to enrich themselves was articulated by no less than President Trump's favorite Supreme Court Justice, Antonin Scalia, who, as a Justice Department official, wrote that it would obviously be undesirable as a matter of policy for the president or vice president to engage in conduct proscribed by conflict of interest rules, whether or not they technically apply.
WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump walked out of a negotiating meeting with congressional leaders Wednesday and said he might declare a national emergency at the border after Democrats refused to yield to his demands for money for a border wall.
The strategy is twofold: High school seniors and others could apply for financial aid in the fall around the same time as they fill out applications for colleges. Plus you'd have the 2015 tax return to use when filing the FAFSA for the 2017-18 academic year.

In fact, with a handful of exceptions, the only information the public has had about House ethics cases during the past seven years has come from OCE reports. The rules as currently written require that once OCE has referred a matter to Ethics for further review — since OCE has no ability to rule on violations or issue punishments — the Ethics Committee has to publicly release the report even if it has made no decision on guilt or innocence. The most common action by Ethics is to release the report and declare that they are still looking onto the matter ... and no conclusion is ever announced. The new rules proposal raised questions about how much of the OCE work would still be public.

Trenton: The state could see a significant increase in the number of electric cars traveling on local roads under a bill gaining momentum that would expand the state's network of charging stations and give motorists a sizable rebate on a purchase or lease. The measure is seen as a cornerstone of efforts to reduce air pollution, including greenhouse gases, in a state that continually receives failing grades for smog. The bill was approved by two Assembly committees Monday as lawmakers push to pass it before the legislative session comes to a close next week. To achieve those clean air reductions, motorists will be given one of the best incentive packages in the nation to buy an electric car. At the center of the bill is a rebate of up to $5,000 intended to lower an electric vehicle's sticker price to make the sector more competitive with gasoline-powered cars.
This is just one more example of how dysfunctional the Department of Homeland Security is, Lopez said.
One additional option you can also consider is picking up some sort of side hustle.

Oklahoma City: Two days of meetings and new searches are planned this week for two 16-year-old girls missing and presumed dead for more than two decades, authorities said Monday. Investigators with the Craig County District Attorney's Office and the Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation will be joined by the U.S. Department of the Interior's Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement for Lauria Bible and Ashley Freeman in and around the former town of Picher, about 85 miles northeast of Tulsa, said district attorney spokeswoman Michelle Lowry. Lowry said a request from Republican U.S. Sen. Jim Inhofe of Oklahoma late last year prompted the federal agency's involvement. The OSMRE will use an underground camera and, if needed, lighting to examine the floors and walls of mine shafts in the area. Picher, which no longer exists as a town, was included in a federally funded buyout after a 2006 Army Corps of Engineers study revealed abandoned lead and zinc mines beneath the area had a high risk of caving in.
Fayetteville: The Washington County jail has temporarily suspended its work-release program to free up more bed space in the facility, which has been hindered by overcrowding. Washington County Sheriff Tim Helder said the move will open up 24 beds, with some detainees being released if eligible and others moved into the jail's general population. The sheriff told the Northwest Arkansas Democrat-Gazette that a recent increase in the number of sex offenders housed at the county jail prompted the decision because sex offenders must be housed separately from other detainees. The county jail has 710 beds, but because of legal requirements to separate certain detainees, it's considered full when the facility is 80% full, or at 568 detainees, the sheriff's office said. On Monday, the number of detainees reached 792, authorities said.

Sen. Jon Tester: Members of Congress who incited Capitol riot must be held accountable
Lighthizer has extensive experience striking agreements that protect some of the most important sectors of our economy, and has repeatedly fought in the private sector to prevent bad deals from hurting Americans, Trump said in a statement. He will do an amazing job helping turn around the failed trade policies which have robbed so many Americans of prosperity.
Horrific, David Mica, executive director of the Florida Petroleum Council, a division of the American Petroleum Institute, said of the decision. This agency has stated over and over again — even under this administration — how safe and efficient and how scientifically proven geological science is to do this. So I see it as a horrific political example that's only the latest in disregarding American energy security needs.
It seems a sensible solution: To slash emissions of the greenhouse gases dangerously warming the planet, force polluters to pay for what they cough out. Slapping a price on carbon, the argument goes, should prod companies and consumers to go green, from electric cars to renewable energy to diets lower in meat.

Trump has repeatedly said he wants to withdraw American troops from just about everywhere. But a withdrawal from Iraq at this moment only serves Iran's desire to exert greater control over Iraq. To much of the world, it would signal U.S. disengagement and weakness — not strength.

Nashua: Three employees were sickened by a cleaning chemical at an Amazon warehouse, fire officials said Thursday. Firefighters in Nashua responded at about 4 a.m. for a report of a chemical reaction that happened while a crew was mixing chemicals, Deputy Fire Chief Karl Gerhard told WMUR-TV. The major symptoms we saw were respiratory-related, scratchiness, coughing-related issues, Gerhard said. There was possibly an unknown chemical in the bucket already that they were putting the chemicals in, and that caused the reaction. The building was evacuated and the employees were taken to a hospital. Two were treated and released. A fire department report said after the building had been ventilated, crews monitored the building using air and chemical metering devices and found no abnormal readings. OSHA and the state fire marshal's office were notified.

Salem: Lagging snowfall early in the season could mean a tough, dry summer for farmers and ranchers around the state. The U.S. Department of Agriculture Resources Conservation Service says the amount of water from snow that's fallen in Oregon right now is just 45% of normal statewide, the Capitol Press reports. Water from melting snow is crucial for replenishing streams and reservoirs for farms and fish, particularly in eastern Oregon where the climate is drier. Every water basin is measuring below average for snow except for the Owyhee Basin in southeastern Oregon, which stands at 117% of normal. The lowest totals are in the Hood, Sandy and Lower Deschutes basins at 25% of normal and the Willamette Basin at 26%. The water year, as defined by hydrologists, begins Oct. 1 and runs through Sept. 30 of the following calendar year.
St. George: More than 16,000 public comments have been submitted for a proposal on whether to allow a highway to be built through a protected Mojave desert tortoise habitat in southern Utah, federal officials said. The proposed four-lane road has drawn criticism from conservationists because the corridor would run through land set aside to protect the tortoise. The Bureau of Land Management opened the public comment period last month and will now go through all of the comments before releasing the draft environmental impact statement, The Spectrum newspaper reported Wednesday. BLM is not permitted to say where the people submitting comments were from, but there was a mix of people who submitted comments locally and nationally, Venhuizen said. Details on the nature of the comments were not disclosed. The draft is the first step in the year-long National Environmental Policy Act, officials said. The Utah Division of Transportation and Washington County proposed building the Northern Corridor that would pass through the Red Cliffs National Conservation Area, officials said. A definite route for the road has not yet been determined, but the draft statement would take alternatives into consideration, officials said. After the department releases the draft environmental impact statement, a new 90-day public comment period will open, officials said. A decision is expected by 2021.

Little Rock: State officials announced Monday that the closure of a hog farm near the Buffalo River has been completed, months after striking a deal with the facility's owners. Arkansas Parks, Heritage and Tourism Secretary Stacy Hurst announced that the terms of the state's agreement with the owners of C&H Hog Farms Inc. are complete. The shuttered hog farm's owners have received $6.2 million in state and private funds that was held in escrow since last August, and the state in return now holds a conservation easement for the property. Under the agreement, the state will be responsible for the closure of the waste ponds at the property. Gov. Asa Hutchinson in June announced the settlement with the 6,500-hog farm in Vendor, about 95 miles northwest of Little Rock, which had been the source of controversy since it was permitted several years ago. The Nature Conservancy provided $1 million of the funding.

Charleston: The Department of Natural Resources says anglers should expect trout stocked in state waterways during the winter months to be smaller than usual. A long dry spell across the state from late summer through fall is thought to have affected the average catchable size of the fish, Jim Hedrick, the division's hatchery supervisor, told the Charleston Gazette-Mail. When the drought broke in October, the hatcheries' water supplies were replenished and allowed workers to begin feeding trout at the normal rate. But winter weather soon slowed the growth rate again, Hedrick said. The growth rate is expected to return to normal as the weather gets warmer, he said. The division is also adding feed to try to increase trout size. Hedrick said each of the 31 streams and 30 lakes designated for January stockings will receive as many pounds of fish as last year.
Social Security is structured to provide a lot of flexibility, since you can take benefits as early as age 62 or as late as age 70, depending on what works for your situation. And while the monthly benefit is significantly lower if you file early and much higher if you delay, the total dollars paid to someone who lives the average lifespan wouldn't be that much different.

This is a story about the two Phil Seidles.
Town: A man from Illinois drove through Wisconsin last week with a snowmobile strapped to the roof of his car, creating a bit of a stir. Tommy Mecher, an electrician apprentice from Chicago, said he could not afford to get a trailer and pay for the extra gas to tow his snowmobile up north. I only burned $10 more in gas on a 430-mile trip, Mecher said. I put it on the roof in Lemont, Illinois, where the snowmobile was and drove it up to Bessemer, Michigan. Snowmobiling can be an expensive pastime. There's the expensive machine, helmet and cold-weather clothing, the cost to travel to a spot with enough snow and the expenses of a weekend of roaring across groomed trails. But Mecher purchased the 1990 Polaris Indy 500 snowmobile a few weeks ago, made a few minor repairs to get it running and left for his father's house in Bessemer last Friday. Mecher said It took about an hour to load the snowmobile on the roof of his 2005 Chevy Malibu, using an old blue Ford tractor with a bucket. He modified the end of the snowmobile to keep the machine's track from caving in the roof or breaking the rear window. Mecher made a support rack of boards to shift the snowmobile's weight to the sides of the roof, away from the middle. He secured his sled with several straps that he looped through the open rear doors before tightening them and closing the doors.
Some $14 million have been invested in the TIU and it's constantly being reviewed Kermode said.

Dallas: A contempt of court charge has been dropped against the Dallas County district attorney over a television interview he gave on the eve of a high-profile murder trial involving a police officer. Both sides filed a motion to drop the contempt charge against Dallas County District Attorney John Creuzot, who gave an interview before the start of former officer Amber Guyger's murder trial despite a gag order by Judge Tammy Kemp. The white officer was convicted of murder for the shooting death of her unarmed black neighbor, Botham Jean, inside his own apartment. Kemp said in an order that the interview, in which Creuzot explained why he thought Guyger was correctly charged with murder rather than manslaughter, was a direct violation of the gag order she'd issued in the case.
By April 2010, I'd decided to leave, Seidle wrote. I had told myself I would stay for the kids, and being a Catholic, divorce was frowned upon. I was making an effort to live my faith. But I reached the point I resented being around her, and even living in my home.
Six days later, Neptune Township police responded to a confrontation at the Seidle home. Seidle said he showed up to get a training document, the prosecutor's report shows the couple got into an argument.

Evansville: A recently retired University of Southern Indiana professor already has a new job, as the state's newest poet laureate. The Indiana Arts Commission says Matthew Graham of Evansville began his two-year term as state poet laureate last week. He succeeds Adrian Matejka, an Indiana University professor. Graham's duties will include making public appearances at poetry readings or literary events and promoting poetry. Graham is the author of four books of poetry, including The Geography of Home, released in 2018. He's received a number of national, regional and local awards, including a Pushcart Prize, an Academy of American Poets Award and two grants from the Indiana Arts Commission. Graham co-founded and co-directed The Ropewalk Writers' Retreat in the historic southwestern Indiana town of New Harmony.

Montgomery: A judge on Tuesday set a final hearing in a lawsuit over control of the Alabama Democratic Party. Montgomery Circuit Judge Greg Griffin scheduled the hearing for Jan. 30. The hearing could signal that a resolution is on the way in the legal dispute over who is party chair. Longtime state party leader Nancy Worley had filed the lawsuit to block state Rep. Chris England from taking control as party chair. A revamped governing board of the party elected England as chair this fall, but Worley and her supporters maintained his election was illegitimate. The ongoing feud has pitted longtime party leaders, such as Worley and Joe Reed, against an upstart faction. The Democratic National Committee supports England and recognizes him as state chair. Barry Ragsdale, an attorney representing the defendants in Worley's suit, said last month that England is functioning as party chair.

Indianapolis:Family members of Hoosier bank robber John Dillinger have dropped their lawsuit seeking rights to open his grave at Crown Hill Cemetery. The lawsuit, filed in August by Dillinger nephew Michael C. Thompson, was initially dismissed without prejudice by Marion County Superior Court Judge Timothy Oakes on Dec. 4, but Thompson was granted an extension of time to file an amended complaint. That deadline would have been Jan. 15. But on Tuesday, a motion to voluntarily dismiss the lawsuit was submitted to the court on Thompson's behalf. It has been granted, effectively putting the issue to rest. Since the lawsuit was dismissed without prejudice, the family could revisit the issue in court. It's unknown what Thompson's plans are moving forward or how this affects the status of the proposed documentary. Attempts to reach the Thompson family and their attorney, Andrea Simmons, were unsuccessful. Crown Hill Cemetery objected to plans to exhume Dillinger's body, citing a duty to ensure the safety and integrity of the grounds and those buried there. In a written statement sent to IndyStar, cemetery management said they were pleased the matter has been resolved. Dillinger, born in Indianapolis in 1903, gained notoriety after a string of bank robberies in 1933 and several high-profile escapes from police custody. His name became legend when FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover labeled him Public Enemy No. 1, but his life of crime came to an end when police and federal agents ambushed him outside Chicago's Biograph Theater on July 22, 1934.

Reno: An Australian mining company has agreed to a moratorium on new activities at a planned lithium mine in the state in exchange for conservationists dropping a lawsuit to protect a rare desert wildflower they say doesn't exist anywhere else in the world. The Center for Biological Diversity filed notice in U.S. District Court in Las Vegas that it was voluntarily withdrawing its lawsuit against the Trump administration seeking a ban on all drilling and road building at the site on federal land as a result of the newly reached agreement with Ioneer USA Corp. The center filed an emergency petition with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in October to list Tiehm's buckwheat as an endangered species. The lawsuit filed weeks later accused the Bureau of Land Management of illegally dividing the mining operations into two separate projects so as to bypass its own regulations for any land disturbances larger than 5 acres.

Wilmington:A record number of vehicles crossed the Delaware Memorial Bridge from New Jersey into the First State last year. In 2019, 18,288,314 vehicles drove through the southbound toll plaza, cruising past the 2016 record of 17.8 million, according to the Delaware River and Bay Authority. Put another way – if you lined up every one of those cars (assuming each is an average of 14.75 feet) it would stretch more than 51,000 miles. That is twice the Earth's circumference, with a road trip from Delaware to Myrtle Beach, S.C. to spare. The bridge also had a record for a month in August, handling more than 1.8 million vehicles, surpassing the August 2003 record by 27,000. Officials said the record traffic volume could be associated with an improving economy and stable gasoline prices in addition to favorable beach weather. All those vehicles means a good chunk of change in toll revenue. Last year, the net total was an estimated $132.8 million, up roughly $27 million from the previous year. For passenger vehicles, the one-way fare is $5. Tolls are paid by vehicles traveling from New Jersey into Delaware.

Wilmington: An 18-year-old man has been charged with throwing an incendiary device at a Planned Parenthood location in the state, a federal prosecutor's office announced. Samuel James Gulick, of Middletown, was charged Monday in federal court. Security video recorded Gulick spray-painting the phrase Deus Vult, a Latin expression meaning God wills it, in red letters across the Newark building's exterior Friday, the U.S. attorney's release said. Gulick then stepped away, lit an object and threw it at the front window before running for cover. The object exploded, and a fire burned for a minute before going out, the court documents said. Gulick was arrested by the FBI on Saturday after investigators identified his car through the security video and found social media posts under his name containing the same phrase he scrawled on the building, as well as several anti-abortion messages.

I can sound like I'm trying to justify what I've done. That's not at all true. I want you to know I hate what I did. I am horrified and deeply saddened. It is reprehensible, and unjustifiable. I killed the woman who at one point I loved, and even though I hated what she did to me, I didn't hate her. I still cared for her as the person who I spent almost twenty-two years raising nine beautiful children with. Although our marriage failed, there were many good times.

The teachers who brought the current case say that decision got it wrong, because there's no real distinction between a public employee union's political and non-political activities. When bargaining for taxpayer money, everything is political: Paying teachers more means spending less on something else, which is a political decision. Furthermore, the teachers bitterly resent having to support many of the unions' workplace priorities, such as making it nearly impossible to fire bad teachers with seniority.
If instead we just wait out the next week until Joe Biden is inaugurated, what will Republicans say if Trump uses his last minutes in office, acting within his legal limits, to pardon the very insurrectionists arrested for attacking the capitol, further eroding democratic norms?

The nation's 25 right-to-work states already bar public employee unions from requiring membership or collecting agency fees, but those unions remain reasonably robust anyway. In fact, there's a compelling argument that taking away the right to force non-members to pay dues makes unions work harder to be responsive to prospective members.

Winona: An employee has been fired after tweeting criticism of his firm's holiday gift to its workers. A branch manager for Fastenal in Canada was fired just before New Year's Day after he posted a tweet chiding the company about its gift choice of barbecue sauce and a wooden grill scraper. Fastenal says the tweet violated the company's policy on social media posts. CEO Dan Florness said the policy about acceptable standards of conduct is given to every employee and posted on the company website. News of the firing has been widely shared on social media and prompted a backlash, including several website posts and phone messages that were deleted immediately because they were vulgar or threatening, Florness told the Star Tribune. Fastena'l, based in Winona, says it's the largest fastener distributor in North America.

The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports that Parson, the former Polk County sheriff, said he is monitoring a Platte County court case that could provide legal guidance to the state's prosecutors on what constitutes a game of chance versus a game of skill. The video gambling terminals, which work in a fashion similar to slot machines, have been rolled out in truck stops, gas stations and convenience stores across the state. Opponents argue that slot machines are only allowed in casinos. But backers say the machines give players the option of viewing the outcome of a wager before placing a bet. The governor's stance is in contrast to the Missouri State Highway Patrol, whose leaders have made a decision.

Boise: Gov. Brad Little says education funding will be his top priority for the state budget, continuing a theme from his just-completed first year in office. The 65-year-old Republican governor delivered his second State of the State address to lawmakers Monday in what is considered the kickoff to the legislative session. I am committed to working with you to invest in education, continue reducing regulatory burdens, and increase all Idahoans' prosperity and quality of life, Little declared. His budget limits general fund spending growth to 3.75%, a reduction from recent years. His budget leaves a surplus of $60 million and increases the state's rainy-day funds by $102 million as protection against a possible economic slowdown. The state spends about half its budget on K-12 education, or about $2 billion annually. Little's budget increases that by about 4%. In particular, Little is keen on increasing the reading ability of young students.

The New York Times, editorial: For the workers directly affected, among those facing the greatest economic uncertainty are contractors, who make up more than 40 percent of the government work force. This includes not only white-collar positions but also thousands of blue-collar jobs, such as janitors and security guards. Unlike regular government employees, many contractors may not be compensated for lost time. They could simply lose the income. Even for regular, noncontract employees, who have eventually been granted back pay after past shutdowns and can reasonably expect the same this time, the grinding anxiety and financial costs of scraping by in the meantime mount with each passing day. Many of these workers live paycheck to paycheck, with little wiggle room.

President Trump abused his office for personal gain, sowed hatred, lied to America, attempted to subvert the electoral process, and finally incited insurrection and violence. He deserves to be punished for each of those violations of the moral order, even if they are not violations of criminal statutes. But more important, we the people deserve the protection afforded by the norms that ensure our democracy — protection we can only secure by removing Trump, thereby enforcing those norms.

Minneapolis:Two prominent leaders have proposed an amendment to the Minnesota Constitution aimed at closing the state's dismal academic achievement gap. The proposal comes from Alan Page, a former Minnesota Supreme Court justice, and Neel Kashkari, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis. They want to change the state's constitution to guarantee all children the fundamental right to a quality public education, the Star Tribune reported Wednesday. Page and Kashkari told the newspaper in an interview that making quality education a civil right for all children is the catalyst that's needed to break the logjam that has blocked effective reform. Even though Minnesota has spent billions of dollars to solve the problem, the state still has some of the worst educational disparities in the nation, as measured by race and socioeconomic status, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis. Courts have interpreted the Minnesota Constitution as giving students a fundamental right to an adequate education. Page and Kashkari want to raise that standard to a quality education. Page and Kashkari said similar amendments have driven improvements in other states. To amend the Minnesota Constitution, they will need the Legislature's approval to put the question to voters. The two hope to get it on the ballot this fall. But they'll face opposition from the state's powerful teachers' union, Education Minnesota, which said it will resist the proposal.

But that latter argument ignores history, as well as the geographic suppleness of global extremist movements in general. Few saw the ISIS caliphate coming in Iraq and Syria before 2014 but then, all of a sudden, it was there. And the former argument shows a poor appreciation of how counterterrorism intelligence is developed — usually by cooperation with partners on the ground — as well as an unrealistic appreciation for the geographic remoteness or ruggedness of the Hindu Kush. Standoff counterterrorism is generally an oxymoron.

New Orleans: Residents who had real Christmas trees to celebrate the holidays are being asked to help the state's fisheries. Jefferson Parish is seeking volunteers to help with its annual Christmas tree recycling program. It's the parish's 30th year doing the project. Volunteers, especially people with shallow draft boats, are needed Feb. 1 to help move the trees out to Goose Bayou, according to Seamus Riley with the parish's Coastal Management Department. The staging area is at Cochiara's Marina in Lafitte and begins at 9 a.m. The parish collects trees from residents and uses them to protect Louisiana's coastline. The trees are used to build wave-reducing fences and to fill in man-made canals, The Times-Picayune/The New Orleans Advocate reports. In 2019, more than 6,000 Christmas trees were collected in Orleans Parish and airlifted by the Louisiana National Guard into the Bayou Sauvage National Wildlife Refuge.

Charleston: The Citadel is evaluating the college's existing buildings, infrastructure and landscapes to create a long-term plan that will guide future building projects and campus renovations. The campus master plan will create a vision of what the public military college could look like 15 years from now, The Post and Courier reports.

Omaha: Despite more than doubling releases from its reservoir system, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers still doesn't expect to eliminate all the leftover water from last year's near-record runoff that led to massive Missouri River flooding. The Corps had been discharging about twice the usual winter amount from Gavins Point Dam – the southernmost in the six-dam system. The Corps said it was raising the discharge this month to 30,000 cubic feet per second, an increase of more than 11%. Until a seasonal decrease that began in November, the amount being released had been 80,000 cubic feet per second for months, also more than twice the average. Areas along the Missouri River and its tributaries in parts of Nebraska, Kansas, Iowa and Missouri were ravaged by floodwaters in the early spring. Heavy rains later in the year reflooded many areas that had been left unprotected because of levee failures. John Remus, chief of the Corps' Missouri River management, told the Omaha World-Herald the reservoir system needs to make as much space as possible in light of the National Weather Service forecast for warmer than normal weather and higher than normal runoff in January and February. The Corps normally doesn't release more during the winter because of the potential for ice jams and dams upriver, Remus told the Associated Press on Wednesday. Once the river freezes over it essentially becomes a pipe, Remus said, limiting its capacity.

1. Head to the baggage claim office immediately if possible. You have up to 24 hours to report a claim for domestic flights and seven days for international flights on most carriers, though policies vary by airline. Southwest and JetBlue require claims within four hours; Frontier, 12 hours. It's easiest to do in person, having everything documented on-site instead of spending time on the phone and uploading claim documents online. Plus, you might be offered a replacement bag on the spot if you're not picky about a new bag.

Dana Point: A baby gray whale heading south with its mother was spotted swimming alongside dolphins and sea lions off the Southern California coast. Crew members on a whale-watching boat recorded video of the pair in about 100 feet of water near Salt Creek Beach in Dana Point on Tuesday. Capt. Frank Brennan aboard Dana Wharf's Ocean Adventure estimated that the calf was just a day or so old. You could still see the fetal folds on it behind the blowhole, he said of the young whale. Brennan told the Orange County Register he followed the pair as white-sided dolphins stopped feeding to check the whales out. The dolphins and whales were then joined by a group of sea lions. The whales are migrating to the lagoons of Baja, Mexico.

It is not too late to enforce the norms. It is not too late to make a clear and unambiguous statement about the limits of presidential behavior. Failure to do so could damage democracy for decades to come.
Instead, candidates should propose a path to downsize and then stabilize the U.S. military mission in Afghanistan so that it is roughly on the scale of the current U.S. deployment in Iraq. That would allow the United States a good chance of achieving its core counterterrorism goals in Afghanistan, as well as Pakistan. The slogan 5,000 troops for 5 years would be a reasonable distillation of the chief military elements of this approach. That time horizon would also give peace talks a realistic chance — unlike recent proposals that fancifully imagined a power-sharing accord between the Afghan government and the Taliban by the end of 2020.

He claimed in court documents that Tamara once threatened to kill him after he declined to have sex with her, she once threw items around their house, she involved the police in personal matters to embarrass him and in the past poked him in the chest and face, pushed him and slapped him. His restraining order wasn't granted either.

The teachers who brought the current case say that decision got it wrong, because there's no real distinction between a public employee union's political and non-political activities. When bargaining for taxpayer money, everything is political: Paying teachers more means spending less on something else, which is a political decision. Furthermore, the teachers bitterly resent having to support many of the unions' workplace priorities, such as making it nearly impossible to fire bad teachers with seniority.

The Obama administration has already shown its weakness in responding to Iran's deal-breaking behavior. In October Iran tested an illegal ballistic missile, and on the last day of 2015 Iran's President Hassan Rouhani ordered accelerated missile production in violation of numerous U.N. Security Council resolutions. None of this is covered by the new nuclear deal and should trigger a harsh response. However, the White House chose to delay punishing Iran for these violations, though Reuters reported that spokesman Josh Earnest said President Obama would not stand in the way if U.S. officials deemed such measures useful and if they would benefit U.S. national security. This frank abrogation of presidential leadership tells Tehran that anything goes.

Denver: An initiative to reintroduce gray wolves to the state has qualified for the November ballot. The secretary of state's office said Monday that backers of the proposal turned in sufficient valid voter signatures to qualify the measure. The gray wolf has been successfully reintroduced to a number of U.S. states. It was eradicated in Colorado in the 1940s. Colorado ranchers and other interests strongly oppose the initiative, saying it would threaten livestock as well as elk, moose, deer and other animals. The Rocky Mountain Wolf Action Fund is campaigning for the plan. It says voters have the opportunity to decide for themselves whether to introduce the wolf, whereas efforts in other states are directed by federal wildlife officials. If passed, the initiative would direct the Colorado Parks and Wildlife Commission to devise a plan to introduce wolves on public land west of the Continental Divide before 2024.
3. If wage growth remains muted (as it did in December), corporate margins are not at risk.

Portland: The state with the largest fishing industry for lobster likely experienced a drop in catch last year, but the dip in harvest was probably not as dramatic as initially feared. Patrick Keliher, commissioner of the Maine Department of Marine Resources, told Maine Public that initial reports showed a harvest of about 100 million pounds of lobster. That would be a drop of nearly 20 million pounds from last year, but still a much higher number than the industry was used to in the 1990s and 2000. The season initially looked like it could produce a substantial drop in catch, but Maine's lobstermen finished strong, Keliher said. The price for Maine lobster was also strong, he said. It's possible for the state's lobster catch to be slowed by lobsters shedding their shells late in the year. The biggest surge in catch happens after many lobsters lose their old shells and reach legal harvesting size.

Hurdles include a debate over the best way to teach English learners, public hostility against those who speak a native language other than English, shortages of bilingual teachers and even the fact that dual-language programs often grow fastest in areas where upper-income parents ask for them. That's good for children who participate, but it worries advocates who want to see language-minority students have equal access.

Sending me to counseling was stitching up a wound week to week, to have her rip it open every time, Seidle wrote. I would go to counseling to talk about what she did, and how it upset me, to leave the sessions and have her do the same thing through to the next session. So where was the healing to take place? Tell me? Every day I missed being a part of my children's lives was a day neither her, nor anyone else could give me back. There was no amount of money, or anything else she could compensate me with for the loss of that time. Missing my son's first communion, because she couldn't have the courtesy to tell me, because she couldn't swallow her gall, couldn't ever be gotten back. Having people constantly tell me about events my children participated in, that I missed simply for her inability to be civil, or of accomplishments they had, that she wouldn't tell me about for her spite, couldn't in a lifetime be made up for. My children would never be able to say, 'my dad was always there.' Not because I left, but for her malice.

Tucson: Like many city libraries, the one in downtown Tucson is a refuge for homeless people looking for a bathroom, a computer or just a respite. But staff at the Valdez Main Library want to be even more of a resource for men and women having a hard time. For more than a year now, the librarians here have been holding monthly meetings as part of the On the Streets program. Those experiencing homelessness can once a month get a meal and connect with services. The program has helped temper friction that can develop when library staffers have to approach people who are sleeping, bathing or bringing in multiple items. An average of 50 people show up for the monthly sessions. They receive a meal prepared by a local food bank and can choose to stay for the meeting. They get to shape the topics of discussion, too.

Salem: Lagging snowfall early in the season could mean a tough, dry summer for farmers and ranchers around the state. The U.S. Department of Agriculture Resources Conservation Service says the amount of water from snow that's fallen in Oregon right now is just 45% of normal statewide, the Capitol Press reports. Water from melting snow is crucial for replenishing streams and reservoirs for farms and fish, particularly in eastern Oregon where the climate is drier. Every water basin is measuring below average for snow except for the Owyhee Basin in southeastern Oregon, which stands at 117% of normal. The lowest totals are in the Hood, Sandy and Lower Deschutes basins at 25% of normal and the Willamette Basin at 26%. The water year, as defined by hydrologists, begins Oct. 1 and runs through Sept. 30 of the following calendar year.

Jackson: Prisoner advocates are calling on the federal government to investigate the state's prison system for possible civil rights violations, saying the violence of recent days highlights deliberate violations of inmates' constitutional right to be free from cruel and unusual punishment. The Southern Poverty Law Center and other groups said they were sending the letter Tuesday to the U.S. Department of Justice. The letter warns that it is no exaggeration to say more lives will be lost absent immediate intervention. U.S. Rep Bennie Thompson, Mississippi's only Democrat in Congress, called Sunday for a federal investigation after inmates were killed by fellow prisoners across three prisons and an unknown number of inmates were injured in disturbances. Mississippi prison officials, who called in state troopers and a special team of prison guards from Tennessee to help regain control of the situation, have said four of the deaths are related to violence between gangs.

Wichita: An animal rescue group said an emaciated dog is recovering after he was found in a locked kennel that was thrown in a dumpster. The Wichita Animal Action League said in a Facebook post that the pit bull was found Wednesday at an apartment complex and taken to a veterinarian, where he is eating food as fast as it's put in front of him. He is around 2 years old and weighs just over 20 pounds, less than half the amount a dog of his size should weigh.The post described the dog as very sweet and loving. The group is asking for donations for his medical care. The post said the dog is dehydrated and will need slow, small meals over a long period of time because feeding him too quickly could be dangerous. It will likely be months before he is eligible for adoption. Wichita Officer Charley Davidson said an investigation is underway.
Macungie: Mack Trucks plans to lay off 305 employees at its assembly plant north of Philadelphia, the company said Wednesday. Mack blamed the layoffs at its Lower Macungue Township plant on a downturn in the heavy-duty truck market. They will take effect at the end of February, The (Allentown) Morning Call reported. The cuts represent about 13% of the plant's payroll. We regret having to take this action, but we operate in a cyclical market, and after two years of extremely high volumes, we have to adapt to reduced market demand, said Mack spokesman Christopher Heffner. Employees, most of whom belong to the auto workers union, were informed of the news Wednesday. The cuts were expected after Mack said last month that it would need to slow production to cope with reduced demand. Mack expects the North American truck market to be down nearly 30% this year.

Instead, candidates should propose a path to downsize and then stabilize the U.S. military mission in Afghanistan so that it is roughly on the scale of the current U.S. deployment in Iraq. That would allow the United States a good chance of achieving its core counterterrorism goals in Afghanistan, as well as Pakistan. The slogan 5,000 troops for 5 years would be a reasonable distillation of the chief military elements of this approach. That time horizon would also give peace talks a realistic chance — unlike recent proposals that fancifully imagined a power-sharing accord between the Afghan government and the Taliban by the end of 2020.

Sioux Falls: Legislators have invited the Crow Creek Sioux tribal chairman to deliver the annual State of the Tribes address after some tribal leaders threatened to boycott a planned address by a member of Gov. Kristi Noem's Cabinet. Lawmakers on Monday invited Lester Thompson Jr. to deliver the address next week. The move is a switch from plans to have Secretary of Tribal Relations Dave Flute give it. The annual speech is supposed to promote cooperation between the state government and the tribes but instead became a point of friction when tribal leaders objected to having a state employee give the speech. Last week, some tribal leaders said they would hold their own event called the Great Sioux Nation Tribal address. That event will still happen in Fort Pierre across the Missouri River from the Capitol but has been rescheduled for after the State of the Tribes address.

But the report also included an admission from the non-profit groups that they regularly relied on a Turkish organization to provide free travel for Capitol Hill VIPs on trips to Turkey. That allowed me to track down 200 other trips these groups had sponsored over the past decade that had probably all violated House rules.

Helena: Urban deer culling for the fall and winter seasons was suspended by city officials amid budget cuts. The Montana Fish and Wildlife Commission recommended the city of Helena be allowed to continue culling despite budget cuts, The Helena Independent Record reported Tuesday. Former Police Chief Troy McGee made the decision to cut the program when the department was ordered to make more than $470,000 in cuts, city officials said. The program costs the city about $30,000 a year, officials said. The commission sets a quota range of up to 250 designated to maintain the population at desire levels and the city determines the exact number to cull each year within that range, officials said. This will be the first fall and winter the city has not culled deer since 2008, officials said. The city has plans to survey the deer population to determine if it will resume culling operations, Police Chief Steve Hagen said. The city has usually culled about 100 deer a year and populations have remained steady, officials said.

Kellogg:Shoshone County Sheriff Mike Gunderson told KHQ-TV that a third body buried under an avalanche at a resort was located Thursday by searchers in a helicopter. But that body has not yet been identified and authorities are not sure it is the person who was reported missing on Wednesday, Gunderson said. He said there were no other reports of missing persons on the mountain. The Silver Mountain Resort said it received a telephone call Wednesday morning from a concerned family member of the missing skier who was confirmed to be skiing there at the time of the avalanche. An avalanche happened at about 11 a.m. Tuesday on Wardner Peak, an area of the resort where the ski runs are rated at the highest difficulty level, according to resort officials. The runs had just been opened for a short period after crews performed avalanche control blasting in the area Tuesday morning, using explosives to trigger avalanches in hopes of leaving only the stable snow layers on the runs, officials said. Rescue crews and volunteers searched the avalanche area Tuesday with dogs and probes. The resort previously said five people had been recovered with minor injuries but said Wednesday afternoon that there were four people. Another skier was discovered Tuesday under about 10 feet of snow and did not survive. Yet another was found after dark. He was taken to a local hospital and pronounced dead. Experts said most avalanche survivors are dug out within 30 minutes. Names of the victims have not been released.

Cincinnati: The future of the city's only abortion clinic is in question after the state health director said the facility doesn't have enough backup doctors lined up. Because the clinic doesn't have an agreement with a nearby, private hospital to transfer patients in case of an emergency – an agreement required by state law –Planned Parenthood Southwest Ohio Region has operated the clinic under an exception known as a variance. Ohio Health Director Amy Acton recently rescinded that variance. To receive a variance, a clinic must provide a list of doctors willing to treat patients in case of emergencies. The clinic in Cincinnati informed the state in December it no longer had four backup doctors listed and requested 30 days to find a replacement physician. Acton then rescinded the clinic's variance and notified the clinic its license was in jeopardy of being revoked. The clinic, which remains open, is expected to request a hearing on the issue. It indicated it was seeking another physician. Kersha Deibel, president and chief executive officer of the Planned Parenthood region, told The Columbus Dispatch that we follow the law and are actively working to identify a new provider.
Less than a year before the shooting, Seidle tried to retire from the force in a fit of frustration over friction with his ex-wife and his deteriorating relationship with his children.

Providence: Legislative leaders said Wednesday they're working to undo a change to how medical marijuana dispensaries are regulated, to address a lawsuit by the governor. A provision in the state budget approved last year gave lawmakers the right to veto regulations imposed on the industry. Democratic Gov. Gina Raimondo sued, arguing the new law violates the state constitution's separation of powers clause because it gives lawmakers unchecked control over executive rulemaking authority. Democratic House Speaker Nicholas Mattiello and Senate President Dominick Ruggerio said Wednesday they're filing legislation to repeal the language that required lawmakers to approve rules and regulations relating to the expansion of licenses for medical marijuana dispensaries. However, they still took issue with how the Department of Business Regulation proposed regulations for dispensaries, with Mattiello calling it blatant overreach by the executive branch. The legislation not only removes the controversial provision, but also imposes limits on regulators. Among them, regulators would be barred from limiting dispensaries based on geographical zones and from preventing any center from growing its own supply of medical marijuana or limiting the number of plants. Lawmakers authorized six new medical marijuana dispensaries last year, for a total of nine.

St. George: More than 16,000 public comments have been submitted for a proposal on whether to allow a highway to be built through a protected Mojave desert tortoise habitat in southern Utah, federal officials said. The proposed four-lane road has drawn criticism from conservationists because the corridor would run through land set aside to protect the tortoise. The Bureau of Land Management opened the public comment period last month and will now go through all of the comments before releasing the draft environmental impact statement, The Spectrum newspaper reported Wednesday. BLM is not permitted to say where the people submitting comments were from, but there was a mix of people who submitted comments locally and nationally, Venhuizen said. Details on the nature of the comments were not disclosed. The draft is the first step in the year-long National Environmental Policy Act, officials said. The Utah Division of Transportation and Washington County proposed building the Northern Corridor that would pass through the Red Cliffs National Conservation Area, officials said. A definite route for the road has not yet been determined, but the draft statement would take alternatives into consideration, officials said. After the department releases the draft environmental impact statement, a new 90-day public comment period will open, officials said. A decision is expected by 2021.

Esper's honesty, especially in an administration whose hallmark is daily dissembling, is refreshing. But again, it raises the baffling problem of why the Trump team didn't just make the case that Soleimani, like Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi and others before him, was a legitimate target and that U.S. forces finally had a clear shot at him. Why lie when the truth is compelling? Why create a story that will fall apart in a matter of hours?

The more ominous problem here is that the Trump team's deceptiveness looks much more like wag the dog than the elimination of a clear and present danger. It might well be true that any day when Soleimani is taken out of action is a good day. But Trump — like Bill Clinton ordering an airstrike on Iraq the day after the Republican House accused him of high crimes and misdemeanors in 1998 — is arguing that military necessity forced him to act.

Fayetteville: The Washington County jail has temporarily suspended its work-release program to free up more bed space in the facility, which has been hindered by overcrowding. Washington County Sheriff Tim Helder said the move will open up 24 beds, with some detainees being released if eligible and others moved into the jail's general population. The sheriff told the Northwest Arkansas Democrat-Gazette that a recent increase in the number of sex offenders housed at the county jail prompted the decision because sex offenders must be housed separately from other detainees. The county jail has 710 beds, but because of legal requirements to separate certain detainees, it's considered full when the facility is 80% full, or at 568 detainees, the sheriff's office said. On Monday, the number of detainees reached 792, authorities said.

President Trump abused his office for personal gain, sowed hatred, lied to America, attempted to subvert the electoral process, and finally incited insurrection and violence.

Anchorage: Alaska experienced its warmest year on record, according to federal climate officials.The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in its U.S. Climate report said Alaska had a statewide average temperature of 32.2 degrees, 6.2 degrees above the long-term average. It also surpassed the previous record statewide average temperature of 31.9 set in 2016, the agency said. Four of the last six years in Alaska have been record warm years, NOAA said. Ten cities experienced their warmest years ever, including Anchorage, Fairbanks, Utqiagvik, Kotzebue, King Salmon, Bethel, Northway, McGrath, Kodiak and Cold Bay. Alaska set the record despite a December that featured temperatures closer to average, NOAA said. NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Information compiled the annual summary. Among the other highlights was rainfall in other states. The contiguous 48 states experienced the second-wettest year on record with 34.78 inches, just 0.18 inches less than the total for the wettest year set in 1973.

In every presidential tenure, there are important moments that reflect the personality of the chief executive, especially in times of crisis. Trump is a man who cannot tell a simple story without dishonesty, even when the facts are on his side. This deficit of character is bad enough in a single leader, but when it spreads to an entire administration, it is dangerous to national security and destructive to trust in democracy.

Hancock County: A huge component of a new rocket system was wheeled slowly from a New Orleans spacecraft factory on Wednesday to a barge that will float it up the Mississippi River for testing. The recently completed core stage of NASA's Space Launch System, which dwarfed the hundreds of NASA and Boeing employees, was to be taken to the Stennis Space Center in Hancock County, about 50 miles northeast of New Orleans. Space Launch System rockets are expected to take astronauts to the moon as part of NASA's Artemis program. The core stage – which measures 212 feet from end to end and more than 27 feet in diameter – was transported like a giant Carnival float from the Michoud Assembly Center in eastern New Orleans to the barge as workers took pictures. It will undergo tests at Stennis ahead of the first Artemis launch, planned for 2021, said Tony Castilleja, a systems engineer with the Boeing Space Team. The SLS core stage, with four huge engines, is the largest rocket stage NASA has assembled since the Apollo stages that first powered crewed missions to the Moon. It will be used for Artemis I, a test-flight without a crew. Artemis II is to send up a crewed spacecraft. The third mission, Artemis III, would put a man and woman on the south pole of the moon, with an eye toward a continued presence that would lead to a trip to Mars.

Iowa's health department said the state may consider adopting new guidelines once we have reasonable confidence that supply meets the demands of this broader eligibility criteria.

Mutko's position as deputy prime minister gives him oversight of all government sports policy in a country with a vast state-run system of sports academies and where most top coaches are government employees. However, he has taken a step back in recent months, leaving his posts as president of the Russian Football Union and chairman of the organizing committee for the World Cup.
Russian athletes are appealing against certain conditions of eligibility, but no appeal has been filed by Russia against the central point of the IOC sanctions, banning the Russian team from competing with its own flag and anthem. Mutko said that was because he believed the Court of Arbitration for Sport would dismiss any appeal.

Annapolis: A newspaper's review of state court records has found an apparent loophole that allows documents filed electronically to be kept from the public. The Capital reports court documents filed through the state's electronic record-keeping system can be made secret by attorneys, judges and clerks and their staffers without a court order or public notice. In contrast, attorneys who want a record kept secret must obtain an order from a judge when filing by paper. That process requires notice and an opportunity for any interested party to intervene. The newspaper reports it's unclear how many records have been so easily sealed across the state. In the case of the man accused of opening fire in the Annapolis newsroom in 2018, killing five employees, the newspaper learned through a public records request that almost 70% of the documents were designated confidential, keeping them from public view.

Omaha: Despite more than doubling releases from its reservoir system, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers still doesn't expect to eliminate all the leftover water from last year's near-record runoff that led to massive Missouri River flooding. The Corps had been discharging about twice the usual winter amount from Gavins Point Dam – the southernmost in the six-dam system. The Corps said it was raising the discharge this month to 30,000 cubic feet per second, an increase of more than 11%. Until a seasonal decrease that began in November, the amount being released had been 80,000 cubic feet per second for months, also more than twice the average. Areas along the Missouri River and its tributaries in parts of Nebraska, Kansas, Iowa and Missouri were ravaged by floodwaters in the early spring. Heavy rains later in the year reflooded many areas that had been left unprotected because of levee failures. John Remus, chief of the Corps' Missouri River management, told the Omaha World-Herald the reservoir system needs to make as much space as possible in light of the National Weather Service forecast for warmer than normal weather and higher than normal runoff in January and February. The Corps normally doesn't release more during the winter because of the potential for ice jams and dams upriver, Remus told the Associated Press on Wednesday. Once the river freezes over it essentially becomes a pipe, Remus said, limiting its capacity.
Killingly: The Killingly Board of Education voted to bring back a controversial Native American-themed athletic mascot. The board decided to reinstate the Redmen mascot at a meeting Wednesday, the Norwich Bulletin reported. In October, the same board approved the new Red Hawks mascot after it was overwhelmingly approved by students at Killingly High School. Several students, faculty members and local tribal representatives have criticized the original mascot as inappropriate, racist and stereotypical. It featured the profile of a Native American man wearing a headdress. Newly elected Republican members of the education board made a campaign promise to reverse the change. The board, with a Republican majority, held a public meeting on Dec. 11 where it voted to remove the Red Hawks mascot but tied on whether to return to the original mascot. More than a dozen people, including students and Native American representatives, spoke out against the decision to keep original mascot at the meeting. They also sought some other compromise, the Bulletin reported. At the Wednesday meeting, the board also voted to appoint a subcommittee that would update the high school logo so it doesn't portray Native Americans in a negative stereotype.

Denver: Wildlife officials have discovered evidence of wolves living in northwestern Colorado after hunters reported a suspected pack and residents found a scavenged elk carcass. The Colorado Parks and Wildlife Department announced the discoveries Wednesday, suggesting a pack of gray wolves might be residing in the state, The Denver Post reported. The news was first reported Tuesday by the Craig Press. The hunters provided a video shot in October of two wolves shown near the Wyoming and Utah borders, officials said. It was the first time in a few years multiple wolves were seen traveling together in Colorado, officials said. The announcement comes days after state election officials placed a measure to reintroduce wolves on this year's ballot, officials said. The ballot will ask voters whether to require state wildlife commissioners to reintroduce gray wolves by the end of 2023 on public land in western Colorado, officials said. State wildlife officials have studied the possibility of reintroducing wolves in Colorado and decided to oppose such efforts, officials said. Local leaders in 23 counties have also opposed reintroduction.

Wilmington: A popular ferry route has closed for three months to allow crews to perform repairs. The StarNews reports the N.C. Department of Transportation closed the Southport-Fort Fisher ferry beginning Monday to update ramp equipment at both ferry terminals. The department's ferry division said contractors expect work on the approximately $3 million project should be done by early April. The work comes after a failure of the ramp system on the Southport side of the ferry shut down the route for five weeks in August and September. The ferry closure will be a headache for tourists and commuters. What was a 30-minute trip over the water could take an hour-plus by road. Nearly 200,000 vehicles make the Southport-Fort Fisher crossing each year, the StarNews reports, citing state statistics.

Bismarck: A county commission that recently voted to limit how many refugees it would accept voted Monday not to put the issue before voters in a nonbinding straw poll. The Bismarck Tribune reports the five-member Burleigh County Commission voted 3-2 against a potential ballot question relating to future refugee resettlement. The vote breakdown was the same as the commission vote last month not to accept more than 25 refugees in 2020. That vote came after a four-hour meeting where several refugees, in often emotional testimony, urged the commission to continue accepting new arrivals. Had the commission voted a total ban on refugee resettlement in Burleigh County, home to about 95,000 people and the capital city of Bismarck, refugee resettlement groups said they believe it would have been be the first local government to do so since President Donald Trump gave states and counties that power.

Dallas: A contempt of court charge has been dropped against the Dallas County district attorney over a television interview he gave on the eve of a high-profile murder trial involving a police officer. Both sides filed a motion to drop the contempt charge against Dallas County District Attorney John Creuzot, who gave an interview before the start of former officer Amber Guyger's murder trial despite a gag order by Judge Tammy Kemp. The white officer was convicted of murder for the shooting death of her unarmed black neighbor, Botham Jean, inside his own apartment. Kemp said in an order that the interview, in which Creuzot explained why he thought Guyger was correctly charged with murder rather than manslaughter, was a direct violation of the gag order she'd issued in the case.

The Washington Post, editorial: In the name of securing the border and keeping out illegal immigrants, President Trump has opted for a partial government shutdown. Irony of ironies, that shutdown has paralyzed the nation's immigration courts, shuttering many of them and allowing several hundred undocumented immigrants to dodge deportation orders each day the shutdown continues. They are among many hundreds of others whose cases will be postponed for years — or, in effect, indefinitely — for every day the closure lasts.

The administration says the motive of the program is to provide more information to crime victims, Bier said. I think if that was the case, it would apply to all crime victims, not just crime victims of immigrants. So I think the motivation is the effort to portray unauthorized immigrants, and immigrants more generally, as a threat or a potential threat to Americans rather than to actually provide meaningful aid to victims of crimes.

Wichita: An animal rescue group said an emaciated dog is recovering after he was found in a locked kennel that was thrown in a dumpster. The Wichita Animal Action League said in a Facebook post that the pit bull was found Wednesday at an apartment complex and taken to a veterinarian, where he is eating food as fast as it's put in front of him. He is around 2 years old and weighs just over 20 pounds, less than half the amount a dog of his size should weigh.The post described the dog as very sweet and loving. The group is asking for donations for his medical care. The post said the dog is dehydrated and will need slow, small meals over a long period of time because feeding him too quickly could be dangerous. It will likely be months before he is eligible for adoption. Wichita Officer Charley Davidson said an investigation is underway.

Galveston: Remains found on a tiny South Pacific island where a bloody World War II battle happened have been identified as those of a missing Marine from Galveston, a federal agency said Wednesday. In a statement, the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency announced that the remains of 1st Lt. Justin G. Mills of Galveston, Texas, had been identified. The remains were found in 2015 on the island of Betio in the Tarawa Atoll of the Gilbert Islands. The remains were turned over to the DPAA laboratory for genetic identification. Mills had been missing since the November 1943 Battle for Tarawa, which left about 1,000 U.S. Marines and sailors dead and more than 2,000 more wounded from fighting that stretched over four days. The DPAA said Mills died on the battle's first day. Mills is to be buried April 29 at Arlington National Cemetery in Virginia.

Trump's actions: With his executive order last year, Trump signaled that he would undermine the ACA's protections by allowing insurance plans that don't have to cover even the basics. Trump calculated that would bring the Democrats to the table, but Democrats are wise to stay away on those terms. Early in 2018, the administration has to decide if and how to implement this executive order as well as whether to approve requests from states to impose work requirements or require drug testing for Medicaid beneficiaries. These decisions are likely to draw a range of legal challenges and protests. Trump may welcome the controversy, and if he proceeds with more unilateral action, he and the entire party will certainly get it.

Why aren't carbon prices curbing global warming? They tend to constrain emissions only in certain parts of the economy.

Little wonder that, according to World Bank figures, less than 1 percent of global emissions are subject to a carbon price that economists believe is high enough to change much.
Worse, Defense Secretary Mark Esper has said that he saw no such evidence. Making the rounds of the Sunday shows, Esper said only that the president believed the attacks were possible, and that therefore he believes the president. It is inconceivable such intelligence would have been kept from Esper, and his admission that he has not seen any such thing raises justifiable suspicions that this exquisite intelligence does not exist.
The attack that killed Soleimani came after Iran-backed militias stormed the U.S. Embassy in response to an earlier U.S. airstrike that killed at least two dozen militia fighters in sites in Iraq and Syria.

New York: The country's busiest train station would get new tracks, expanded terminals and better access for commuters under a plan announced by the governor Monday. Gov. Andrew Cuomo said he will propose acquiring the block south of Penn Station to add at least eight new underground tracks, which he said will create new, larger terminals and boost track and train capacity by 40%. More than 600,000 people pass through Penn Station daily on trains run by Amtrak, New Jersey Transit and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, operator of the Long Island Rail Road and the New York City subway system. The station has 21 tracks and operates at full capacity during peak periods, leading to rippling delays when trains or infrastructure break down. The more than century-old station was considered an architectural masterpiece in its day, and its demolition and repurposing in the 1960s provoked a public outcry.

Both the Retail Industry Leaders Association and National Retail Federation have encouraged mask policies to protect shoppers and employees.

Galveston: Remains found on a tiny South Pacific island where a bloody World War II battle happened have been identified as those of a missing Marine from Galveston, a federal agency said Wednesday. In a statement, the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency announced that the remains of 1st Lt. Justin G. Mills of Galveston, Texas, had been identified. The remains were found in 2015 on the island of Betio in the Tarawa Atoll of the Gilbert Islands. The remains were turned over to the DPAA laboratory for genetic identification. Mills had been missing since the November 1943 Battle for Tarawa, which left about 1,000 U.S. Marines and sailors dead and more than 2,000 more wounded from fighting that stretched over four days. The DPAA said Mills died on the battle's first day. Mills is to be buried April 29 at Arlington National Cemetery in Virginia.
After an accident, you might think it would be obvious what's wrong with your car and what repairs are necessary. But it turns out auto insurance companies and repair shops routinely disagree over repairs, and you should pay attention to such disputes.
• How long repairs should take. A repair shop might estimate a dent in a door will take six hours to fix, but an insurance company will think the work should be done in four, Risley says. Each extra hour is more labor cost. And each extra day adds to the insurer's bill for a rental car, if the policy pays for it.
I was very upset because I do my best to protect my privacy for my safety and I was especially upset that it was the Department of Homeland Security that gave out my personal information, she said.

Until President Donald Trump spent his term making 30,000 false and misleading statements, strong norms dictated honesty. Recall the Republican obsession with Ambassador Susan Rice correctly quoting an incorrect early intelligence community assessment of the events at Benghazi. As far as the GOP was concerned unknowingly repeating an inaccurate statement supplied by executive branch agencies, was sufficiently egregious to render her unfit for membership in the president's cabinet.
It's likely that any decision will be followed by a rush of last-minute appeals by athletes who aren't invited, particularly because the IOC wants to exclude all Russians with previous doping offenses — potentially including Kulizhnikov — not just the 43 banned from Sochi.

Chicago: O'Hare and Midway international airports have added boxes where travelers can dispose of recreational marijuana before they board their flights. The cannabis amnesty boxes, as they're called, were installed at each airport last week, just as legal marijuana sales began in Illinois. The boxes are located just past the airports' Transportation Security Administration checkpoints, the Chicago Tribune reported. Although police aren't targeting travelers with cannabis, and it's not illegal to have it at the airport, possessing is still illegal under federal law, and air space is regulated by the federal government, Chicago Police Department spokeswoman Maggie Huynh said. The boxes give people an opportunity to ensure that they're not breaking federal law and won't run into an issue when they land at their destination, she said. The boxes are owned by the Department of Aviation and serviced by the police. Police officers will regularly empty the boxes, file a report for the items inside and dispose of any surrendered marijuana like they would narcotics, Huynh said. Illinois residents can legally possess up to 30 grams of marijuana, or about an ounce, in Illinois and out-of-state residents can have half that.
In every sport we have a lot of interesting young athletes with potential and we hope they can realize their potential, Mutko said. We'd like them to compete in equal conditions.

Administration officials might have worked more closely with the Iraq government to think through the best way forward. Instead, in essence, Trump walked into Iran's trap.

Nashua: Three employees were sickened by a cleaning chemical at an Amazon warehouse, fire officials said Thursday. Firefighters in Nashua responded at about 4 a.m. for a report of a chemical reaction that happened while a crew was mixing chemicals, Deputy Fire Chief Karl Gerhard told WMUR-TV. The major symptoms we saw were respiratory-related, scratchiness, coughing-related issues, Gerhard said. There was possibly an unknown chemical in the bucket already that they were putting the chemicals in, and that caused the reaction. The building was evacuated and the employees were taken to a hospital. Two were treated and released. A fire department report said after the building had been ventilated, crews monitored the building using air and chemical metering devices and found no abnormal readings. OSHA and the state fire marshal's office were notified.
The suit, along with nearly all reviewed by USA TODAY, alleges that Boy Scouts knew it had a rampant child sexual abuse problem as far back as the 1920s but concealed the issue to protect its wholesome image.

Chapel Hill: The University of North Carolina Board of Governors violated the state's open meetings laws by secretly negotiating and approving a deal to dispose of a Confederate monument from the campus of the system's flagship school, according to a lawsuit filed by a student newspaper. DTH Media Corp., which publishes The Daily Tar Heel student newspaper on the UNC-Chapel Hill campus, wants a court to void two agreements between the Board of Governors and the state chapter of the Sons of Confederate Veterans, news outlets reported on Wednesday. The deal has been denounced by students and faculty members as paying money to support white nationalism. UNC-Chapel Hill lost a $1.5 million research grant because of it. Superior Court Judge Allen Baddour said last month that he is reconsidering his approval of the deal. Baddour approved an agreement on Nov. 27 in which the SCV agreed to take ownership of the Silent Sam statue and build a center to preserve it. The statue stood for more than a century on the Chapel Hill campus before protesters took it down in August 2018. The university agreed to put $2.5 million into a trust to help defray the costs of the new center. In addition, UNC-Chapel Hill paid the SCV about $75,000 not to display Confederate flags or similar banners on any UNC system campus during any meetings or demonstrations for five years.

New Orleans: Residents who had real Christmas trees to celebrate the holidays are being asked to help the state's fisheries. Jefferson Parish is seeking volunteers to help with its annual Christmas tree recycling program. It's the parish's 30th year doing the project. Volunteers, especially people with shallow draft boats, are needed Feb. 1 to help move the trees out to Goose Bayou, according to Seamus Riley with the parish's Coastal Management Department. The staging area is at Cochiara's Marina in Lafitte and begins at 9 a.m. The parish collects trees from residents and uses them to protect Louisiana's coastline. The trees are used to build wave-reducing fences and to fill in man-made canals, The Times-Picayune/The New Orleans Advocate reports. In 2019, more than 6,000 Christmas trees were collected in Orleans Parish and airlifted by the Louisiana National Guard into the Bayou Sauvage National Wildlife Refuge.

Virginia Beach: An animal shelter took in 20 cats after they were found living in a storage unit with their owner who had recently lost her home, the adoption center said in a social media post. The woman and the felines were found living in a Virginia Beach self-storage unit this week, the city's Animal Care and Adoption Center said on Tuesday. The city doesn't have a limit on how many cats residents can own, Animal Control Supervisor Meghan Conti told The Virginian-Pilot. The adoption center said the cats were understandably scared, but are otherwise in good health and didn't show signs of neglect. They're being housed together and awaiting adoption into new homes. The animal shelter didn't say how long the cats and their owner had been living in the storage unit or what happened with the woman.

Nonetheless, the mission has not been an abject failure. The Afghan government continues to hold all major and midsize cities as of this writing.

The Boy Scouts of America is committed to fulfilling our social and moral responsibility to fairly compensate victims who suffered abuse during their time in Scouting, the statement reads. The BSA has a multi-layered process of safeguards informed by experts, including the following, all of which act as barriers to abuse: a leadership policy that requires at least two youth-protection trained adults be present with youth at all times and bans one-on-one situations where adults would have any interactions alone with children – either in person, online or via text; a thorough screening process for adult leaders and staff, including criminal background checks and the prompt mandatory reporting of any allegation or suspicion of abuse.
The 2015 OCE report on a May 2013 trip to Azerbaijan by 10 members of Congress and 29 staffers concluded that the travel was not in fact paid for by the non-profit groups that had invited everyone, but by a foreign oil company, which is a violation of House rules. But the report also included an admission from the non-profit groups that they regularly relied on a Turkish organization to provide free travel for Capitol Hill VIPs on trips to Turkey. That allowed me to track down 200 other trips these groups had sponsored over the past decade that had probably all violated House rules.

The importance of the norm against presidents using their official positions to enrich themselves was articulated by no less than President Trump's favorite Supreme Court Justice, Antonin Scalia, who, as a Justice Department official, wrote that it would obviously be undesirable as a matter of policy for the president or vice president to engage in conduct proscribed by conflict of interest rules, whether or not they technically apply.

Lincoln: The City Council is cracking down on illegal dumping at recycling collection sites. The council voted unanimously Monday to make it illegal to put recyclables anywhere but in the proper containers at the 19 collection sites available to residents. The new ordinance also bans dumping at the sites or in the recycling containers anything that can't be recycled. People have left garbage and other objects at the sites, including hot tubs, tires, beds, televisions, wood pallets and pianos – all items that can't be recycled. Cleaning up the resulting messes fell to the businesses hosting the sites, Lincoln transportation and utilities assistant director of utilities Donna Garden told the council last month. The ordinance also applies to recycling processing centers, salvage operations and commercial composting operations. Violators face fines of up to $500 for the misdemeanor offense.

Las Vegas:Lincoln County authorities have announced that a reward is being offered for information surrounding the starvation and death of a herd of cattle. The Lincoln County sheriff's office announced the $10,000 reward Monday after the herd of six were locked into a corral in rural south Nevada, officials said. Authorities believe at least one person intentionally isolated the herd in a coral where all but one cow starved to death. The herd was in the Tule Spring area about 30 miles north of Mesquite when weather made travel to the area difficult, Sheriff Kerry Lee said. The rancher who owns the cattle last saw them alive the first week of December before the weather cleared and he returned to his cattle, authorities said. The area is a popular location for hunters, authorities said. Anyone with information or trail camera footage of vehicles in the area is asked to contact the Lincoln County sheriff's office.

New York: The country's busiest train station would get new tracks, expanded terminals and better access for commuters under a plan announced by the governor Monday. Gov. Andrew Cuomo said he will propose acquiring the block south of Penn Station to add at least eight new underground tracks, which he said will create new, larger terminals and boost track and train capacity by 40%. More than 600,000 people pass through Penn Station daily on trains run by Amtrak, New Jersey Transit and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, operator of the Long Island Rail Road and the New York City subway system. The station has 21 tracks and operates at full capacity during peak periods, leading to rippling delays when trains or infrastructure break down. The more than century-old station was considered an architectural masterpiece in its day, and its demolition and repurposing in the 1960s provoked a public outcry.

Little Rock: State officials announced Monday that the closure of a hog farm near the Buffalo River has been completed, months after striking a deal with the facility's owners. Arkansas Parks, Heritage and Tourism Secretary Stacy Hurst announced that the terms of the state's agreement with the owners of C&H Hog Farms Inc. are complete. The shuttered hog farm's owners have received $6.2 million in state and private funds that was held in escrow since last August, and the state in return now holds a conservation easement for the property. Under the agreement, the state will be responsible for the closure of the waste ponds at the property. Gov. Asa Hutchinson in June announced the settlement with the 6,500-hog farm in Vendor, about 95 miles northwest of Little Rock, which had been the source of controversy since it was permitted several years ago. The Nature Conservancy provided $1 million of the funding.

Three years before the shooting, ongoing domestic incidents were discussed by a lieutenant in Neptune and a sergeant in Tinton Falls when they handled a confrontation between the Seidles, according to a police report. Higher ranking officers in both departments were notified of the incident.
Seidle worked in patrol, later as a detective and as a sergeant. He was credited for police work in Asbury Park Press stories. He helped make arrests in a car theft ring in 1995, he was among officers who booked several people after a shooting in 1997. While patrolling in an unmarked car in 1998, he arrested a man who tried to sell him cocaine. He received a commendation from the 200 Club of Monmouth County – an organization that supports the police – in 2007 for his role as a detective on the department's quality of life team.

Why does this matter for baby boomers? Because it will affect how much of their benefit they'll receive, based on how early you retire.

Since their full retirement age is 66, they would receive 75% of their full benefit if they retired at age 62.

Chapel Hill: The University of North Carolina Board of Governors violated the state's open meetings laws by secretly negotiating and approving a deal to dispose of a Confederate monument from the campus of the system's flagship school, according to a lawsuit filed by a student newspaper. DTH Media Corp., which publishes The Daily Tar Heel student newspaper on the UNC-Chapel Hill campus, wants a court to void two agreements between the Board of Governors and the state chapter of the Sons of Confederate Veterans, news outlets reported on Wednesday. The deal has been denounced by students and faculty members as paying money to support white nationalism. UNC-Chapel Hill lost a $1.5 million research grant because of it. Superior Court Judge Allen Baddour said last month that he is reconsidering his approval of the deal. Baddour approved an agreement on Nov. 27 in which the SCV agreed to take ownership of the Silent Sam statue and build a center to preserve it. The statue stood for more than a century on the Chapel Hill campus before protesters took it down in August 2018. The university agreed to put $2.5 million into a trust to help defray the costs of the new center. In addition, UNC-Chapel Hill paid the SCV about $75,000 not to display Confederate flags or similar banners on any UNC system campus during any meetings or demonstrations for five years.

Seattle: Mayor Jenny Durkan said Seattle will no longer use fossil fuels like natural gas to heat, cool and cook in new and substantially altered city-owned buildings and will come up with a plan by 2021 to transition all city-owned buildings to clean electric systems over time. Durkan included those directives in a Green New Deal executive order Wednesday. Neither the new KeyArena now under construction at Seattle Center nor the massive Seattle Aquarium expansion pavilion planned for construction starting next year will be covered by the city's new fossil-fuel ban, however, Durkan said. That's because the projects are underway, she said. Both city-owned structures will use a lot of energy. The $930 million new arena and 50,000-square-foot aquarium pavilion will initially be allowed to include some fossil-fuel infrastructure, though both will be included in the city's longer-term electrification plans, Durkan's office said. There's no deadline yet for all city buildings to be fossil-fuel free. Last year, the council passed a Green New Deal resolution that said Seattle would seek to eliminate climate pollutants in the city by 2030.

Madison: Republicans decided Tuesday to place only President Donald Trump's name on the state's primary ballot this spring, setting up obstacles for any long-shot candidates to challenge him in the state. A committee made up of Republicans and Democrats met with state election officials in the Capitol to decide which candidates will be placed on the April 7 primary ballot. The Republican committee members submitted only Trump's name; he was approved on a unanimous voice vote. The Democratic committee members submitted 14 candidates. The Republican move will make it more difficult but not impossible for other GOP hopefuls such as former Massachusetts Gov. Bill Weld and former Illinois Rep. Joe Walsh to get on the GOP primary ballot. They could still be included if they each collect 8,000 signatures by Jan. 28.
Topeka: Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly proposed Monday that the state give itself more breathing room in its budget by slashing annual payments to its pension system for teachers and government workers, offering a new version of a plan that the Republican-controlled Legislature spiked last year. Kelly's proposal would give the state an extra 10 years to close a long-term gap in funding for the state pension system. The move would free up tens of millions of dollars each year for more than a decade, money that could be used for schools and social services. But it's not clear if her new plan will fare any better than last year's proposal – which was dead from almost the moment she presented it to lawmakers. The Kansas Public Employee Retirement System projects Kelly's proposal would increase the cost of closing the gap by a total of $4.4 billion – comparing it to extending the length of a home mortgage.

The Obama administration has already shown its weakness in responding to Iran's deal-breaking behavior. In October Iran tested an illegal ballistic missile, and on the last day of 2015 Iran's President Hassan Rouhani ordered accelerated missile production in violation of numerous U.N. Security Council resolutions. None of this is covered by the new nuclear deal and should trigger a harsh response. However, the White House chose to delay punishing Iran for these violations, though Reuters reported that spokesman Josh Earnest said President Obama would not stand in the way if U.S. officials deemed such measures useful and if they would benefit U.S. national security. This frank abrogation of presidential leadership tells Tehran that anything goes.

He referred to the developing conflict as a war, which he said began when Obama and the European Union adopted the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). Under that deal, Iran agreed to scrap its nuclear weapons program for at least 10 years in exchange for sanctions relief and the release of previously frozen funds.

However, the recent Washington Post story alleging that officials engaged in Pentagon Papers-like deception of the American public about the mission is badly misleading.

Denver: Wildlife officials have discovered evidence of wolves living in northwestern Colorado after hunters reported a suspected pack and residents found a scavenged elk carcass. The Colorado Parks and Wildlife Department announced the discoveries Wednesday, suggesting a pack of gray wolves might be residing in the state, The Denver Post reported. The news was first reported Tuesday by the Craig Press. The hunters provided a video shot in October of two wolves shown near the Wyoming and Utah borders, officials said. It was the first time in a few years multiple wolves were seen traveling together in Colorado, officials said. The announcement comes days after state election officials placed a measure to reintroduce wolves on this year's ballot, officials said. The ballot will ask voters whether to require state wildlife commissioners to reintroduce gray wolves by the end of 2023 on public land in western Colorado, officials said. State wildlife officials have studied the possibility of reintroducing wolves in Colorado and decided to oppose such efforts, officials said.

Columbia: Gov. Henry McMaster wants to expand full-day pre-kindergarten for low-income 4-year-olds to every school district across the state. The program was created in 2006 in response to a lawsuit by poorer, more rural school districts and didn't cover all the districts in the state. McMaster's $53 million proposal would expand the 4K program to the remaining 17 districts. Several are among South Carolina's largest districts, including Beaufort, Charleston, Greenville and Richland District 2, according to The Post and Courier of Charleston. McMaster told the newspaper the expansion of the 4K program is crucial to his efforts to improve education to keep economic development humming in South Carolina. Several senators and House members praised the Republican governor's proposal. Democratic Sen. Vincent Sheheen of Camden has been pushing for universal pre-kindergarten for years and said it can only improve education across all grades.

But the House Ethics Committee didn't want this report released. The committee had ordered OCE in March 2015 to drop its probe of the Azerbaijan trip, saying it had its own investigation under way, despite the fact that the committee had originally approved the trip for the entire congressional delegation, including Rep. Yvette Clarke, D-N.Y., who was a member of the Ethics Committee. But OCE refused and proceeded to publish its report over the objections of the Ethics Committee.

Trenton: The state could see a significant increase in the number of electric cars traveling on local roads under a bill gaining momentum that would expand the state's network of charging stations and give motorists a sizable rebate on a purchase or lease. The measure is seen as a cornerstone of efforts to reduce air pollution, including greenhouse gases, in a state that continually receives failing grades for smog. The bill was approved by two Assembly committees Monday as lawmakers push to pass it before the legislative session comes to a close next week. To achieve those clean air reductions, motorists will be given one of the best incentive packages in the nation to buy an electric car. At the center of the bill is a rebate of up to $5,000 intended to lower an electric vehicle's sticker price to make the sector more competitive with gasoline-powered cars.

Boston: The City Council swore in the most diverse group in its history Monday. The council made up more than half by women and people of color was ushered in by Mayor Martin Walsh during a ceremony at Faneuil Hall, the Boston Herald reports. The mayor swore in 13 members who included four new faces, which is an unusual amount of turnover for the council. Voters in November also elected the council's first Latina member, Julian Mejia, as well as district councilors Ricardo Arroyo, Kenzie Bok and Liz Breadon, the first openly gay woman to serve on the council. City Councilor Kim Janey will also make history as the third woman of color to serve as the body's president. The council was a white male bastion for decades, but Boston is now a majority minority city where whites comprise roughly 47% of the population.

Wellesley: A college employee who posted a controversial Facebook post about Iran bombing the U.S. was suspended Wednesday. Babson College's director of sustainability, Asheen Phansey, faced disciplinarian actions for a post he made on social media on Tuesday that suggested Iran list 52 American cultural sites that Iran could bomb, the Boston Herald reported. President Donald Trump posted on Twitter on Jan 4. that the U.S. has targeted 52 Iranian sites in reference to rising tensions between the countries. In the now-deleted post, Phansey wrote, In retaliation, Ayatollah Khomenei should tweet a list of 52 sites of beloved American cultural heritage that he would bomb. Um… Mall of America? Kardashian residence? In a statement Wednesday, the former employee said, I regret my bad attempt at humor.

In 2016, Niehof said U.S. immigration officers briefly detained him upon returning from a vacation abroad with his family after his immigration record was flagged because of his ex-wife's allegations.

Washington:Neighbors in a Northeast D.C. community quickly mobilized to help their neighbors who lost everything in a raging fire Sunday, WUSA-TV reported. Neighbors donated everything, from school supplies to toiletries. James Caviness-Bey was working overnights at Wal-Mart when he got word of the fire, with his family still inside their Madison street home. But on Wednesday night, he was able to thank D.C. firefighters for their quick response. He also recognized the person he calls the real hero: his wife, who ran back into their burning home when she realized their 2-year-old grandson was still inside. With the flames intensifying, Edwina Caviness-Bey dropped her grandson from the second floor window into her son's arms. From there, she had no choice but to jump out. She had second-degree burns, a fractured pelvis and wrist, and is still in the intensive care unit preparing for surgery. Caviness-Bey, his son and grandson all got to thank their neighbors Wednesday night. Even the family dog, whom for hours they thought had died in the blaze, made an appearance. Neighbors are planning another donation drive to support this family in the coming days. In the meantime, they have set up a GoFundMe page.

With a month to go before the Feb. 3 caucuses, Iowans like Peters appear to be everywhere. Multi-candidate events draw large turnouts from fervent supporters, but there are also those in the first-in-the-nation caucus state who are not sure which candidate to support.

This table is based on a full retirement age of 66 and a full retirement age benefit of $1,000 per month. And as you can see, if you aren't likely to live beyond your mid-70s, it's almost certainly in your best interest to file at age 62 (with the caveat that you should consider how that would affect your surviving spouse). On the other end of the spectrum, if you're fortunate enough that you'll probably live well into your 80s or beyond, delaying Social Security will almost certainly mean more total income, not to mention a bigger check later in life when your ability to earn a wage is far more limited.

Jonathan Bernstein, Bloomberg: What President Donald Trump has been doing so far is, as political scientist Dave Hopkins points out, following the lead of the House Freedom Caucus. But Freedom Caucus radicals don't have plans for either policy gains or public-relations wins. What they care about is proving that they're True Conservatives by differentiating themselves from mainstream Republicans. In practice, that means finding irrational but tough-sounding tactics to endorse. That's this shutdown in a nutshell. Instead of making a deal last year, when Republicans held unified control of government, Trump has chosen to negotiate from a position of relative weakness as Democrats take over the House majority.

Jonathan Bernstein, Bloomberg: What President Donald Trump has been doing so far is, as political scientist Dave Hopkins points out, following the lead of the House Freedom Caucus. But Freedom Caucus radicals don't have plans for either policy gains or public-relations wins. What they care about is proving that they're True Conservatives by differentiating themselves from mainstream Republicans. In practice, that means finding irrational but tough-sounding tactics to endorse. That's this shutdown in a nutshell. Instead of making a deal last year, when Republicans held unified control of government, Trump has chosen to negotiate from a position of relative weakness as Democrats take over the House majority.
If we can make children feel more whole and more ready and more accepted and welcomed and validate their prior knowledge and prior learning experiences, then we've gone a long way to making them ready to learn over the course of a lifetime, says Tara Fortune, immersion program director at the University of Minnesota's Center for Advanced Research on Language Acquisition.

If Flash can run ads and videos automatically, you may pick up a virus without intending to.

But consumers don't need significant wage increases to prosper. Despite unexpectedly low wage growth, the consumer is confident and still spending. That is because inflation is well below 2%, interest rates are near historic lows, tax-cuts increased net take-home pay and energy costs are muted. Since the American consumer drives two-thirds of domestic GDP growth (and 17% of global GDP growth) he or she matters to growth. And the picture looks pretty rosy.

Jackson: Prisoner advocates are calling on the federal government to investigate the state's prison system for possible civil rights violations, saying the violence of recent days highlights deliberate violations of inmates' constitutional right to be free from cruel and unusual punishment. The Southern Poverty Law Center and other groups said they were sending the letter Tuesday to the U.S. Department of Justice. The letter warns that it is no exaggeration to say more lives will be lost absent immediate intervention. U.S. Rep Bennie Thompson, Mississippi's only Democrat in Congress, called Sunday for a federal investigation after inmates were killed by fellow prisoners across three prisons and an unknown number of inmates were injured in disturbances. Mississippi prison officials, who called in state troopers and a special team of prison guards from Tennessee to help regain control of the situation, have said four of the deaths are related to violence between gangs.

Atlanta: The city's police chief has ordered a halt to all police car chases after crashes that killed or injured people. I don't want to see us cost someone their life in pursuit of an auto theft person or burglar when the courts aren't even going to hold them accountable. I mean, how can we justify that? Chief Erika Shields said at a news conference. Two men were killed last month in Atlanta when their car was hit by a stolen car evading authorities, police said. The chief said the order will stay in effect while she reviews a chase policy that has been in place since 2018. Changes might include allowing only highly trained officers to take part in chases, Shields said. I have not heard of any department totally restricting pursuits without some exception for extreme situations such as active shooters or terrorists, said Jack Rinchich, president of the National Association of Chiefs of Police in Titusville, Florida.

And even as Washington was confronting Iran over its nuclear program and malign behavior elsewhere, we maintained an uneasy coexistence in Iraq, where Tehran holds considerable sway.

Honolulu: Road crews are working to repair a section of highway that collapsed into the ocean as some residents question the state's actions to fight road deterioration. Repair crews began working Sunday on Kamehameha Highway in Hauula after coastal erosion caused the collapse of the shoulder and part of a lane.

Ed Sniffen, the state deputy director for highways, estimated the repairs would cost about $120,000 and take about a week to complete. The collapsed area of road is 12 feet long and 6 feet above the beach. Inspectors found the shoulder had been undercut for approximately 20 feet in both directions, the department said.

Kellogg:Shoshone County Sheriff Mike Gunderson told KHQ-TV that a third body buried under an avalanche at a resort was located Thursday by searchers in a helicopter. But that body has not yet been identified and authorities are not sure it is the person who was reported missing on Wednesday, Gunderson said. He said there were no other reports of missing persons on the mountain. The Silver Mountain Resort said it received a telephone call Wednesday morning from a concerned family member of the missing skier who was confirmed to be skiing there at the time of the avalanche. An avalanche happened at about 11 a.m. Tuesday on Wardner Peak, an area of the resort where the ski runs are rated at the highest difficulty level, according to resort officials. The runs had just been opened for a short period after crews performed avalanche control blasting in the area Tuesday morning, using explosives to trigger avalanches in hopes of leaving only the stable snow layers on the runs, officials said. Rescue crews and volunteers searched the avalanche area Tuesday with dogs and probes. The resort previously said five people had been recovered with minor injuries but said Wednesday afternoon that there were four people. Another skier was discovered Tuesday under about 10 feet of snow and did not survive. Yet another was found after dark. He was taken to a local hospital and pronounced dead. Experts said most avalanche survivors are dug out within 30 minutes. Names of the victims have not been released.

The tunnel hasn't undergone significant work since it was built in 1948. The cove's campground also will be closed until March.

Lowry said a request from Republican U.S. Sen. Jim Inhofe of Oklahoma late last year prompted the federal agency's involvement. The OSMRE will use an underground camera and, if needed, lighting to examine the floors and walls of mine shafts in the area. Picher, which no longer exists as a town, was included in a federally funded buyout after a 2006 Army Corps of Engineers study revealed abandoned lead and zinc mines beneath the area had a high risk of caving in.

Des Moines: To keep up with a sharp increase in passengers, Des Moines International Airport is adding gates to its planned new terminal years before construction even begins. Planned with 14 gates when it opens in 2028, the terminal will instead need 18 to handle the additional load, airport officials said Monday. The extra four gates hadn't been slated to be built until 2040. The airport will have a combined $60 million in additional capacity-boosting projects, including the $40 million cost of the extra gates. But because the growth in passenger traffic has generated additional revenue, the shortfall in funding for the $500 million project remains at $194 million – similar to two years ago, when airport leaders were looking at scaling back the project to cut costs.

A future force of 5,000 U.S. troops in Afghanistan, aided by 2,000 to 3,000 other NATO military personnel, would contrast with the late-2019 figure of 13,000 GIs there. It would be 95% less than the 100,000 U.S. troops commanded there by Gen. David Petraeus and then Gen. John Allen at the peak of the American presence in 2010-11. This lower level could probably achieved by 2022, though the glide path could be slowed if conditions required.
Previous administrations did not kill him only because the risks of further conflict with Iran were too high. The Trump administration — whether wisely or foolishly — took its shot and killed him.

West Palm Beach: Doctors told a woman she had a better chance of winning the lottery than of giving birth to two sets of twins in the same year. But Alexzandria Wolliston said she won the jackpot with the births of Mark and Malakhi in March and Kaylen and Kaleb in December. Oh, yes, I feel like I hit the twin lottery, Wolliston told WPTV. She said her 3-year-old daughter helped her prepare for the double dose of twins. Two months after the first set of twins arrived, Wolliston said she learned about the second set. They were born in West Palm Beach on Dec. 27. Wolliston said Kaleb was dismissed from the hospital on Monday and she's hoping to bring Kaylen home soon. She said she recently learned that both of her grandmothers lost twin boys at birth, which makes her believe her four babies are a blessing from above. I always say that I feel like my grandmothers gave me their kids because two sets of twins and their twins passed away, she said. I feel like they just sent them down for me.

Trenton: All 37,000 of the lead water pipes in the state capital will be replaced over the next five years at an estimated cost of $150 million, Trenton officials said Thursday. The announcement comes about five months after the state's largest city, Newark, said it would speed up the replacement of its 18,000 lead lines over the next 21/ 2 years – and as the state grapples with how to move forward with its old water infrastructure. Trenton's publicly owned water utility draws water from the Delaware River and serves some 200,000 customers in the city, in addition to surrounding communities of Ewing, Hamilton, Hopewell and Lawrence. Pipes will be replaced in phases as the city and Trenton Water Works, the public utility, continue to secure funds, which are coming from the state infrastructure bank, as well a federal program, according to David Smith, the water works chief engineer. Residents must register on the utility's website and pay $1,000 to have their lines replaced, Democratic Mayor Reed Gusciora said. That's a savings, he said, because replacement typically costs about $2,000-$5,000 per line. About 7,000 people have registered to have their pipes replaced, and officials said they hope to make the replacement mandatory and at no cost at some point.

One of the poorest, most technologically backward countries in the world now seems to have joined the most elite, most deadly club on the planet. North Korea has proved that talk is cheap and sanctions are useless against a country determined to go nuclear.

Columbus: Gov. Mike DeWine has asked the state's Medicaid official to look into what can be done in response to the recent increase in the number of children without health insurance. The governor's directive came after a recent report showed Ohio's uninsured rate for infants, toddlers and preschoolers is now the third-highest in the nation, with nearly 12,000 more children without coverage in 2018 than in 2016, the Columbus Dispatch reports. DeWine said he asked Medicaid Director Maureen Corcoran to see what steps that we can take to deal with this and to see if there is a way to make re-enrollment easier so that it is not a hurdle for those looking to get insured. The number of children without health insurance coverage climbed to 5% in 2018 from 3.6% in 2016, according to report released in December by the Georgetown University Center for Children and Families.

The administration says the motive of the program is to provide more information to crime victims, Bier said. I think if that was the case, it would apply to all crime victims, not just crime victims of immigrants.

Des Moines: To keep up with a sharp increase in passengers, Des Moines International Airport is adding gates to its planned new terminal years before construction even begins. Planned with 14 gates when it opens in 2028, the terminal will instead need 18 to handle the additional load, airport officials said Monday. The extra four gates hadn't been slated to be built until 2040. The airport will have a combined $60 million in additional capacity-boosting projects, including the $40 million cost of the extra gates. But because the growth in passenger traffic has generated additional revenue, the shortfall in funding for the $500 million project remains at $194 million – similar to two years ago, when airport leaders were looking at scaling back the project to cut costs.
A suit filed in Arkansas in November alleges abuse against two former Scouts who say they were assaulted by a leader who had previously been reported to the Boy Scouts of America for abuse in Georgia.

Murphy said the Trump administration's Iran policy has been a disaster from the very beginning, arguing Iran was more powerful now than when Trump took office. He said Obama and former President George W. Bush also had the opportunity to kill Soleimani but did not act on it despite the fact that he was carrying out attacks on U.S. forces, because they believed ultimately that would get more Americans killed.

Chicago: Several recreational marijuana dispensaries in the state were closed Monday, with some owners saying strong demand has caused a shortage in supplies and staff exhaustion. The legal sale of recreational cannabis began Jan. 1 in Illinois, with customers spending about $3.2 million on the first day and more than $10.8 million over five days. By comparison, Michigan, which made recreational marijuana legal Dec. 1, generated $3.1 million in the first two weeks of sales. Neal McQueeney of Midway Dispensary in Chicago said the shop stopped selling recreational product Sunday and doesn't expect to resume sales until Friday. Jason Erkes said Cresco Labs shut its Sunnyside shops in Chicago, Rockford and Champaign to all customers to reset and give his staff a break after working five consecutive 14-hour days.

Manchester: Monks at a Catholic college faced off in court Monday against the school's board of trustees in a dispute over an effort to limit the the monks' power – a move some worry could lead to increased secularization. A judge heard motions in Hillsborough Superior Court related to a lawsuit filed against the Saint Anselm College board last year. The unusual clash was set in motion when the board moved to take away the monks' ability to amend the school's bylaws. Michael Tierney, representing the monks, said the school's charter dictated that they retain the power to amend laws governing the school. The school was set up and run by Benedictine monks for 130 years. The board has argued that it has the authority under state law on nonprofit organizations to amend the bylaws. It argues the move is necessary to ensure it has the required independence for reaccreditation.
ACA fixes: If there's a way for Trump and the Republicans to score a win of sorts, it is simply by undoing some of the damage they did to the ACA in 2017. The administration stopped paying Cost-Sharing Reduction payments to insurers, designed to keep insurance affordable for low-income people, and repealed the individual mandate that encourages broad participation by both the healthy and the sick. Those steps collectively raise premiums by as much as 30% for families.

Boise: Gov. Brad Little says education funding will be his top priority for the state budget, continuing a theme from his just-completed first year in office. The 65-year-old Republican governor delivered his second State of the State address to lawmakers Monday in what is considered the kickoff to the legislative session. I am committed to working with you to invest in education, continue reducing regulatory burdens, and increase all Idahoans' prosperity and quality of life, Little declared. His budget limits general fund spending growth to 3.75%, a reduction from recent years. His budget leaves a surplus of $60 million and increases the state's rainy-day funds by $102 million as protection against a possible economic slowdown. The state spends about half its budget on K-12 education, or about $2 billion annually. Little's budget increases that by about 4%. In particular, Little is keen on increasing the reading ability of young students.
Concerted action to curtail Iran's malign behavior, human rights abuses, unlawful detention of Americans and state sponsorship of terrorism remains very necessary. Had Trump stayed in the Iran deal and not only used the remaining sanctions in the U.S. toolbox but also built a coalition of diplomatic partners to challenge Iran to truly join the community of nations, we would be in a very different place today.
But Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., who sits on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said Sunday on CBS News' Face the Nation that Trump does not have authorization from Congress to go to war with Iran and the killing of Soleimani – which he called an assassination – potentially sets us on a course to do just that.
Lincoln: The City Council is cracking down on illegal dumping at recycling collection sites. The council voted unanimously Monday to make it illegal to put recyclables anywhere but in the proper containers at the 19 collection sites available to residents. The new ordinance also bans dumping at the sites or in the recycling containers anything that can't be recycled. People have left garbage and other objects at the sites, including hot tubs, tires, beds, televisions, wood pallets and pianos – all items that can't be recycled. Cleaning up the resulting messes fell to the businesses hosting the sites, Lincoln transportation and utilities assistant director of utilities Donna Garden told the council last month. The ordinance also applies to recycling processing centers, salvage operations and commercial composting operations. Violators face fines of up to $500 for the misdemeanor offense.

Wilmington: A popular ferry route has closed for three months to allow crews to perform repairs. The StarNews reports the N.C. Department of Transportation closed the Southport-Fort Fisher ferry beginning Monday to update ramp equipment at both ferry terminals. The department's ferry division said contractors expect work on the approximately $3 million project should be done by early April. The work comes after a failure of the ramp system on the Southport side of the ferry shut down the route for five weeks in August and September. The ferry closure will be a headache for tourists and commuters. What was a 30-minute trip over the water could take an hour-plus by road. Nearly 200,000 vehicles make the Southport-Fort Fisher crossing each year, the StarNews reports, citing state statistics.

The New York Times, editorial: For the workers directly affected, among those facing the greatest economic uncertainty are contractors, who make up more than 40 percent of the government work force. This includes not only white-collar positions but also thousands of blue-collar jobs, such as janitors and security guards. Unlike regular government employees, many contractors may not be compensated for lost time. They could simply lose the income. Even for regular, noncontract employees, who have eventually been granted back pay after past shutdowns and can reasonably expect the same this time, the grinding anxiety and financial costs of scraping by in the meantime mount with each passing day. Many of these workers live paycheck to paycheck, with little wiggle room.

Atlanta: Leaders of the African Methodist Episcopal Church forgave $4 million in debt owed by a college it founded in Atlanta. The financial boost for Morris Brown College was announced Tuesday night, news outlets reported. In exchange, the college agreed to establish a $1.5 million scholarship for AME church members. Morris Brown College lost its accreditation in 2002. Interim president Kevin James launched an effort last year to become accredited again. An official told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution that the debt forgiveness will help. The Georgia Conference of the African Methodist Episcopal Church founded Morris Brown College in 1881, the newspaper reported. The college has about 40 students enrolled, according to news outlets.
New Orleans: John White, who helped strengthen the role of charter schools, backed a taxpayer-funded tuition voucher program for private schools and oversaw overhauls of the state's school accountability efforts, said he is stepping down as Louisiana's education superintendent. He told state Board of Elementary and Secondary Education members in a letter that he will leave the job March 11. He did not state his reasons. The board said a search for his replacement would begin immediately and the process will be discussed at an upcoming meeting. White can point to numerous improvements made during his eight years as education chief, including improved graduation rates and better performance on college preparation tests. His tenure was also marked by a rocky relationship with teacher unions and Gov. John Bel Edwards. And the state continues to lag others in nationwide education rankings. Still, his departure comes as his job seemed secure, following the election last year of a slate of state education board members who were backed by the state's business lobby, which was supportive of White. Although he didn't discuss his future, The Advocate reported in April that he had quietly co-founded a national nonprofit group, Propel America, aimed at connecting low-income high school graduates with solid jobs. White has been education superintendent since 2012 but he had been working on a month-to-month basis since 2016. Although he had the support of a majority of the 11-member state Board of Elementary and Secondary Education, he lacked the two-thirds majority needed to get a new contract.

Williston: A proposed gas plant could help reduce wasteful flaring in the northern region of the Bakken oil patch. Outrigger Energy of Denver wants to build a plant in Williams County west of Williston capable of processing up to 450 million cubic feet of gas per day. Crude oil prices surpassing $50 per barrel have attracted the company to oil drilling in the Bakken, according to CEO Dave Keanini. The company also plans to build a 70-mile gathering pipeline that starts in eastern Williams County and ends at the processing plant, according to the Bismarck Tribune. It has entered into an agreement with XTO Energy to transport gas from the producer's wells. The Outrigger processing plant is the sixth facility of its kind in the works in North Dakota. Officials hope the investments will significantly curb the amount of excess gas that is flared in the state.

Of course, Trump administration policy could change dramatically before Election Day as well. Absent a comprehensive peace deal with the Taliban by next fall that also involves the Afghan government — an extreme long shot, given the lukewarm interest that the Taliban as well as their sometimes-sponsor Pakistan likely have in the idea — President Trump will face a dilemma. He will have to choose between his original campaign promise to end forever wars and leave Afghanistan, on the one hand, or his promise to defeat global terrorism and protect America on the other.

The Humane Society said it was the first year that cat adoptions outnumbered dogs. In total, 3,424 cats found new homes compared to 3,398 dogs. Adoption officials said cat adoptions have been increasing over the past few years. Humane Society spokeswoman Andrea Blair said cats are popular with seniors, busy families, renters and people who travel for work. Blair said 1,583 cat adoptions took place at Purrfect Day Café, which opened in August 2018. The cafe serves coffee, snacks and cocktails while patrons interact with adoptable kittens and cats. Total adoptions were up 816 from 2018.
Spring Hill:General Motors and United Auto Workers Local 1853 have agreed to convert 157 local temporary workers to permanent status effective Feb. 3. The decision resolves a dispute between GM in Spring Hill and the union over the hiring of new temporary workers, Chairman Mike Herron told The Daily Herald on Thursday. Under the new collective bargaining agreement ratified in October, GM agreed to convert temporary workers with three years of continual service to permanent status. None of the temporary workers in Spring Hill had three consecutive years of service because of layoffs in 2017 and 2018, creating a short-lived problem. The deal between GM and Local 1853 allows the plant to begin bringing in new temporary workers. The company has started taking applications, seeking 154 employees for those positions. On Monday, GM announced it was making 930 temporary workers permanent at 30 of its 52 UAW-represented plants across the country. Ford also moved 592 temps to full-time status. At GM's Flint Assembly in Michigan, 250 were told at a meeting by the local union president of their new status.

Wilmington:A record number of vehicles crossed the Delaware Memorial Bridge from New Jersey into the First State last year. In 2019, 18,288,314 vehicles drove through the southbound toll plaza, cruising past the 2016 record of 17.8 million, according to the Delaware River and Bay Authority. Put another way – if you lined up every one of those cars (assuming each is an average of 14.75 feet) it would stretch more than 51,000 miles. That is twice the Earth's circumference, with a road trip from Delaware to Myrtle Beach, S.C. to spare. The bridge also had a record for a month in August, handling more than 1.8 million vehicles, surpassing the August 2003 record by 27,000. Officials said the record traffic volume could be associated with an improving economy and stable gasoline prices in addition to favorable beach weather. All those vehicles means a good chunk of change in toll revenue. Last year, the net total was an estimated $132.8 million, up roughly $27 million from the previous year. For passenger vehicles, the one-way fare is $5. Tolls are paid by vehicles traveling from New Jersey into Delaware.

The Metropolitan Transportation Authority did not say what specific incidents led to removing the cars, but said no riders were injured, the newspaper reported. The new cars, known as R-179s, were purchased for $600 million under a contract between the authority and the Canadian manufacturing giant Bombardier. A Bombardier spokeswoman told the Times that the company's investigation of the cars showed that the doors had not been properly calibrated by a supplier, Nanjing Kangni Mechanical & Electrical of China. Transit workers complained that the new cars speedometer was hard to see, that the master controller used to drive the train was uncomfortable and the space between cars was too narrow for some workers to operate in. Riders also complained that new cars broke down much more often than older subway cars, the Times reported. An outside firm has been hired by the MTA to inspect the troubled cars.

Santa Fe: The Legislature's lead budget-writing committee on Tuesday recommended a 6.5% increase in state general fund spending and endorsed plans to stash away a portion of New Mexico's windfall from oil production in trust funds to ensure future financial stability. The Legislative Finance Committee that operates a year-round policy and accountability office recommended a $464 million increase in sustained spending to about $7.5 billion for the fiscal year that begins July 1. Another $325 million would be set aside in an investment trust to underwrite early childhood schooling and services, alongside smaller trusts dedicated to college affordability and rural libraries. Legislators expect the state will receive an $800 million surplus in general fund income next year, in excess of the $7 billion in current spending obligations.

The council made up more than half by women and people of color was ushered in by Mayor Martin Walsh during a ceremony at Faneuil Hall, the Boston Herald reports. The mayor swore in 13 members who included four new faces, which is an unusual amount of turnover for the council. Voters in November also elected the council's first Latina member, Julian Mejia, as well as district councilors Ricardo Arroyo, Kenzie Bok and Liz Breadon, the first openly gay woman to serve on the council. City Councilor Kim Janey will also make history as the third woman of color to serve as the body's president. The council was a white male bastion for decades, but Boston is now a majority minority city where whites comprise roughly 47% of the population.

Providence: Legislative leaders said Wednesday they're working to undo a change to how medical marijuana dispensaries are regulated, to address a lawsuit by the governor. A provision in the state budget approved last year gave lawmakers the right to veto regulations imposed on the industry. Democratic Gov. Gina Raimondo sued, arguing the new law violates the state constitution's separation of powers clause because it gives lawmakers unchecked control over executive rulemaking authority. Democratic House Speaker Nicholas Mattiello and Senate President Dominick Ruggerio said Wednesday they're filing legislation to repeal the language that required lawmakers to approve rules and regulations relating to the expansion of licenses for medical marijuana dispensaries. However, they still took issue with how the Department of Business Regulation proposed regulations for dispensaries, with Mattiello calling it blatant overreach by the executive branch. The legislation not only removes the controversial provision, but also imposes limits on regulators. Among them, regulators would be barred from limiting dispensaries based on geographical zones and from preventing any center from growing its own supply of medical marijuana or limiting the number of plants. Lawmakers authorized six new medical marijuana dispensaries last year, for a total of nine.

Denver: An initiative to reintroduce gray wolves to the state has qualified for the November ballot. The secretary of state's office said Monday that backers of the proposal turned in sufficient valid voter signatures to qualify the measure. The gray wolf has been successfully reintroduced to a number of U.S. states. It was eradicated in Colorado in the 1940s. Colorado ranchers and other interests strongly oppose the initiative, saying it would threaten livestock as well as elk, moose, deer and other animals. The Rocky Mountain Wolf Action Fund is campaigning for the plan. It says voters have the opportunity to decide for themselves whether to introduce the wolf, whereas efforts in other states are directed by federal wildlife officials. If passed, the initiative would direct the Colorado Parks and Wildlife Commission to devise a plan to introduce wolves on public land west of the Continental Divide before 2024.

Phoenix: The National Weather Service said there were seven confirmed tornadoes in Maricopa and Pinal counties last year, the most in nearly five decades. Meteorologists said last year's total is second only to the 10 confirmed tornadoes that hit the Phoenix metro area in 1972. They said all of the 2019 tornadoes were considered weak, ranking as either F0 or F1 in intensity. But in June 1972, an F2 tornado damaged about 200 homes in Paradise Valley and caused extensive damage to canals and power lines in Scottsdale and east Phoenix. The National Weather Service in Phoenix has data on tornadoes going back to 1950. Meteorologists said there were five confirmed tornadoes in the metro Phoenix area in both 1992 and 1993 with four tornadoes in 1971. Tornadoes are considered a rare event because the Phoenix area generally doesn't get the wind shear and unstable air mass needed to whip up the twisters.

Cincinnati: The future of the city's only abortion clinic is in question after the state health director said the facility doesn't have enough backup doctors lined up. Because the clinic doesn't have an agreement with a nearby, private hospital to transfer patients in case of an emergency – an agreement required by state law –Planned Parenthood Southwest Ohio Region has operated the clinic under an exception known as a variance. Ohio Health Director Amy Acton recently rescinded that variance. To receive a variance, a clinic must provide a list of doctors willing to treat patients in case of emergencies. The clinic in Cincinnati informed the state in December it no longer had four backup doctors listed and requested 30 days to find a replacement physician. Acton then rescinded the clinic's variance and notified the clinic its license was in jeopardy of being revoked. The clinic, which remains open, is expected to request a hearing on the issue. It indicated it was seeking another physician. Kersha Deibel, president and chief executive officer of the Planned Parenthood region, told The Columbus Dispatch that we follow the law and are actively working to identify a new provider.

Portland: Lawmakers have approved a $4.5 million contract with a hazardous waste removal company to clean up homeless encampments across the city. The City Commission unanimously voted to give the contract to Rapid Response Bio Clean on Wednesday after the agenda item was pulled late last month over concerns from homeless people and their advocates, Oregon Public Broadcasting reported Thursday.

The workers generally disposed of the needles, shopping carts, trash and human waste that are left behind after a homeless camp is cleared.

Mayor Ted Wheeler said the new contract strikes an excellent balance between keeping the city clean and respecting the homeless. Rapid Response was to resume its work by Thursday.

Recent surveys show more consumers are complying with retailer and local mandates, but that it is often seen as a political issue.
But consumers don't need significant wage increases to prosper. Despite unexpectedly low wage growth, the consumer is confident and still spending. That is because inflation is well below 2%, interest rates are near historic lows, tax-cuts increased net take-home pay and energy costs are muted. Since the American consumer drives two-thirds of domestic GDP growth (and 17% of global GDP growth) he or she matters to growth. And the picture looks pretty rosy.

Bismarck: A county commission that recently voted to limit how many refugees it would accept voted Monday not to put the issue before voters in a nonbinding straw poll. The Bismarck Tribune reports the five-member Burleigh County Commission voted 3-2 against a potential ballot question relating to future refugee resettlement. The vote breakdown was the same as the commission vote last month not to accept more than 25 refugees in 2020. That vote came after a four-hour meeting where several refugees, in often emotional testimony, urged the commission to continue accepting new arrivals. Had the commission voted a total ban on refugee resettlement in Burleigh County, home to about 95,000 people and the capital city of Bismarck, refugee resettlement groups said they believe it would have been be the first local government to do so since President Donald Trump gave states and counties that power.

San Diego: A team of eye experts has operated on an unusual patient – a gorilla. A cataract was removed Dec. 10 from the left eye of a 3-year-old western lowland gorilla who lives at the San Diego Zoo Safari Park, the park announced Monday.

The operation was performed at the San Diego Zoo Global's Paul Harter Veterinary Medical Center. Cataract surgeon Chris Heichel, who led the team and has performed thousands of operations, said it was his first on a gorilla.

Town: A man from Illinois drove through Wisconsin last week with a snowmobile strapped to the roof of his car, creating a bit of a stir. Tommy Mecher, an electrician apprentice from Chicago, said he could not afford to get a trailer and pay for the extra gas to tow his snowmobile up north. I only burned $10 more in gas on a 430-mile trip, Mecher said. I put it on the roof in Lemont, Illinois, where the snowmobile was and drove it up to Bessemer, Michigan. Snowmobiling can be an expensive pastime. There's the expensive machine, helmet and cold-weather clothing, the cost to travel to a spot with enough snow and the expenses of a weekend of roaring across groomed trails. But Mecher purchased the 1990 Polaris Indy 500 snowmobile a few weeks ago, made a few minor repairs to get it running and left for his father's house in Bessemer last Friday. Mecher said It took about an hour to load the snowmobile on the roof of his 2005 Chevy Malibu, using an old blue Ford tractor with a bucket. He modified the end of the snowmobile to keep the machine's track from caving in the roof or breaking the rear window. Mecher made a support rack of boards to shift the snowmobile's weight to the sides of the roof, away from the middle. He secured his sled with several straps that he looped through the open rear doors before tightening them and closing the doors.
Punitive measures like suspensions and disarmament compounded the stress he was under, Seidle said.

Norms are as important as laws
After a lifetime of hard work, the last thing you want to worry about is never getting to call it quits. But a huge chunk of working adults are risking that very fate by not saving for retirement appropriately. In fact, nearly half of U.S. households have no money set aside for the future, according to the Economic Policy Institute. And that's a problem, because Social Security alone won't be enough to pay the bills in retirement. Or, to put it another way, if you don't save on your own, you'll probably end up working forever, or landing in a precarious financial situation when you're old. Neither is ideal.
As representatives of their game, and as business people who benefit greatly from it, their reputations are sullied, forever. Sorenstam and Player now will be attached to Trump at this horrible time in our nation's history, forever.

Investors' renewed love affair with U.S. government bonds also follows a weaker-than-expected January reading on the U.S. services sector, which is a key pillar of the consumer-focused U.S. economy. The weaker number, released Wednesday, led to speculation that the Federal Reserve would not raise rates at its March meeting -- and may pass on rate hikes altogether this year. The Fed earlier this year had said it would like to hike rates another full percentage point in 2016 after a quarter-point hike in December. But Wall Street is now questioning that so-called hawkish pace of rate hikes.

Phoenix: The National Weather Service said there were seven confirmed tornadoes in Maricopa and Pinal counties last year, the most in nearly five decades. Meteorologists said last year's total is second only to the 10 confirmed tornadoes that hit the Phoenix metro area in 1972. They said all of the 2019 tornadoes were considered weak, ranking as either F0 or F1 in intensity. But in June 1972, an F2 tornado damaged about 200 homes in Paradise Valley and caused extensive damage to canals and power lines in Scottsdale and east Phoenix. The National Weather Service in Phoenix has data on tornadoes going back to 1950. Meteorologists said there were five confirmed tornadoes in the metro Phoenix area in both 1992 and 1993 with four tornadoes in 1971. Tornadoes are considered a rare event because the Phoenix area generally doesn't get the wind shear and unstable air mass needed to whip up the twisters.

Chicago: Several recreational marijuana dispensaries in the state were closed Monday, with some owners saying strong demand has caused a shortage in supplies and staff exhaustion. The legal sale of recreational cannabis began Jan. 1 in Illinois, with customers spending about $3.2 million on the first day and more than $10.8 million over five days. By comparison, Michigan, which made recreational marijuana legal Dec. 1, generated $3.1 million in the first two weeks of sales. Neal McQueeney of Midway Dispensary in Chicago said the shop stopped selling recreational product Sunday and doesn't expect to resume sales until Friday.

Tallahassee: The state's environmental cops fine polluters today less than half as much as they did a decade ago, before former Gov. Rick Scott took office and shifted state regulators to a more pro-business posture, state data shows. Through the first week of December, the Florida Department of Environmental Protection assessed 352 penalties in 2019, totaling $4.4 million in fines for violating air, water, sewer, petroleum tank and other state environmental regulations. By comparison, in 2010 DEP assessed 1,249 environmental penalties in Florida, totaling $10.2 million – more than 3 1/ 2 times as many penalties and double the fines assessed this year. DEP holds that the lower figures prove the success of the agency's mission to help businesses, utilities and other polluters to clean up their acts. But the agency's critics say the steep drop in fines reflects an ever-softening stance.

Montgomery: A judge on Tuesday set a final hearing in a lawsuit over control of the Alabama Democratic Party. Montgomery Circuit Judge Greg Griffin scheduled the hearing for Jan. 30. The hearing could signal that a resolution is on the way in the legal dispute over who is party chair. Longtime state party leader Nancy Worley had filed the lawsuit to block state Rep. Chris England from taking control as party chair. A revamped governing board of the party elected England as chair this fall, but Worley and her supporters maintained his election was illegitimate. The ongoing feud has pitted longtime party leaders, such as Worley and Joe Reed, against an upstart faction. The Democratic National Committee supports England and recognizes him as state chair. Barry Ragsdale, an attorney representing the defendants in Worley's suit, said last month that England is functioning as party chair.
Minneapolis:Two prominent leaders have proposed an amendment to the Minnesota Constitution aimed at closing the state's dismal academic achievement gap. The proposal comes from Alan Page, a former Minnesota Supreme Court justice, and Neel Kashkari, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis. They want to change the state's constitution to guarantee all children the fundamental right to a quality public education, the Star Tribune reported Wednesday. Page and Kashkari told the newspaper in an interview that making quality education a civil right for all children is the catalyst that's needed to break the logjam that has blocked effective reform. Even though Minnesota has spent billions of dollars to solve the problem, the state still has some of the worst educational disparities in the nation, as measured by race and socioeconomic status, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis. Courts have interpreted the Minnesota Constitution as giving students a fundamental right to an adequate education. Page and Kashkari want to raise that standard to a quality education. Page and Kashkari said similar amendments have driven improvements in other states. To amend the Minnesota Constitution, they will need the Legislature's approval to put the question to voters. The two hope to get it on the ballot this fall. But they'll face opposition from the state's powerful teachers' union, Education Minnesota, which said it will resist the proposal.

Midland: It's not what the Egyptians had in mind, but it worked: A group of high school students made a pyramid out of toilet paper – 27,434 rolls. It took 16 hours for students to assemble the pyramid at Bullock Creek High School in Midland County. They are hoping to be recognized by the Guinness Book of World Records and sell the toilet paper as a fundraiser for the 20-member robotics team. There was a lot of excitement when we got to the last few layers, but the final roll at the top was actually pretty anti-climactic, Maxton Herst told MLive.com. Every single roll you place, you want it to be in the correct spot. It was just kind of mind-numbing work. Herst got the idea three years ago after seeing a similar pyramid on YouTube. The students built the pyramid during holiday break. Rolls of the two-ply toilet paper have since been placed into 96-count boxes for purchase.

Louisville: The Kentucky Humane Society had its largest adoption year on record with about 6,902 animal adoptions in 2019. The Humane Society said it was the first year that cat adoptions outnumbered dogs. In total, 3,424 cats found new homes compared to 3,398 dogs. Adoption officials said cat adoptions have been increasing over the past few years. Humane Society spokeswoman Andrea Blair said cats are popular with seniors, busy families, renters and people who travel for work. Blair said 1,583 cat adoptions took place at Purrfect Day Café, which opened in August 2018. The cafe serves coffee, snacks and cocktails while patrons interact with adoptable kittens and cats. Total adoptions were up 816 from 2018.

A. Social media has truly transformed the way customers interact with companies, and it can be a valuable marketing tool for any business. Most companies benefit from having well-managed Facebook and Twitter accounts, but you need to know how to use them. Posting too much or too little can hurt you. The best tip is to use each platform for a specific purpose that benefits your business. For example, use Facebook to share events, photos and customer testimonials, then use Twitter to share coupon codes, news and special discounts.

Harrisburg: Voters in three Pennsylvania House districts will choose new state representatives during special elections scheduled for March, the state House speaker announced Tuesday. A top aide to Speaker Mike Turzai, R-Allegheny, said the March 17 date was chosen to fill seats that became vacant because the incumbents were elected in November to other offices. The seats were most recently held by Rep. Tedd Nesbit, R-Mercer; Rep. Gene DiGirolamo, R-Bucks; and Justin Walsh, R-Westmoreland. Nesbit and Walsh were elected to become county judges, and DiGirolamo is now a county commissioner. Rep. Tom Murt, R-Montgomery, will succeed DiGirolamo as chair of the Human Services Committee, and Rep. Gary Day, R-Lehigh, will chair Aging.

New Orleans: John White, who helped strengthen the role of charter schools, backed a taxpayer-funded tuition voucher program for private schools and oversaw overhauls of the state's school accountability efforts, said he is stepping down as Louisiana's education superintendent. He told state Board of Elementary and Secondary Education members in a letter that he will leave the job March 11. He did not state his reasons. The board said a search for his replacement would begin immediately and the process will be discussed at an upcoming meeting. White can point to numerous improvements made during his eight years as education chief, including improved graduation rates and better performance on college preparation tests. His tenure was also marked by a rocky relationship with teacher unions and Gov. John Bel Edwards. And the state continues to lag others in nationwide education rankings. Still, his departure comes as his job seemed secure, following the election last year of a slate of state education board members who were backed by the state's business lobby, which was supportive of White. Although he didn't discuss his future, The Advocate reported in April that he had quietly co-founded a national nonprofit group, Propel America, aimed at connecting low-income high school graduates with solid jobs. White has been education superintendent since 2012 but he had been working on a month-to-month basis since 2016. Although he had the support of a majority of the 11-member state Board of Elementary and Secondary Education, he lacked the two-thirds majority needed to get a new contract.

Columbus: Gov. Mike DeWine has asked the state's Medicaid official to look into what can be done in response to the recent increase in the number of children without health insurance. The governor's directive came after a recent report showed Ohio's uninsured rate for infants, toddlers and preschoolers is now the third-highest in the nation, with nearly 12,000 more children without coverage in 2018 than in 2016, the Columbus Dispatch reports. DeWine said he asked Medicaid Director Maureen Corcoran to see what steps that we can take to deal with this and to see if there is a way to make re-enrollment easier so that it is not a hurdle for those looking to get insured. The number of children without health insurance coverage climbed to 5% in 2018 from 3.6% in 2016, according to report released in December by the Georgetown University Center for Children and Families.

Annapolis: A newspaper's review of state court records has found an apparent loophole that allows documents filed electronically to be kept from the public. The Capital reports court documents filed through the state's electronic record-keeping system can be made secret by attorneys, judges and clerks and their staffers without a court order or public notice. In contrast, attorneys who want a record kept secret must obtain an order from a judge when filing by paper. That process requires notice and an opportunity for any interested party to intervene. The newspaper reports it's unclear how many records have been so easily sealed across the state. In the case of the man accused of opening fire in the Annapolis newsroom in 2018, killing five employees, the newspaper learned through a public records request that almost 70% of the documents were designated confidential, keeping them from public view.

Oklahoma City: The Oklahoma Corporation Commission said it has approved a plan for an additional area code for 19 central Oklahoma counties in the 405 area, including Oklahoma County and Oklahoma City. The commission said the North American Numbering Plan Administrator will announce the new area code later this month and it will be available in July. Starting in January 2021, callers will have to dial 10 digits that include the area code plus the seven-digit number. Commission spokesman Matt Skinner said existing phone numbers will not be affected or changed, but callers will have to dial all 10 digits to make a phone call. The area code overlay is similar to one adopted in 2011, when the 539 code was added in the 918 area code region that includes Tulsa. The commission said the additional area code is needed because the administrator has determined that the 405 area code will run out of available numbers in December 2021.
Regardless, if the Trump administration really understood the dynamics of Iraq, it might have anticipated a move like the attack on the U.S. Embassy.

Jackson: Foul weather has postponed plans to kill nonnative mountain goats in Grand Teton National Park. Park officials closed a large area of the Teton Range to the public this week so that hunters could shoot goats by helicopter without endangering people on the ground. Park officials now say snow and poor visibility are postponing those plans. Grand Teton spokeswoman Denise Germann said another attempt could take place in late January or early February. Mountain goats aren't native to the park and biologists worry the 100 or more goats could spread disease to native bighorn sheep. The National Park Service has contracted Oregon-based Baker Aircraft to shoot goats with nonlead shotgun or rifle rounds, the Jackson Hole News & Guide reported. Wintry weather kept Baker from making it to the area, Germann said. Park officials also plan to use volunteer hunters on the ground.

In every presidential tenure, there are important moments that reflect the personality of the chief executive, especially in times of crisis. Trump is a man who cannot tell a simple story without dishonesty, even when the facts are on his side.

But someone born in 1958, for instance, would have a full retirement age of 66 years, eight months. But if that person retired at 62, they would only get 71.7% of their full benefit.

Madison: Republicans decided Tuesday to place only President Donald Trump's name on the state's primary ballot this spring, setting up obstacles for any long-shot candidates to challenge him in the state. A committee made up of Republicans and Democrats met with state election officials in the Capitol to decide which candidates will be placed on the April 7 primary ballot. The Republican committee members submitted only Trump's name; he was approved on a unanimous voice vote. The Democratic committee members submitted 14 candidates. The Republican move will make it more difficult but not impossible for other GOP hopefuls such as former Massachusetts Gov. Bill Weld and former Illinois Rep. Joe Walsh to get on the GOP primary ballot. They could still be included if they each collect 8,000 signatures by Jan. 28.

North Korea's example shows Iran that they might as well invest it all in banned nuclear programs and push ahead for the bomb.

This table is based on a full retirement age of 66 and a full retirement age benefit of $1,000 per month. And as you can see, if you aren't likely to live beyond your mid-70s, it's almost certainly in your best interest to file at age 62 (with the caveat that you should consider how that would affect your surviving spouse). On the other end of the spectrum, if you're fortunate enough that you'll probably live well into your 80s or beyond, delaying Social Security will almost certainly mean more total income, not to mention a bigger check later in life when your ability to earn a wage is far more limited.

Jefferson City: Republican Gov. Mike Parson's campaign said it raised about $540,000 in recent months, outpacing the $445,000 brought in by Democratic challenger Nicole Galloway. Those numbers are dwarfed by fundraising by independent political action committees, which rose in power after voters put limits on political donations directly to candidates in 2016. There are no limits on donations to PACs, which can work to bolster a candidate but cannot coordinate with the official campaign. A PAC backing Parson raised close to $1 million in the latest reporting period, which covers October through December. Uniting Missouri PAC Chairman John Hancock said the committee has more than $5 million on hand to spend helping Parson in the gubernatorial race. A pro-Galloway PAC has not yet reported recent fundraising. The general election is Nov. 3.

We are hopeful the incoming administration will reverse this short-sighted course, Milito said in a prepared statement, and base its decisions on facts so that we can have a forward-looking energy policy to help keep energy affordable for American consumers and businesses, help create jobs, and strengthen our national security.
Public employees don't have to join a union, even if a majority of their colleagues vote to have it represent them. In California and other states, though, the law compels the union to represent everyone — members and non-members alike — in collective bargaining. And in California and some 20 other states, unions are allowed to collect some dues from non-members for that representation.

Mutko — who was sports minister at the time — has been banned from the Olympics for life along with 43 athletes, though he and all but one of the athletes have filed appeals.
For me, Jurgen seems to try and do the second one without doing the first one. He would rather put young guys on the team that potentially could become somewhat important on the team and he leaves out players that could make the team better right now.

He's someone I'd like to look a little more into, Peters said of Delaney. … He's kind of been someone I've paid attention to the whole time he's been in the race.
Esper's honesty, especially in an administration whose hallmark is daily dissembling, is refreshing. But again, it raises the baffling problem of why the Trump team didn't just make the case that Soleimani, like Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi and others before him, was a legitimate target and that U.S. forces finally had a clear shot at him. Why lie when the truth is compelling? Why create a story that will fall apart in a matter of hours?
One complaint in 2004 claims Seidle threw a man on top of the police cruiser then punched him in the jaw and kicked him in the ribs. The second claims he hit a man on a bicycle with his police car then kneed and kicked him. The official outcomes of those complaints remain obscured by Neptune's denial of records. These complaints aren't mentioned in Gramiccioni's report.
An emergency declaration theoretically would allow Trump to use military money to build the wall. Democrats and some Republicans have questioned the legality of such a move, saying an emergency declaration would be challenged in court.

The proposal is the third in a string of aviation consumer rules, with the first adopted in 2009. Earlier rules set large fines for lengthy tarmac delays and forced airlines to post the full cost of a ticket with taxes when advertising fares.
If this stuff doesn't move, and we don't know what to do with it, we can't keep it forever, he says. At some point, it's going to start to degrade. The other thing that could happen is that if we can't find outlets — and I'm not talking about just E.L.

One additional option you can also consider is picking up some sort of side hustle. Though it's not easy swinging a second gig on top of a full-time job, if you're willing to put in the effort, you can boost your income and use that extra money to pad your savings account. Furthermore, working that extra job might give you the flexibility to cut fewer expenses, thus contributing to a better quality of life.

Helena: Urban deer culling for the fall and winter seasons was suspended by city officials amid budget cuts. The Montana Fish and Wildlife Commission recommended the city of Helena be allowed to continue culling despite budget cuts, The Helena Independent Record reported Tuesday. Former Police Chief Troy McGee made the decision to cut the program when the department was ordered to make more than $470,000 in cuts, city officials said. The program costs the city about $30,000 a year, officials said. The commission sets a quota range of up to 250 designated to maintain the population at desire levels and the city determines the exact number to cull each year within that range, officials said. This will be the first fall and winter the city has not culled deer since 2008, officials said. The city has plans to survey the deer population to determine if it will resume culling operations, Police Chief Steve Hagen said. The city has usually culled about 100 deer a year and populations have remained steady, officials said.

A critic of China trade practices in particular, Lighthizer said he is fully committed to President-elect Trump's mission to level the playing field for American workers and forge better trade policies which will benefit all Americans.
Previous administrations did not kill him only because the risks of further conflict with Iran were too high. The Trump administration — whether wisely or foolishly — took its shot and killed him. This is a clear enough narrative that administration officials should be able to go out and tell it to Congress, the American people and the international community without shooting themselves in the foot over and over.

Santa Fe: The Legislature's lead budget-writing committee on Tuesday recommended a 6.5% increase in state general fund spending and endorsed plans to stash away a portion of New Mexico's windfall from oil production in trust funds to ensure future financial stability. The Legislative Finance Committee that operates a year-round policy and accountability office recommended a $464 million increase in sustained spending to about $7.5 billion for the fiscal year that begins July 1. Another $325 million would be set aside in an investment trust to underwrite early childhood schooling and services, alongside smaller trusts dedicated to college affordability and rural libraries. Legislators expect the state will receive an $800 million surplus in general fund income next year, in excess of the $7 billion in current spending obligations.

Oklahoma City: The Oklahoma Corporation Commission said it has approved a plan for an additional area code for 19 central Oklahoma counties in the 405 area, including Oklahoma County and Oklahoma City. The commission said the North American Numbering Plan Administrator will announce the new area code later this month and it will be available in July. Starting in January 2021, callers will have to dial 10 digits that include the area code plus the seven-digit number. Commission spokesman Matt Skinner said existing phone numbers will not be affected or changed, but callers will have to dial all 10 digits to make a phone call. The area code overlay is similar to one adopted in 2011, when the 539 code was added in the 918 area code region that includes Tulsa. The commission said the additional area code is needed because the administrator has determined that the 405 area code will run out of available numbers in December 2021.

Taco Bell released the following statement about the incident on Thursday:
The Russian government insists it never supported dopers or covered up for them. Mutko painted WADA's star witness, former Moscow and Sochi laboratory director Grigory Rodchenkov, as untrustworthy and erratic, and said the Russian government wasn't responsible for any malpractice in the state-funded Sochi drug-testing lab during the Olympics. Instead, he laid the blame at the feet of the IOC and WADA.
So carbon prices aren't just ineffective; they're counterproductive. By providing the illusion that they're effectively dealing with climate change, they reduce pressure for tougher policies that could meaningfully curb emissions, such as phasing out coal as an electricity fuel except where it's paired with carbon-capture technology; maintaining existing nuclear plants; and making renewable energy cheaper.
Anthony Duclair, Lukas Sedlak and David Savard also scored for the Blue Jackets.

New York City: Nearly 300 of the city's new subway cars were removed over concerns that the doors could open while the trains were in motion, The New York Times reported Wednesday. The 298 cars on the A, C, J and Z lines were supposed to replace subways that date to the 1960s. They were removed after two recent incidents signaled trouble, the Times reported, citing people who were told about the malfunctions. The Metropolitan Transportation Authority did not say what specific incidents led to removing the cars, but said no riders were injured, the newspaper reported. The new cars, known as R-179s, were purchased for $600 million under a contract between the authority and the Canadian manufacturing giant Bombardier. A Bombardier spokeswoman told the Times that the company's investigation of the cars showed that the doors had not been properly calibrated by a supplier, Nanjing Kangni Mechanical & Electrical of China. Transit workers complained that the new cars speedometer was hard to see, that the master controller used to drive the train was uncomfortable and the space between cars was too narrow for some workers to operate in. Riders also complained that new cars broke down much more often than older subway cars, the Times reported. An outside firm has been hired by the MTA to inspect the troubled cars.

Of course, the sooner you begin socking away money for retirement, the better your chances of actually getting to leave the workforce when you want to. Keep in mind, however, that the $300 figure above doesn't even come close to maxing out an IRA or 401(k). For the former, you can contribute up to $5,500 a year if you're under 50, or $6,500 if you're 50 or older. For the latter, these limits just increased to $18,500 and $24,500, respectively. Max out for even a couple of years while contributing smaller amounts consistently, and you stand a much better shot of retiring than you'd think.

Spring Hill:General Motors and United Auto Workers Local 1853 have agreed to convert 157 local temporary workers to permanent status effective Feb. 3. The decision resolves a dispute between GM in Spring Hill and the union over the hiring of new temporary workers, Chairman Mike Herron told The Daily Herald on Thursday. Under the new collective bargaining agreement ratified in October, GM agreed to convert temporary workers with three years of continual service to permanent status. None of the temporary workers in Spring Hill had three consecutive years of service because of layoffs in 2017 and 2018, creating a short-lived problem. The deal between GM and Local 1853 allows the plant to begin bringing in new temporary workers. The company has started taking applications, seeking 154 employees for those positions. On Monday, GM announced it was making 930 temporary workers permanent at 30 of its 52 UAW-represented plants across the country. Ford also moved 592 temps to full-time status. At GM's Flint Assembly in Michigan, 250 were told at a meeting by the local union president of their new status.
Midland: It's not what the Egyptians had in mind, but it worked: A group of high school students made a pyramid out of toilet paper – 27,434 rolls. It took 16 hours for students to assemble the pyramid at Bullock Creek High School in Midland County. They are hoping to be recognized by the Guinness Book of World Records and sell the toilet paper as a fundraiser for the 20-member robotics team. There was a lot of excitement when we got to the last few layers, but the final roll at the top was actually pretty anti-climactic, Maxton Herst told MLive.com. Every single roll you place, you want it to be in the correct spot. It was just kind of mind-numbing work. Herst got the idea three years ago after seeing a similar pyramid on YouTube. The students built the pyramid during holiday break. Rolls of the two-ply toilet paper have since been placed into 96-count boxes for purchase.

Richmond: More people earned bachelor's degrees in the state last year than ever before. Data from the State Council of Higher Education for Virginia shows that a record number of degrees were awarded in science, technology, engineering, mathematics and health fields. During the 2018-19 school year, public and private nonprofit colleges and universities awarded 122,168 degrees and certificates – an increase of nearly 50% from a decade ago. In-state students accounted for 86,325, or more than 70%, of those awards. Bachelor's degrees accounted for 46% of the total, while graduate degrees made up 25%.

Iraq is a tough country under any circumstances, made more so after the 2003 U.S. invasion that upended the Middle East and cost so much in U.S. lives and treasure.

Columbia: Gov. Henry McMaster wants to expand full-day pre-kindergarten for low-income 4-year-olds to every school district across the state. The program was created in 2006 in response to a lawsuit by poorer, more rural school districts and didn't cover all the districts in the state. McMaster's $53 million proposal would expand the 4K program to the remaining 17 districts. Several are among South Carolina's largest districts, including Beaufort, Charleston, Greenville and Richland District 2, according to The Post and Courier of Charleston. McMaster told the newspaper the expansion of the 4K program is crucial to his efforts to improve education to keep economic development humming in South Carolina. Several senators and House members praised the Republican governor's proposal. Democratic Sen. Vincent Sheheen of Camden has been pushing for universal pre-kindergarten for years and said it can only improve education across all grades.

It also could maintain a modest military advisory and training presence in Kabul, to help the Afghan army and police carry out the bulk of the fighting against extremists.

Three years into his presidency, Donald Trump owns the events and outcomes in Iraq and Iran, as he does in North Korea, Afghanistan, Venezuela, the Middle East, Russia, China and Hong Kong. Having diminished our State Department, intelligence agencies and military, the very institutions that could have helped him construct an effective national security and foreign policy, he is now on his own.

Las Vegas:Lincoln County authorities have announced that a reward is being offered for information surrounding the starvation and death of a herd of cattle. The Lincoln County sheriff's office announced the $10,000 reward Monday after the herd of six were locked into a corral in rural south Nevada, officials said. Authorities believe at least one person intentionally isolated the herd in a coral where all but one cow starved to death. The herd was in the Tule Spring area about 30 miles north of Mesquite when weather made travel to the area difficult, Sheriff Kerry Lee said. The rancher who owns the cattle last saw them alive the first week of December before the weather cleared and he returned to his cattle, authorities said. The area is a popular location for hunters, authorities said. Anyone with information or trail camera footage of vehicles in the area is asked to contact the Lincoln County sheriff's office.

Investors' renewed love affair with U.S. government bonds also follows a weaker-than-expected January reading on the U.S. services sector, which is a key pillar of the consumer-focused U.S. economy. The weaker number, released Wednesday, led to speculation that the Federal Reserve would not raise rates at its March meeting -- and may pass on rate hikes altogether this year. The Fed earlier this year had said it would like to hike rates another full percentage point in 2016 after a quarter-point hike in December.

Topeka: Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly proposed Monday that the state give itself more breathing room in its budget by slashing annual payments to its pension system for teachers and government workers, offering a new version of a plan that the Republican-controlled Legislature spiked last year. Kelly's proposal would give the state an extra 10 years to close a long-term gap in funding for the state pension system. The move would free up tens of millions of dollars each year for more than a decade, money that could be used for schools and social services. But it's not clear if her new plan will fare any better than last year's proposal – which was dead from almost the moment she presented it to lawmakers. The Kansas Public Employee Retirement System projects Kelly's proposal would increase the cost of closing the gap by a total of $4.4 billion – comparing it to extending the length of a home mortgage.

Washington:Neighbors in a Northeast D.C. community quickly mobilized to help their neighbors who lost everything in a raging fire Sunday, WUSA-TV reported. Neighbors donated everything, from school supplies to toiletries. James Caviness-Bey was working overnights at Wal-Mart when he got word of the fire, with his family still inside their Madison street home. But on Wednesday night, he was able to thank D.C. firefighters for their quick response. He also recognized the person he calls the real hero: his wife, who ran back into their burning home when she realized their 2-year-old grandson was still inside. With the flames intensifying, Edwina Caviness-Bey dropped her grandson from the second floor window into her son's arms. From there, she had no choice but to jump out. She had second-degree burns, a fractured pelvis and wrist, and is still in the intensive care unit preparing for surgery. Caviness-Bey, his son and grandson all got to thank their neighbors Wednesday night. Even the family dog, whom for hours they thought had died in the blaze, made an appearance. Neighbors are planning another donation drive to support this family in the coming days. In the meantime, they have set up a GoFundMe page.

So carbon prices aren't just ineffective; they're counterproductive.

Charleston: The Department of Natural Resources says anglers should expect trout stocked in state waterways during the winter months to be smaller than usual. A long dry spell across the state from late summer through fall is thought to have affected the average catchable size of the fish, Jim Hedrick, the division's hatchery supervisor, told the Charleston Gazette-Mail. When the drought broke in October, the hatcheries' water supplies were replenished and allowed workers to begin feeding trout at the normal rate. But winter weather soon slowed the growth rate again, Hedrick said. The growth rate is expected to return to normal as the weather gets warmer, he said. The division is also adding feed to try to increase trout size. Hedrick said each of the 31 streams and 30 lakes designated for January stockings will receive as many pounds of fish as last year.

We can't lose our heads. We can't start rioting. We have to be calculated. We have to continue to keep our foot on the gas, said Matthews, who played with the Bucks last season when they staged the walkout. The flame is already lit. It just has to continue to keep burning and burning the right way.

GETTING HEALTHY: The Bears might need to determine if the organization can do anything to prevent another rash of injuries.

Having trouble with what was going on in my personal life. And he knew that, he knew that.
