but lawmakers can also embed climate provisions in broader spending packages. last month, congress passed a stimulus bill that included billions for clean energy research, extended tax credits for solar and wind power, and ratified a global deal to phase out hydrofluorocarbons, a superheating refrigerant gas. the federal government's annual budget offers a similar opportunity, as the budget reconciliation process allows lawmakers pushing polarizing provisions to circumvent the filibuster.
but some progressive advocates say frederick's recent work defending shell, in which he's argued that lawsuits trying to hold oil companies liable for climate change have no legal grounds, should be disqualifying.
there will still be pushback from conservative democrats like sen. joe manchin (d-w.va.), a staunch fossil fuel ally who in 2010 ran an ad in which he fired bullets into a copy of the last major climate bill that congress considered. manchin, sen. krysten sinema (d-ariz.) and sen. angus king (i-maine) voted against a resolution in march 2019 outlining the core tenets of a green new deal. newly elected sen. john hickenlooper (d-colo.), a longtime oil and gas booster, could also be a hurdle.
five states ― connecticut, delaware, massachusetts, minnesota and rhode island ― and a number of cities ― including new york, baltimore and oakland, california ― have filed lawsuits since then, making the case that some of the biggest oil companies operating in the u.s. broke the law by hiding the reality of climate change.
zeroing out planet-heating pollution from the world's second-largest emitter by the middle of the century will require unprecedented changes to the u.s. economy, and biden will need new legislation to do that.

when the 2020 election finally ended 64 days after election day, democrats pulled out two additional victories, setting up a 50-50 balance in the senate where vice president-elect kamala harris will cast tie-breaking votes.
we have the beginnings of a tailor-made solution to this problem before us right now. unlike past reforms, which used a one-policy-fits-all-genders mode, the dignity for incarcerated women act seeks to address the unique needs of this swelling population. introduced last summer by senators cory booker (d-n.j.) and elizabeth warren (d-mass.) and co-sponsored by sens. kamala harris (d-calif.) and dick durbin (d-ill.), the bill recognizes the history of sexual abuse shared by so many women behind bars.
in 2016, the supreme court ruled against exxon mobil in a case that frederick argued on behalf of the state of new hampshire, forcing the oil giant to pay a $236 million fine for contaminating groundwater.
in other words, the united states has made a practice of locking up victims. the blame for that practice can be laid at the feet of the burgeoning opioid crisis; the war on drugs, which has a disparate effect on women; and our widespread insistence on ignoring girls when they report sexual abuse.
other potential names reportedly under consideration for solicitor general include sherrilyn ifill, director of the naacp legal and educational defense fund; david cole, national legal director of the american civil liberties union; and barbara underwood, new york state's solicitor general.
a flurry of litigation against oil giants began in 2015 after inside climate news and the los angeles times revealed that exxon mobil corp. had understood the science of global warming decades before the company started promoting misinformation denying that climate reality. three years later, the dutch publication de correspondent unearthed documents showing that even after shell's own scientists warned that emissions from burning oil were trapping heat in the atmosphere, the corporation's management team chose to emphasize the scientific uncertainties of global warming.
david frederick, a partner at the washington, d.c.-based law firm kellogg, hansen, todd, figel & frederick, is considered a serious enough candidate for solicitor general that the group demand justice singled him out as someone it would oppose in a public letter last month.
biden has promised to take a number of executive actions to reverse trump's immigration policies, but democratic control of congress could allow him to resurrect broader immigration reform.
during their campaigns, neither warnock nor ossoff endorsed the green new deal slogan that progressives use to frame calls for a world war ii-style industrial strategy to rapidly decarbonize. but both georgia democrats vowed to make climate legislation a top priority, and warnock, a baptist reverend, draws on a long history of black clergy fighting racist policies on pollution.
even with republicans out of legislative power, biden faces a potential crisis in the supreme court, which is due to rule later this year on a lawsuit challenging the aca's constitutionality. the republican officials who brought the suit base their argument on the fact that congress repealed the fines associated with the law's individual mandate in 2017 without repealing the mandate itself. biden and a democratic congress could fix that problem in multiple, simple ways by amending the aca and rendering the lawsuit moot.
many people will balk at such a solution because it doesn't roar with accountability for offenders; female arrestees broke the law, after all, some in very serious ways. but the fever for accountability ― the fever that spiked as nassar's victims described their suffering with such eloquence and rage ― needs to be brought down. one way to do that is to recognize that our thirst for justice in an extreme case like the nassar scandal is at odds with how we treat many victims of child sex abuse.
an even better approach to justice reform laws is to treat women in the justice system with a filter of trauma — rather than a lens. this means pulling out female arrestees who have been abused before they reach a correctional facility and referring them to appropriate treatment. in addition to respecting victims' experiences, such a shift in practice would slow the out-of-control rate of growth of the female incarcerated population.
it's hard to imagine a better moment for democrats to pass paid family and sick leave, and to do something to improve the state of childcare. the coronavirus pandemic has added a level of urgency to these issues, as paid sick leave would help reduce the spread of covid-19 and a lack of paid family leave has pushed hundreds of thousands of parents, mainly women, out of the workforce.
the biden transition team, which is expected to announce its justice department picks sometime after tuesday's closely watched senate runoff elections in georgia, did not respond to questions about frederick's candidacy.
meanwhile, the long-suffering childcare industry has taken a massive hit. but it's now possible for congress to pass something visionary like increased childcare funding to ensure, as sen. elizabeth warren (d-mass.) proposed, that families don't have to spend more than 7% of their income on that necessary expense. biden's robust caregiving proposals also raise the prospect of higher pay and benefits for childcare workers.
a number of measures now have a chance of passing the senate, including the national origin-based antidiscrimination for nonimmigrants act (or no ban act), which passed the house last july. it would immediately terminate trump's travel ban on several muslim-majority countries and prohibit future presidents from implementing a similar ban.
david frederick is the most capable, pro-consumer supreme court litigator in the country, and has demonstrated his ability over more than 50 supreme court arguments, todd webster, a former chief of staff to sen. chris coons (d-del.), told politico last month. he is literally the guy progressives turn to when their cases reach the supreme court, so that we win at that level.
the failed war on drugs has targeted women at the very moment that illegal drugs are more widely available to women who are seeking relief from profound suffering.
protecting the aca is but a preliminary step. biden's health care plan would direct additional financial assistance to those who purchase private health insurance on exchanges like healthcare.gov, and make that coverage and that assistance available to more people. biden has also proposed establishing a government-run public option insurance program that would be available to everyone as an alternative to private coverage, including to low-income adults who live in 12 states that haven't expanded their medicaid programs under the aca. and he has called for lowering the medicare eligibility age from 65 to 60 and allowing the federal government to negotiate prescription drug prices with manufacturers, among other policies a democratic majority makes possible.
there are a few exceptions to the filibuster, including bills that go through the budget reconciliation process ― a special procedure that makes it possible to pass bills with a simple majority. but there are rules about what can and can't be in a reconciliation bill and democrats over the next two years will be limited to three such bills, at most.
democratic control of the senate also makes sweeping labor reform possible through the protecting the right to organize act (pro act). the legislation, which the democratic-controlled house had passed last year, would ramp up penalties for employers who try to break unions, ban anti-union right to work laws, and expand workers' rights to strike and boycott. the measure would be a huge prize for organized labor, but it has drawn fierce opposition from business groups and could struggle to draw the necessary votes from moderate senate democrats.
kellogg, hansen, todd, figel & frederick, pllc frederick, pictured here in his law firm website photo, is a widely known democratic litigator who has already argued more than 50 cases before the supreme court.
the incoming president supports a pathway to citizenship for many undocumented immigrants ― including dreamers, the young undocumented immigrants who came to the u.s. as kids. he's also pledged to increase the refugee cap and ease restrictions on asylum-seekers.
democrats in the senate and the house, where their majority is also razor-thin, will still have to contend with more conservative members of their party who are resistant to progressive reforms.
biden promised to renew temporary protected status for people from venezuela, guatemala and hong kong, among others. the house passed a bill to do that last month, but republicans in the senate blocked it. the president-elect has also pledged to work with congress on other reforms including amending visa programs for permanent workers and expanding protections for domestic violence survivors and undocumented immigrants who report labor violations.
our sympathy for sexual abuse victims, while we're in the throes of punishing their abusers, is righteous. but it seems to fade away when they self-medicate because the pain of their victimization is too much to bear. it disappears when victims respond to their pain in ways that are less socially acceptable than testifying at their abuser's sentencing. all victims of sexual abuse deserve our compassion ― and they need help, not punishment.
congressional democrats also want to reverse some of trump's tax cuts, but they've muddied the message by mainly insisting they would undo the only major tax hike that republicans included in the tax cuts and jobs act. among its various changes, that law capped the federal deductions people can take for what they pay in state and local taxes, which democrats decried as a tax hike on the middle class even though it mostly affected high-income households.
the washington post via getty images president-elect joe biden has vowed to make climate a top priority of his administration.
outside of their demands for bigger unemployment benefits in coronavirus relief legislation, democrats have not said much lately about expanding or improving programs for poor people. they've mostly played defense against trump and congressional republicans' attempts to cut food and disability benefits, policies that will be relatively easy for them to reverse.
still, progressive reforms in these areas now look a whole lot more possible than they did last week:
paramount among these is the john lewis voting rights act, which would reform and reauthorize the 1965 voting rights law. the proposed legislation, named after the civil rights hero and former democratic congressman who died in 2019, would update the vra in compliance with the supreme court's 2014 decision in shelby county v. holder, which gutted key parts of the historic law. that decision freed state-level republicans to enact a raft of voter suppression measures aimed at lowering minority voter turnout. former president barack obama called on the senate to waive the filibuster in order to pass the revised law in his eulogy for lewis.
biden will have a much, much easier time getting his judicial nominees confirmed with sen. dick durbin (d-ill.) leading the senate judiciary committee than he would have with sen. lindsey graham (r-s.c.) at the helm. since trump and mcconnell filled almost every open judicial seat that republicans had prevented obama from filling, biden will have to rely on older judges to retire quickly if he is to put his stamp on the federal judiciary.
the united states has made a practice of locking up victims.
on the campaign trail in 2019, joe biden said that fossil fuel executives should be held liable for climate change and those who refuse to take responsibility should be jailed. we should be able to sue oil and gas companies just like we did the drug companies, just like we did with the tobacco companies, he said in a february debate. and on his campaign website, biden pledged to strategically support ongoing plaintiff-driven climate litigation against polluters.
but there have been some big proposals in recent years, like making the child tax credit fully refundable and paid in advance, so low-income parents receive monthly checks instead of having to wait for a refund. democratic leaders included this proposal in their covid-19 relief demands late last year.
in court filings in california and rhode island last year, frederick argued that federal law prevents states from suing shell and other oil companies over climate change. he contended that federal law also provides no remedies for damage due to global warming and that shell could only face climate litigation in the netherlands, where it is headquartered.
on the higher education front, biden's agenda focuses on hiking funding for historically black colleges and universities, and doubling the value of pell grants, which help low-income students attend college. both goals are possible with a simple senate majority.
jail, as opposed to prison, has become a correctional catch basin for women: sixty percent of women in jail are unsentenced, left behind bars because they are unable to afford bond. the remaining 40 percent of female jail detainees are sentenced but have not been moved to a prison because they are low-risk inmates. in 2016, the vera institute of justice conducted surveys of that jail population and found that 86 percent of them reported being sexually violated before being incarcerated.
frederick served as a clinton-era assistant to the solicitor general from 1996 to 2001 and appeared on the obama administration's short list for the top job in 2008.
at odds with the future vice president
another goal, to expand opportunities for free college, would involve more complex legislation and votes from republicans, making it less likely. how much action biden can take on student loan forgiveness is also up for debate, including whether he could do so through executive action. expanding access to preschool is another area where advocates are hopeful for new, ambitious legislation resembling what biden proposed as a candidate.
and democrats will have to deal with the filibuster, which allows a minority of senators to block legislation by stalling unless and until 60 members vote to end debate. that would mean getting 10 republicans to join them, something hard to imagine in most circumstances these days.
climate and a green new deal
frederick's arguments put him at odds with some of the top officials in the incoming biden administration. among those who signed legal briefs in favor of allowing oakland's case against five oil giants, including shell, to move forward in the california courts were vice president-elect kamala harris; biden's secretary of state pick, antony blinken; his future climate diplomat, john kerry; his choice for climate czar, gina mccarthy; and xavier becerra, the likely next secretary of health and human services.
lawmakers like sen. kirsten gillibrand (d-n.y.), sen. patty murray (d-wash.) and rep. rosa delauro (d-conn.) have raised the issue's profile in the last few years, and polling shows actual bipartisan support. biden's campaign agenda favors 12 weeks of paid family leave and seven days of paid sick leave.
the only other way forward would be to end the filibuster, which is a parliamentary rule that the senate adopted and can easily end. reforming the filibuster is something biden signaled last year he could be open to, after historically defending the procedure, but several democratic senators have said they would oppose that.
surely they can find an accomplished lawyer in this country that hasn't made millions going to bat for the fossil fuel industry, said jesse bragg, the media director at the boston-based anti-corruption group corporate accountability. experience in the energy industry is not a prerequisite for solicitor general, and there are plenty of people who have extensive careers that don't include defending oil companies.
throughout his lengthy legal career, frederick, 59, has notched notable progressive victories at the nation's highest court, winning decisions in favor of tyson foods workers whose wages the meatpacking giant stiffed, against tobacco companies advertising light cigarettes as safer, and against a gas facility that british oil giant bp tried to build in delaware waters.
a staggering number of incarcerated women are victims of childhood sexual abuse. studies suggest that between 47 and 82 percent of women have endured that crime. other studies say 94 percent of incarcerated women have been victimized sexually, some as children, others as adults.
there's new hope of passing covid-19 relief measures to send much-needed injections of dollars to state and local governments, k-12 schools and universities. biden has promised to reopen most schools within his first 100 days in office, an undertaking that would require massive funding. there's also hope that any stimulus package could include resources to help alleviate students' learning loss over the last year.
the equivalent of saying 'oh, murder is not illegal'
during roughly that same time, between 1989 and 2009, drug possession arrests among women tripled (for men, they doubled). women who are imprisoned for heroin possession are not a danger to the community; that's why they're allowed to stay in jails rather than in higher-security prisons. eighty-two percent of women in state prisons have been convicted of nonviolent offenses.
shell did not return a call requesting comment.
the quickest path forward would be to extend and expand the emergency sick leave and childcare leave provisions passed last year to deal with the pandemic. republican senators blocked extension of those provisions in december, and they expired on jan. 1.
lawyers who have argued cases alongside frederick say his record shows that he's willing to take on the oil industry.
as for expanding social security retirement benefits, party leaders previously declined to give a hearing to such a proposal, though they said nice things about it.
accused of selling 'his progressive bona fides'
reached by email, frederick directed huffpost to his law firm. the firm declined to comment.
there's no lack for public interest and public service-experienced litigators, hauser said. we don't need to rotate between republican big law and democratic big law.
last month the nation watched, transfixed, as more than a hundred women stood before a michigan courtroom to describe how larry nassar altered their lives with his abuse. they were heard and heeded. the judge listened, the media listened, the world listened, and those girls and women were told that their suffering mattered. many women who are sexually abused get their day in court, but on a different side of the judge ― when they're defendants in a criminal case. and their abuse, it seems, counts for little.
the wins for raphael warnock and jon ossoff unlock much more hope that the biden administration might not just undo some of the worst actions taken in the trump era, but actually push progressive reforms over the finish line.
he worked tirelessly to protect the coastal zone act in delaware, which is one of our treasured environmental laws, said max walton, a partner at the wilmington, delaware-based law firm connolly gallagher who argued the case with frederick. i can't think of a human being who works harder and smarter and more fair than david frederick.
house democrats also plan to pass the for the people act, a collection of voting rights, campaign finance and ethics reforms, as they did in 2019. the bill would create a system of publicly financed congressional elections, expand campaign finance disclosure provisions, enhance executive branch ethics laws, end partisan gerrymandering, and require states to implement a host of election reforms to make it easier to vote. other bills like the protect our democracy act, which aims to prevent future presidents from abusing their power as donald trump did, will also get a senate hearing now.
what shell is purchasing in getting his time is a lawyer who is known to be a democrat who had some good clients, and that provides a positive sheen to their cause, said jeff hauser, director of the center for economic and policy research's revolving door project. frederick is selling to shell the fact that he is a progressive, and there ought to be consequences for his progressive bona fides when he does that.
the pushback highlights the legal challenges in prosecuting shell, a globe-spanning corporate empire valued at nearly $140 billion, for planetary harm on a scale that few, if any, lawmakers could have imagined when writing the environmental statutes currently on the books. two of the biggest cases against rival exxon mobil, for example, take a narrower approach, arguing that the company violated state laws in new york and massachusetts by not disclosing relevant information to investors and making deceptive advertising claims about the safety of burning fossil fuels.
the industry had the science 30 years ago and knew what was going to happen but made no warning so that preemptive steps could have been taken, harold koh, a professor of international law at yale law school who served as legal adviser to then-secretary of state hillary clinton, told inside climate news. the taxpayers have been bearing the cost for what they should have been warned of 30 years ago. the companies are now being called to account for their conduct and the damages from that conduct.
women in state prisons are more likely to be incarcerated for a drug or property offense (like theft) than men are. according to the sentencing project, 24 percent of women in state facilities have been convicted of a drug offense, compared to 15 percent of male prisoners. when it comes to property crimes, 28 percent of incarcerated women have been convicted, compared to 19 percent among incarcerated men.
at the very least, a democratic senate should allow biden to more easily reverse many of the labor policies of the trump era ― not just legislatively through the congressional review act, but by reshaping the national labor relations board, which referees disputes between employers and unions. the trump picks for that board have made it more difficult for many workers to bargain collectively. if sen. mitch mcconnell (r-ky.) is deposed as the senate's leader, biden would have a much easier time installing union-friendly nominees who could undo the previous board's decisions.
it's a very different exercise than defending a criminal defendant where the lawyer might say, 'sure, murder should be illegal, but my client didn't do it,' said marco simons, general counsel at the environmental legal nonprofit earthrights international. this is the equivalent of the lawyer starting out the case by saying, 'oh, murder is not illegal.'
jonathan ernst/reuters with the elections of jon ossoff, raphael warnock and joe biden, progressives are thinking they might actually be able to pass some real reform.
trump transformed the supreme court with three new justices, the most named by any president since ronald reagan. progressive judicial activist groups wasted no time in calling for liberal stephen breyer, the oldest supreme court justice at 82, to retire as soon as biden is inaugurated and make way for a younger progressive justice. democrats do not want another elderly justice dying at an inopportune time, as happened with the late justice ruth bader ginsburg. if breyer does step down, biden is expected to nominate the first black female justice, as he promised to do during his presidential campaign.
the affordable care act ― biden's famous b.f.d. ― is 11 years old and, for all its success making health care coverage available and more affordable to millions of americans, it needs work. biden campaigned on beefing up the law rather than replacing it wholesale with a single-payer medicare for all system. a fully democratic congress would provide the new president with an opportunity to fulfill some of his promises.
the campaign for trauma-informed policy and practice has detailed the connection between opioid addictions and childhood sexual abuse. victims of childhood trauma are more likely to report debilitating physical pain and be prescribed pain medication, and 80 percent of people seeking treatment for opioid addiction have experienced at least one form of childhood trauma, including sexual abuse. childhood sexual abuse, particularly among women, is highly correlated with opioid abuse. women are increasingly likely to turn to opioids for relief from pain, be it physical, psychic or both. between 2002 and 2013, heroin use among women doubled.
because women have long been lumped in with male prisoners in correctional and prosecutorial planning for years, it's only recently that researchers culled data that show what's really happening to incarcerated women. last year, the prison policy initiative painted the first landscape of female incarceration. what they found was disturbing.
while representing the state of delaware in the mid-2000s, he persuaded the supreme court to block bp's bid to build a liquefied natural gas facility in delaware waters on the grounds that it violated state laws protecting the coastline.
but progressive critics say it's that record of winning smaller-scale victories against oil companies that made him appealing to a company like shell.
reauthorization of the voting rights act and a suite of voting rights and campaign finance and ethics reforms were already at the top of congressional democrats' priority list before they won control of the senate on tuesday.
the dignity act insists that incarcerated women be viewed through a lens of trauma; for example, it bans cross-gender strip searches and other re-traumatizing security measures and mandates that inmates who menstruate receive sufficient feminine hygiene products. even though it hasn't been scheduled for a hearing, the dignity act has already had demonstrable impact: within a month of its introduction, the federal bureau of prisons issued a memo promising to provide adequate and free menstrual supplies. while the dignity act and all of its state-level progeny are revolutionary legislation and deserve a hearing and a yea vote, these laws do little to prevent the fact that the women it's trying to dignify probably shouldn't be incarcerated in the first place.
now just weeks away from inauguration, the president-elect is considering a corporate lawyer who has defended royal dutch shell against climate liability lawsuits to serve as solicitor general, the administration's top legal advocate who argues cases before the u.s. supreme court, according to two sources with knowledge of the process.
chandra bozelko is the author of up the river: an anthology and writes the award-winning blog prison diaries. she is a 2018 justleadership usa leading with conviction fellow.
a democratic majority in the senate could put in play the first minimum wage hike in more than a decade. the federal wage floor of $7.25 per hour has not budged since 2009. with democrats holding the house, the senate and the white house, they would have a much stronger hand to pursue an increase as high as $15, though only if they prove willing to nuke the filibuster.
biden has said he supports a higher corporate tax rate and higher income and payroll taxes on people earning more than $400,000 ― proposals that would partially reverse the tax cuts that republicans enacted at the end of 2017.
