in 2009, then president-elect obama expressed a belief that we need to look forward as opposed to looking backwards in previewing his administration's free pass to george w. bush alumni. that view was at odds with a commitment to justice, since, by its very nature, justice is always retrospective ― crimes are committed, criminals are charged, juries or judges weigh the evidence and proceed to punish (or not) accordingly.
unfortunately, right now, the government, our health care system and our society in general are not focusing enough on putting resources into increasing prep uptake among black folks—it's clear, says ashwini hardikar, mph, director of prevention and outreach at the lgbt-focused callen-lorde community health center in the chelsea neighborhood of manhattan.

glottlieb specifically referenced prior fda warnings about kratom's side effects, including seizures and respiratory depression. but these potentially deadly symptoms don't appear in any sort of discernible pattern in the cases the fda cites, and they're not well-documented elsewhere. while scientific studies on the effects of mitragynine on humans are still lacking ― largely because it's difficult to get funding for research on a plant that can't be patented ― most of the emerging science on kratom has found it to be largely benign, especially when taken in low or moderate doses.
huffpost reporters around the world are tracking the pandemic and the measures being taken to flatten the curve of transmission.
officials are scaling up hospital capacity throughout the state, which is adding 6,000 additional ventilators to its operations, though it needs about 24,000 more, according to the governor. the state is planning to distribute 1 million n95 masks to new york city alone and is evaluating sites for building four new field hospitals to address the expected shortage of icu beds, cuomo said.

bail reform advocates have been campaigning to replace this system with one that bases release decisions on individualized assessments that measure a defendant's flight risk and potential threat to community safety. in places like new jersey and washington, d.c., pretrial services agencies now conduct these evaluations and provide recommendations to judicial officers. under this system, many low-level defendants are released without payment, simply on the promise that they'll return for future court dates. others are subjected to some level of monitoring by the pretrial services agency or held without the option of bail.

a judge ultimately assigned daves $500 bail, the generic amount under dallas county's schedule. but she didn't have that kind of money, so she was sent back to jail, where she was set to remain until her trial date.
that system has allegedly had direct consequences for plaintiff shannon daves, a 47-year-old who like many defendants was arrested on low-level charges. after being booked for misdemeanor theft earlier this month, daves was unable to post $500 bail. as a result, she was indefinitely detained in solitary confinement, due to the county's policy on transgender inmates, while she awaited trial. daves says she was confined to her cell for 24 hours a day.
under the affordable care act, tax credits are available to people whose incomes are up to four times the poverty line, or $48,500 for an individual and $100,400 a year for a family of four. people with higher incomes can find coverage difficult, if not impossible, to afford ― even in california, where the marketplace is considered among the most successful in the country.

we need to be able to talk for ourselves, she said, and not be used as an ax to grind because of elizabeth warren's aspirations to run for president.
experts also worry that a wall will cause further backlogs at legal ports of entry, where some migrants have been waiting for months to cross the border due to the trump administration's crackdown on asylum-seekers. as a result, thousands of immigrants who arrived in tijuana, mexico, with a migrant caravan last month are languishing in sometimes unsanitary shelters for their turn to legally cross the border.

president donald trump on saturday accused medical professionals of thoughtlessly wasting the protective masks now in short supply, but those who work in emergency rooms have a very different story to tell.
it's about who you know, just like any other industry. whether it's telecom or cannabis. if you want to be a big player, you have to know folks and you have to commit capital. and when every male in your family has been in jail at one point in their life, it's very hard to build up capital, she said.
the very broad sentiment from right to left is that nobody wants big cannabis to own vermont, and whatever we do end up drafting for a tax-and-regulate bill will be oriented toward smaller production facilities and a more broad distribution of the economic benefit throughout the state, as opposed to large out of state corporate version, he said.

the majority-democratic new york assembly passed single-payer health care bills several times in recent years, but the state senate ― then controlled by republicans ― didn't take up the measure. democrats now have a majority in both chambers of the legislature and are set to reconsider single-payer, although gov. andrew cuomo (d) has expressed skepticism.
the movers and shakers in the industry and activist space are phenomenal women who broke down barriers in corporate america, politics and in every other aspect of life, out of necessity, she said. these women are mothers, partners, wives, sisters and daughters of the men killed and imprisoned and left with few options in life as the war on drugs rages on. we don't have the option of not actively pursuing restorative justice in addition to creating an equitable industry.

intelligence agencies issued classified warnings in january and february about the spread of coronavirus and its potential to become a global pandemic, reported the washington post, citing unnamed u.s. officials familiar with the agency reporting.
warren enraged tribal groups and other minorities concerned about her reliance on a test to measure ethnicity, the washington post reported last month. that episode injected uncertainty over the decision-making by warren and her campaign staff and subjected her to both anger and mockery just as she was gearing up for a potential presidential effort.
but it's virtually certain that no major expansions are going to happen in washington for the next two years because republicans still control the senate and the white house. their agenda has focused for years on scaling back federal and state programs that provide assistance to low- and middle-income families and would lead to millions fewer americans covered.
a reporter also asked trump about the five republican senators now in isolation — paul, as well as sens. mitt romney (r-utah), mike lee (r-utah), cory gardner (r-colo.) and rick scott (r-fla.).
you are going to respect this plant. you're not just going to come in here and grab on us. you're going to respect what we have to bring to the table, and we've been doing this a really long time, and you're not just going to come in here and grab it, unsworth said. as women, we're finally getting the chance to scream that as a group.

presidential pardons are typically meted out in compassion to those who have more than served a just penalty, or who may have been too-harshly treated by the criminal justice system.
the governor's commission is expected to deliver a final report to lawmakers by the end of the year, which would guide them on future legislation to establish a market for cannabis. under vermont's two-step process of legalization, it could be a while before the state sees its first legal marijuana sale, said matt simon, the new england political director for the marijuana policy project, a non-profit organization that advocates for cannabis reform around the country.
intelligence agencies have been warning on this since january, a u.s. official told the post of the intelligence reporting, which was sent to trump administration officials as well as members of congress. donald trump may not have been expecting this, but a lot of other people in the government were — they just couldn't get him to do anything about it.
but saturday's show of force, arranged by organizing for bernie ― an upstart group founded by sanders campaign alumni and grassroots activists ― demonstrated one of the senator's biggest advantages if he decides to return to the ring: a network of supporters already familiar with his message and skilled in do-it-yourself internet organizing.

at the same time, new york gov. andrew cuomo, who began his first term in 2011 by coupling tax cuts with reductions in social spending, has proven resistant to any tax increases targeted at the super-rich. he has at once argued that it would provoke multi-millionaires and billionaires ― with whom he claimed to speak all day long ― to flee the state in pursuit of lower taxes, and wielded the threat of higher taxes as part of an appeal for federal aid.
raul mejia, a prep specialist at callen-lorde, goes further. in addition to how inaccessible prep is, black msm are still black people and as such deal with life-threatening issues such as racism, internalized homophobia, homophobia, hyper-masculinity, violence and police brutality on a daily basis, he says. this needs to be taken into account when attempting to serve this community.
the view was also a political calamity ― obama's governance strategy of burying the broadly accepted failures of the bush presidency created a path for bush's enablers in congress to secure historic victories in the 2010 midterms. and the obama administration's failure to prosecute bankers and other elites responsible for economic cataclysm added fuel to the fire of resentment that led so many americans to the tea party, and ultimately, trumpism.
outside of california, ayanna pressley, the first woman of color elected to the boston city council, worked with the minority cannabis business association to develop a model equity bill. in 2017, shaleen title, a marijuana attorney and legalization activist, was appointed to lead the massachusetts cannabis control commission.

michael, who is on prep, doesn't mince words when addressing the larger societal context into which prep has arrived. there is something very imperialistic about the way that prep has been rolled out, he says, because you can't get a young man of color to care about whether or not he contracts hiv when he doesn't feel good enough about himself to care about whether or not he lives or dies.
the number of families apprehended by border patrol while traveling through the el paso sector, which includes a part of the chihuahuan desert, has risen by more than 1,500 percent over the past year because of policies that dissuade immigrants from using legal ports of entry and an increased military presence at the border. advocates worry a border wall will only exacerbate the problem and lead to more health issues for children traveling through remote regions that lack access to medical services.
beletsky admitted there was still a lot of uncertainty surrounding kratom, and said it warrants further research to better understand its full range of effects and possible harms. but considering there are an estimated 3 to 5 million kratom users around the u.s., according to industry figures, he added that the relatively low number of supposed kratom-related deaths ― even in questionable cases like these ― could actually suggest that kratom is not very harmful.

it's media fodder. it's sensationalism. that's what it is, he said. all it takes is for one person to say they're offended, and then everybody does a dog pile. but to me, it's 'wait a second. let's get to some of the facts here.' sen. warren has always been a friend to tribes. and we need all the allies we can get.
the number of migrant families being apprehended at the border reached record-high levels of more than 25,000 last month ― a number that's risen by more than 13 percent since 2013.

in the u.k., the death toll reached 104 after a further 32 people died in england. they were ages 59 to 94 and all had underlying health conditions, huffpost u.k. reported. the u.k. has also announced all schools will close on friday until further notice.
immigration experts say the money trump is requesting to build a wall would be better spent on more border patrol agents to process migrants, a more efficient immigration court system and technology to detect drugs and weapons at the border.
pubs have been ordered to close from midnight tonight, as the u.k. government escalates measures to fight coronavirus. prime minister boris johnson has previously urged people to avoid pubs, clubs, theatres and other such social venues in order to try and slow the spread of the virus. but despite the plea, many londoners were still gathering in pubs in some parts of the capital this week. the government also announced it would step in to pay 80% of the wages of workers to encourage employers not to layoff staff.

new york wouldn't be the first municipality to carry out a plan seeking universal coverage. san francisco enacted a similar plan in 2007, while newsom was mayor, and one of that plan's architects now is a de blasio adviser. los angeles county, california, and the district of columbia also have local programs that provide coverage and services to uninsured residents that predate the affordable care act.
want americans to feel like the country is fair? think the rule of law is important? prosecute powerful people when they commit crimes. even people who worked for a president. even a former president.
although other states have legalized cannabis through ballot initiatives that have left the decision up to voters, vermont does not allow for such a process. over the past few years, lawmakers in the state have instead been working to address marijuana reform through legislation. a similar legalization bill made it to scott's desk in 2017, but the governor vetoed it, citing concerns with weak language on punishment for the sale of marijuana to minors and its establishment of a commission to study how a regulated cannabis market would work in vermont.

such a scheme could also preserve a role for private insurers, providing the same kind of alternative, tightly regulated coverage they do for seniors on medicare today. hybrid systems with both public and private insurance are actually pretty common around the world ― and succeed in establishing health care as a right, just as single government programs do.

a critical problem facing prep promotion among african americans is their overall disenfranchisement from the health care system. frequently a by-product of poverty and unemployment, this alienation from what many progressives argue is a basic american right is often compounded by an accident of geography. those with very low incomes who live in the 19 states with governments that have refused to expand medicaid under the affordable care act (aca, or obamacare)—including almost all the states in the republican-dominated south—have been summarily excluded from the recent mass expansion of the health care rolls.

many democrats do not support medicare for all. but at this point even democrats unwilling to endorse it are frequently calling to expand public insurance programs in some fashion ― if not by creating a new government plan that enrolls everybody, then by opening one of the two big existing programs, medicare or medicaid, to more people.

california produces vast amounts of marijuana and has done so for years. in 1996, it became the first state to legalize medical marijuana. and despite the passage of more permissive laws, there were still thousands of marijuana-related arrests annually. from 2006 to 2015, there were nearly 500,000 people arrested for marijuana offenses, a recent dpa report found. and rodney holcombe, a legal fellow at dpa, said that there may be close to 1 million people in the state who have convictions that could now be eligible for relief.
some of hunter's other policy ideas are to:
prop 15 would have created a separate property tax collection system for commercial properties worth more than $3 million, generating as much as $12.5 billion in new revenue. but some of california's biggest corporations and property investors, such as the private equity giant blackstone, spent $53 million ― nearly as much as prop 15's backers ― trying to convince californians that the proposal would raise taxes on ordinary people and prices for consumers. state voters voted the referendum down, 52 to 48%.

and that's assuming the price cuts would even become law. even modest proposals to reduce what government programs pay providers and suppliers of medical care generate huge opposition from their lobbying groups. the kind that would come with medicare for all would likely provoke an all-out war, one for which industry groups are already preparing.

for uninsured americans, the bill would cover any health care items and services that are medically necessary or appropriate to maintain a person's health, get a diagnosis, or go through rehabilitation, at medicare rates, which are substantially lower than what private insurers pay providers. in other words, this would not cover elective surgeries like a hip replacement during the pandemic, but would cover cancer treatment or an inhaler for asthma. many hospitals have stopped elective treatments during the pandemic as health care providers struggle to get the resources they need to address the surge in covid-19 cases.

just to be clear, king's rhetoric cannot be attributed to the rise of trumpism, it goes back to well before donald trump's entry into the 2016 presidential campaign. in august of 2013, king absurdly claimed that for every child of an illegal immigrant who is valedictorian, there's another 100 out there who weigh 130 pounds, and they've got calves the size of cantaloupes because they're hauling 75 pounds of marijuana across the desert.

experts believe that black msm may also shy away from seeking out prep for fear that having a truvada prescription would expose them to scorn from homophobic family members. black msm considering prep may face further internal conflicts if they don't identify as gay. fears that physicians holding the keys to a prep prescription may be yet another source of stigma and sex shaming could be quite justified in some cases, given the pervasive ignorance about prep in the medical field. and even though there are often ways to access prep for free, black msm may automatically assume that such an expensive drug is out of their reach financially and not even explore payment options.

the working families party also has high hopes of pressuring lawmakers in connecticut and rhode island, where democrats enjoy control of the legislature and governorships, to enact a similarly progressive course of action. president-elect joe biden has tapped rhode island gov. gina raimondo (d), a centrist fiscal hawk, to serve as his commerce secretary. her departure and a series of progressive primary wins in the state legislature in september are already generating more momentum to address the state's $513 million budget shortfall through tax increases that target the state's wealthiest residents, rather than spending cuts.

like del duca, coteau is a former cabinet minister. as minister of social services, he oversaw the liberals' program for children with autism and helped implement the basic income pilot project that ford's government quickly cancelled.
but i wouldn't say taxes are a third rail in california anymore, he added. opponents of reform are hanging on by a thread.
proponents of the tax increases see them as the appropriate antidote to an uneven, or k-shaped, recovery from the economic fallout of the pandemic. working-class people, including black and latino communities already harder hit by covid-19, have been much more likely than upper-middle-class professionals to lose their jobs or otherwise have their lives upended since march. food pantries are seeing unprecedented demand and the plight of the state's 725,000 undocumented immigrants, who have not been eligible for previous rounds of aid, has been especially acute.
as the economy changes and technology evolves, we need an income floor … so that people can still maintain a certain dignity in their lives while they decide what to do if they need to get retrained.
this example, one of many across our state, underscores the true promise of proposition 64 ― providing new hope and opportunities to californians, primarily people of color, whose lives were long ago derailed by a costly, broken and racially discriminatory system of marijuana criminalization, lieutenant governor gavin newsom said in a statement. this isn't just an urgent issue of social justice here in california – it's a model for the rest of the nation.
the u.k. government has announced an astonishing £330 billion (about $400 billion) bailout to help businesses and people cope with the coronavirus crisis. finance minister rishi sunak said the government must be bold as he unveiled the unprecedented package of government-backed loans and support. huffpost u.k. reports that the economic package represents 15% of u.k. gdp.
the pfizer-biontech vaccine requires a second shot about three weeks after the first vaccination. another vaccine, this one produced by moderna, requires a second shot about four weeks afterward. one-shot vaccines are still undergoing testing.
with nearly 20,000 cases reported as of friday, spain overtook iran to become the world's third-hardest-hit country by the pandemic after china and italy. the madrid region accounts for 628 deaths and 7,165 cases. spanish authorities said on friday they would turn a madrid conference center into a giant makeshift military hospital for thousands of coronavirus patients.
but here in san francisco's gritty tenderloin district, where fentanyl was only rarely seen until last year, drug users tell a starkly different story. for many of them, fentanyl is a high-value drug that, if used carefully, can prevent dope sickness and deliver a strong high for a fraction of the price of heroin.
on other issues, like auto insurance, hollingsworth said the liberals failed to help people and actually did harm.
fortifying the border is just going to lead to more deaths, said elissa steglich, a law professor at the university of texas at austin who teaches a clinic for immigrant families. [it's] giving business to sophisticated smugglers who are going to be taking migrants through more perilous and life-threatening circumstances.
del duca is considered the man to beat. he's a former minister who was first elected to represent vaughan in the final weeks of dalton mcguinty's premiership. del duca's campaign says there are 2,676 people running to be his delegates this weekend, out of the 5,500 total candidates the party says are on the ballots.
gov. cuomo has a lot of beautiful, soaring rhetoric, but the history of his time in office is that he hasn't been able to deliver on the reality, kink said.
fourteen lakers players were tested on wednesday, and results on thursday confirmed two cases, sources told the los angeles times and the athletic. the team will likely now test its remaining players, according to the athletic.
the supplies ― which trump said will be delivered within 48 hours ― include gloves, medical beds, n95 masks and gowns. the u.s. army corps of engineers will also provide these states additional support to build alternate care sites.

deviating from this protocol without approval would be a violation of the animal welfare act, berry said.
fda's data could have severe implications for the future of kratom. the latest press release comes as the agency appears to be leading a push to ban the substance under federal law. following pushback, the u.s. drug enforcement administration postponed a move to place kratom in schedule i, alongside drugs like heroin and lsd. but the fda recently completed an analysis that may help determine how the dea proceeds. a spokesperson for the dea said tuesday that it could take months or even years for the agency to reach a final decision on scheduling.
ultimately, these minority business owners hope the industry will respect their claim to the plant they helped bring out of the darkness.
the most in-demand type of masks are n95 respirators which are often worn by workers in industries such as construction and healthcare. while they might be effective at preventing contact with contaminated liquid, they won't hold back small particles in the air from coughs or sneezes, and so aren't effective protection from covid-19.
the fact that bernie is the only candidate who could inspire this kind of gathering says it all, ullman said.
there must be comprehensive and convincing plans completed in these areas before i will begin to consider the wisdom of implementing a commercial 'tax-and-regulate' system for an adult marijuana market, scott said on monday. it is important for the general assembly to know that – until we have a workable plan to address each of these concerns – i will veto any additional effort along these lines, which manages to reach my desk.
kruegel added that the fda's analysis was an order of magnitude less rigorous than many of the studies that had already been conducted on kratom. he said the fda's claim was akin to saying that all opioid agonists have the same effect, which is not true based on what we've learned about these compounds. (opioid agonists provide pain relief by binding to opioid receptors.)
that is the first time that has ever happened in australia's history, morrison said at a news conference wednesday. the travel advice to every australian is 'do not travel abroad.' do not go overseas. that is very clear, that instruction. for those who are thinking of going overseas in the school holidays, don't. don't go overseas.
creating a safe, legal and tightly regulated system for adult-use marijuana is, at its core, about criminal justice reform and fixing a broken system that has disproportionately harmed low-income californians and communities of color, said newsom, a proponent of prop. 64.
i may have been a unicorn, but my life was no fantasy.
it's a brutal statement. and it reflects legitimate anger felt by some native people over warren's handling of the situation. she didn't get consent from the cherokee nation before dropping her video. even if unintentionally, she amplified sensitive issues around tribal citizenship (including federal versus state recognition, benefits and native identity) versus ancestry that most non-native people know nothing about.

each state has its own plan for who should be vaccinated, based on recommendations from the federal centers for disease control and prevention. the cdc recommendations give first priority to health care workers and nursing home residents.
in addition to shutting down nonessential businesses and greatly increasing testing, the state is retrofitting facilities such as new york city's javits center to use them as extra hospitals, recruiting more medical staff and using hotels and empty college dorms for extra beds.

spain's death toll from the coronavirus pandemic soared on saturday to 1,326, up from 1,002 on friday, according to the national health ministry's latest data.
using a dna test to lay claim to any connection to the cherokee nation or any tribal nation, even vaguely, is inappropriate and wrong, read hoskin's statement (which no longer appears to be on the tribe's site but does appear on anadisgoi, the official cherokee nation newsroom). senator warren is undermining tribal interests with her continued claims of tribal heritage.

on tuesday, gottlieb reiterated concerns about kratom's potential for abuse, addiction, and serious health consequences; including death. as proof of the drug's deadly harm, the fda released reports on 36 deaths involving the use of kratom, culled from academic research, medical examiner reports and adverse event reports. gottlieb also said the fda plans to release the eight newly received reports.
but several of the people interviewed by huffpost noted that hoskin is an appointee, not an elected official, and he was speaking only for himself, not on behalf of the cherokee nation, according to doug george-kanentiio, a co-founder of the native american journalists association and a former trustee for the national museum of the american indian.
cuomo also indirectly alluded to trump when arguing that it's important to balance public health response with a smart economic response.
sen. elizabeth warren (d-mass.), who would very likely be the field's second-most progressive contender after sanders, announced her bid on new year's eve. rep. tulsi gabbard (d-hawaii) joined the field on friday. and former housing and urban development secretary julián castro launched his campaign on saturday.
rep. steve king (r-iowa) issued a defiant statement monday night after house republican leadership decided to strip king of his committee assignments following the release of an interview where the congressman questioned why terms like white nationalist and white supremacist were offensive.
meanwhile, the total number of reported cases rose to 10,491.
fda the fda considers this individual's death related to his kratom use, though the report details a lengthy medical history of medical problems, including prescription drug abuse.
it also creates incentives for applicants who don't meet those criteria to incubate equity applicants and provide capital and real estate for their businesses. those who qualify receive no-interest loans from the city.
the next time someone tells you that one candidate has this leadership race 'in the bag' — ask them about lyn mcleod or dalton mcguinty or kathleen wynne, coteau wrote in a message to supporters on jan. 25. no 'frontrunner' has ever won our leadership race process.
and while parks will remain open for exercise, all social events including weddings and baptisms will be stopped. funerals, however, can continue.
nine of the fda's 36 documented deaths were related to a string of fatal overdoses in sweden in 2010, which involved a controversial kratom-based product that had been adulterated with a dangerous synthetic opioid. an additional eight cases that fda previously released to huffpost consisted largely of voluntary reports, including accounts from family members who simply suspected their loved ones had died from kratom use.
it's still a much more dangerous drug than heroin, which is typically sold as black tar in california and tends to be inconsistent in potency and quality, he added.

if wealthy americans were taxed more ― or, in hannity's words, if their wealth were confiscated ― rich people are not going to remodel their homes, they're not going to build new homes, he claimed.
the decision came after unions representing immigration judges and prosecutors from u.s. immigration and customs enforcement called for the shutdown. a dozen current government employees working in the u.s. immigration system told reuters on tuesday that they were concerned courts had remained open for so long despite the spreading outbreak.
civil rights corps and other groups are also suing harris county over its bail system, though unlike their dallas county suit, that challenge wasn't extended to felony defendants. a federal judge in that case has issued a preliminary injunction banning the county from holding misdemeanor defendants for more than 24 hours if they say they can't afford bail. a final ruling is still forthcoming.
the senator said john started feeling sick while she was in minnesota and he was in washington, d.c. the two have been in different places for the last two weeks. as such, klobuchar said she won't seek out a test based on the advice of her doctor.

beyond sentencing, some local governments are making efforts to further repair damage from criminalization by enacting equity programs that allow for victims of the war on drugs to have application priority during the marijuana business licensing process.
the state's attorney also urged maryland gov. larry hogan (r) to release all inmates over the age of 60 in state prisons, as well as a slew of other prisoners, including those that are scheduled to finish their sentences in the next year.
in fairness to the fda, it has acknowledged the limitations of the reporting systems used to compile these deaths. on its website, the fda says the inclusion of a case doesn't imply a causal relationship between a product and an event. it also notes that reports do not always contain enough detail to properly evaluate an event.
lawmakers and advocates began to discuss what it might look like if legalization policies embraced restorative justice. how can communities of color, whose access to the networks and means required to start a business for cannabis had long been oppressed by the rules governing it, now benefit from what is projected to be the largest and most profitable market in the u.s.?
there's lots of polling showing that our brand remains resilient and strong. that's all positive and encouraging. but in those 26 months [before the next general election], we're going to have to be able to find well over 100 candidates who are not currently incumbents, we're going to have to raise millions of dollars, and we're going to have to find a way to put together a platform of ideas that are compelling for the people, he said.

such an order, which several other states have enacted versions of, would be a very blunt instrument, he said. you simply cannot lock down our society indefinitely with no end in sight.
echo hawk sees the opportunity for a teachable moment. her research found that more than one-third of americans claimed some sort of native ancestry. it's part of the national folklore of the country, she said, and when people are introduced to accurate information about native people, it changes their perceptions in a positive way.
new york city is about 10 days away from widespread shortages on ventilators, masks and other supplies needed to treat patients with covid-19, said mayor bill de blasio. he warned that more people will die if president donald trump doesn't step up his response to the pandemic.
but zero cost-sharing could also encourage people to get care they don't need, which could mean unnecessary (and potentially harmful) tests and treatments, all while driving up costs throughout the system. purely from a budgetary standpoint, the federal government would have to spend a lot more money if it's assuming responsibility for every single dollar on every single medical bill for every single american.
the nets said four of its players had tested positive for the virus, although it did not say who had been affected. the team said all four were under isolation and in the care of team physicians.
he also criticized trump's tax cuts for the wealthy. during the 2019 federal election, singh campaigned on tax hikes targeting canada's richest people, and promised funding to low-income groups.
the results from the los angeles and boston teams follow the philadelphia 76ers' news earlier thursday that three of its players tested positive for covid-19. several nba teams have tested their players since the league announced it was suspending the 2019-2020 season.

huffpost talked to a dozen tribal chiefs, native politicians, researchers and influencers to get a sense of why this narrative that has taken off in the media ― that warren, who has been a strong ally to tribes, is suddenly on the ropes with them because of her dna test ― seems off. some spoke on record; others spoke only anonymously, given their close work with tribes whose privacy they wanted to respect.
mike pence and his wife, karen pence, have tested negative for covid-19, the vice president's spokeswoman announced saturday.
oops. neither of these stories included comments from any elected tribal leaders. the post story didn't include comments from native people at all. of the three native voices mixed in with political pundits in the times story, one is a known warren critic and one is a congresswoman-elect whose positive comments were buried ― a stunning distortion of how many tribal leaders and native people in general feel about warren's move.
the responsibility of the senate is to remain operational. you are not protecting an institution by rendering it unable to function, schatz tweeted, just hours before the senate gets ready to vote on a coronavirus relief bill. remote voting must be instituted immediately, so that the federal legislature can do its job, not just today, but for the duration of this crisis.
another reason for san francisco's relatively low death rate from fentanyl is the city's entrenched and well-funded harm reduction community, coffin said. after the first fentanyl outbreak here in 2015, public health and harm reduction groups joined forces to sharply increase the amount of narcan, used to treat overdose, distributed to all drug users and intensify outreach programs.
this november, voters in california and illinois voted down ballot measures designed to make their taxation systems more progressive.
the idea that wealth trickles down from the richest to those less privileged has been bashed by none other than billionaire investor warren buffett, who has argued that people like him should pay more in taxes.
in spain, el huffpost reports (in spanish) that the government will extend a state of emergency until april 11 as some regions asked for even harsher confinement measures. prime minister pedro sanchez warned that the worst is yet to come as spain's death toll jumped to over 1,700, with more than 28,000 cases of infection.
fentanyl is involved in more than half of overdose deaths nationwide, and its geographic reach is extending beyond the east coast and appalachia, where its death toll has been rising since 2011, to california, where the synthetic drug is involved in about 20 percent of deaths.
he went on to thank trump for working quickly to help the state set up emergency hospitals, and to allow federal emergency funding, including waiving the requirement that the state pays for 25% of it.
the baltimore sun reports she is taking the step to reduce any potential outbreak for those behind bars. an outbreak in prison or jails could potentially be catastrophic, mosby told her office. now is not the time for a piecemeal approach where we go into court and argue one by one for the release of at-risk individuals.

nationally, black people are 3.5 times more likely to be arrested for marijuana possession than white people, even though the two groups consume cannabis at similar rates. in oakland, 90 percent of cannabis arrests from 1995 to 2015 were people of color.
everyone needs safe restroom access, and california law protects every person's right to access restrooms based on their gender identity in workplaces, schools, and business establishments, goad said in a statement on the aclu website. it's important for businesses to make sure their employees understand that requirement, just like walgreens is now doing, because jessie meehan had the courage to stand up for her rights.
the move follows a similar announcement by canada, which said sunday it would refuse to send any athletes to japan if the event was not postponed.
the centers for disease control and prevention (cdc) recently projected that if current trends persist, half of all black msm will contract hiv in their lifetime, compared with 1 in 11 (or 9 percent) of their white counterparts. and in a cdc study of msm in 20 major u.s. cities, 30 percent of blacks were living with hiv, compared with 14 percent of whites.

the challenge for democrats is to do something that will make a difference in the lives of regular people, said michael kink, executive director of the union-backed strong economy for all coalition, which is pushing for a host of higher taxes in new york. the only way to do that is with real money. you can't fake it.
i wasn't in the majority. i was deeply depressed and emotionally fragile. i used the sex club as a way to avoid the intimacy and vulnerability of a relationship. i didn't believe anyone would want to be around me for longer than it took to get off, since i could barely stand to be around myself.
scholten has seen some signs that the coalition sanders has promised to awaken of young, working-class and otherwise disengaged voters is starting to tune in as the caucus approaches. he was impressed with the 1,100-person turnout for a rally with sanders and ocasio-cortez in sioux city on sunday night.
that's what lots of news outlets want you to think, anyway, after warren unexpectedly released a carefully choreographed video in mid-october featuring a geneticist who confirmed that she had a native ancestor six to 10 generations ago.
biden responded by noting that while youth turnout may have jumped in 2018, turnout also spiked among voters over the age of 40.
we have a very active flu season, more active than most. it's looking like it's heading to 50,000 or more deaths ― deaths, not cases. fifty-thousand deaths ― which is, that's a lot, he said. and you look at automobile accidents, which are far greater than any numbers we're talking about. that doesn't mean we're going to tell everybody no more driving of cars. so we have to do things to get our country open.
we need to be a party that's open and that is inclusive, that's modern and youthful and ready to take on the challenges of the future. i think that moving to a one-member-one-vote system would really help.
but relief is not automatic under the new law. individuals who want their marijuana convictions reclassified or cleared must submit an application to a court. they may also need to hire an attorney to help them through the process. about 5,000 people have so far applied to have marijuana sentences reviewed for possible relief, according to data compiled by the judicial council of california. and while it's encouraging that some are taking advantage of the new process, it's an extremely small fraction of the number of people who have been arrested for marijuana offenses in the state.
pa wire/pa images lewes mp maria caulfield has spoken out against decriminalisation of abortion.
president-elect joe biden is expected to give a speech thursday outlining his plan to speed vaccines to more people in the first part of his administration. his transition team has vowed to release as many vaccine doses as possible, rather than continuing the trump administration policy of holding back millions of doses to ensure there would be enough supply to allow those getting the first shot to get a second one.
the market for pardons — which cuts out the poor and those not politically connected — reflects the access peddling that has defined trump's presidency, as well as his unorthodox use of his clemency powers to reward friends, the times noted.
in order to offset the cost of those new subsidies, newsom wants to reinstate the financial penalty for people who do not have insurance ― a penalty that was part of the affordable care act until congressional republicans and trump eliminated it, effective this year. this would make california the fourth state to adopt an individual mandate with a penalty; massachusetts, new jersey and vermont already have such a policy in law.
we're actually in a moment of abundance in terms of our ability to fill many of our budget gaps, but it's an abundance that must be coupled with political will to balance the budget not on the backs of those who have already been at the front lines, said sochie nnaemeka, director of the new york working families party.

with scott's signature, vermont will join eight other legal-weed states, as well as washington, d.c., in a growing movement away from federal law, which still classifies marijuana as a schedule i substance, alongside heroin and lsd. vermont legalized medical marijuana in 2004, and is currently among nearly 30 states, plus the territories of guam and puerto rico, and the district of columbia, with such programs in place.

we have a huge opportunity to teach people about claiming ancestry versus tribal citizenship, she said. tribes are sovereign political nations. we are not racial groups. we are citizens of nations that pre-date the united states. it's like nobody is interested in really hearing from tribal leaders and native people on this issue.
he is particularly upset about an idea from freshman rep. alexandria ocasio-cortez (d-n.y.) to finance the plan by introducing a marginal tax rate of up to 70 percent for the nation's wealthiest people. doing so would have dreadful effects on the very rich, hannity said tuesday in an at-times nonsensical rant on his radio program.
new york gov. andrew cuomo (d), who leads the state with the most covid-19 cases in the u.s., issued an urgent plea at his daily press conference, warning that the rate of growth for cases continues to increase and will peak in 14 to 20 days, making it essential that the state strengthen its hospital capacity and obtain much-needed medical supplies.
fifty times stronger than heroin and 100 times stronger than morphine, the synthetic opioid was rarely detected in u.s. illicit drug markets or in the bodies of fatal overdose victims just a decade ago. last month, the centers for disease control and prevention confirmed that fentanyl has become the biggest killer in the nation's raging drug overdose epidemic. the rate of overdoses jumped 113 percent each year from 2013 through 2016.

in this world, skin color is a category that shapes your experience, says nelson, who is one of the four black researchers at the helm of a recent study that, promisingly, has had initial success supporting prep uptake and adherence among african-american msm. when you don't have diversity on your scientific team, those kinds of experiences are never brought to the table to form study designs, what questions you can ask, how questions get asked.
huffpost reached out to a walgreens representative for comment, but did not immediately hear back.

san francisco city and county officials have found that the black community has been over-represented in marijuana-related arrests in the region. in a study from the city's human rights commission on the effects of marijuana policy in the region, between 1999-2000, arrests of african-americans for marijuana-related offenses jumped from 34 to 41 percent, despite black san franciscans comprising of less than 8 percent of the population in 2000. in 2011, after penalties for marijuana possession was downgraded from a misdemeanor in san francisco, 50 percent marijuana-related arrests were of african-americans, while they represented just 6 percent of the region's population in 2010.
medicare for all envisions the federal government spending a lot more money on health care than it does today. the government has to find that money ― by raising revenue through taxes or government-imposed premiums, cutting other spending, accepting higher deficits or some combination of the three.

johnson wanted to see a change in the law that would prevent women who accessed drugs for medical termination online from being prosecuted. she said: i wonder if any of us truly believe that those women, in such difficult circumstances, really should be seen as criminals. let me be clear that decriminalisation will not mean deregulation. under the abortion act, a termination not officially certified by two medical professionals is not legal.

democrats increasingly see antitrust policy in the same vein that they have come to view campaign finance reform ― a fundamental structural problem underlying the many issues of skyrocketing health care costs, lower wages, lack of labor mobility, rising prices, fewer local businesses and less political power. a 2018 poll by the anti-monopoly group open markets institute found 76 percent of respondents believed big corporations have too much power over your family and your community.
in california, public-sector labor unions joined with the chan-zuckerberg initiative in an effort to pass proposition 15, which would have closed a massive property tax loophole for big businesses. the ballot measure was a response to the unusual property tax system california adopted in 1978 tying property taxes to the property's value at the time of the sale, rather than a rolling system of tax assessment of the kind used in other states. as a result, many homeowners and big businesses like disneyland pay property taxes based on values assessed decades in the past, leading to major shortfalls for local services like schools and county hospitals. despite its progressive reputation, california ranks 42nd in the country in per-pupil education spending when adjusted for cost of living, according to the california budget and policy center, a liberal think tank.

inslee's plan is the most straightforward and most familiar, because he wants the state legislature to create something that progressives have wanted as part of the affordable care act all along. he's calling for the state to create a public option ― a stand-alone insurance plan, which a state agency would manage, available to people buying coverage on their own through the state's exchange, washington healthplanfinder.

instead, the two governors are calling for new programs ― and spending ― to shore up the health insurance market for people who find affordable care act exchange policies too expensive. in new york, the mayor is eyeing a local plan to use city money to cover medical expenses for uninsured residents. the california and new york city proposals include assistance for undocumented immigrants, who are ineligible for federal programs like medicaid and the health insurance exchanges.
to that end, oakland launched the nation's first equity permit program earlier this year. it sets aside half of all medical and recreational marijuana business licenses for applications by individuals hit hardest by marijuana criminalization. in their research during the development of the program, oakland city council found that over the past two decades, the black community has been extraordinarily over-represented in marijuana-related arrests in the region. in 1998, up to 90 percent of marijuana arrests involved a black suspect. by comparison, just 3.9 percent of those arrested were white.

trump, who has spent a lifetime stretching (and seemingly bursting) the legal limits on tax avoidance, money laundering, housing discrimination, deceptive consumer practices and sexual assault, ran a presidential campaign that represents the apotheosis of elites breaking laws to achieve massive gains. since taking office, trump has plausibly been implicated in a broad array of crimes, including breaking campaign finance rules, violating state and national tax laws, conspiring to violate the computer fraud and abuse act, and of course, obstructing justice.
beyond that, the reason warren even decided to release her dna test results, for better or for worse, was to try to move on from president donald trump's constant mockery of her native ancestry and racist attacks on her as pocahontas. she has been relentlessly harassed. boston shock jock howie carr said in march that he got her spit on a pen and tried to get a dna sample from it. he encouraged readers of his boston herald column to grab her water glass at a st. patrick's day event so he could do a dna test. one of her political opponents mailed two dna test kits to her house.
those two things i think stand as a remarkable achievement not just for me as an individual minister, but for our time in government.
in a series of interviews with heroin users in rhode island in 2017, brown university researchers reported that users described fentanyl as unpleasant, potentially deadly, and to be avoided. they concluded that demand for the deadly contaminant was low and that its presence in the drug supply was generating user interest in effective risk mitigation strategies, including treatment.

by the end of 2015, likely well over 80,000 u.s. residents had filled at least one prescription for the daily tablet. and given the steadily increasing rate of new prescriptions registered each quarter, the population of hiv-negative people who have at least tried prep has probably swelled considerably by now. this is fantastic news for the effort to stem the tide of hiv infections among men who have sex with men (msm), whom data suggest make up the vast majority of prep users. while it's still too early to determine truvada's initial impact on infection trends—prep started gaining popularity only in late 2013—clinics with large populations of high-risk msm on prep have reported very low hiv rates among them.
in the middle of the week we will be more or less 14 days after the adoption of the most stringent measures, locatelli said on monday morning. we expect the results to become evident, with a clear tendency to reduce new infections and people who lose their lives.

no more copays, no more coinsurance, no more deductibles ― yes, that's right, out-of-pocket spending would basically disappear under the existing medicare for all proposals. the only exception would be a provision in the sanders bill that would allow some token cost-sharing to encourage use of generic drugs.

they say 'flatten the curve, flatten the curve.' we're not flattening the curve, he added. we have exhausted every option available to us.
in addition, the insidious legacy of the tuskegee syphilis experiment continues to wreak havoc on the overall health of african americans more than 40 years after the sadistic, decades-long program was finally exposed. an inherited culture of mistrust of the medical establishment and propensity for medical conspiracy theories may leave black msm wary of hiv prevention that comes in a pill and requires routine medical care. furthermore, many african americans are raised with a strong bias against going to the doctor for anything but serious illness.

fortifying the border is just going to lead to more deaths. elissa steglich, university of texas at austin
meanwhile, in new york, political will for higher taxes on the state's wealthiest residents is materializing among some key players. new york's state senate, which was effectively controlled by republicans until 2018, now has a democratic supermajority fueled by progressive and even socialist victories across two election cycles. and the state assembly, where democrats already had a veto-proof majority, has seen some of its more moderate members ousted by younger left-wing challengers.

so for truvada to make the greatest possible impact on hiv rates, its use as prevention would need to reach a critical mass among at-risk black msm. instead, prep has increasingly found its niche among white msm, a demographic that has already long benefited from a dropping hiv diagnosis rate, to the tune of an 18 percent decline between 2005 and 2014. during that time, diagnoses among black msm rose 22 percent, with an 87 percent surge among young black msm. (in promising news, however, the hiv rate among black msm, including youths, has leveled off in more recent years.)

california gov. gavin newsom (d) said tuesday that the state's public schools were likely to be closed for the rest of the school year.
do not think for one minute that republican leaders are sincere about substantively addressing racism in their own ranks. speaking out against king's comments is the exception, not the rule. the one example of action republicans will hide behind to justify their silence on everything else. after all, if mitch mcconnell is sincere about there being no place in the republican party, the congress or the country for an ideology of racial supremacy of any kind how could he possibly still be supporting and protecting the biggest racist of them all – donald trump.
it was just over a year ago that president trump declared that haiti, el salvador and africa were shithole countries and that the u.s. should get more people from countries like norway.

supernova women urged lawmakers in san francisco to consider a similar program. without equity language in place on jan. 1, when cities could officially license adult-use cannabis businesses, the city might lose a chance to ensure that those who had been hurt by the racist criminalization of the plant were first in line to create wealth from it.

it's not yet clear if there would be enough support in the state legislature to pass a tax-and-regulate bill without scott's support. vermont requires a two-thirds vote in both chambers to override a gubernatorial veto. with statewide elections upcoming in november, these deliberations seem likely to become a key campaign issue in the coming months, though it's not yet clear if lawmakers will be willing to put themselves on the record as strong supporters of legal marijuana sales in vermont.

we need to be very serious about ― for a while, life is not going to be the way it used to be in the united states, fauci said sunday on cnn. we have to just accept that if we want to do what's best for the american public.
age has emerged as the crucial dividing line ahead of the democratic caucuses here, neatly dividing the coalitions of the two septuagenarians in a way education, class and geography do not. sanders, whose bold agenda includes aggressive plans to wipe out student debt and battle climate change, disproportionately draws support from millennials and members of generation z. biden, who has unveiled more cautious policy proposals, is heavily reliant on the gray-haired. each is struggling with the opposite demographic. (the coalitions for both warren and buttigieg are more consistent across age groups.)

i was kicking ass at work, but my personal life was spiraling out of control. so, naturally, i decided to drown my sorrows in anonymous sex. but the more i went to the club, the more random people i slept with, the less i liked myself.
there were so many eyes on me, i couldn't relax. it felt good, but i also kind of felt like i needed to pee. i wasn't anywhere near turned on enough to squirt, so i was pretty sure i had to pee. i was going through the motions, making sure my breasts bounced attractively while thinking, don't pee! don't pee!

jayapal is a leader of a medicare for all house caucus that had 78 members as of late november and, with an infusion of newly elected democrats, should soon have more. the new bill will be similar to one she co-sponsored in the last congress, which in turn was similar to a bill sanders introduced in the senate.

sanders' colleagues in the house and senate, like rep. ruben gallego (d-ariz.) and sen. elizabeth warren (d-mass.), have also been out front calling for the government to help cover coronavirus treatments. gallego's proposal in the house would have medicaid, the federal health insurance program for low-income americans, cover treatment.

when you came to the business side of things, there was a complete dearth of conversation about inclusion, even though social and racial justice were at the forefront of the talking points around why you should legalize and why you should allow local jurisdictions to give permits, lencho said. but no one was talking about providing permits for those who actually went to jail for cannabis.
he instead hammered home the need for help from washington, including through the reinstatement of the full federal income tax deduction for state and local taxes, and proposed an array of spending cuts and revenue raisers.
according to an estimate from gilead sciences, which manufactures truvada, about three quarters of the men who have filled a prep prescription are white while just 9 percent are black. considering the racial breakdown of the epidemic among msm, these figures are gravely lopsided.
but due to the lack of regulations around herbal supplements, kratom is largely free from consumer standards on quality or dosing, leading to fears about the possible adulteration of products and problems related to improper self-medication or misuse by youth. the fda has maintained that kratom is dangerous, and has pointed to the lack of an approved medical use as justification to impound numerous shipments of kratom products into the u.s.

los angeles ― california is now the largest state in the nation to have legal and regulated recreational marijuana. and while that alone is a blow to the prohibitionist policies of the failed war on drugs, a lesser-known provision in the state's new law, along with efforts in a few local jurisdictions, aims to repair some of the damage that the criminalization of marijuana has done to so many communities.

i certainly don't see any of these suddenly outspoken republicans denouncing the trump administration's directive to include a citizenship question in the 2020 census for the first time in 70 years at the behest of the disgraced steve bannon. a change that will result in the undercounting of immigrants and minorities.

the consensus was clear: this narrative is incredibly overblown. tribal leaders have far more pressing matters to deal with than a senator's dna test. and, frustratingly, non-native people are defining a debate about native people without letting them speak for themselves.
huffpost uk reports that taylor swift, paul mccartney, diana ross and lana del rey were all due to perform at the festival, which was due to celebrate its 50th anniversary. the event's cancellation follows the decision to postpone this year's coachella to october. around 135,000 tickets had already been sold for the five-day event.
sanders, meanwhile, has continued to remind voters of his long-standing support for expanding social security and his plans to bring down prescription drug prices. the sanders campaign has spent more than $700,000 on a television ad highlighting his willingness to battle pharmaceutical companies, according to data from advertising analytics. and alex lawson, a sanders supporter who runs the advocacy group social security works, has made two trips to iowa this month to pitch seniors in small towns on sanders' agenda.

oakland's newly created department of race and equity, led by darlene flynn, produced an equity analysis to see how outcomes for people of color might be improved by the kind of equitable cannabis policy brooks had proposed.
even though bernie has not announced yet, the opposition certainly has, said demoro, one of the only national labor union leaders to back sanders in 2016. they're not trying to take bernie out; they're trying to take the movement out.
san francisco is unique in its method of drug surveillance and user education, said daniel raymond, policy director of the national harm reduction coalition.
of course, wraparound services and other forms of prep outreach aren't necessarily cheap; widespread use of prep among black msm will likely come with a much higher overall price tag than for their white peers.
remembering those women of color who have been left behind when their men have fallen is another aspect of the war on drugs that gets forgotten about. andrea unsworth, supernova women
other democrats have proposed an expanded government role in providing health coverage and medical care through means such as a public option plan that would compete with private health insurance or proposals to allow consumers to buy into medicare or medicaid.

your generation is a situation where you're the least prejudiced, the most open, you're the best educated, but until recently ― and then thank god, this has changed ― you haven't been very interested in politics, generally, he said. and so now you're engaged and i'm looking forward to you voting and voting in big numbers. but everyone is voting in bigger numbers as well.
the organization is currently notifying anyone who has had known contact with the players, including recent opponents, and is working closely with state and local health authorities on reporting, the nets said. all players and members of the nets travel party are being asked to remain isolated, closely monitor their health and maintain constant communication with team medical staff.
healy noted that the senate campaign had created a human resources hotline which employees could use to report harassment without fear of retaliation or discomfort, provided mandatory sexual harassment training to all staff and volunteers, and made sure that the signs explaining the campaign's anti-harassment policy were posted visibly in all areas.
there were also reports about instances that resulted in death:
all barber shops, hair salons, nail salons, tattoo parlors and related personal care services in new york, new jersey, connecticut and pennsylvania must close by saturday at 8 p.m., as these services cannot be provided while maintaining social distance, new york gov. andrew cuomo (d) announced.

gamestop, the video game chain that operates 5,800 stores across the country, has been instructing its employees to keep stores open. executives consider the chain essential retail alongside grocery stores and pharmacies, which have been allowed to remain open even in areas hit hardest by the outbreak.
the positive test results come after reports that multiple utah jazz players also got infected by the virus. the nba announced in response that it was suspending the basketball season.
doctors, nurses and specialists have been questioning the government's management of coronavirus, including a decision not to postpone local editions last sunday. doctors have also called for a policy of total containment and raised doubts over resourcing in hospitals.
we now believe that our manufacturing is predictable enough that we can ensure second doses are available for people from ongoing production, azar told abc's good morning america. so everything is now available to our states and our health care providers.
also: we are sending, upon request, the two hospital ships. they're being prepared right now. they're massive ships. the big white ships with the red cross on the sides.
the ban on nonessential cross-border travel went into effect at midnight et and will stay in place for at least 30 days as both countries scramble to curb the rapid spread of covid-19.
unfortunately, while our world-class athletes are willing to push themselves to their athletic limits in pursuit of olympic success, the likelihood that they will be able to properly train in a safe and adequate environment, and replicate the excellence we have all come to expect, does not appear likely in the midst of this global crisis, ceo max seigel said.
although dallas' use of money bail is in some way unremarkable, it also employs some particularly egregious practices. after bail hearings, deputies have a unusually direct way of extracting cash from defendants who can afford bail.
powers said weinstein, 68, had been placed in isolation at wende correctional facility, a maximum-security prison near buffalo, new york. several staff members have also been quarantined, powers said.
these practices contribute substantially to the number of people incarcerated in the u.s. at any time, there are nearly 450,000 people who have not been convicted of a crime in jails across the country, with many facing only low-level charges. they account for nearly two-thirds of the jail population, and one-fifth of all people behind bars. jailing these people costs u.s. taxpayers approximately $38 million each day, or $14 billion annually, according to a pretrial justice institute report published last year.
the drugstore chain announced the new policy in a nov. 21 directive to employees, which stated: all individuals have a right to use restroom facilities that correspond to the individual's gender identity, regardless of the individual's sex assigned at birth. (read the full company directive here.)
but given that single-payer is staunchly opposed by republicans in washington and has struggled to get sufficient support even in california's democratic-controlled legislature, the more consequential action, for now, will likely be on three other parts of newsom's announcement.
trump has used his power to reward those with powerful connections, as well as friends and allies — including those who may harbor damning evidence about his own behavior.
one is a call to substantially increase the financial assistance available to people who buy private insurance through covered california, which is the online insurance marketplace that the state runs as part of the affordable care act.
pubs, gyms and indoor sporting venues will shut down, while restaurants and cafes will be limited to takeaway orders only.
while the number of confirmed cases continues to increase, in part because of the increased availability of tests, cuomo was cautiously optimistic.
the u.k. government has signaled a major ramping up of its preparedness efforts by calling on more than 65,000 retired doctors and nurses to return to work.
others are enthusiastic about medicare for all, but think it would be more practical, as policy and politics, to have a more gradual transition ― for example, by making the new public insurance plan voluntary for individuals and employers, while enrolling newborns so that it gets bigger over time. that's the approach of a new bill from reps. rosa delauro (d-conn.) and jan schakowsky (d-ill.).
one reason medicare for all will get a hard look is that the democratic party's increasingly powerful progressives are determined to improve upon the coverage gains made under affordable care act, which has helped many millions get health care but also left many millions still struggling to pay medical bills. a single government insurance plan, progressives say, would be more efficient and effective than obamacare's awkward mix of private and public plans.
the orders from louisiana gov. john bel edwards (d) and ohio gov. mike dewine (r) stress that staying at home is a stricter form of social distancing, and that if people need to go out, they must stay at least six feet away from others and not gather in groups. the orders also say residents should not go out to work unless their job is considered an essential service.
in last 24 hrs there've been prominent us voices calling for a stop to social distancing, citing rationale that they're worse than impact of covid itself, tom inglesby tweeted. these big social distancing measures take time to work. … to drop all these measures now would be to accept that covid pts will get sick in extraordinary numbers all over the country, far beyond what the us health care system could bear.
india announced on thursday that no scheduled international commercial passenger aircraft will be allowed to land in the country beginning march 22 for one week. the central government has also asked states to make sure that private sector employees, except those working in emergency or essential services, work from home. the country reported its fourth death from the coronavirus on thursday, in punjab. prime minister narendra modi is expected to address the country at 8 p.m. ist.
the contractor, the electrician, the plumber, the carpenters ― they're the ones that benefit when rich people spend money on their homes, continued hannity, who has been linked to shell companies that spent tens of millions investing in residential real estate over the last decade.
i can't emphasize enough how much a conviction affects a person's life the moment it happens. almost every application they fill out will ask, 'have you ever been convicted of a crime?' mayor jenny durkan said at the conference. while we cannot reverse all the harm that was done, we can give back to those people a record that says they were not convicted.
harvey weinstein, the disgraced film mogul who is currently serving a 23-year prison sentence for rape and sexual assault, has tested positive for coronavirus.
indeed, this is fantastic news—for white msm.
an arizona man has died after consuming a toxic, non-medicinal version of chloroquine, an active ingredient in drugs touted last week by president donald trump as a potential game changer for treating covid-19, which also appears in a product used to clean fish tanks.

senator rand paul has tested positive for covid-19. he is feeling fine and is in quarantine. he is asymptomatic and was tested out of an abundance of caution due to his extensive travel and events. he was not aware of any direct contact with any infected person. — senator rand paul (@randpaul) march 22, 2020
the taxes and premiums would be in lieu of what private individuals and employers pay for insurance today, so that, advocates say, a majority would come out ahead. but exactly how many would depend on the budget arithmetic in the rest of the program. if the cuts in payments to doctors and hospitals aren't deep enough, for example, the whole program would end up more expensive, requiring bigger taxes and swelling the ranks of people who would feel worse off financially.
paul is the first senator known to have contracted the virus. two members of the house said last week that they had tested positive, making them the first members of congress known to be infected.
as a whole, the data suggests the fda is basing its warnings about kratom's fatal harms on a patchwork of loosely sourced anecdotal reports that say very little about how the drug is responsible for the fatalities ― or even whether it is at all.
that is no minor thing. medicare pays far less than commercial insurers and hospitals say the reimbursements are not sufficient to cover their costs. it's why a public option could potentially offer lower premiums but also why, historically, proposals have generated such intense opposition from hospitals.
use less of it, use it slower, use it with other people, and keep narcan with you, marshall said. it's also important to test your drugs. even if you know you're getting fentanyl, you need to run additional tests to see what else might be in the mix.
everyone be careful, take care of yourself and quarantine, durant told the athletic. we're going to get through this.
the dems' new push will focus on three areas: consolidation of health care markets driving up prices for consumers, the monopolization of big tech platforms and anti-competitive labor abuses like non-compete agreements and wage fixing. hearings on these issues could even result in the first major rewrite of antitrust law since the 1950s.
millions of lives depend on getting the coronavirus response right — and so does the economic and social health of communities around the world, bloomberg, a former 2020 presidential candidate, said in a statement.
as for the leadership of these three pivotal studies, out of the more than 50 authors of the associated published papers, none were african-american men. neither of the iprex studies had a single black author, while just two black women are listed among the prep demo project paper's authors.
new york progressives already have a policy template from across the hudson river in new jersey, where gov. phil murphy (d) finally succeeded in cutting a deal with the democratic-run legislature in september to raise income taxes on earnings of $1 million to 5 million from 8.97% to 10.75%. the state also raised its surtax on corporate income from 1.5% to 2.5%. at the same time, he expanded the earned-income tax credit to 60,000 more low-income state residents.
cicilline has emerged as an aggressive voice calling for a break with the antitrust status quo that has turned a blind eye to the extreme consolidation across the economy. he helped launch a congressional antitrust caucus and is the lead sponsor of key antitrust reform bills that range from giving the news media more power to organize against digital ad monopolies like google and facebook to modernizing the antitrust laws passed during the age of teddy roosevelt.
this week, senator mitt romney (r-utah) called on king to step aside and for congress to make it very clear he has no place there. this was eight years after king ignorantly proclaimed that former president barack obama had a default mechanism in him that breaks down the side of race – on the side that favors the black person. mind you, in 2012, romney told an iowa crowd that king needs to be your congressman again. i want him as my partner in washington!
but where the republican leadership was not interested in prioritizing these issues in the last congress, the democratic party leadership is insistent on pursuing them.

in theory, democratic lawmakers do not need to wait for cuomo's approval. they have the power to pass laws raising taxes and to override cuomo's veto if he chooses to block them. and both new york assembly speaker carl heastie and state senate majority leader andrea stewart-cousins have expressed support for higher taxes on the wealthy.
that's the essence of what native people are thinking about, he said. they're just trying to keep afloat.
the story of 21st-century america is complex, but the narrative of powerful people behaving terribly and getting away with it is arguably the common thread. consider the illegal torture operations of george w. bush, dick cheney and john yoo. reflect on the financial frauds perpetrated by wall street bankers and foreclosure mills last decade (they're not exactly complying with the law this decade, either). contemplate the big lies of fossil fuel executives like exxon chair turned secretary of state rex tillerson. think about the violations of consent decrees, tax laws and antitrust statutes by the likes of mark zuckerberg, sheryl sandberg and the rest of silicon valley. reckon with the horrifying conduct brought front and center by #metoo. and then come to terms with the number of the aforementioned elites whose potential criminal liability has been taken seriously by prosecutors ― approximately zero.
what matters is the policies, said andy simpson, a manhattanite who crossed the east river to attend the party.
the fact is you've got to be able to represent anyone, he continued, before finishing with a joke: it's also, i've found, very difficult to get people to show up on a college campus before 4 o'clock.
at the tuesday press conference, inslee said the plan would be available in all parts of the state, in part to fulfill one of its chief goals: to make sure everybody has coverage available. washington, like many states, has had trouble keeping insurers from abandoning rural areas. this year, 14 counties in the state have only one carrier.
these temporary closures are not going to be easy, but they are necessary to protect the public health. — andrew cuomo (@nygovcuomo) march 20, 2020
the big question is how doctors, hospitals, drugmakers and all the other industries related to health care would react. some would figure out how to become more efficient or live with lower margins. some would react simply by reducing capacity, right at a moment when millions of newly insured people were seeking it.
congressional democrats are supportive of this push for more antitrust oversight. rep. jerry nadler (d-n.y.), the incoming chairman of the house judiciary committee, told antitrust regulators at an oversight hearing in december that congress had abdicated its role for too long by allowing pro-big business administrations, both republican and democratic, to erode antitrust laws.
baltimore's state's attorney, marilyn mosby, ordered her staff to drop all pending charges for a bevy of crimes, including drug possession or attempted distribution, prostitution and minor traffic violations.

don't anticipate schools are going to open up in a week. please don't anticipate in a few weeks, newsom said during a news conference, according to the los angles times. i would plan, and assume, that it's unlikely that many of these schools — few, if any — will open before the summer break.almost every school district in the state is closed, impacting more than 6 million students in public schools. districts have continued to teach via online classes and homework. kansas also closed all state-accredited schools, representing nearly 500,000 students, for the rest of the school year on tuesday.
almost all of the fda's cases involve subjects who were found to be on multiple substances at the time of their death, with the vast majority including either illicit or prescription drugs that carry well-known fatal risks.
his conclusion: the vast majority of drug users don't want fentanyl. the third and deadliest wave of the opioid epidemic, ciccarone and other researchers said, was driven by drug traffickers, not by user demand. the powerful white powder was mostly killing people who were unaware of its presence.
jayapal has said she hopes a version will get a floor vote, although that seems a long ways off. the committees taking up the proposal initially aren't actually the ones that would write a health care bill. even so, the hearings could represent the most serious attention the concept has received on capitol hill since the late 1940s, when committees took up then-president harry truman's similarly designed, but ill-fated national health insurance proposal.
cuomo also blasted the federal emergency management agency for sending the state only 400 ventilators.
the number of registered cases in the country rose by nearly 5,000 in 24 hours to 24,926 on saturday.

we put in place the act which passed and doug ford has completely destroyed. he's just not acted on any of it … i really wish i could have explored more ways to lock it into the system so it'd be more difficult for him to dismantle.
holcombe hopes that local jurisdictions ― and other states that may legalize one day ― give a leg up in the industry to even more people, especially those who don't have the funds to start a business and who may have a marijuana conviction that makes getting a bank loan difficult. holcombe said cities could address this through allocating a portion of marijuana sales tax to fund these equity applicants' start-up businesses while also prioritizing women and minority business applicants.
he maintained that the nationwide fentanyl epidemic has been primarily supply driven. but for unknown reasons, the cartels decided not to push fentanyl in california until recently, he said. if fentanyl is starting to become a demand issue here in california, that could be really bad news.
then, in october of 2008, i got a dui in the parking lot of my building. (to the officer's credit, i did throw up on her.) i had spent the better part of the evening taking shots of tequila with a bartender i wanted to bang.
more than 17 million americans have filed for unemployment in the past four weeks; those who lost health benefits are eligible to extend their benefits through cobra, buy into the aca, or in many cases apply for medicaid. even for those with insurance, there have been reports of massive hospital bills for coronavirus treatment.

president donald trump said national guard troops are being activated to help new york, california and washington state respond to the coronavirus pandemic.
and while the relief for past convictions is a component built into california's new marijuana laws, the process is not automatic or well-known. individuals with past marijuana convictions must know the relief exists, petition the courts themselves to file the appropriate paperwork and may need to retain an attorney to do so. the process can be time consuming and costly. gascón's approach, however, is novel because no action is required from eligible individuals with past marijuana convictions to take advantage of the law. his office is applying the relief process on its own.
wages have been stagnant. people can't work enough with the additional cost of living going up, with housing prices the way they are, with rents the way they are.
in that moment, they made it crystal clear … that they view me as the most significant threat.
california produces vast amounts of marijuana and has done so for years. in 1996, it became the first state to legalize medical marijuana. and despite the passage of more permissive laws, there were still thousands of marijuana-related arrests annually. from 2006 to 2015, there were nearly 500,000 people arrested for marijuana offenses, a recent drug policy alliance report found. and rodney holcombe, a legal fellow at dpa, said that there may be close to 1 million people in the state who have convictions that could now be eligible for relief.
working out the chances of death from coronavirus is not a simple process, not least because an unknown number of people with mild symptoms won't see a health professional, but may pass the infection on to someone else who may be at higher risk.
prince albert ii has tested positive for coronavirus, the palace of monaco has announced. the palace said that the prince, who is working from home, is being treated by doctors. the prince is the first head of state to test positive, but not the first royal. karl von habsburg, the archduke of austria, was the first to announce he had coronavirus.

while white house officials have assured the public that they are working on providing masks to health care professionals, the timeline on doing so is not clear.
i think there is a dot where those two lines cross, cuomo said, announcing he has convened experts to begin to consider how to restart the economic engine, which could include younger and healthier people going back to work sooner, and testing people to see if they are immune.
it can't just be: 'hey, who wants to help, let me know!' we need to know who is going to produce what and when, cuomo said. this is a national emergency.
one case the fda listed as a kratom-related death, which has been completely redacted in the document, appears elsewhere in an agency database as a death by homicide due to a gunshot wound to the chest.
finkenauer, who is the second-youngest woman ever elected to congress — ocasio-cortez is the youngest — indicated she wasn't too worried about biden's struggles with young voters. after all, biden had won over a college-age finkenauer during his last campaign in 2008.
in comments to the corriere della sera newspaper, prime minister giuseppe conte said measures taken to close schools, universities and to impose severe restrictions on movement would have to be prolonged. under current measures, italy's 60 million people are only allowed to travel for work, medical reasons or emergencies under an order that runs until april 3, while most shops, except those selling food and pharmacies, are supposed to remain closed until march 25.
wow, this sounds bad! let's see what all these tribal chiefs and native people are saying about warren's dna test and why her decision to release it was so outrageous.
indeed, in a statement e-mailed to huffpost, a spokesperson for walgreens explained it is the company's policy to allow pharmacists and other employees to step away from completing a transaction to which they may have a moral objection, and requires the pharmacist or other employee to refer the transaction to another employee or manager on duty to complete the customer's request.
widespread access to the internet means that a significant proportion of the global population can stay well-informed about rapidly-developing situations such as the coronavirus outbreak, but it can also provide a space for dangerous conspiracy theories and 'cures' to flourish.
based on the fda's recent public actions, however, it appears to favor outright prohibition, a move that would cut off millions of americans ― many of whom have struggled with opioids or other prescription drugs ― from their preferred method of treatment. some drug policy experts and a handful of congressional lawmakers have said the damage caused by forcing people away from kratom, and possibly back onto other prescription or illicit drugs, would far outweigh the current harms. furthermore, if kratom were to be banned, many individuals would simply continue buying and using it illegally. if feds are worried about controlling kratom now, driving it onto the black market will only make that harder.
however, dr. anthony fauci, the director of the national institute of allergy and infectious disease, has said that a dramatic reduction in activity is necessary to curb the spread of the virus, and he hasn't ruled out a nationwide lockdown.

that americans no longer trust their institutions or elites should not be a source of wonderment ― it should be seen as a rational response to the declining trustworthiness of the people with the most power in this country. if with great power comes great responsibility, then why is our criminal justice system so focused on jailing poor people for being unable to pay fines for modest offenses or nonviolent drug possession?
the former minister says his biggest accomplishment in office was funding a massive expansion of public transit and investments in infrastructure like roads and bridges.
referring to 2016 democratic presidential nominee hillary clinton, russell whitehouse, a progressive activist and internet entrepreneur, said, it didn't work last time. we ran a centrist last time.
on monday, biden held events at two different college campuses ― at iowa and at the university of northern iowa in cedar falls ― and drew much smaller crowds. his event at northern iowa, in particular, had almost no students in attendance.
with the help of harm reduction workers who supply narcan and drug test strips, many fentanyl users have developed ways of protecting themselves from overdoses. and despite the drug's short-lived euphoria, they say they plan to continue using fentanyl, albeit carefully, primarily because of its value, marshall said.
today, with mixed emotions, i have signed h. 511, said scott in a statement addressed to the state's general assembly. i personally believe that what adults do behind closed doors and on private property is their choice, so long as it does not negatively impact the health and safety of others, especially children.

in illinois, billionaire gov. j.b. pritzker (d) bankrolled a constitutional amendment ballot initiative that would have allowed the adoption of a progressive income tax, replacing the current system, which only permits a single, flat income tax rate. by its very nature, levying the same tax rate ― currently 4.95% ― on all state residents disproportionately affects low- and middle-income people, for whom the sum is more onerous. and the system has forced illinois to rely more heavily on property taxes, which wealthy residents have often evaded by hiring politically connected property tax appeals lawyers.
a new york times/siena college poll released saturday morning found sanders jumping to a substantial lead, earning 25% of the vote, while buttigeg draws 18%, biden 17% and warren 15%. no other candidate earned double-digit support. john anzalone, the pollster for the biden campaign, immediately suggested the poll's sample leaned too young. nate cohn, the times reporter responsible for the poll, noted sanders would have led even without the inclusion of any 18-to-29-year-old voters.

with the most ambitious progressive tax reforms off the table in california and illinois, new york stands out as the biggest blue-state laboratory for progressive solutions to covid-19 budget woes.
tatem, president of the east valley naacp in metropolitan phoenix, argued that a second sanders campaign would have greater success in reaching the middle-aged and older voters of color who proved so elusive for sanders in 2016. the senator would no longer struggle to merely establish name recognition with these voters and inform them about his progressive platform, according to tatem.
iowa city, iowa ― the political fortunes of former vice president joe biden and vermont sen. bernie sanders could hinge on how many young voters show up to next week's iowa caucuses, which are historically dominated by older voters with the ability to dedicate a full night to participating in the lengthy, labor-intensive process.
