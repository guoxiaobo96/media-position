zach gibson via getty images mat staver (far right), the founder of liberty counsel, at a demonstration outside the supreme court on dec. 12, 2018. after backlash against his opposition to an anti-lynching bill, the group claimed that listing protected categories in the legislation would limit its application.\n\nafter more than a century of inaction from congress, the senate unanimously approved legislation in december that would make lynching a federal hate crime.\n\nbut some conservative evangelical christian activists are upset that the justice for victims of lynching act contains language that specifically protects people on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity.\n\nmat staver, the founder of the conservative litigation group liberty counsel, told the christian news site onenewsnow that his team is talking to house politicians to ensure that the act is stripped of this inclusive language.\n\nthe old saying is once that camel gets the nose in the tent, you can't stop them from coming the rest of the way in, he said in an interview published tuesday.\n\nwhile emphasizing that he's generally in favor of banning lynching, staver claimed the bill is being used to further other proposed federal legislation that would explicitly protect queer americans from discrimination at work and in other contexts.\n\nthis is a way to slip it in under a so-called anti-lynching bill, and to then to sort of circle the wagon and then go for the juggler [sic] at some time in the future, he said.\n\nliberty counsel has spent years advocating against lgbtq rights, prioritizing the religious liberty of conservative christians over the civil rights of queer americans. the organization represented kim davis, the now-former kentucky county clerk who was jailed in 2015 after refusing to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples. staver, who served as her lawyer, painted her as an evangelical christian heroine, comparing her at one point to jewish people who were persecuted by the nazis.\n\nassociated press staver (left) at a news conference discussing a trial on same-sex marriages in san francisco in 2006. in a recent interview he said his team is talking to house politicians to ensure that the anti-lynching bill is stripped of language protecting lgbt people.\n\non its surface, the justice for victims of lynching act isn't about queer rights. the bill addresses the crime of lynching ― extrajudicial executions carried out by a mob. according to the naacp, lynching was used after the civil war to resolve some of the anger that whites had in relation to the free blacks. at least 4,742 people, predominantly african-americans, were reportedly lynched in america from 1882 to 1968.\n\nsince a new session of congress has begun, the senate-approved act and a corresponding bill in the house that's still in committee will likely have to be reintroduced.\n\nas of now, the senate bill defines lynching as two or more people willfully caus[ing] bodily injury because of the victim's actual or perceived race, color, religion, national origin, disability, gender, sexual orientation or gender identity.\n\nstaver told onenewsnow that if passed, the justice for victims of lynching act would be the first federal law to mention gender identity and sexual orientation.\n\npizer said lgbtq americans still urgently need comprehensive and explicit federal anti-discrimination laws. according to the american civil liberties union, only a minority of states have laws that specifically protect queer people.\n\nlambda legal, the aclu, and other progressive organizations have been pushing for the passage of the equality act, a bill that would prohibit discrimination against queer people in employment, housing, education and other areas of their lives.\n\nbecause there continues to be confusion and debate about whether lgbtq people already are legally equal — and whether or not we should be equal — we need the law to be inclusive and crystal clear, pizer told huffpost in an email.\n\nassociated press mike huckabee (left), rowan county clerk kim davis and staver, her lawyer, after her release from jail in 2015 for refusing to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples in kentucky. liberty counsel has for years advocated against lgbtq rights.\n\nin response to backlash it received for staver's position on the anti-lynching bill, liberty counsel released a statement thursday claiming that what he actually meant in the onenewsnow interview was that including a list of protected categories in the justice for victims of lynching act would limit the law's application.\n\nlynching should be prohibited no matter the person's reason for committing this violent crime, staver said in the statement.\n\nthe organization also said it has received death threats over the issue.\n\nin a youtube video defending the organization, jonathan alexandre, liberty counsel's public policy director, said that some politicians and media organizations are using lynching's horrible history to push unrelated political agendas. he confirmed that liberty counsel is questioning members of congress about the created list of protected categories.\n\nthe historical victims of lynching should not, as i do not, tolerate the hijacking of this issue by political agenda, he said.\n\nliberty counsel has not responded to a request for comment on why it believes lgbtq americans should not be treated as a protected class.\n\npizer said she believes liberty counsel has repeatedly used an ends-justify-the-means approach to furthering its goals.\n\nwith the grossly disproportionate rates of hate crimes against lgbtq people, and the horrifying rate of murders of transgender women of color in particular, a demand to strip [sexual orientation and gender identity] out of an anti-lynching bill is truly dumbfounding, and beyond comprehension, she said. that it would be done by someone claiming to be motivated by christian teachings just shows how deeply perverse and inhumane that anti-lgbt advocacy can become.
last month the nation watched, transfixed, as more than a hundred women stood before a michigan courtroom to describe how larry nassar altered their lives with his abuse. they were heard and heeded. the judge listened, the media listened, the world listened, and those girls and women were told that their suffering mattered. many women who are sexually abused get their day in court, but on a different side of the judge ― when they're defendants in a criminal case. and their abuse, it seems, counts for little.\n\na staggering number of incarcerated women are victims of childhood sexual abuse. studies suggest that between 47 and 82 percent of women have endured that crime. other studies say 94 percent of incarcerated women have been victimized sexually, some as children, others as adults.\n\nbecause women have long been lumped in with male prisoners in correctional and prosecutorial planning for years, it's only recently that researchers culled data that show what's really happening to incarcerated women. last year, the prison policy initiative painted the first landscape of female incarceration. what they found was disturbing.\n\njail, as opposed to prison, has become a correctional catch basin for women: sixty percent of women in jail are unsentenced, left behind bars because they are unable to afford bond. the remaining 40 percent of female jail detainees are sentenced but have not been moved to a prison because they are low-risk inmates. in 2016, the vera institute of justice conducted surveys of that jail population and found that 86 percent of them reported being sexually violated before being incarcerated.\n\nthe united states has made a practice of locking up victims.\n\nin other words, the united states has made a practice of locking up victims. the blame for that practice can be laid at the feet of the burgeoning opioid crisis; the war on drugs, which has a disparate effect on women; and our widespread insistence on ignoring girls when they report sexual abuse.\n\nthe campaign for trauma-informed policy and practice has detailed the connection between opioid addictions and childhood sexual abuse. victims of childhood trauma are more likely to report debilitating physical pain and be prescribed pain medication, and 80 percent of people seeking treatment for opioid addiction have experienced at least one form of childhood trauma, including sexual abuse. childhood sexual abuse, particularly among women, is highly correlated with opioid abuse. women are increasingly likely to turn to opioids for relief from pain, be it physical, psychic or both. between 2002 and 2013, heroin use among women doubled.\n\nduring roughly that same time, between 1989 and 2009, drug possession arrests among women tripled (for men, they doubled). women who are imprisoned for heroin possession are not a danger to the community; that's why they're allowed to stay in jails rather than in higher-security prisons. eighty-two percent of women in state prisons have been convicted of nonviolent offenses.\n\nwomen in state prisons are more likely to be incarcerated for a drug or property offense (like theft) than men are. according to the sentencing project, 24 percent of women in state facilities have been convicted of a drug offense, compared to 15 percent of male prisoners. when it comes to property crimes, 28 percent of incarcerated women have been convicted, compared to 19 percent among incarcerated men.\n\nthe failed war on drugs has targeted women at the very moment that illegal drugs are more widely available to women who are seeking relief from profound suffering.\n\nwe have the beginnings of a tailor-made solution to this problem before us right now. unlike past reforms, which used a one-policy-fits-all-genders mode, the dignity for incarcerated women act seeks to address the unique needs of this swelling population. introduced last summer by senators cory booker (d-n.j.) and elizabeth warren (d-mass.) and co-sponsored by sens. kamala harris (d-calif.) and dick durbin (d-ill.), the bill recognizes the history of sexual abuse shared by so many women behind bars.\n\nthe dignity act insists that incarcerated women be viewed through a lens of trauma; for example, it bans cross-gender strip searches and other re-traumatizing security measures and mandates that inmates who menstruate receive sufficient feminine hygiene products. even though it hasn't been scheduled for a hearing, the dignity act has already had demonstrable impact: within a month of its introduction, the federal bureau of prisons issued a memo promising to provide adequate and free menstrual supplies. while the dignity act and all of its state-level progeny are revolutionary legislation and deserve a hearing and a yea vote, these laws do little to prevent the fact that the women it's trying to dignify probably shouldn't be incarcerated in the first place.\n\nan even better approach to justice reform laws is to treat women in the justice system with a filter of trauma — rather than a lens. this means pulling out female arrestees who have been abused before they reach a correctional facility and referring them to appropriate treatment. in addition to respecting victims' experiences, such a shift in practice would slow the out-of-control rate of growth of the female incarcerated population.\n\nmany people will balk at such a solution because it doesn't roar with accountability for offenders; female arrestees broke the law, after all, some in very serious ways. but the fever for accountability ― the fever that spiked as nassar's victims described their suffering with such eloquence and rage ― needs to be brought down. one way to do that is to recognize that our thirst for justice in an extreme case like the nassar scandal is at odds with how we treat many victims of child sex abuse.\n\nour sympathy for sexual abuse victims, while we're in the throes of punishing their abusers, is righteous. but it seems to fade away when they self-medicate because the pain of their victimization is too much to bear. it disappears when victims respond to their pain in ways that are less socially acceptable than testifying at their abuser's sentencing. all victims of sexual abuse deserve our compassion ― and they need help, not punishment.\n\nchandra bozelko is the author of up the river: an anthology and writes the award-winning blog prison diaries. she is a 2018 justleadership usa leading with conviction fellow.
jeff greenberg via getty images the manhattan skyline glowing with electric power, as seen from the long island city side of the queensboro bridge.\n\nastoria, n.y. ― a top new york city councilman is preparing to introduce a bill mandating that the city come up with a plan by the end of the year to phase out nearly two dozen gas-fired power plants and replace them with renewable sources of electricity.\n\nthe legislation would require the city to carry out a study on the feasibility of replacing existing in-city gas-fired plants with renewables that use battery storage, according to a draft huffpost obtained. by dec. 30, 2019, the city would have to lay out a plan to swap those gas-fired generating stations for new wind or solar units paired with batteries.\n\nthere's no guarantee the study will result in a workable proposal. but the impact could be huge. of the 24 power plants in new york city, 21 burn gas, contributing to the roughly 30 percent of the city's greenhouse gas emissions that come from the utility sector, according to city data. the other three burn petroleum, an even dirtier fuel, and would likely be affected by any policy aimed at drastically shrinking fossil fuel's share of the city's electricity production.\n\nreached by phone on monday, councilman costa constantinides, the queens lawmaker who authored the bill, confirmed its existence but declined to comment on its details.\n\ndonald trump may love power plants, but we know the 21st-century future is a green grid, said constantinides, who chairs the council's committee on environmental protection.\n\nthe bill, announced tuesday and set to be introduced wednesday, marks a significant step toward weaning the nation's largest and most economically influential city off fossil fuels. six cities across the united states already generate 100 percent of their electricity with renewables. the city council in washington, d.c., passed a bill last month requiring the city to offset 100 percent of its electricity purchases with renewable energy credits by 2032. but it would be a historic first for a metropolis like new york to shutter existing gas plants like these, and the city's move would likely ripple far beyond the five boroughs as other big cities sought ways to slash climate-changing emissions.\n\nsome small cities have managed to shift to renewable electricity but nothing on the scale of new york, said david pomerantz, executive director of the nonprofit energy and policy institute, which tracks the utility sector.\n\nit's unclear whether an overhaul of new york's power stations would trigger utility cost increases for ratepayers, but industry groups likely to oppose the bill are expected to argue that it would.\n\nthe legislation calls for researching at least six different types of batteries to store excess wind or solar power for times when the wind doesn't blow and the sun isn't shining. that would, in theory, offer the increased energy reliability needed to replace a network of gas-fired peaker plants on the new york waterfront. those plants provide backup power when demand is high or there's a malfunction at power stations upstate.\n\nalexander c. kaufman / huffpost councilman costa constantinides announced a bill to reduce emissions from big buildings at a city hall press conference last year.\n\nbut a large share of new york city's locally produced electricity is generated by two power plants in the densely populated northwestern corner of queens that constantinides represents. the plants, located in the councilman's native astoria and neighboring long island city, each burn a mix of gas and fuel oil. the stations annually burn a combined 6.3 million gallons of no. 6 fuel oil ― a thick, viscous blend considered one of the most polluting energy sources in the world. the long island city plant, called ravenswood generating station, was ranked the state's largest carbon polluter in 2014.\n\nthe bill's announcement comes nearly two weeks after an equipment malfunction at a consolidated edison substation next door to the astoria generating station released an electric arc flash that illuminated the city sky with an eerie neon blue. the accident, the result of a broken voltage monitoring system, had no direct connection to the neighboring power plant.\n\nbut the incident ― on which constantinides is scheduled to hold a feb. 11 hearing ― raised new concerns about the risks of burning fossil fuels for electricity in a residential neighborhood and cast a new light on existing public health problems linked to power plant pollution.\n\nspeaking at a press conference outside a utility complex in astoria on tuesday morning, constantinides said, it's time for a greener future here in western queens.\n\nastoria borealis was a spotlight on the issues of what we're dealing with in our community, he said.\n\nin 2015, astoria and long island city suffered from higher pollution levels than the rest of the borough and the city, according to new york city department of health findings. the levels of pm2.5 ― a fine-grain pollutant that wedges into lung tissue when inhaled, making it one of the most harmful types of particulate matter ― hit 8.9 micrograms per cubic meter, higher than the 8.4 average for queens overall and the 8.6 average citywide.\n\nqueens officials, including constantinides, have long blamed the plants for the two neighborhoods' high levels of asthma, which earned one part of northern astoria the nickname asthma alley. in 2017, the city council passed legislation requiring the utility operators to stop using no. 6 fuel oil by 2020 and no. 4 oil by 2030. the new bill would be the first to lay the groundwork for phasing out the plants altogether.\n\nbloomberg via getty images an electric arc released by an equipment malfunction at a conedison substation in astoria illuminated the new york skyline late last month.\n\nmeanwhile in albany, the new democratic majorities in both houses of the new york legislature are preparing to push the climate and community protection act, a bill that would mandate 100 percent renewable energy across the state by 2050. the ccpa has repeatedly passed in the state assembly since it was first introduced in 2016, but the previous republican majority in the state senate refused to hold a vote on it. gov. andrew cuomo (d), who now says he wants to shift the state to 100 percent carbon-free electricity by 2040, declined to champion the legislation last year.\n\nnew york state generates just 5 percent of its electricity from wind or solar. the new york city area consumes roughly 60 percent of all power in the state, but produces just 40 percent.\n\ndemocratic state sen. jessica ramos, a newly elected legislator from queens, vowed to co-sponsor the ccpa and consider other ways to provide state-level support to constantinides' legislation.\n\nwe're looking into what can be done as a state measure as we speak, she told huffpost on monday. it's exactly what we should be doing.\n\nstate agencies are already making a push. last june, new york's department of public service issued a report outlining an energy storage roadmap. in december, the state's public service commission released a plan requiring utilities such as conedison to procure a total of 350 megawatts of storage as part of a broader blueprint to decrease the state's dependence on fossil-fueled peaker plants. the new york state energy research and development authority earlier vowed to conduct a study on how to move every sector in the state to 100 percent renewable energy, although politico reported last week that the report had not been made public by the end of 2018 as promised.\n\npete sikora, a senior adviser to the grassroots group new york communities for change, said it's critical for the city to conduct its own study to put more pressure on state agencies.\n\nit's all about politics, sikora said after tuesday's press conference. and it's important that it's in the city's hands.\n\nthe power plant bill will be the second major piece of energy legislation from constantinides in a little over five weeks. in november, he introduced legislation to cut emissions from buildings of more than 25,000 square feet by 80 percent by 2050. that would set what could be a new standard for cities around the world and form the backbone of what proponents have dubbed the green new deal for new york city.\n\nthe legislative push builds on high-profile efforts from other top city hall officials. in december, new york city comptroller scott stringer announced a significant next step in divesting the city's $200 billion pension funds from the oil and gas sector as he issued a request for a proposal to analyze the city's fossil fuel risks.\n\nlast january, mayor bill de blasio decided to sue five major oil companies over infrastructure damage linked to sea level rise. a federal judge dismissed the suit in july, but california and seven other states signed on to new york city's appeal in november.\n\npomerantz, of the energy and policy institute, suggested that the deadline in the power plant bill is key.\n\nthe question of speed makes all the difference in the world for climate change, he said. if new york city is serious about its climate goals, that's exactly what it needs to do, is look at the question and say, 'how quickly can we get out of gas and into renewables?'\n\nthis story was updated with details from the press conference and comment from pete sikora.
in the midst of a partial government shutdown that has left thousands of federal employees without pay, top trump administration officials ― including vice president mike pence ― may be cashing in on substantial salary raises.\n\nthe raises, first reported by the washington post, could go into effect as early as saturday and amount to as much as $10,000 per eligible official.\n\nsalaries for hundreds of top government executives have been frozen since 2013, when congress enacted a pay freeze amid debate surrounding the fiscal cliff bill.\n\nthe pay freeze lapsed last month after lawmakers failed to reach a consensus on spending bills for multiple federal agencies. unless legislators take action by saturday, the post reported, the freeze is likely to expire and government executives like pence could begin receiving raises that would have accumulated due to annual cost-of-living adjustments.\n\nthe raises may be an intended outcome of the shutdown, as republicans in november were attempting to tie a pay increase for civilian federal employees to a lift on the pay freeze for top government executives.\n\npresident donald trump told lawmakers in august he wanted to scrap the annual pay raise for civilian federal employees, arguing the nation's budget couldn't finance it.\n\nfederal workers were poised to receive a 2.1 percent pay increase in january, along with an annual locality pay increase.\n\nwe must maintain efforts to put our nation on a fiscally sustainable course, and federal agency budgets cannot sustain such increases, trump wrote in a letter to house and senate leaders.\n\nbloomberg via getty images some federal employees, such as transportation security administration workers, have had to work without pay during the government shutdown.\n\ntrump in late december went forward on the pay freeze for federal workers, while the government shutdown was in effect.\n\nwith the pay cap lifted, cabinet secretaries could be eligible for an annual salary bump from $199,700 to $210,700, the post reported. salaries for deputy secretaries could jump from $179,700 to $189,600. pence's salary could rise from $230,700 to $243,500.\n\nthe raises could cost $300 million in taxpayer money over the course of 10 years, the senior executives association told the post.\n\nroughly 400,000 federal workers have been furloughed since parts of the government shut down last month. another 400,000 have been forced to work without pay. democrats quickly passed legislation to reopen the closed government agencies after taking back control of the house on thursday. but senate majority leader mitch mcconnell (r-ky.) vowed to block the bill, and trump said he would veto it.\n\nrep. nita lowey (d-n.y.), who chairs the house committee responsible for drafting annual spending bills, said it was outrageous that top trump administration officials could take home raises while other federal employees go without pay.\n\nat a time when 800,000 federal employees aren't getting paid, it is absolutely outrageous that the trump administration would even consider taking advantage of the shutdown to dole out huge raises to the vice president and its political appointees, lowey said in a comment to huffpost.\n\nrep. betty mccollum (d-minn.), whose attempt to maintain the pay freeze for top government executives was voted down by house republicans in june, condemned the potential raises.\n\ndonald trump has a long history of shortchanging workers, mccollum said in a comment to huffpost. while the government is shut down and federal employees are going without pay, he's doling out pay raises to his senior political appointees. i find this outrageous. the president must rescind this action, or congress must work to prohibit it.\n\nthe white house did not immediately offer comment on the potential raises. the government's office of personnel management and office of management and budget also did not respond to requests for comment.\n\ntrump said during remarks in the white house rose garden on friday he was considering not granting the raises to cabinet members.\n\nwhite house press secretary sarah huckabee sanders said friday that the administration was aware of the issue and was exploring options to prevent this from being implemented while some federal workers are furloughed.\n\njacqueline simon, the policy director for the american federation of government employees, said no federal workers of any rank should be subjected to pay caps.\n\nwe think it is a good thing salaries for top executives and political appointees will no longer be frozen, but we would expect the administration to abide by the 'officers eat last' principle and make sure that rank and file federal employees receive a pay adjustment first, simon said in a emailed comment to huffpost.\n\nshe added: if pay freezes are wrong for those at the top, then surely they are wrong for those on the front lines, and we urge the president to make sure that everybody gets an adjustment so they can keep up with the cost of living.\n\nthis has been updated to include comment from mccollum and sanders.\n\ncorrection: a previous version of this story indicated that rep. nita lowey (d-n.y.) is the ranking democrat on the house committee responsible for drafting annual spending bills. in fact, she chairs the committee.\n\nhuffpost readers: are you

home purchasers who were obliged to take out private mortgage insurance (pmi) because their down payment was less than 20% of the price have the right to cancel it, ridding themselves of the monthly premium. borrowers should take advantage of the opportunity if they can but they must meet the cancellation rules.\n\ncancellation rules\n\nunder federal law, lenders are required to cancel private mortgage insurance on most home mortgage loans made after july 29, 1999. cancellation will occur automatically when amortization has reduced the loan balance to 78% of the value of the property at the time the loan was made. the borrower cannot accelerate this process with extra payments.\n\nunder another provision of this law, lenders must terminate insurance at the borrower's request when the loan balance hits 80% of the original value. borrowers can accelerate the process of getting to 80% by making extra payments.\n\nwarning: a lender need not accept a request for cancellation if the borrower has taken out a second mortgage or had an excessive number of delinquencies in the prior two years, or if the property has declined in value.\n\nif fannie mae or freddie mac own the mortgage, the cancellation rules apply to the current appraised value of the property rather than the value at the time the loan was made. borrowers can request cancellation after two years if the loan balance is no more than 75% of current appraised value, and after 5 years if it is no more than 80%. the ratios are lower if there is a second mortgage, if the property is held for investment rather than occupancy, if the property is other than single-family, or if the borrower has had recent delinquencies.\n\npaying off pmi as an investment\n\nhomeowners should view paying off pmi as a potential investment that can yield a high return. until now, figuring out how large that return was exceeded the capacities of almost all borrowers, but no longer. my colleague allan redstone has developed a pmi payoff spreadsheet, which shows the investment required to eliminate pmi, and the rate of return on that investment, for each of three rules: 80% of original value, 75% of current value after 2 years, and 80% of current value after 5 years. the spreadsheet is on my web site and is available for anyone to download.\n\na unique feature of pmi payoff as an investment is that the amount of the investment is a specific dollar amount. hence, the borrower's decision must consider not only the rate of return but also whether or not they have the exact amount required.\n\nhere is an example. three years ago, the borrower purchased a house for $200,000 with a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage of $190,000 at 4%, and a monthly mortgage insurance premium of $65. she expects to be in the house another 4 years. the house is now worth $225,000, requiring an investment of $11,098 to bring the loan balance down to $168,750, which is 75% of $225,000. the return on investment in dollars is the $65 a month insurance premium for 68 months, plus the $14,280 difference in the loan balance in month 84 when the owner expects to sell the house. the rate of return is 8.96%\n\nnote that the $65 monthly saving in mortgage insurance extends for only 68 months because in month 69, the ratio of loan balance to original property value falls below 78%, which under the law requires the lender to cancel the policy.\n\nborrowers paying higher premiums earn a higher return\n\nthe example described above applied to a relatively low-risk transaction that carried a very modest mortgage insurance premium. the transaction assumed a single-family home, a purchase for occupancy, and a credit score of 800.\n\nborrowers with poor credit pay more when they borrow, but there is a reverse side to that coin. when they invest in reducing their obligations, the rate of return is correspondingly high. if the purchaser in my example intended to rent the house rather than occupy it, and if her credit score was 620 rather than 800, her insurance premium would be almost 6 times larger. in that event, the rate of return on the investment required to eliminate the insurance would be 39.26%.\n\nhow the passage of time affects the investment\n\nintuitively, it would appear that the sooner you pay down the balance and rid yourself of the pmi premium, the better off you will be, but this may or may not be the case. it depends on the circumstances and preferences of the borrower.\n\nconsider the example given earlier where after three years the borrower earns 8.55% on an investment of $11,098. if the same borrower decided to make the investment after 4 years instead of 3, her dollar savings would be smaller because both the number of pmi premium payments and the balance reduction in the payoff month would be smaller. on the other hand, the required investment would be $7326 instead of $11,098, which might make it affordable, and the rate of return on investment would be 10.52% as compared to 8.55%.\n\nin general, the longer the borrower waits to pay down the balance to the point where the pmi is eliminated, the smaller is the savings in dollars and in the investment required, but the higher is the rate of return on investment. the power of the spreadsheet is that it allows each individual borrower to adopt the payoff strategy that best fits her needs and capacities.\n\ncomparison with other investments\n\nin comparison to other investments, an investment in pmi payoff ranks very high on default risk, because there is none, and on expected return. the drawback has been the complexity of the process, which has made it difficult to determine exactly what the rate of return is. eliminating this uncertainty is the reason we developed the spreadsheet.\n\nfor more unbiased

a new pathogen that is believed to have originated in a seafood and live animal market in wuhan, china, late in december has spread to at least 15 countries including canada, the u.s., france and singapore.\n\nthe wuhan virus is a new form of coronavirus — a term for a group of viruses that have crown-like spikes on them and cause illnesses as benign as the common cold and as severe as sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and mers (middle east respiratory syndrome).\n\nwhat is it?\n\nthis strain of coronavirus has infected more than 6,000 people globally and killed at least 132. in some people, it causes symptoms similar to the common cold — such as coughing and fever — but in more severe cases it gives patients pneumonia-like symptoms.\n\ncoronaviruses often spread between

mutated, giving it the ability to transmit more easily between people and having infected some health-care workers. however, all transmissions are still first and secondary. that means so far, people who got sick either went to the market or were in contact with someone who was at the market, which has been closed for disinfection since jan. 1. no one has gotten it from third or fourth degree transmission, hoffman said.\n\nviruses and other pathogens evolving is one of the challenges when it comes to managing and curing them, but it happens often.\n\nthe important thing to note is this

the agency said the country is well positioned to deal with the disease.\n\nwe have been preparing with the provinces and territories since we heard about the first cases in china. we began implementing new measures to mitigate the risk of introduction of the virus into canada and to control and prevent its spread, said maryse durette, the agency's senior media relations advisor.\n\nassociated press in this wednesday file photo, a staff member moves bio-waste containers past the entrance of the wuhan medical treatment center in china.\n\ncanada's robust public health

those who find themselves sick.\n\nhoffman said there's no need to panic. however, health agencies must be ready, which is why investing in public health even between outbreaks is so vital.\n\nthis is the new normal in the sense that we live in a globalized world where people are travelling and carrying pathogens and bacteria with them, which do not carry passports. so we just need to be prepared.\n\nfederal health agencies have already planned with their territorial and provincial counterparts on what actions to take if more cases start to appear in canada.\n\nif a case is identified, the ministry will convene several co-ordination and communication processes, including the clinical team treating the case to ensure they have the scientific and technical expertise and support that they need. we will also share communications with our broader health-system partners for their situational awareness, david jensen, a spokesman for ontario's ministry of health, said

services to ensure that the health system is ready to respond effectively if needed, he added.\n\nhow can canadians protect themselves?\n\nlike other coronavirus strains, the wuhan virus can be spread through coughing, sneezing or general contact with someone carrying the pathogen. experts recommend taking all the regular precautions that people should be taking during flu season anyway — washing hands often, coughing into your elbow instead of your hand, not going to work if you're feeling unwell, avoiding contact with sick people, and seeing a doctor as soon as possible if you're showing symptoms.\n\nmasks might make you feel better, but they aren't particularly helpful, as most are more likely to protect the person wearing them from spreading the infection rather than catching it.\n\nassociated press passengers wear masks amidst an outbreak of a new coronavirus in a subway station in hong kong on wednesday.\n\nwhat now?\n\na vaccine could take years of research and testing to develop. mers, for example, which emerged in 2012 and has already killed 851 people, still doesn't have an approved inoculation. sars, which was identified in 2002 and killed 774, mostly ran its course on its own by the end of 2003. most people with various forms of coronavirus recover on their own, but older people and those with chronic disease are more likely to be hit with severe forms of the illness.\n\nbut canada and other countries are more prepared to deal with this virus than they were in 2002 when sars was active. communication between nations is open, and the specific strain of coronavirus already has a diagnostic test available.\n\nwhat's most important is that we're monitoring, keeping up to date on what's happening, trying to learn as much as possible and sharing that information with everyone who needs that. what we're seeing is a lot of communication between the federal governments and provincial and territorial governments, as well as between canada and other countries and the world health organization, hoffman noted.\n\nthe first step of being prepared for a potential future pandemic is to have that information and have the mechanisms to share it.\n\na canadian travel advisory recommends travellers to china avoid high-risk areas that have animals such as farms, markets and butchers, avoid contact with living and dead animals, and avoid surfaces with animal waste on them. the advisory also reminded travellers to wash their hands frequently and monitor their own health carefully during and after their trips. travel in and out of china was expected to increase around the lunar new year holiday on saturday.\n\nchina has put at least 12 cities under lockdown, attempting to restrict the movements of around 35 million people. hoffman said a quarantine on that scale is unprecedented and is unlikely to work, either in china or hypothetically in canada.\n\neven if we did try to stop travel, it still happens anyway. the good news about travel that's done through official channels like flights is that you can track it and if someone does get a case, you can use some contact tracing knowing who that person traveled with and who they were around, he said. generally travel bans don't work and people find ways around them.\n\nassociated press a health official scans the body temperature of a passenger as she arrives at the

to be helpful during sars, for example, there were cases where people were in canadian airports. we did screen millions of people for temperatures and didn't find a single case of sars. that way so very expensive, disruptive and doesn't always work.\n\nsince the virus has already been genetically sequenced, diagnosing new cases is a fairly quick process. the world health organization is

president donald trump owns three golf resorts in the european countries he has spared from his travel ban.\n\nforeign nationals from all 26 countries of the schengen area, which make up most of europe, will be barred from entering the u.s. for at least 30 days as protection against the spread of coronavirus, trump announced wednesday. the united kingdom and ireland are not part of that group, but they do have cases of coronavirus — and trump golf resorts.\n\nthe president's trump organization owns a golf course in doonbeg, ireland, and two in scotland: trump turnberry and trump international golf links.\n\ntrump said thursday that he exempted the u.k. from the travel ban because he believes conservative prime minister boris johnson is doing a good job battling coronavirus. but several health experts disagree with trump's assessment.\n\ntrump's decision is clearly not based on science, jeremy konyndyk, a center for global development fellow who helped the u.s. deal with the ebola crisis, told foreign policy magazine.\n\njohnson has been attacked for being slow to take action to stop the spread of the illness, such as shutting down large gatherings to head off widespread contagion.\n\njohnson declared on britain's this morning tv program on tuesday that one coronavirus theory is that people should take it on the chin and allow the disease to move through the population. but, he added, i think we need to strike a balance.\n\nrichard horton, the editor in chief of the medical journal the lancet, accused johnson of playing roulette with the public by taking his time instituting changes.\n\nthe uk government—matt hancock and boris johnson—claim they are following the science. but that is not true. the evidence is clear. we need urgent implementation of social distancing and closure policies. the government is playing roulette with the public. this is a major error. — richard horton (@richardhorton1) march 10, 2020\n\nin a marked change of tone, however, similar to that exhibited by trump, johnson said thursday that the virus threatens the worst health crisis in a generation and that many more people will die. but he wasn't quite prepared to stop major sporting events.\n\nthough italy and france have far more cases of coronavirus, 590 cases were reported thursday in britain — a 30% jump from the previous day. the chief health officer of the u.k. believes as many as 10,000 people could already be infected.\n\nten people have died of the illness there. ireland reported its first death wednesday and is canceling st. patrick's day celebrations this year.\n\ntrump's former homeland security adviser tom bossert said that a ban on european travelers makes little sense now that the illness is already being passed within u.s. communities.\n\nthere's little value to european travel restrictions. poor use of time & energy. earlier, yes. now, travel restrictions/screening are less useful. we have nearly as much disease here in the us as the countries in europe. we must focus on layered community mitigation measures-now! — thomas p. bossert (@tombossert) march 12, 2020\n\nthe irony is that if we don't implement aggressive community interventions and mitigate the spread of the virus already in the united states, we will end up infecting or reinfecting europe. #coronavirus — thomas p. bossert (@tombossert) march 12, 2020\n\ntrump blamed the european union for exporting cases to the u.s., a strategy some critics said was intended to deflect criticism from his administration.\n\nas president, trump has frequently showcased his golf resorts in scotland and ireland, which have struggled financially. he took an entourage to doonbeg after a state visit with queen elizabeth ii last year. vice president mike pence went three hours out of his way to stay at trump's resort in doonbeg last year, even though he had traveled to ireland to meet with the nation's prime minister in dublin. the u.s. air force spent nearly $200,000 at trump's turnberry resort for lodging during refueling stops at a small airport near the resort.
sen. bernie sanders (i-vt.) once told a fellow left-wing activist that the democratic party was too intellectually bankrupt to allow the progressive movement to flourish within it.\n\nin a 1985 letter newly obtained by huffpost in which sanders debated running for governor, he wrote: whether i run for governor or not is really not important. what would be a tragedy, however, is for people with a radical vision to fall into the pathetic camp of the intellectually bankrupt democratic party.\n\ntimes have changed.\n\nsanders, who has served as an independent in congress — first in the house and now in the senate — since 1991, is now among the leading democratic candidates for president, second behind former vice president joe biden in national polls, and tied for first in iowa. he's raised more money than any other candidate in the democratic primary, with more individual contributions. his platform — which includes medicare for all, tuition-free college, and wealth redistribution through aggressive taxes on the richest americans — defines the party's progressive wing.\n\nhe has taken the democratic party's loyalty pledge and repeatedly promised to support whoever becomes the party nominee to defeat president donald trump. but that hasn't been enough for many of his critics in the party's establishment, who are likely to point to the letter as evidence he doesn't play nice with the party.\n\nat the start of his career in politics, sanders viewed the democratic party as hopeless. by 1985, he had already made several failed bids for elected office in vermont as a member of the progressive liberty union party. he finally succeeded in 1981, becoming mayor of burlington, the state's largest city, and toppling a five-term democratic mayor.\n\nat the beginning, the democrats were very angry with him, jane sanders, sanders' wife, said in an interview with huffpost. burlington's board of aldermen — a part-time, 13-seat city council — resisted sanders' efforts. they wouldn't let him appoint any of the mayoral appointments. they stopped him from hiring the city attorney, city clerk, city treasure ... [the democrats] were outright enemies in the beginning.\n\nsanders never won full control of city government, but he organized enough voters to elect some allies onto the board and win veto power. he soon became popular enough to win reelection by a 20-point margin.\n\nthe sept. 5, 1985 letter ― which has not previously been reported on ― came as sanders was considering a run for governor, and left-wing activists in the state and around the country were debating whether he should mount an independent bid or launch a primary challenge to the state's democratic governor, madeleine kunin.\n\nobtained by huffpost a sept. 5, 1985, letter from then-burlington, vermont, mayor bernie sanders to marty jezer, a progressive activist.\n\nsanders' three-paragraph missive was addressed to marty jezer, an author and progressive activist in the state. then-mayor sanders was writing in response to an august letter from jezer in which he apologized that a memo he wrote to sanders had leaked to the press. while the exact contents of the memo are unclear, jezer's letter indicates that it encouraged sanders to run for congress instead of challenging kunin.\n\n1986 is the wrong time for such a race, jezer, who died in 2005, wrote. i hope you will listen to the voices of the committed activists around the state. we sink or swim with this together.\n\nsanders ultimately reached a different conclusion: he ran against kunin as an independent. but the decision was not without dissent. an editorial from the socialist magazine in these times criticized sanders for dividing the left.\n\nin choosing to create a three-way race, sanders is dividing the left and making more likely the defeat of an incumbent liberal woman governor by a more conservative republican, in these times wrote. (at the time, kunin was one of only two female governors in the country.)\n\nthe editorial prompted sanders to reply: i believe that the real changes that are needed in this country … are not going to be brought about by working within the democratic party or the republican party.\n\nkunin eventually won reelection with 47% of the vote. republican peter smith finished second, earning 38% of the vote, while sanders finished third with just 14%.\n\nthe vermont senator's critiques of the democratic party are well documented, as cnn reported last july. throughout the 1980s and 1990s, he was adamant that a progressive movement could not be built within the party and was highly critical of the moderate new democrats who argued that the party's progressivism in the 1960s, 1970s and early 1980s had alienated voters.\n\ni think that nationally, the party has on issue after issue sold out so many times that if you go before the people and say, 'hey, i'm a democrat,' you don't usually generate a lot of enthusiasm, sanders said in 1991 about the idea of a progressive trying to work within the party.\n\ncommenting on civil rights activist jesse jackson's democratic presidential runs in the 1980s, sanders said he did not agree with jackson's decision to work within the democratic party. (sanders endorsed jackson's candidacy.) his skepticism of the party continued in subsequent decades. in 2011, he said democrats could be called republican-lite for considering cuts to social security and medicare in order to lessen the deficit. and his first presidential campaign in 2016 didn't shy away from blasting the party apparatus.\n\nsanders' willingness to criticize the democratic party speaks to the progressive bona fides highlighted by his supporters. his campaign often relies on decades-old videos of sanders warning against the iraq war, multinational trade deals and the climate crisis using the same rhetoric he still uses today.\n\nbut the senator's view of the party — and the role of progressive politics within it — has evolved. he's since refined his critiques to focus on the corporate wing of the democratic party, which is composed of the same centrists, including organizations like third way, that pushed the party to the right during the 1980s and '90s.\n\njane sanders, who did not recall the exact circumstances of her husband's letter to jezer, said this shift came about when he was elected to the house as an independent. he knew that if democrats didn't let him into their caucus, he wouldn't be assigned to any committees and would be left out of the process altogether.\n\nhe believed that the two-party system was bankrupt, but as he was put in a position by the people of vermont to effect real change, he had to consider, how do you effect real change? jane sanders said. his concern isn't party politics.\n\nby 2015, when he launched his bid for the democratic presidential nomination, sanders had fully changed his mind about the ability for progressive politics to flourish within the party.\n\nthe decision that i made, as the longest-serving independent in the history of the united states congress, i said, 'if we are going to win this race, we have to do it within the democratic primary process,' sanders said in a 2016 interview with nbc's chuck todd. he decided to not run as an independent because he didn't want to be a spoiler in the presidential race.\n\nbernie fights when he has to fight, jane sanders said. bernie's interest is getting things he wants done, done. he found that he had to fight effectively against the democratic party at the beginning as mayor. but over time, by organizing, he learned he can change the democratic party.\n\nsanders' relationship with the party has notably softened since that first presidential run. he served on the senate democrats' leadership team and his 2016 campaign managed to push the democratic national committee to change rules around superdelegates, lessening the power of party insiders in the nominating process.\n\nthat hasn't been enough for many of his critics, who accuse him of only half-heartedly campaigning for former secretary of state hillary clinton in 2016 after dragging out the primary, and question whether he would be willing to support down-ballot democratic candidates who don't share his progressive ideology.\n\njane sanders said she hadn't spoken with her husband about how he would engage in party politics should he be elected president. but she was explicit about how he approaches it currently.\n\nif you organize, the people will elect new people, jane sanders said, citing those like rep. alexandria ocasio-cortez (d-n.y.), who famously ousted a top-ranking house democrat in the 2018 midterm elections. you will see bernie supporting and raising money for the best of the democrats. you will not see him doing that for others.\n\nbut former vermont gov. peter shumlin, a democrat who has endorsed former vice president joe biden in the 2020 nominating contest, said he was skeptical that sanders could keep the party together during an election against trump.\n\nthe notion that [sanders] would lead the national democratic party would be repugnant to both democrats and to bernie sanders, because he's not a democrat, shumlin told huffpost in a phone interview. he'd be the first one to tell you that.\n\nthat the party's policy debates have only now caught up to him was sanders' opening pitch to voters when he announced in early 2019 that he would run for president again.\n\nover the last two years — and before — you and i and millions of americans have stood up and fought for justice in every part of our society, and we've had some successes, sanders said when launching his 2020 bid.\n\nas one of the top contenders going into the iowa caucuses in early february, sanders now clearly believes that he can bring about a progressive revolution within the democratic party — one that he's worked to change.
video credit: skye fitzgerald, director, spin film\n\nahmed elhubbish, a middle-aged yemeni living in yemen's capital city of sanaa, wants to know what his children — abdul rahman, khalid, wasim and siham — did wrong.\n\nlast year, they were killed in an airstrike launched from thousands of miles above them by sophisticated machinery from continents away. what could make them targets for the coalition led by saudi arabia and supported by the u.s. that has been bombing yemen since 2015?\n\nthere's not a single reason for persistent attacks on yemenis such as the may 2019 strike that hit his children, elhubbish said through a translator in an outtake from hunger ward, a new documentary on the war and mass starvation in yemen, which was directed by oscar and emmy nominee skye fitzgerald. (watch above. note: the video contains graphic images.)\n\nthe footage, which was shot for the documentary and shared exclusively with huffpost, showed the immediate aftermath of an airstrike and included reflections by elhubbish and others that highlight the toll of the bombing campaign.\n\nlawmakers, u.s. officials, humanitarian groups, anti-war activists, arms dealers, foreign representatives and others have debated the american role in yemen for years in washington ― though rarely with such vivid evidence of the policy's consequences as is documented in fitzgerald's film.\n\nit's vital now to have a clear picture of what president-elect joe biden's choices could mean for yemen as he assumes the presidency later this month and will have the power to change u.s. policy.\n\nthe country's current crisis began in the fall of 2014, when iran-backed rebels known as houthis ejected yemen's internationally recognized government from sanaa. six months later, saudi arabia and its allies, notably the united arab emirates, launched a military intervention against the houthis ― with crucial backing from the u.s. and other western nations that continues despite persistent reports that the coalition is violating human rights standards and international law.\n\nmost national security experts believe that without american support for the bombing, the saudi-led coalition would need to seriously curtail its operations. that move would also make the kingdom more keen to cut a peace deal with the houthis and address deadly tussles for influence among its own yemeni partners.\n\nthe war has now killed nearly a quarter of a million people, the united nations reported in december. airstrikes by the saudi-led coalition have killed at least 18,000 civilians, according to the yemen data project, an independent monitoring group. the strikes have hit hospitals, markets, schools and other nonmilitary targets, prompting state department lawyers to worry that american involvement could implicate u.s. officials in war crimes.\n\nafter nearly five years of fighting, the houthis continue to control the most populated parts of yemen ― and the saudis continue to bomb those regions with u.s. support, most recently on new year's eve.\n\nunder president barack obama, washington provided the saudi-led coalition with aerial refueling that enabled it to run longer bombing campaigns, as well as intelligence and regular supplies of fresh bombs, while defending the campaign from international criticism and supporting a saudi blockade of yemeni ports that drove up food prices and pushed millions of yemenis into famine-like conditions.\n\npresident donald trump continued that policy and took further steps against the houthis that had devastating consequences for yemenis, such as slashing u.s. aid for houthi-controlled regions amid the coronavirus pandemic. when lawmakers and rights groups called for a tougher u.s. approach to the saudis over their role in the murder of journalist jamal khashoggi, trump cut off the aerial refueling assistance but left in place other forms of american aid to the saudi-led coalition.\n\ntrump also vetoed bipartisan legislation to cut off that support and to stop sending more bombs to the countries involved in the war.\n\nbiden has promised he will end the obama-era policy and treat saudi arabia as a pariah. but he will face a test of how seriously he takes that promise early in his presidency: biden will have to decide whether to block a giant arms package that trump crafted for the u.a.e. last fall, which the vast majority of congressional democrats opposes.\n\nthe humanitarian situation in yemen is predicted to deteriorate even further in the coming months with hunger on the rise, scott paul of oxfam america told huffpost in december after a slim senate majority approved the u.a.e. weapons package, which includes munitions that could be used in yemen. congress and the biden administration should do all they can to halt these arms sales and be a force for peace to save lives in yemen.
by erin el issa\n\nthere are many personal finance tenets to follow when you decide to take control of your finances. perhaps one of the most important is this: don't pay fees unless absolutely necessary.\n\nthe average cost of checking account fees over a decade totals almost $1,000, according to a recent study. but many of these fees -- including common ones such as maintenance, atm and overdraft fees -- can be avoided by choosing the right bank and cultivating good banking habits.\n\nhere's what you should know about common bank fees and tips for avoiding them, including options for low-fee checking accounts that also earn interest.\n\n1. maintenance fees\n\nmany traditional banks charge a maintenance, or service, fee on checking accounts -- about $10 to $12 per month.\n\nsome banks will waive the charge if you keep a daily minimum balance or have a certain amount of money deposited directly into your account each month. others require a certain number of debit card transactions each month for the waiver.\n\ncheck your bank's policy for exact terms so that you can set up direct deposit and keep the minimum required balance to avoid maintenance fees. if you can't meet the requirements, look for a bank without these fees.\n\n2. atm fees\n\nyou've probably had the experience of needing cash and looking unsuccessfully for an atm affiliated with your bank. you ended up with no choice but to go, cringing, to another atm, resigned to paying a fee to your bank and possibly another to the atm's operator. such fees average $2.01 and $2.75, respectively, according to the study.\n\natm fees can be avoided by using your own bank atm. that may require choosing a bank whose atms are easily accessible from your home or workplace, or looking for local bank branches and atms when you are out and about. you could also get cash back when making debit card purchases at many retail locations, eliminating the need for a trip to the atm.\n\n3. overdraft fees\n\nyour bank may charge you an overdraft fee if your withdrawals and transactions total more than the balance in your checking account. most large u.s. banks charge at least $35 per overdraft, according to a recent pew study. if you don't correct the negative balance in a certain amount of time, you could get hit with an extended overdraft fee -- that median is $20, the study said.\n\nconsumers average about two overdrafts per year. but these fees are avoidable. the obvious solution is to avoid spending more money than you have in your account. you can also choose to have your transactions declined by the bank if your funds are insufficient.\n\nif you opted into your bank's overdraft program, which will carry a fee when you exceed your account balance, talk to customer service about opting out. then keep a close eye on your bank balance, and use a credit card or cash to avoid overdraft fees.\n\nuse an online-only bank or credit union\n\nyou can optimize your finances more by using an online-only bank or credit union. online financial institutions have fewer overhead costs than traditional banks, so they are typically able to offer free checking accounts with higher interest rates and no maintenance fees. they typically don't have their own atms but tend to be part of a network of fee-free atms that are widely accessible, especially in larger cities.\n\nif you regularly have to deposit cash or like to visit a branch, try brick-and-mortar credit unions, which usually have lower fees and higher interest rates than big banks. credit union membership may be restricted to residents of certain geographical areas or workers at qualified employers, but you may be able to join by making a donation of $5 to $10. that's generally less than one month's service fee at a big bank, so it's worth the investment.\n\nthis article was written by nerdwallet and was originally published by u.s. news & world report.

oakland, calif. (ap) — a u.s. judge in california on sunday blocked trump administration rules, which would allow more employers to opt out of providing women with no-cost birth control, from taking effect in 13 states and washington, d.c.\n\njudge haywood gilliam granted a request for a preliminary injunction by california, 12 other states and washington, d.c. the plaintiffs sought to prevent the rules from taking effect as scheduled on monday while a lawsuit against them moved forward.\n\nbut gilliam limited the scope of the ruling to the plaintiffs, rejecting their request that he block the rules nationwide.\n\nthe changes would allow more employers, including publicly traded companies, to opt out of providing no-cost contraceptive coverage to women by claiming religious objections. some private employers could also object on moral grounds.\n\ncalifornia and the other states argue that women would be forced to turn to state-funded programs for birth control and experience unintended pregnancies.\n\nthe law couldn't be more clear — employers have no business interfering in women's healthcare decisions, california attorney general xavier becerra said in a statement sunday. today's court ruling stops another attempt by the trump administration to trample on women's access to basic reproductive care. it's 2019, yet the trump administration is still trying to roll back women's rights. our coalition will continue to fight to ensure women have access to the reproductive healthcare they are guaranteed under the law.\n\nthe u.s. department of justice said in court documents the rules protect a narrow class of sincere religious and moral objectors from being forced to facilitate practices that conflict with their beliefs.\n\nat issue is a requirement under president barack obama's health care law that birth control services be covered at no additional cost. obama officials included exemptions for religious organizations. the trump administration expanded those exemptions and added moral convictions as a basis to opt out of providing birth control services.\n\nat a hearing on friday, gilliam said the changes would result in a substantial number of women losing birth control coverage, which would be a massive policy shift.\n\nthe judge previously blocked an interim version of the rules — a decision that was upheld in december by an appeals court.\n\nthe ruling affects california, connecticut, delaware, hawaii, illinois, maryland, minnesota, new york, north carolina, rhode island, vermont, virginia, washington, and the district of columbia.
lansing, mich. (ap) — a state panel on monday banned the open carry of guns in michigan's capitol, a week after an armed mob rioted in the u.s. capitol and following an attempt last year to storm the statehouse.\n\nmoves to ban weapons at the statehouse have been pushed since april, when protesters opposed to gov. gretchen whitmer's covid-19 restrictions, some armed with long rifles and other weapons, entered the michigan state capitol demanding to be allowed into the legislative chambers. some entered the senate chambers.\n\nthe michigan capitol commission, which is responsible for overseeing the capitol, had been reluctant to issue rules for firearms, but it shifted course monday and issued the order to ban open carrying of weapons.\n\ndemocratic legislators have pushed since april for a ban on open and concealed carry to avoid violence and continue to call for the policy to ban all firearms.\n\na spokesman for senate majority leader mike shirkey, who previously said the commission shouldn't be responsible for creating weapons policies, said last week that he would support an open carry ban after violence erupted at the u.s. capitol by a mob of president donald trump's supporters.\n\nthe plan to take over the statehouse included an alleged a domestic terror plot to kidnap and kill gov. gretchen whitmer, including taking hostages at the capitol while they held a trial for the governor, the fbi and state law enforcement officials said.\n\nsen. dayna polehanki has pushed an effort to ban all firearms from the capitol by introducing legislation last year that died in session. the livonia democrat said monday before the panel vote that an open carry ban does not go far enough and will lead to a false sense of security for those who work at and visit the capitol.\n\nbullets are bullets, she said no matter what kind of gun a person brings.\n\nthere is no reason any gun belongs in the capitol, it's absurd, the world thinks it's absurd, polehanki said. it sickens me that this is even being considered as a viable action.\n\n___\n\nanna liz nichols is a corps member for the associated press/report for america statehouse news initiative. report for america is a nonprofit national service program that places journalists in local newsrooms to report on undercovered issues.
the green new dealers are taking their movement on the road.\n\nit's been a whirlwind two months since the youth activists of the sunrise movement staged protests in democratic leaders' offices, bringing into the mainstream calls for a green new deal ― a sweeping federal policy that would mandate 100 percent renewable energy and provide good-paying sustainable jobs to millions of americans.\n\nnow the sunrise movement, likely the nation's fastest-growing climate advocacy group, is planning a 14-stop tour meant to drum up grassroots support for a green new deal across multiple states, huffpost has learned. it's the first leg of the group's effort to make the policy the defining issue of the 2020 election.\n\nwe're launching the road to a green new deal tour to activate the millions of americans who are ready to fight for a green new deal but haven't heard of it yet, varshini prakash, co-founder of sunrise movement, said by email. when you come out to a tour stop, we'll give you all the tools you need to spread the word within your own community, build support, and pressure your elected officials to take a stand.\n\nin march and april, the sunrise movement will host events in florida, california, pennsylvania, new york, kentucky, michigan and elsewhere. the tour builds off an intensive new online training program, where volunteers are coached via webinars on how to confront politicians and frame an issue as overwhelming as global warming in terms of clear, effective action. each event will include in-person training sessions, and conclude with organizing meetings for new converts.\n\nthe goal of the tour is to invite tens of thousands of young people into the movement, stephen o'hanlon, a spokesman for sunrise movement, said by phone. we want to go where they are, and one thing we've learned … is young people across the country, in red states, blue states and purple states, are excited about what a green new deal could mean for their communities.\n\nreuters in a photo from three years ago, varshini prakash, then with the divestment student network leads chants of i believe that we will win during a student climate protest in washington.\n\nthe sunrise movement has added more than 100 new local chapters since november. that includes one in wyoming, the nation's top coal-producing state, two in nebraska, a hotbed of pipeline battles, and another two in deep-red utah. the group has raised more than $500,000 in just two months, with 650 new recurring monthly donors.\n\nfounded officially in april 2017, the sunrise movement traces its roots back to the start of the decade, when the occupy wall street protests put a national spotlight on the widening income gap. by the mid-2010s, the student activists who would go on to found the sunrise movement were leading efforts to pressure their universities to divest from fossil fuels. drawing on lessons from the 2016 presidential bid of sen. bernie sanders (i-vt.), the group finally took form a few months after president donald trump began a full-on assault on environmental regulations in a push to bolster the oil and gas industry.\n\nby the time the midterm elections began, the sunrise movement had started carving out a place for itself, helping to elevate candidates who took climate change more seriously than just declaring a belief in the basic science. the group helped run a ground campaign for left-wing candidates like rep. alexandria ocasio-cortez (d-n.y.) and michigan gubernatorial hopeful abdul el-sayed. the sunrise movement also bird-dogged powerful incumbents like new york gov. andrew cuomo, who was forced to make an embarrassing public reversal after a teenage activist got him to promise to stop taking fossil fuel money on camera.\n\nbut the breakthrough came in november, days after the election.\n\nhistoric wildfires in california, buttressed by back-to-back united nations and federal reports on the extent of human-caused global warming, generated an unusual amount of attention on the climate crisis. then democratic leaders made clear that climate change would be, at best, a midlevel priority after retaking the house of representatives, with nancy pelosi, not yet the next house speaker, making the restoration of a decade-old select committee on global warming the cornerstone of the party's strategy. in response, the sunrise movement staged sit-in protests in pelosi's office demanding democrats instead champion a green new deal.\n\nocasio-cortez joined the protests, adding the political star power needed to grab headlines in a competitive, fast-moving news cycle. the 29-year-old socialist darling from new york also proposed a resolution to establish a select committee on a green new deal in the house, providing a counteroffer to pelosi's panel.\n\nyoung people across the country, in red states, blue states and purple states, are excited about what a green new deal could mean for their communities. stephen o'hanlon , sunrise movement\n\nnearly 40 house democrats and a handful of senators backed the resolution. more than half the democrats expected to run for president in 2020 slowly endorsed a green new deal in some form or another. one poll pegged the number of registered voters who support a green new deal at 81 percent, including 57 percent of conservative republicans.\n\npelosi and her allies kiboshed the effort last month, announcing plans to move ahead with the original select committee. but the push succeeded in making a green new deal a rallying cry.\n\ntouring the country could build a grassroots base for eventual green new deal legislation that the last major federal climate bill ― the 2009 cap-and-trade proposal known as the waxman-markey bill ― never received.\n\nthe politics have drastically changed since then, r.l. miller, the president of the political action committee climate hawks vote, said by email. sunrise is a grassroots-driven group, unlike some of the top-down green groups pushing waxman-markey, and they have both energy and moral clarity on their side.\n\nbut passion and urgent messaging only go so far, and the sunrise movement faces considerable challenges. labor unions, a necessary constituency for a policy that essentially amounts to an industrial plan, are skeptical of proposals to end fossil fuel use, a source of lucrative contract jobs. the sunrise movement's meteoric ascent was fueled by aggressive protests against potential green new deal champions, which risked burning allies, according to e&e news. in a competition with immigration, health care and taxes, climate change remains an underdog issue with relatively few vocal champions on the national level despite its ubiquitous threat.\n\nplus, the trump administration is stacked at every level with officials who reject the very reality that burning fossil fuels is the primary cause of global warming, making it hard to envision green new deal legislation passing until 2021 at the earliest.\n\nother climate groups have taken different approaches.\n\nthe citizens' climate lobby built a network of roughly 400 local groups in part by pushing an avowedly bipartisan message on climate change and appealing to a small cadre of republicans who back a moderate carbon fee-and-dividend policy. despite its ideological malleability, many say such a policy amounts to a half-measure in dealing with greenhouse gases.\n\nthe sierra club's beyond coal campaign empowered local communities across the country to organize around shutting down coal-fired power plants, but it's limited in scope. the organization's broader 100 percent renewable energy effort struggled until the emergence of the green new deal rhetoric to address concerns over the impact on jobs.\n\nthe environmental voter project went the wonk's route, using data to target specific voters it deemed likely to support green causes with aggressive get-out-the-vote materials. but it has a narrow focus, both in geography and mission.\n\nsunrise movement then-rep.-elect alexandria ocasio-cortez (d-n.y.) speaking at the sunrise movement protest in then-minority leader nancy pelosi's office in november.\n\nthe challenge is how to scale it and make it sustainable, anthony leiserowitz, the director of the yale program on climate change communication, said of the upcoming sunrise movement tour. one-off rallies in a few cities, for example, might generate a little press and get some temporary action, but the effects are unlikely to last or build sustained support for the policy or, i would argue, build the deeper political power of the climate movement.\n\na series of local events might make for a flashy start to the year, but the sunrise movement's 2020 election push won't end with the monthlong roadshow. the group plans to confront presidential candidates directly, forcing each of the democratic hopefuls to take a position on the green new deal and on whether to accept donations from the fossil fuel industry. it's also preparing to stage protests at as many democratic debates as possible ahead of the democratic national convention in july 2020.\n\nthe sunrise movement is working with electoral groups such as justice democrats and climate hawks vote to identify progressive primary challengers to moderate incumbents who oppose a green new deal. early polling already shows the group could make a difference. democratic voters in new york's 4th congressional district, a densely populated swath of suburban long island, said they would support a primary challenger to popular rep. kathleen rice (d-n.y.) if she voted against a green new deal, according to survey data released last week.\n\ni feel the sunrise movement and their proposed green new deal is a genuinely exciting new development, ed maibach, a climate communications researcher at george mason university, said by email. if the folks in the sunrise movement get out there and sell their idea to americans before their opponents attempt to shoot it down, 2019 may prove to be an unexpectedly auspicious moment for climate solutions in america.

david bernhardt, the interior department's no. 2 official and a former fossil fuel lobbyist, took over wednesday as acting secretary after the resignation of scandal-plagued agency chief ryan zinke.\n\nwith democrats on thursday taking back control of the house of representatives — and the powerful subpoena authority that comes with it — they have vowed to investigate zinke's conduct and policy decisions.\n\nzinke, a former montana congressman and navy seal, faced nearly 20 federal investigations. several are ongoing, and one has been referred by interior's internal watchdog to the justice department for possible criminal violations. he has maintained he did nothing wrong and blamed his departure on vicious and politically motivated attacks.\n\nby midday wednesday, his twitter profile read former secretary. in a farewell message posted to the social media site, he said it was a high honor to serve @potus & the american people.\n\nwe've restored public lands 'for the benefit & enjoyment of the people,' improved public access & shall never be held hostage again for our energy needs, zinke wrote.\n\nit's been a high honor to serve @potus & the american people as @interior secretary. we've restored public lands for the benefit & enjoyment of the people, improved public access & shall never be held hostage again for our energy needs. god bless america & those who defend her. pic.twitter.com/jxzvmrpdtg — secretary ryan zinke (@secretaryzinke) january 2, 2019\n\ntrump has not nominated a permanent replacement, as he said he would do in a post to twitter last month. but several names have surfaced as contenders for the role, including rep. rob bishop (r-utah) and outgoing sen. dean heller (r-nev.). whoever trump taps must be confirmed by the senate.\n\nbefore being sworn in at the interior department on aug. 1, 2017, bernhardt, a colorado native, worked for eight years at the law firm brownstein hyatt farber schreck, where he lobbied on behalf of oil, gas, mining and agricultural interests. he also previously served as a top interior official under former president george w. bush, leading an attempt to open alaska's pristine arctic national wildlife refuge to oil and gas development. (last month the trump administration took a significant step toward its goal of allowing drilling in the refuge, which zinke said stands out among the most impactful interior accomplishments in terms of bolstering america's economic strength and security.)\n\nthe senate confirmed bernhardt as interior's deputy secretary in july 2017. before his confirmation hearing, 150 conservation groups signed a letter opposing his nomination, citing his ties to the industries he is now charged with regulating and labeling him a walking conflict of interest.\n\nhe has so many potential conflicts that he carries around a list of former clients and is barred from participating in decisions affecting them, the washington post reported in november.\n\nbloomberg via getty images president donald trump and acting interior secretary david bernhardt (left) at a meeting in the cabinet room of the white house on jan. 2, the first day bernhardt was in charge of the department.\n\nas interior's deputy secretary, bernhardt met on several occasions with lobbyists for mgm resorts international, the casino-resort giant that his longtime former employer represents, as huffpost previously reported. the ethics agreement he signed last year bars him from participating in matters involving brownstein hyatt farber schreck.\n\nlast year the interior department blocked a proposed casino partnership between two connecticut tribes. the project would have been competition for an mgm casino in nearby springfield, massachusetts, and the company lobbied against federal approval. interior's decision is under investigation by the agency's inspector general.\n\nbernhardt played a key behind-the-scenes role in many regulatory rollbacks during zinke's tenure, as mother jones highlighted in an october profile. those efforts include a plan to dismantle obama-era protections for the greater sage grouse, a move that would open up millions of acres of the declining game bird's habitat to energy and mineral development. bernhardt is also leading a charge to revise the endangered species act, one of america's bedrock conservation laws. the proposed changes would make it easier to remove recovered species from the protected list and would change how federal agencies go about designating habitat as critical to the long-term survival of species.\n\nafter news of zinke's resignation, the liberal environmental group western values project launched a website detailing bernhardt's work with special interests. in an accompanying statement, the nonprofit's executive director, chris saeger, called bernhardt the ultimate dc swamp creature.\n\nthe bottom line is that bernhardt is too conflicted to even be acting secretary, saeger said.\n\nbernhardt represented interior at wednesday's cabinet meeting at the white house, sitting directly next to trump.
the white house correspondents associations decided wednesday to remove the far-right one america news network from its seating rotation for daily coronavirus briefings because its reporter has repeatedly violated social distancing guidelines.\n\nthe association's board released a statement citing a policy it created last month that restricts seating at the white house's james s. brady press briefing room in order to comply with social distancing guidelines from the centers for disease control and prevention.\n\nunder the policy, white house correspondents have been asked not to attend the briefings if they don't have an assigned seat to ensure the safety of the white house press corps and white house staff during this difficult time.\n\nwe are writing to inform you that the whca board has voted this evening to remove a news outlet from the rotation for a seat in the briefing room, the association's board said. we did this because a reporter for this outlet twice attended press briefings in contravention of this policy.\n\nwhca statement on removing news organization from news briefing seat rotation pic.twitter.com/kl3xcpq7rt — whca (@whca) april 1, 2020\n\nwednesday was the second time that an oann correspondent attended the white house's daily coronavirus briefing in defiance of the whca's social distancing requirements. the correspondent, chanel rion, violated the policy by standing in the back of the room on two occasions when she was not listed on the briefing seat rotation.\n\nthe oan person's first question was a loaded one meant to denigrate china. her second was a loaded question meant to heighten tensions with iran. pic.twitter.com/xztrhl3abe — aaron rupar (@atrupar) april 1, 2020\n\nwe do not take this action lightly, the board said in its statement. this is a matter of public safety.\n\nrion made headlines for her racist remarks during an earlier coronavirus briefing when she asked a leading question about whether president donald trump considers the term chinese food to be racist. (trump has been rightfully criticized for calling the pandemic the chinese virus.)\n\nshe also attempted to peddle a right-wing conspiracy theory, saying american journalists have teamed up with chinese communist party narratives and are siding with foreign state propaganda, islamic radicalism, latin gangs and cartels.
hey! it's bushroot! in the flesh!\n\nthese six words shattered the little world that i created for myself during my freshman year at syracuse university. up until that point, i had considered myself to be pretty much nailing the whole college thing as i adjusted to life eight hours away from my maryland childhood home. i was getting good grades, keeping my homesickness mostly in check, convincing myself that i enjoyed cheap beer and making new friends. cool new friends. cool new bro friends, to be exact.\n\ni was on cloud nine about being accepted into the brewster hall dorm crew, which was led by a group of guys who lived on the floor below me and who loved to do the ultimate college bro stuff, such as smoke weed and watch sports. one of them even initiated a hookup with me on the very first night of college. he was drunk ― and he never looked me in the eye after that ― but still.\n\ngrowing up, i was a bit of a late bloomer both physically and socially. i could hardly believe that these guys saw me for who i really was: a cute, fun, friendly girl who was cool enough to be privy to their inside jokes ― including and especially the one about bushroot.\n\nbushroot was a squat, gnome-like creature that one of the bros had sketched out at the beginning of the semester to be our dorm mascot. it had bulging eyes and a dark shaded face ringed by short spiky hair. the guys proudly hung photocopies of the bushroot sketch up on all their walls. they would approach the sketch and ask, bushroot, should i take another hit from this bong? or someone in the room would suddenly whisper 'shroot and then they'd all repeat the name in turn, escalating the volume until they were shouting. they would invite the girls, myself included, to chant bushroot along with them and then they would hoot and holler when we did.\n\nthen, one night, i found out that this mascot — and therefore the whole bushroot joke — was supposed to be a caricature of me. a guy from a different dorm was hanging out in brewster hall. when he saw me face to face, he blurted out those six fateful words: hey! it's bushroot! in the flesh!\n\ni retreated to the privacy of my dorm room and tried to deny that i had heard him correctly. i'm bushroot? i thought. the stupid-looking mascot thing that everyone thinks is so hilarious? how?!\n\nbut bushroot had enough similarities to my appearance that i had to believe it. the shaded skin, for one. and the spiky hair. i understood that my afro-style cropped cut was an unconventional look for our white, affluent, sorority-laden upstate new york campus. it was for me, too. i had never done anything so bold when it came to my appearance. i had gotten a burst of confidence after high school, though, and wanted to make a start strong in this new chapter in my life. i wanted to show up to college and really be someone.\n\ni just didn't want to be the dorm mascot.\n\ncourtesy of leah olson the author sporting her newly cropped cut during her freshman year at syracuse university in 2003.\n\nconsidering that this incident occurred at roughly the halfway point of my life to date, it could have made for a very nice turning point if we were following a typical hollywood narrative.\n\nleading up to bushroot, i had spent nearly two decades as a girl who was half-black but hellbent on being seen as fully white. from as early as i can remember, i harbored the belief that in white america, there was a minimum threshold that a human had to meet before the rest of society even considered whether that person could be cute, beautiful, sexy, professional and successful. and that threshold was ... whiteness. the way i saw it (and the way the world had made me see it), if you didn't look white, well then you better hope to be super talented at something that white america valued.\n\nparadoxically, i developed this hurtful white favoritism mindset while growing up in a multiracial family of transracial adoptees. i was adopted at birth by my white parents, who went on to adopt my white sister and four black brothers. my parents espoused diversity, african american heritage, anti-racism and tolerance. we had open conversations about race and prejudice. i grew up surrounded by family friends and family members of all races, ethnicities and backgrounds.\n\nbut the messages i was receiving from the broader society around me were powerful and persistent. as i got old enough to make my own decisions, i chose to attend mostly white academic magnet programs in middle and high school. i made no efforts to diversify my social circle. ditto with my extracurricular activities: violin, cross country, competitive swimming and ― the kicker ― field hockey.\n\nthrough it all, i felt like i was doing a pretty convincing job of passing as white, so long as i hid my hair. i saw my hair as the big giveaway. white people's hair hung down. my coarse, kinky curly hair expanded out.\n\ncourtesy of lean olson the author at age 4, when her hair finally grew long enough to assemble into some sort of bun (which she viewed as a thrilling milestone in my young eyes!).\n\nwhen my hair finally grew long enough, i always shoved it back into a thick braid or a tight bun to try and pull off a sporty look. but right before i left for syracuse, i went out on a limb and got that short, cropped, natural curly cut.\n\nif my life were following the kind of story arc you might see on tv, here's where i ― the black girl who wanted to be white ― would have finally been forced to admit that racism exists. i would have known it all along, of course, in part because of the very fact that i wanted so badly to be white in the first place. post-bushroot, i would have taken a hard look at all the other times i had experienced both covert and overt racism. i would have spoken out against the hurtful mascot joke of which i was the butt at syracuse. i would have sought solace from other people of color ― maybe even my own family members ― who might have understood and helped me deal with my pain.\n\nbut i can't write that story.\n\nforget an arc ― my story became more linear than ever as i jacked up my quest to get white people to see and accept me as white.\n\ni first addressed my hair, which seemed like an obvious place to start at the time. i felt grateful that at this point in my life, i was no longer beholden to my parents' no chemicals in your body policy. i began to pay increasingly large percentages of my income to hair stylists to burn the crap out of my hair with sketchy chemicals ― relaxers, texturizers, keratins, thermal reconditioners, smoothers, serums, rinses ― that made my eyes water, my nose run and my scalp scream. i figured it was the price i had to pay to scorch out any traces of bushroot.\n\ncourtesy of leah olson the author giving a toast while rocking her elusive straight hair at her sister's wedding in 2016. (needless to say, chemicals were involved, she said.)\n\ni also went hardcore on tailoring my résumé, my friendships and my lifestyle in hopes of fitting in with white, privileged, affluent, well-respected america after i graduated from college. in 2007, i joined the education reform organization teach for america for a two-year teaching commitment. afterward, i attended harvard law school, graduated in 2012, and then worked for four years at top-tier corporate law firms in new york city and san francisco.\n\nthe whole time, i was surrounded by a lot of white people. a lot. however, i take far less issue with that ― i made wonderful friends and had incredible, life-changing experiences ― than i do with my attitude along the way. i was in full-on racial denial. i didn't even join any affinity groups for black, indigenous and other people of color or try to make any friends who looked like me.\n\nat first, while i was still hurting inside, i felt motivated to keep climbing the white privilege ladder to get as far away as i could from the position of being a victim of racism. i would collect my latest (white) gold star and think, suck it, syracuse! as i became more enmeshed in my 20-something rat race life, however, it became more subconscious. i am naturally hardworking and competitive (aka type a), so i began enjoying my aggressive life pursuits more simply for what they were. i began to go long stretches of time without thinking about syracuse or bushroot or any of that pain. in fact, i never told a soul about bushroot until this year.\n\nnow, i am finally finding an arc, thanks to the boys ― not the syracuse ones, but my own.\n\nin a plot twist that i find a little bit hilarious and a little bit fated, my white husband and i are the biological parents to two sons who are as different in appearance as day and night ― pun intended.\n\ncourtesy of leah olson the author with her sons, ages 2 and 4 months, respectively, in the spring of 2020.\n\ni'll pause here to acknowledge that, yes, i married a white guy. my husband loves me for all of who i am, inside and out. he has been a strong supporter of my identity journey. he is an incredible father to our kids. but he is indeed a white guy. like, scandinavian ancestors on both sides white. and our first son looks like a carbon copy of those ancestors. fair skin, blue eyes, stick-straight towhead blond hair.\n\nconsider this child next to me. we turn heads when we're out in public. strangers cannot get enough of our brown-blond combo. sometimes even i catch myself doing a double take at us and thinking about how not even my ap biology teacher back in high school could have predicted this outcome.\n\nso maybe it was the universe at work in some way, right? my first son came to me with the message: stop hiding! you're not white! and now everyone's going to be calling you out on it!\n\nand then came his brother.\n\nalmost exactly two years later, my husband and i were blessed with our second son, who looks like a carbon copy of me. brown eyes (no real hair yet) and brown skin that is somehow even a little darker than mine.\n\nthis son brought his own message: stop hiding! we're not white! but we are both beautiful just the way we are!\n\ncourtesy of leah olson the author's younger son at 9 months old.\n\nit took welcoming these two beautiful boys into the world for me to realize the journey i had been on was not the journey i wanted to stay on. i do not know what would've happened if i had not become a mother to them ― if the realization that i was hiding from who i really am had not accompanied them when they appeared in my world. but it did. and it made me rethink ― and re-feel ― everything.\n\nso here i am, in all of my vulnerable glory. i am sharing the bushroot story to belatedly call out racism and cruelty but also to illustrate just how powerful white favoritism and, let's be honest, white supremacy can be in this society. by hiding the pain that i felt at syracuse and, more generally, by focusing so much time and energy throughout my life into trying to convince others and myself that i am just as white as they are, i have undoubtedly caused pain to myself and to those who look like me. i don't want to do that anymore. especially not to my son.\n\nmy identity journey is not over. on the contrary, it's just beginning. there's a lot that i still don't know, but here is what i do know: being honest is important. it doesn't mean you have to have all of the answers or have to be ready to take some dramatic action to prove a point. it just means that you have to be ready to be raw.\n\nbeing raw is ok. admitting pain is ok. apologizing is ok. and it's never too late to come home to yourself.\n\ni want to be honest about my racial identity for me, for my kids and for my country. i want us to make some profound progress in making america a more accepting place where people can feel more and, ultimately, hurt less. i want to be exactly who i am, and i want my sons — and, really, everyone — to feel confident to do the same.\n\nleah olson is working on a memoir about growing up biracial in white america. she works as an in-house attorney for a network of public charter schools. she lives in southern california with her husband and two young sons.\n\ndo you have a compelling personal story you'd like to see published on huffpost?

this article is the first in a seven-part series, one year later: larry nassar and the women who made us listen, that commemorates the seven days women stood in a lansing, michigan, courtroom last year and read powerful impact statements to former usa gymnastics and michigan state trainer larry nassar. one year later was produced by reporter alanna vagianos. read more installments: one | two | three | four | five | six | seven\n\none year ago, almost to the day, morgan mccaul stood in a tiny courtroom in lansing, michigan, ready to face down her abuser, former usa gymnastics and michigan state university trainer larry nassar. with her pixie-cut hair and tortoiseshell glasses, the diminutive 18-year-old university of michigan student didn't look especially formidable.\n\nthen she started speaking.\n\nevery shred of admiration i had for you is gone, mccaul told nassar, the doctor she said she'd once respected and called a friend. the man i thought i knew did not exist, only a selfish predator whose atrocities know no bounds.\n\nthe beige courtroom, ordinarily unremarkable, hummed with energy that day as dozens of women waited their turn to read victim impact statements to the man who'd turned their lives upside down at some point in the past two decades. an army of more than 150 survivors had arrived for battle.\n\nsince reports of larry nassar's misconduct to michigan state faculty began in 1997, two years before i was even born, i can't help but wonder, mccaul continued. how many little girls could have been spared from this lifelong battle if someone at the university had just done the bare minimum and listened?\n\nwhen mccaul finished, she stepped back from the podium, emotional but resolute, and stared down nassar.\n\nnearly 365 days later, mccaul says it was this moment and that historic sentence hearing that changed her life forever.\n\nali lapetina for huffpost morgan mccaul, age 19, holds her original impact statement about larry nassar that she read in court last year.\n\ndays before mccaul and her legion of self-proclaimed sister survivors confronted nassar in court, i published a piece about the 140 women who had publicly accused nassar of sexual abuse at the time. while their stories had commanded attention in the lansing area (thanks to first-rate reporting from local media), they hadn't yet garnered the international attention they would ultimately receive. it was frustrating, and disappointing, to see dozens of stories of serial abuse brushed aside by mainstream media.\n\nhalf a dozen survivors described a feeling of hopelessness before the sentencing, telling huffpost last year that it seemed as if the country simply did not care about the abuse they experienced. some attributed it to sexism. others believed the lack of public attention was because most of nassar's victims were not olympic gymnasts.\n\nwe couldn't get anybody to pay attention to this. we tried so hard and we couldn't get people to care, sarah klein, an attorney and one of the first known victims of nassar, told huffpost this year. we knew that what michigan state had done was wrong. we knew that what usag had done was wrong, and we wanted so badly to tell our story, but we couldn't get any traction.\n\nit was a sentence hearing, of all things, that finally made the country take notice. on jan. 16, 2018, in a tiny michigan courtroom, 169 women and family members began reading gut-wrenching victim impact statements to the once-famed sports medicine doctor.\n\ni could just feel it in that room. finally, we were taking our power back and the world was listening. amanda thomashow, msu graduate and nassar survivor\n\ni could just feel it in that room, nassar survivor and msu graduate amanda thomashow told huffpost. finally, we were taking our power back and the world was listening.\n\nit's common for victims of a crime to be given the opportunity to read a statement. but this was different. ingham county circuit court judge rosemarie aquilina took a unique and at times controversial approach, allowing every single person to speak ― which meant that instead of lasting a day or two, the hearing ran an entire week.\n\ni got to bring that little girl that i once was with me into court and up to that podium, klein told huffpost. and i got to speak for her.\n\nthat week, and those women, forced the country to finally confront nassar's heinous abuse and the institutional complicity that enabled him for so long.\n\nby the end of the seven days, prosecutors had identified more than 265 accusers. and that was before more survivors faced down nassar during an additional sentencing in charlotte, michigan.\n\njeff kowalsky via getty images people in the courtroom react as former michigan state university and usa gymnastics doctor larry nassar listens during impact statements during the sentencing phase in ingham county circuit court on january 24, 2018 in lansing, michigan. more than 100 women and girls accuse nassar of a pattern of serial abuse dating back two decades, including the olympic gold-medal winners simone biles, aly raisman, gabby douglas and mckayla maroney -- who have lashed out at top sporting officials for failing to stop him. / afp photo / jeff kowalsky (photo credit should read jeff kowalsky/afp/getty images)\n\nhuffpost spoke with almost all of the women we talked to for last year's article, plus a few additional survivors: mccaul, klein, thomashow, larissa boyce, christine harrison and jessica smith. a year later, now that the public is finally listening, i wanted to know ― have msu and usag righted their wrongs?\n\ni find it really interesting how many people are still willing to put money and medals and institutional reputation ahead of survivors ― even under intense public scrutiny, mccaul said.\n\nall the women agreed: the country may finally be paying attention, but usa gymnastics and michigan state are not.\n\ni still fear that the institutions are not listening, harrison, an msu graduate and former gymnast and soccer player, said. sexual assault survivors should never have to beg to be listened to or believed, and unfortunately i feel like that's what we've had to do this past year.\n\ntime and again, msu, usa gymnastics and the u.s. olympic committee have neglected to remedy decades of institutional failures, despite embarrassing resignations, criminal charges and even bankruptcy.\n\nat msu, former president lou anna k. simon, former gymnastics coach kathie klages and former msu dean of osteopathic medicine and nassar's former boss william strampel have been charged with lying to the police, willful neglect of duty and, in the case of strampel, sexual misconduct.\n\neven more distressing to many survivors, msu interim president john engler closed a $10 million healing fund in december originally set aside for counseling and other services for nassar victims. the school redirected that money into an existing $500 million settlement divided between the 332 women who'd sued the school. this move left dozens of other accusers, who were not part of the lawsuit, unable to collect support funding for necessary counseling and other mental health services. (last week, msu's board of trustees voted to establish a new fund, although board chair dianne byrum said the details are still to be worked out.)\n\nsmith, a dance teacher, scoffed at msu's incompetence in its attempts to course-correct after the nassar scandal.\n\nali lapetina for huffpost jess a c\n\ni teach students as young as 2, and in my experience, 2-year-olds are better at taking responsibility than michigan state university, she said. children don't necessarily understand what they're doing, but they understand when their friend says 'that hurts me.'\n\nthomashow said that for msu to improve, the school needs to listen to the team of experts and advocates it has on hand as part of the recently created relationship violence and sexual misconduct expert advisory workgroup. the group consists of rock star advocates, thomashow said, including andrea munford, the lead msu special victims unit detective who broke open the nassar case in 2016.\n\ni know that they have it in them at msu, thomashow said. it's just listening to the experts and actually having a trauma-informed, evidence-based approach to sexual assault prevention and response.\n\nsuch a response would typically entail training officials on the importance of believing survivors and combating victim blaming. it would also include law enforcement training about how trauma works, and its effects on delayed reporting and memory loss. the university has not yet rolled out programs specifically addressing these issues.\n\nmeanwhile, at usa gymnastics, former president steve penny and former trainer debbie van horn face criminal charges as well. van horn was indicted in june on allegations that she sexually assaulted a child while working at the infamous usag training facility, the karolyi ranch in walker county, texas.\n\nali lapetina for huffpost amanda thomashow, age 29, poses for a portrait on the bed where she originally wrote her impact statement about larry nassar a year ago.\n\nin one of the most glaring missteps, usag appointed mary lee tracy to the prestigious role of elite development coordinator, only to learn that she'd defended nassar in december 2016, when more than 50 women had already accused him of serial sexual abuse. days later, she resigned.\n\nfor its part, the u.s. olympic committee, the very organization tasked with righting the ship post-nassar, has not been able to land on its feet. the organization announced in november that it planned to decertify usa gymnastics, but usag filed for bankruptcy ― a last-ditch effort to stabilize the flailing organization ― before the decertification could take place. as of this writing, usa gymnastics is still up and running.\n\nlast month, it was revealed that two usoc top officials deleted emails containing disturbing accusations against nassar in 2015, and failed to report it. one of the officials was fired over the revelation; the other had stepped down some months before.\n\nmccaul toggled between anger, frustration and flat-out exhaustion as she discussed the various institutional errors.\n\nif international attention is not enough to force institutional leaders to change their behavior, what is? she said, adding that money repeatedly took precedence over girls' lives.\n\nif international attention is not enough to force institutional leaders to change their behavior, what is? morgan mccaul, university of michigan student and nassar survivor\n\nreached for comment, representatives for usag and michigan state each expressed remorse for the survivors' trauma while pointing to changes their respective institutions have made post-nassar.\n\none year ago, more than 150 courageous women made gymnastics, and all sports, safer by sharing their stories and the personal impact of larry nassar's despicable crimes, kathryn carson, chair of usa gymnastics' board of directors, told huffpost. we deeply regret the horrific acts that hurt so many of our athletes. we will never forget and are forever grateful for their bravery in coming forward.\n\ncarson said a lot has changed in the past year, citing turnover in usag's leadership and noting that the group has implemented safe sport policies and worked to create a culture of greater accountability.\n\nwe know we have more work to do, she said. we are committed to taking the needed steps toward fostering a positive, encouraging and safe environment where all of our members are comfortable in speaking up and have the opportunity to thrive and follow their gymnastics dreams.\n\nemily guerrant, a spokeswoman for msu, told huffpost the university is extraordinarily sorry for all the harm nassar's crimes and the school's own failures have caused.\n\nas we learn and move forward, the university continues to engage and invest in an intense reform and cultural change effort to ensure michigan state university is a safe campus for students, faculty, staff and our community, she said. msu has made many strides in addressing sexual misconduct situations, including implementing a new chaperone policy and strengthening mandatory reporting policies for all staff.\n\nali lapetina for huffpost morgan mccaul, age 19, inside her apartment in ann arbor michigan. morgan is studying political science student at the university of michigan.\n\nlooking ahead, there's no one-size-fits-all solution for three different institutions that failed women equally. the cleanup promises to be complicated, as the organizations attempt to unlearn decades of bad behavior.\n\nmccaul, like thomashow, stressed the importance of prioritizing and centering survivors in nassar's wake.\n\nif the health and the well-being of the people that you hurt is at the forefront of your mind, i think that that will create an environment and create a mindset for actual progress, she said.\n\nand if the past year has proven anything, it's that the sister survivors will stop at nothing to hold these organizations accountable. all of the women agreed that their fight isn't over.\n\nit's clear that fame, money and attention is what's motivating them, smith said of usa gymnastics and msu. let's be clear, though, you can't buy us off. there's no amount of money, there's no amount of fame or attention that can get us to stop.\n\none year later: larry nassar and the women who made us listen is a seven-part series that commemorates the seven days women stood in judge rosemarie aquilina's lansing, michigan, courtroom last january and read powerful victim impact statements to former usa gymnastics and michigan state trainer larry nassar. their words made history, forcing the country to finally listen and confront the abuse nassar perpetrated. this series highlights the people who helped take nassar down, as well as those he hurt for so long.\n\ncorrection: a previous version of this article misstated the location of nassar's sentence hearing. it took place in lansing, not east lansing.\n\nillustration by marly gallardo for huffpost\n\n* * * * *
theresa may has survived a no-confidence vote in her government and fended off labour leader jeremy corbyn's attempt to force a general election.\n\nmps voted by a slim margin of 19 votes to express their confidence in the prime minister's government despite her historic defeat on her brexit deal a day earlier. the result was expected after brexit supporting-politicians who opposed her deal in large numbers nevertheless backed her government to continue.\n\nmay said immediately after the vote she would embark on a round of cross-party talks to find a way out of the brexit deadlock amid suggestions from cabinet ministers that she could be edging towards a softer withdrawal from the eu.\n\nlabour policy prioritizes forcing a general election, though corbyn is coming under intensifying pressure to explicitly back a second referendum. 71 labour mps have called for corbyn to unequivocally back a second referendum now that his no-confidence motion has failed.\n\nwe shouldn't have any further delay, louise ellman, a senior labour lawmaker, said. the clock is ticking. it's just over 70 days to go before we actually leave the eu. we can't afford to do that, so jeremy must act now.\n\nbut senior party figures indicated he was ready to table repeated no-confidence challenges and therefore stall the process by which he could be forced to back another referendum.\n\npa wire/pa images corbyn is facing internal pressure to back a second eu referendum\n\nopening the debate on the no-confidence motion, corbyn urged may's zombie government to stand aside and declared her frankenstein brexit deal officially dead.\n\nhe attacked the pm for presiding over the largest defeat in the history of our democracy on her brexit deal before saying there has been no offer of all-party talks from the prime minister to break the impasse.\n\nhe also criticized the government record on issues beyond leaving the eu before facing tory taunts, with former minister anna soubry labelling him the most hopeless leader of the opposition we've ever had.\n\nresponding, may dismissed his call for a general election saying it would be the worst thing we could do.\n\nit would deepen division when we need unity, it would bring chaos when we need certainty, and it would bring delay when we need to move forward, she told mps.\n\nmeanwhile, former labour mp john woodcock, who quit the party while suspended amid harassment allegations, did not support the no-confidence motion because corbyn and shadow chancellor john mcdonnell are simply not fit to hold public office.\n\nthe public deserve so much better than this choice in the broken political system than they are being given, he said.\n\nthis is a breaking news story and will be updated. follow huffpost uk on twitter here, and on facebook here.
by hong soon-do, beijing correspondent, asiatoday - china's political world had been dominated by various factions before xi jinping took power at the 18th chinese communist party (ccp) national congress in 2012. but now there are signs of unification of political factions within the party. while china's socialist system and the regime remain unchanged, we could even say that no other faction than the xi jinping faction is left in china.\n\naccording to beijing sources familiar with the chinese government information on wednesday, there used to be two main political factions within the ccp leadership competing for power, influence and control over policy initiatives. they are the communist youth league faction and the shanghai faction. they deserved to be the main powers since the youth league faction produced former president hu jintao and premier li keqiang, and the shanghai faction produced former president jiang zemin. their close allies monopolized key positions of the ruling party. but now it is not easy to find high ranking officials of these factions in the office of the ruling party. it's because most of them have been relegated to less important posts as a result of a recent reshuffle. chinese vice chair li yuanchao, who is widely considered to be a protégé of hu jintao, is even embroiled in rumors of losing his post.\n\n[chinese president xi jinping and his allies. the picture is taken during their europe visit in 2014./ source: xinhua news agency]\n\non the other hand, xi jinping's close allies are being promoted to key positions. it can be clearly seen from the recent reshuffle. what's most eye-catching is the position of mayor shanghai. ying yong, a former close subordinate of xi jinping, is expected to step up from deputy role to replace yang xiong, who is considered a member of the shanghai faction.\n\n[ying yong, a former close subordinate of president xi jinping, is expected to be appointed mayor of shanghai./ source: xinhua news agency]\n\nwe should also take note of the appointment of the deputy secretary of the central commission for discipline inspection, which is considered ministerial rank. xi's long-time speechwriter li shulei was promoted to deputy chief of the discipline commission during the commission's recent plenary session. the appointment shows that the chinese president is seeking to train li to be secretary wang qishan's successor.\n\nin addition, we should not ignore the appointment of zhang guoqing and chen yixin as mayors of chongqing and hubei provinces, respectively. zhang and chen's appointments show xi jinping's intentions to train young bloods in order to increase his control in the future.\n\nsuch trend is expected to continue for a while. in short, the signs of the unification of political factions may have already become reality.
employees of the music equipment retailer guitar center have been told they must sign mandatory arbitration agreements or they will lose their jobs.\n\nthe agreement, a copy of which was obtained by the huffington post, forces employees to relinquish their rights to sue the company in class action lawsuits over wage violations, workplace discrimination and unjust firings, among other disputes.\n\nsean lynch, a sales employee at the company's las vegas store, said he and his colleagues were told they must sign the agreement by end of day friday or they forfeit their jobs.\n\nit was imposed on us and we have absolutely no choice, lynch told huffpost.\n\narbitration agreements have become highly controversial for the way they hamstring employees and weaken their legal power. by sending disputes to an arbitrator, they force workers to pursue their claims individually and outside of court, preempting any collective action. and even though they're supposed to be neutral third parties, arbitrators are often cozy with the companies that workers are squaring off with, as the new york times detailed in a recent series.\n\na guitar center spokeswoman said the company declined to comment.\n\ncorporations are increasingly demanding that employees and consumers agree to mandatory arbitration, whether signatories realize it or not. nowadays, the clauses are often tucked into welcome packets as boilerplate for new hires to sign. but in the case of guitar center, it appears the new policy is being imposed suddenly on longtime employees like lynch, who says he's worked for the company for seven years.\n\nthe las vegas resident said he and his co-workers learned about the agreements in december when they signed in to do routine computer training. the powerpoint-style sessions are usually devoted to matters like music equipment or workplace safety, he said. but in this case, the session was all about arbitration, and why it was good for the company and the worker.\n\nin a question-and-answer sheet on the new policy, guitar center says that going to an arbitrator is less costly, less formal, friendlier and faster than going through the courts. the document assures a fair and impartial process, and notes that guitar center will pick up the tab for the arbitration (though not for the employee's lawyer, if he or she chooses one). the company is clear that the agreement is mandatory:\n\nas a condition of new or continued employment, all new and current associates are required to electronically acknowledge and agree to be bound by the arbitration program and related agreement.\n\nlynch said he has been circulating a petition in his store that he intends to submit to management on friday. he plans to sign the arbitration agreement, but not without protest. he said he can't afford to lose his job.\n\nmy main concern with it is that it's 'do it or else,' lynch said.\n\nguitar center has been wrapped up in a nasty labor dispute with the retail, wholesale and department store union, which provided the arbitration documents to huffpost. in 2013, rwdsu won elections at three guitar center stores, including las vegas, but the union is still without a contract at any of them. the general counsel of the national labor relations board accused the company of refusing to bargain in good faith, leading to a recent two-week trial. a decision hasn't yet been issued.\n\nliz vladeck, a lawyer with cary kane llp who represents the union, said she questions the legality of guitar center requiring its employees to sign such a document. although federal courts have ruled different ways on the issue, the nlrb has declared that such mandatory agreements illegally infringe on a worker's right to protected concerted activity with colleagues.\n\nwhile guitar center's agreement says workers can still pursue certain claims, such as unemployment insurance or workers' compensation, the language rules out a strikingly broad array of situations -- including any other violation of federal, state or local law.\n\nwe're analyzing the agreement in light of the labor board's recent cases. we're considering filing a new charge and pursuing a new round of action, vladeck said. what's great is a lot of workers have been individually protesting. they're organizing themselves.
jonathan ernst/reuters with the elections of jon ossoff, raphael warnock and joe biden, progressives are thinking they might actually be able to pass some real reform.\n\nwhen the 2020 election finally ended 64 days after election day, democrats pulled out two additional victories, setting up a 50-50 balance in the senate where vice president-elect kamala harris will cast tie-breaking votes.\n\nthe wins for raphael warnock and jon ossoff unlock much more hope that the biden administration might not just undo some of the worst actions taken in the trump era, but actually push progressive reforms over the finish line.\n\ndemocrats in the senate and the house, where their majority is also razor-thin, will still have to contend with more conservative members of their party who are resistant to progressive reforms.\n\nand democrats will have to deal with the filibuster, which allows a minority of senators to block legislation by stalling unless and until 60 members vote to end debate. that would mean getting 10 republicans to join them, something hard to imagine in most circumstances these days.\n\nthere are a few exceptions to the filibuster, including bills that go through the budget reconciliation process ― a special procedure that makes it possible to pass bills with a simple majority. but there are rules about what can and can't be in a reconciliation bill and democrats over the next two years will be limited to three such bills, at most.\n\nthe only other way forward would be to end the filibuster, which is a parliamentary rule that the senate adopted and can easily end. reforming the filibuster is something biden signaled last year he could be open to, after historically defending the procedure, but several democratic senators have said they would oppose that.\n\nstill, progressive reforms in these areas now look a whole lot more possible than they did last week:\n\nminimum wage and labor\n\na democratic majority in the senate could put in play the first minimum wage hike in more than a decade. the federal wage floor of $7.25 per hour has not budged since 2009. with democrats holding the house, the senate and the white house, they would have a much stronger hand to pursue an increase as high as $15, though only if they prove willing to nuke the filibuster.\n\ndemocratic control of the senate also makes sweeping labor reform possible through the protecting the right to organize act (pro act). the legislation, which the democratic-controlled house had passed last year, would ramp up penalties for employers who try to break unions, ban anti-union right to work laws, and expand workers' rights to strike and boycott. the measure would be a huge prize for organized labor, but it has drawn fierce opposition from business groups and could struggle to draw the necessary votes from moderate senate democrats.\n\nat the very least, a democratic senate should allow biden to more easily reverse many of the labor policies of the trump era ― not just legislatively through the congressional review act, but by reshaping the national labor relations board, which referees disputes between employers and unions. the trump picks for that board have made it more difficult for many workers to bargain collectively. if sen. mitch mcconnell (r-ky.) is deposed as the senate's leader, biden would have a much easier time installing union-friendly nominees who could undo the previous board's decisions.\n\nvoting rights and campaign finance\n\nreauthorization of the voting rights act and a suite of voting rights and campaign finance and ethics reforms were already at the top of congressional democrats' priority list before they won control of the senate on tuesday.\n\nparamount among these is the john lewis voting rights act, which would reform and reauthorize the 1965 voting rights law. the proposed legislation, named after the civil rights hero and former democratic congressman who died in 2019, would update the vra in compliance with the supreme court's 2014 decision in shelby county v. holder, which gutted key parts of the historic law. that decision freed state-level republicans to enact a raft of voter suppression measures aimed at lowering minority voter turnout. former president barack obama called on the senate to waive the filibuster in order to pass the revised law in his eulogy for lewis.\n\nhouse democrats also plan to pass the for the people act, a collection of voting rights, campaign finance and ethics reforms, as they did in 2019. the bill would create a system of publicly financed congressional elections, expand campaign finance disclosure provisions, enhance executive branch ethics laws, end partisan gerrymandering, and require states to implement a host of election reforms to make it easier to vote. other bills like the protect our democracy act, which aims to prevent future presidents from abusing their power as donald trump did, will also get a senate hearing now.\n\nthe judiciary\n\nbiden will have a much, much easier time getting his judicial nominees confirmed with sen. dick durbin (d-ill.) leading the senate judiciary committee than he would have with sen. lindsey graham (r-s.c.) at the helm. since trump and mcconnell filled almost every open judicial seat that republicans had prevented obama from filling, biden will have to rely on older judges to retire quickly if he is to put his stamp on the federal judiciary.\n\ntrump transformed the supreme court with three new justices, the most named by any president since ronald reagan. progressive judicial activist groups wasted no time in calling for liberal stephen breyer, the oldest supreme court justice at 82, to retire as soon as biden is inaugurated and make way for a younger progressive justice. democrats do not want another elderly justice dying at an inopportune time, as happened with the late justice ruth bader ginsburg. if breyer does step down, biden is expected to nominate the first black female justice, as he promised to do during his presidential campaign.\n\nthe social safety net\n\noutside of their demands for bigger unemployment benefits in coronavirus relief legislation, democrats have not said much lately about expanding or improving programs for poor people. they've mostly played defense against trump and congressional republicans' attempts to cut food and disability benefits, policies that will be relatively easy for them to reverse.\n\nbut there have been some big proposals in recent years, like making the child tax credit fully refundable and paid in advance, so low-income parents receive monthly checks instead of having to wait for a refund. democratic leaders included this proposal in their covid-19 relief demands late last year.\n\nas for expanding social security retirement benefits, party leaders previously declined to give a hearing to such a proposal, though they said nice things about it.\n\ntaxes, maybe\n\nbiden has said he supports a higher corporate tax rate and higher income and payroll taxes on people earning more than $400,000 ― proposals that would partially reverse the tax cuts that republicans enacted at the end of 2017.\n\ncongressional democrats also want to reverse some of trump's tax cuts, but they've muddied the message by mainly insisting they would undo the only major tax hike that republicans included in the tax cuts and jobs act. among its various changes, that law capped the federal deductions people can take for what they pay in state and local taxes, which democrats decried as a tax hike on the middle class even though it mostly affected high-income households.\n\nclimate and a green new deal\n\nzeroing out planet-heating pollution from the world's second-largest emitter by the middle of the century will require unprecedented changes to the u.s. economy, and biden will need new legislation to do that.\n\nduring their campaigns, neither warnock nor ossoff endorsed the green new deal slogan that progressives use to frame calls for a world war ii-style industrial strategy to rapidly decarbonize. but both georgia democrats vowed to make climate legislation a top priority, and warnock, a baptist reverend, draws on a long history of black clergy fighting racist policies on pollution.\n\nthere will still be pushback from conservative democrats like sen. joe manchin (d-w.va.), a staunch fossil fuel ally who in 2010 ran an ad in which he fired bullets into a copy of the last major climate bill that congress considered. manchin, sen. krysten sinema (d-ariz.) and sen. angus king (i-maine) voted against a resolution in march 2019 outlining the core tenets of a green new deal. newly elected sen. john hickenlooper (d-colo.), a longtime oil and gas booster, could also be a hurdle.\n\nbut lawmakers can also embed climate provisions in broader spending packages. last month, congress passed a stimulus bill that included billions for clean energy research, extended tax credits for solar and wind power, and ratified a global deal to phase out hydrofluorocarbons, a superheating refrigerant gas. the federal government's annual budget offers a similar opportunity, as the budget reconciliation process allows lawmakers pushing polarizing provisions to circumvent the filibuster.\n\nhealth care\n\nthe affordable care act ― biden's famous b.f.d. ― is 11 years old and, for all its success making health care coverage available and more affordable to millions of americans, it needs work. biden campaigned on beefing up the law rather than replacing it wholesale with a single-payer medicare for all system. a fully democratic congress would provide the new president with an opportunity to fulfill some of his promises.\n\neven with republicans out of legislative power, biden faces a potential crisis in the supreme court, which is due to rule later this year on a lawsuit challenging the aca's constitutionality. the republican officials who brought the suit base their argument on the fact that congress repealed the fines associated with the law's individual mandate in 2017 without repealing the mandate itself. biden and a democratic congress could fix that problem in multiple, simple ways by amending the aca and rendering the lawsuit moot.\n\nprotecting the aca is but a preliminary step. biden's health care plan would direct additional financial assistance to those who purchase private health insurance on exchanges like healthcare.gov, and make that coverage and that assistance available to more people. biden has also proposed establishing a government-run public option insurance program that would be available to everyone as an alternative to private coverage, including to low-income adults who live in 12 states that haven't expanded their medicaid programs under the aca. and he has called for lowering the medicare eligibility age from 65 to 60 and allowing the federal government to negotiate prescription drug prices with manufacturers, among other policies a democratic majority makes possible.\n\nimmigration\n\nbiden has promised to take a number of executive actions to reverse trump's immigration policies, but democratic control of congress could allow him to resurrect broader immigration reform.\n\nthe incoming president supports a pathway to citizenship for many undocumented immigrants ― including dreamers, the young undocumented immigrants who came to the u.s. as kids. he's also pledged to increase the refugee cap and ease restrictions on asylum-seekers.\n\na number of measures now have a chance of passing the senate, including the national origin-based antidiscrimination for nonimmigrants act (or no ban act), which passed the house last july. it would immediately terminate trump's travel ban on several muslim-majority countries and prohibit future presidents from implementing a similar ban.\n\nbiden promised to renew temporary protected status for people from venezuela, guatemala and hong kong, among others. the house passed a bill to do that last month, but republicans in the senate blocked it. the president-elect has also pledged to work with congress on other reforms including amending visa programs for permanent workers and expanding protections for domestic violence survivors and undocumented immigrants who report labor violations.\n\npaid leave and childcare\n\nit's hard to imagine a better moment for democrats to pass paid family and sick leave, and to do something to improve the state of childcare. the coronavirus pandemic has added a level of urgency to these issues, as paid sick leave would help reduce the spread of covid-19 and a lack of paid family leave has pushed hundreds of thousands of parents, mainly women, out of the workforce.\n\nlawmakers like sen. kirsten gillibrand (d-n.y.), sen. patty murray (d-wash.) and rep. rosa delauro (d-conn.) have raised the issue's profile in the last few years, and polling shows actual bipartisan support. biden's campaign agenda favors 12 weeks of paid family leave and seven days of paid sick leave.\n\nthe quickest path forward would be to extend and expand the emergency sick leave and childcare leave provisions passed last year to deal with the pandemic. republican senators blocked extension of those provisions in december, and they expired on jan. 1.\n\nmeanwhile, the long-suffering childcare industry has taken a massive hit. but it's now possible for congress to pass something visionary like increased childcare funding to ensure, as sen. elizabeth warren (d-mass.) proposed, that families don't have to spend more than 7% of their income on that necessary expense. biden's robust caregiving proposals also raise the prospect of higher pay and benefits for childcare workers.\n\neducation\n\non the higher education front, biden's agenda focuses on hiking funding for historically black colleges and universities, and doubling the value of pell grants, which help low-income students attend college. both goals are possible with a simple senate majority.\n\nanother goal, to expand opportunities for free college, would involve more complex legislation and votes from republicans, making it less likely. how much action biden can take on student loan forgiveness is also up for debate, including whether he could do so through executive action. expanding access to preschool is another area where advocates are hopeful for new, ambitious legislation resembling what biden proposed as a candidate.\n\nthere's new hope of passing covid-19 relief measures to send much-needed injections of dollars to state and local governments, k-12 schools and universities. biden has promised to reopen most schools within his first 100 days in office, an undertaking that would require massive funding. there's also hope that any stimulus package could include resources to help alleviate students' learning loss over the last year.
four years ago, on jan. 21, 2017, nearly half a million people showed up for the women's march in washington, d.c., and millions more joined around the world to protest the kinds of unjust and racist policies expected from the newly inaugurated president donald trump.\n\nit was a day of anger, but also unity and joy. parents brought their kids, women sported pink pussy hats, and people carried homemade signs with statements like a woman's place is in the revolution! and make america gay again.\n\nit was also a day of dire warnings. women warned that trump's racist, misogynistic and violent rhetoric would have real consequences. in the years after, those fears were borne out in his policies and practices.\n\nnearly four years later, on jan. 6 of this year, a mob of trump's most fervent supporters ― incited by the then-president himself ― violently stormed the u.s. capitol to try to stop congress from certifying president-elect joe biden's victory.\n\ntrump's presidency was thus bookended by two very different groups registering their reactions to losing an election. to women's march organizers, the end came as no surprise.\n\nwomen said this would happen, noted rachel o'leary carmona, the executive director of the women's march. this is exactly who we knew trump to be. this is exactly who we said he was. and this is exactly why we got him out of office. because this attempted coup is just the beginning of what he could have done if he got another four years.\n\non the four-year anniversary of that first protest, huffpost spoke to linda sarsour, an original organizer and co-chair of the women's march. (she is no longer affiliated with the group. sarsour and two other original co-chairs stepped down from their positions at the organization in 2019 after reported in-fighting and accusations of anti-semitism.)\n\nillustration: damon dahlen/huffpost; photos: getty linda sarsour speaks during a national day of action for a dream act now protest on feb. 7, 2018, in washington, d.c.\n\nlooking back at that day four years ago and the organizing that happened around that first historic women's march, how do you feel now?\n\ni feel proud. the women's march was a warning to the country that we were going to mobilize in large numbers to hold this administration accountable. we reached women across the country, including a majority of women who never ever marched or organized a day in their lives, and we were able to articulate a message that our liberation is bound up with one another. a white woman won't be free if black women and muslim women and refugee women are not free. it was a very powerful message.\n\nit was fascinating to see the comparison of the beginning of trump's presidency to the end, the crazy contrast of people registering their reactions to losing an election. one, the women's march, was peaceful and joyous, while the other was a violent insurrection.\n\nthe difference between us and insurrectionists is that our march stood for something. it wasn't just a march against donald trump. it was a march for racial justice and gender justice and climate justice. we gave people something to aspire for.\n\nhow do you reflect on that contrast?\n\noutside of the women's marches, i reflect on the direct action that was led by women over the last four years. i remember in 2018, during the zero-tolerance policy of separating children from their mothers and fathers, we organized the largest women-led civil disobedience in history. and the capitol police figured out how to arrest over 640 women that day who were engaged in non-violent direct action inside of the senate hart building in the atrium.\n\nas a women's march leader, i remember during the [brett] kavanaugh hearing i was the first protester in that senate chamber, and all i did was get up and say, this is a travesty of justice. this is a mockery of justice. that's all i did. and i was dragged over chairs and arrested brutally by the capitol police for doing nothing more than standing up and using my voice. i did not engage in violence. i did not have any weapons. i was an unarmed woman just saying that i was outraged at what was happening before my eyes, and i was brutalized by the capitol police.\n\nwe were able to articulate a message that our liberation is bound up with one another. a white woman won't be free if black women and muslim women and refugee women are not free. linda sarsour\n\nso, for me, when i watched insurrectionists and white supremacists storm the capitol ― people who had announced days in advance that they were coming to the capitol ― and to see that they were treated with kid gloves really shows you everything we were trying to expose in the last four years under this administration. law enforcement is not here to protect everyone the same and not everyone will be held accountable the same. and i've experienced that. i've been arrested over 20 times on capitol hill grounds, inside the capitol and outside the capitol. so to watch people just walk right in, break windows, steal mail from federal government officials ― it was a very triggering but eye-opening experience for the rest of the country.\n\nhow do you think the women who marched in 2017 can channel that energy into four years of a biden presidency? a president they likely see far more common ground with, but still need to demand big change from.\n\nwhat is powerful now, four years later and in my experience organizing for the last 20 years, is that now we see intersectionality in a way that we have never seen before. we've seen racial justice movements working with climate justice movements working with gender justice movements in ways that are really unprecedented. i believe that the women's march ― and our contribution as women-of-color leaders in the women's march ― forced our movement to understand that we cannot win this in silos. we cannot defeat donald trump or his policies in silos. once donald trump goes after one of us, he's gonna go after all of us ― and that's, in fact, exactly what he did. so i think in the next four years, under the biden administration, you will see a lot more intersectional power building across movements and across communities.\n\ni just came from georgia. i lived there for a month during the senate runoff and i saw some of the most remarkable organizing. that, for me, is a reflection of what is possible over the next four years ― to push this administration to do the right thing. if you see even some of the policies that biden has already proposed and some of the first-day executive orders, one of them is repealing the muslim ban. that was a big campaign that came out of our movement.\n\nso i feel proud. i hope that women, particularly those who were never really organizers and started becoming active in the last four years, i hope that they see the fruits of their labor. i hope that black and brown organizers who have been organizing for decades see the fruits of their labor. that's what i'm excited about.\n\nthis interview has been edited for length and clarity.
after the end of the cold war some 30 years ago, public debate and understanding of the enormous scale of impact of nuclear war fell to very low levels. this has changed with recent nuclear weapons tests and missile firings by north korea. in this article i explain why the threat of nuclear war may now be higher than it has ever been and why we should all be aware of the latest scientific studies of the impacts of nuclear weapons.\n\ntwo nuclear war scenarios\n\nthere are approximately 14,900 nuclear weapons ready to fire or in stockpiles. 13,800 are deployed by the usa and russia, while the remaining 1,100 are deployed by china, the uk, france, india, pakistan and israel. north korea may have a handful of weapons. based a range of published or leaked nuclear war plans and statements by political leaders, there are two key types of nuclear war to consider.\n\nthe first is a global nuclear war involving the us and russia. in this scenario at least 1800 large warheads, or more likely over 3000, would be fired at nuclear weapon launch sites, command centres, ports, major industry, power stations and major centres of population. this is a large number of warheads and most cities, particularly state or regional capitals, would be struck by several nuclear weapons.\n\nthe other main scenario is a 'regional conflict', for example between india and pakistan. in this case at least 100 smaller nuclear weapons would be used out of stockpiles of around 200 weapons striking mainly large densely populated super cities such as delhi and karachi. a north korea – us scenario could be similar but with fewer but larger warheads being used.\n\neveryone understands that any such conflict would cause unprecedented levels of deaths and suffering, but what is not well understood is just how vulnerable modern society is. on top of this, the most up to date scientific studies predict serious and long lasting global climate impacts leading to widespread crop failure and famine.\n\nthe increased risk of nuclear war\n\nsince the cold war, both the us and russia have kept 1800 warheads ready to launch within minutes as soon as a potential nuclear attack is detected. this nuclear hair trigger is intended to prevent a nuclear first strike by ensuring that weapons will be launched before they are themselves destroyed. but this policy has brought the world very close to a nuclear war several times in past years when equipment faults and innocent signals were thought to be nuclear attacks in progress and launches were only countermanded at the last minute. now, nuclear commanders warn this risk is even higher due to continued cyber-attacks. many argue that weapons should not be kept ready to fire at short notice as a nuclear response would always be possible.\n\nthe vulnerability of society to nuclear attack\n\nthe use of a nuclear warhead causes a series of severe impacts: intense nuclear radiation and a blinding flash of light much brighter than the sun; a fierce fireball lasting several seconds; an intense blast wave; minutes or hours later, large-scale deposition of radioactive particles as fallout.\n\nsurvivors of the bombs dropped over japan at the end of world war 2 speak of a bright sunlit day plunged into darkness as black oily rain fell. dead figures, charred black still standing. burned and terminally injured survivors, their skin hanging off; eyes and other internal organs hanging out of their bodies. cars and vehicles tossed like toys, strong structures reduced to piles of rubble. huge fires.\n\nuse of a nuclear weapon today would be much worse for two reasons: a typical modern nuclear weapon is now 8 to 80 times larger; modern society is much more reliant on vulnerable information technology and long distance supply routes for food and fuel.\n\nmodern society is heavily reliant on electricity to power central heating pumps, to provide water, information via tv, the internet and mobile phones. nuclear strike will mean no water supply, no heating or lighting, no information, no mobile phone signal.\n\nonly a few days' food supply exists in regional distribution depots. the supply network would fail for multiple reasons: road blockages, communications breakdown, collapse of the banking system, destruction of ports.\n\ninternational aid organisations and health bodies all agree that the tens of thousands of casualties from just one nuclear bomb would overwhelm all attempts to help the injured. as a result, there would be no hope of treatment for severe injuries including burns, broken bones, deep cuts from flying debris.\n\nto add to the multiple impacts, most locations in western europe are ringed by nuclear targets such as power stations or cities, so whatever the weather or wind condition, radioactive fallout is likely. you may receive a lethal dose inside a few hours but may not experience any symptoms until days possibly up to a week later. radiation sickness causes vomiting, diarrhoea and internal bleeding. children and the elderly are more vulnerable and more likely to suffer or die.\n\nwith the intense levels of damage, huge fires would spread across all major towns and other targets, burning them out in huge fires lasting days to weeks. we now understand that these huge fires would cause long lasting climatic impacts at a global level.\n\na nuclear winter\n\nintense city-wide fires loft extensive high-altitude smoke clouds similar to a large volcanic eruption. these clouds block sunlight causing cooling. the latest climate models predict that the use of a few tens to a hundred of the smaller nuclear weapons in the regional india-pakistan scenario would cause severe frosts, reduced growing seasons, drought and famine lasting up to ten years across the entire northern hemisphere. a 1,800 us - russian warhead scenario would cause a long-lasting cold period with a peak average global cooling of 4°c, whilst a larger scale nuclear war with over 3000 warheads would cause average cooling of 8°c. this is greater than the average cooling of 5°c experienced during the last ice age, so this would be a severe nuclear winter lasting a decade.\n\nwhilst an average cooling of only a few degrees may not sound very serious, the crucial impact is much longer periods of frost in winter and severe drought. there would be dramatically reduced growing seasons or even the impossibility of growing any crop as planned. farming also relies upon supplies of fuel for mechanised planting and harvesting.\n\nrealistically, after a large scale nuclear war, one must picture small groups of brutalised, traumatised people, violently thrown back into a pre-industrial age. assuming that some people somewhere furthest from the bombs could initially survive this global catastrophe, any 'recovery' would surely be measured in hundreds of years. it has to be regarded a shocking indictment of our modern civilisation that current stockpiles of nuclear weapons are sufficient to cause such a global catastrophe.\n\nthe only conclusion that can be drawn from these findings is that any use of nuclear weapons would be a global disaster and cause unacceptable suffering. nuclear weapons do not keep us safe but under a constant threat of disaster. we now know we have avoided this only by sheer luck in several nuclear close-calls. in 2017, this understanding led 122 countries at the united nations, to support a treaty to ban nuclear weapons in the same fashion as chemical and biological weapons and to press the nuclear-armed states to negotiate major reductions in weapons. we need to get rid of nuclear weapons before they get rid of us.\n\nyou can find out more about scientists for global responsibility here.\n\nhuffpost uk tech has launched huffpost-apocalypse, a project that aims to investigate what an apocalypse would mean for humanity, how we can best delay the end of the world, what the world will look like after we're gone and what the best viable options for survival will be for anyone left. join in the conversation with #huffpostapocalypse on twitter. to read more from the series, visit our dedicated page.

president joe biden has revoked a key permit for the keystone xl pipeline, effectively killing the controversial project and jump-starting what he's promised will be a seismic shift in u.s. climate policy after four years of inaction under donald trump.\n\nthe executive order on the oil pipeline, which biden signed just hours after his inauguration, is part of an anticipated blitz of early executive actions to reverse trump-era policies. several are expected to target the previous administration's industry-friendly rollbacks of environmental regulations.\n\nbiden and vice president kamala harris have pledged aggressive government action to combat the global climate crisis, and in recent weeks they've assembled what environmentalists have hailed as an all-star team to lead that effort. as promised, biden signed a second executive order wednesday to rejoin the paris climate accord.\n\na cry for survival comes from the planet itself, biden said during his inauguration speech. a cry that can't be any more desperate or any more clear now.\n\nrevoking the permit for keystone xl is part of a broader day-one executive order to address the climate crisis, create good union jobs, and advance environmental justice, according to the administration. those efforts include potentially strengthening fuel economy and emissions standards; directing the interior department to protect our nation's treasures by reviewing and possibly reversing trump's rollbacks of protected national monuments, including bears ears and grand staircase-escalante; and temporarily banning all oil and gas leasing activities in alaska's arctic national wildlife refuge.\n\nit comes as a major blow for a fossil fuel infrastructure project that has been plagued by setbacks and litigation over the last decade.\n\nin 2015, president barack obama rejected keystone xl, saying that u.s. leadership to combat climate change would be undercut if he allowed the pipeline to be built. trump, in turn, revived both keystone xl and the dakota access pipeline, signing a pair of executive orders in his first few days to move the pipelines forward. legal challenges followed and in november 2018 a federal judge halted construction on keystone xl and ordered the trump administration to conduct a thorough environmental review. trump subsequently sidestepped that court order, issuing a presidential permit in 2019 authorizing energy company transcanada to again proceed with construction.\n\nif built, the planned 1,179-mile, $8.5 billion keystone xl pipeline would transport some 830,000 barrels of crude oil per day from alberta, canada, to nebraska, where it would link up with the existing keystone pipeline that connects to refineries in texas.\n\npipeline owner tc energy corp said in a statement wednesday that it would suspend construction ahead of biden's order, which it called very disappointing.\n\nwhile the trump administration, industry groups and other project supporters touted the pipeline's potential to create thousands of new jobs, environmentalists and native american groups have long warned about its potential climate and other environmental impacts. the pipeline has already suffered a number of failures, including a nearly 400,000-gallon spill in north dakota in october 2019.\n\ncanadian officials were among those who expressed concern this week after several media outlets reported on biden's looming action. jason kenney, the premier of the province of alberta, said in a statement that repealing the project permit would kill jobs on both sides of the border, weaken the critically important canada-us relationship, and undermine us national security by making the united states more dependent on opec oil imports in the future.\n\nmeanwhile, environmental groups hope the president's executive order is just the start of aggressive government action to curb planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nthese huge first steps show biden is serious about climate action, but re-entering the paris agreement and canceling keystone must be the start of a furious race to avert catastrophe, kierán suckling, executive director of the center for biological diversity, said in a statement. much more is needed, and we're increasingly hopeful the administration will stop approving new fossil fuel projects and speed the transition to clean, distributed energy that climate science and justice demand.
san diego (ap) — the acting director of u.s. immigration and customs enforcement resigned wednesday, only weeks after taking over the agency that detains and deports immigrants and runs international criminal investigations.\n\njonathan fahey gave no explanation for his abrupt departure in a brief email to employees late in the day, telling them that wednesday was his last day. he was replaced by tae johnson, currently deputy director and now the agency's fourth acting director since august.\n\ni am sincerely impressed by the professionalism and integrity with which you perform your duties each and every day, he wrote in his farewell message obtained by the associated press. despite leaving your ranks, i will remain an ardent supporter of this agency and workforce, cheering on your successes and praying for your safety.\n\nice spokeswoman jenny burke confirmed fahey had resigned and that johnson would replace him but did answer why. buzzfeed news first reported the resignation.\n\nice is part of the department of homeland security, which has also cycled through leaders during donald trump's presidency. chad wolf resigned this week as acting secretary of a department that has been without a senate-confirmed leader since kirstjen nielsen was forced out in april 2019.\n\nice, with more than 20,000 employees, oversees a sprawling network of immigration detention centers and carries out deportations. its homeland security investigations unit has a broad portfolio, including child exploitation, money laundering, antiquities theft and human smuggling.\n\nfahey's announcement surprised employees. he joined homeland security in march as a senior adviser for immigration policy after years as a federal and state prosecutor in virginia.\n\njohnson takes the reins at ice less than a week before president-elect joe biden's inauguration. he has worked at homeland security and one of its predecessor agencies, the immigration and naturalization service, for more than 25 years, including senior positions in ice's enforcement and removal operations division.
in 2003, the sars outbreak almost ruined the chinese communities in canada.\n\nfrank ye felt this first-hand. now a 23-year-old masters student at the university of toronto, ye was only around eight years old when the sars outbreak happened but he already began to encounter racism at his school.\n\ni remember when the other kid on the playground would tell me to go away because 'all chinese people had sars,' ye posted on twitter.\n\ni remember when the other kids on the playground would tell me to go away because all chinese people had sars, the spread of the virus is a concern, but let's not let paranoia translate to racism. my heart cries for the little chinese kids who well face racism because of this. https://t.co/dt5hopxd1w — frank ye (@leafye_river) january 26, 2020\n\nas a kid, i didn't understand what racism was, being in first and second grade, ye told huffpost canada. but thinking back to it, when kids told me to get away from them because i was chinese, that was racism.\n\nat the time it made me feel excluded and made me feel invalid in who i was.\n\nwhen news of the novel coronavirus first started spreading, asian-canadians like ye felt they were grappling not just with the outbreak of a new mysterious virus, but also the onslaught of racism they've come to expect.\n\nin 2003, toronto was hit especially hard by sars. there were a total of 44 deaths, all in or around the city. as the toll rose, people started staying away from chinese restaurants and grocery stores, cbc news reported in 2003. businesses in toronto's chinatown reported their customers dropping by 70 to 90 per cent.\n\ncarlos osorio / reuters pedestrians walk in the chinatown district of downtown toronto on jan. 28, 2020.\n\nbesides the economic hit, asian communities in canada faced racism at personal levels. the ontario government's post-sars commission found cases of chinese workers getting terminated from their jobs and chinese tenants unlawfully kicked out by landlords. funeral homes cancelled victims' funerals if they heard the body came from a hospital dealing with sars.\n\nye is worried that as the new virus makes its way through the information cycle, young kids will have to go through the same discrimination he went through.\n\nit doesn't help that ye has already seen an instance of blatant racism among people his own age. on a university facebook group he's a part of, someone posted a fake graphic insinuating that people in wuhan, china — where the outbreak reportedly started — are trying to rip masks off medical staff.\n\ni think this time around it's made so much worse by social media, where anyone can say anything they want, whether it's trying to take advantage of it for views and making these fake claims, or it's people like this who are spreading a racist message.\n\ncourtesy of frank ye frank ye is a graduate student at munk school of global affairs in toronto studying public policy. he endured sars-fuelled racism as a child.\n\nharris ali, a professor of sociology at york university who has written extensively about the social impact of the sars outbreak in toronto, said that social media is the factor that didn't exist then the same way it does now.\n\nat the time of the sars outbreak, cellphones and texting were still at a rudimentary phase. but now, social media has given people the ability to gather virtually — and it's helping to amplify existing prejudice.\n\nin ontario, thousands of parents in the york region signed a petition asking the school board to keep students whose family had visited china away from schools. the school's chair wrote back to parents, letting them know the request ran the risk of demonstrating bias and racism.\n\nthat sort of response, you didn't get it in the 2003 outbreak, said ali. the racism responses were more interpersonal and individualized — shunning on the street, hate messages on telephone answering machines, canadian-chinese community centres facing verbal abuse.\n\nwatch: coronavirus: the myths you shouldn't believe. story continues below.\n\nwhile those responses were unwarranted and irresponsible, ali says that the anonymity of the web means those responses can happen faster than ever.\n\nit has an enduring psychological impact, he said.\n\nali said that the obvious difference with the novel coronavirus outbreak is that things have improved technically — canada was prepared to handle the virus before it even came here, the technology is more advanced, and health officials were able to mobilize quicker.\n\nwhere the improvement has not occured is with the social impact of the disease — racism, stigmatization — those have kind of been left unaddressed, he said.\n\nin 2003, paranoia surrounding sars reached such heights that jean chrétien, prime minister at the time, went to a restaurant in chinatown and publicly ate soup, in an effort to ease fears.\n\nfred lum/ globe and mail/ the canadian press jean chrétien has tea with members of toronto's chinese community in response to sars fears which hurt chinese businesses, on apr. 10, 2003.\n\nit's a good gesture of solidarity, it's a good gesture against the racist presumption, said justin kong, executive director of the chinese canadian national council.\n\nregardless, people should not assume that just because you're going to a chinese restaurant or chinese mall, that means that somehow you're going to get infected.\n\nkong said when news of the novel virus hit canada, there was already an impending sense of fear in the chinese-canadian community that they'd experience what they went through with sars.\n\nit didn't take long before his fears were validated. for example, kong came across a tweet by ctv reporter peter akman that showed him posing beside his barber who was wearing a face mask.\n\nhopefully all i got today was a haircut, akman captioned the photo. he since apologized for the tweet.\n\nbut kong said the damage was already done.\n\nthat was just a regular person who was working, small-business owner, probably just gave this guy a haircut, he said. the only basis of that was because this person was chinese and that they were wearing a mask.\n\nas part of the national council, kong is working to help monitor misinformation about the disease and help keep the media on track. seeing a journalist from an established outlet engage in racism was not a good start.\n\ni think it's important that we don't racialize the issue, because while the virus did originate in china, anyone is susceptible to the virus.\n\nkong described the community paranoia among asian-canadians ⁠— the fear that racist attitudes toward them will come to the forefront ⁠— as a hallmark of every time a disease breaks out.\n\ni think it's important that we don't racialize the issue, because while the virus did originate in china, anyone is susceptible to the virus. - justin kong, executive director of the chinese canadian national council\n\nbut it's not unwarranted. ye is feeling the impact of it on his day-to-day life.\n\nit's just the worry that someone says something or looks at you some way and you feel it's because of this virus, or people are avoiding you because of who you are.\n\nafter bearing the brunt of the social and economic impact of sars in 2003, chinese-canadians were left to rebuild their lives by themselves. the asian canadian labour alliance noted in their post-sars report that though the government had put aside $150 million to help ontario recover from sars, not a single cent went to chinatown businesses or workers.\n\nkong thinks that, going forward, it's all about balancing a needed policy-based response and not producing unjustified hyper-fear. even within the community, he said, fears are fluctuating between oh, i'm so scared to this is no big deal.\n\nyou carry this burden where you worry about yourself, but you also worry about the well-being of your relatives who are in a worse situation than you are right now in canada, said ye.\n\ncole burston via getty images health officials during a press briefing on the coronavirus at queen's park on jan. 27, 2020, in toronto.\n\ncanada should start considering how to properly deal with the social impacts of outbreaks, ali said, especially given that with globalization, they're more likely.\n\nwhen i interviewed the guy who discovered sars, he said, 'you know what's different today? in the past you would have a disease outbreak in a village, and it was very limited because it used to burn itself out.'\n\namongst the vitriol against chinese communities in north america, some people like to point to sars and other diseases as proof that china is a hotbed of diseases.\n\nthat's nonsense, said ali. if you study infectious disease and their origins, they all have their origins in an animal reservoir. he said given the increasing rate of globalization, disease can come from livestock here as well.\n\nali says outbreaks are going to keep on happening, just because of the way we live.\n\ni'm not passing judgment on that at all, it's just sort of a natural thing.\n\nwith the likelihood that this will happen again, social and psychological factors of outbreaks should be considered as important as the technical issues — but they're not, ali said.
the sight of mcdonald's workers walking off the job in protest has been a public-relations nightmare for the company during the past three years. now a judge will determine whether the fast-food giant broke labor law as it tried to protect its image and quell the strikes.\n\nmcdonald's goes on trial at the national labor relations board in new york city on monday. the proceedings will set out to answer two fundamental questions: should mcdonald's be considered an employer alongside the franchisees who run its stores, and if so, did the company violate its employees' rights amid the mass protests?\n\nthe hearings are about much more than a few one-day strikes. in a sense, the very franchise model that mcdonald's and most other fast-food companies operate on will be on trial.\n\nmcdonald's sets the terms and conditions for its employees -- in this case we'll make that clear, gwynne wilcox, an attorney for the fast-food workers, said on a call with reporters thursday. the company dictates policy and practice. workers have been intimidated and threatened and even fired.\n\nwhile mcdonald's did not immediately comment on thursday, the company has told the huffington post in the past that it views the nlrb case as an overreach that strike[s] at the heart of the franchise system. mcdonald's denies that it broke the law.\n\nthe case is being brought by the nlrb's general counsel, on behalf of mcdonald's workers who are part of the union-backed fight for $15 movement. the workers claim they were retaliated against for their activism, which embarrassed the company and helped draw national attention to the plight of low-wage workers. the trial involves so-called unfair labor practice charges involving mcdonald's locations scattered around the country.\n\nit isn't often that a franchisor like mcdonald's is held accountable for labor law violations at its stores. roughly 90 percent of mcdonald's locations are technically run by franchisees -- the much smaller companies or individuals who tend to the day-to-day operations and ultimately sign workers' paychecks. according to mcdonald's, it's the franchisee who's responsible for the working conditions inside a mcdonald's store.\n\nthe fight for $15, which is funded by the service employees international union, has challenged that entire premise. it argues that mcdonald's really is the boss inside stores, exerting control over workers through the menu, the supplies and uniforms, the training materials, and even computer programs that determine labor costs. the franchise model, it says, merely helps the company shirk its duties to workers, by shifting legal liabilities onto franchisees when workers get shorted on pay or fired for union activism.\n\nif they succeed at trial and prove that mcdonald's has a significant hand in setting the working conditions, then mcdonald's could be punished for violating the workers' rights. the fast-food company would find itself answering to workers at franchised stores in a way it never had to before.\n\nthe general counsel's case has put the entire franchise industry on notice. the international franchise association, a trade lobby, has led a publicity blitz against the board, claiming it threatens businesses and entire industries if it deems companies like mcdonald's joint employers. republicans in congress have publicized their cause, holding hearings and pushing legislation that would block the board from moving forward with such cases.\n\nfor its own part, mcdonald's fought subpoenas from the board for records related to its business practices, forcing the nlrb to go to federal court. mcdonald's and its franchisees were eventually compelled to fork over the documents.\n\nin a call with reporters thursday, david dean, another lawyer for the fast-food workers, accused mcdonald's of intentionally delaying the trial and doing everything they can to drag out the proceedings.\n\nmcdonald's seems resolved to try this case in the dark if it can, dean said.\n\nalso on huffpost:\n\nphoto gallery mcdonald's secret menu
stevendelduca.ca ontario liberal leadership candidate steven del duca says his daughters, who are 8 and 12, motivate him to do something about climate change.\n\ntoronto — ontario businesses had spent $3 billion on permits to pollute under cap and trade when premier doug ford started dismantling the program, five days into his mandate. then, for about five months, ontario had no price on pollution, until the federal government's carbon tax came into effect.\n\nthis whipsaw effect is confusing for voters and businesses and sabotages climate action in the long run, says ontario liberal leadership contender steven del duca. that's why he says — if he wins the leadership convention and the next election — his government would collaborate on climate policy with opposition parties.\n\nthe progressive conservatives and ndp would have a hard time attacking and taking apart programs they helped develop, he said.\n\nwhen you're facing that kind of a threat, it shouldn't become a partisan political football. and that's what it's become, the former cabinet minister told huffpost canada.\n\nmark blinch/canadian press former ontario minister steven del duca stands with then-premier kathleen wynne at a climate announcement in toronto on june 8, 2016.\n\ndespite the fact that ontario's liberal party has no permanent leader and only six elected members, it has more support than ford's pcs, according to recent polls.\n\nthat means del duca, who's considered the front-runner to replace kathleen wynne, has a real shot at becoming premier in the 2022 election.\n\nhe gave huffpost an exclusive preview of his multi-party climate change plan.\n\nit includes seven measures:\n\ncreate a committee with at least one mpp from every party in the legislature to work on climate policy,\n\nbring back reimbursements for electric vehicle purchases,\n\nmatch federal funding to build infrastructure for electric vehicles like charging stations,\n\nplant 800 million trees in 10 years,\n\ngive a 50 per cent discount on fares to public transit riders on weekends, holidays and outside one-hour peaks on weekdays,\n\ngive $100 million a year to municipalities, businesses and farmers to build infrastructure that can stand up to extreme weather,\n\ndevelop a climate change curriculum for elementary and high school students.\n\nontario needs a policy that is real, tangible and produces positive results, he said.\n\nright now, all of those things are absent from the decisions that we see being made at queen's park by doug ford and his friends.\n\nit's been particularly horrible to see ford's government revoke liberal environmental policies because they haven't replaced them with anything significant, del duca said.\n\nford's government did introduce a climate plan in 2018, but ontario's auditor general says it'll likely fail to meet its targets. environment minister jeff yurek has since called the plan a draft.\n\nearlier: premier doug ford defends climate plan. story continues after video.\n\nontario's emissions have been falling since the mid-2000s, largely because the liberals phased out coal plants. wynne, who still sits in the legislature as an mpp, sometimes shouts, you're welcome, when pcs say ontario has cut its emissions.\n\nthe province needs to cut emissions from non-electricity sectors to meet future targets, according to a report by the environmental commissioner of ontario, an independent office that was cut by ford's government.\n\nmost of the measures in del duca's plan go after the largest source of ontario's emissions: transportation.\n\nthe transit discount, which would apply in any jurisdiction that has public transit, would take cars off the road, he said.\n\nthere will be a whole bunch of new riders who come into the system if they leave their car at home, which is really good news for climate change.\n\ndel duca says he would start implementing the plan within 100 days of winning office. three of its measures — funding for electric vehicle infrastructure, rebates for electric vehicles and discounts for public transit — would be introduced no later than the government's spring budget in 2023.\n\ndel duca couldn't project how many emissions his plan would cut, but said he'd align himself with the federal liberals' goal to make the country carbon neutral by 2050. and he hasn't worked out how much the plan would cost.\n\nthe bigger question for us as a province is: what are we prepared to do? what are we prepared to invest in order to make sure that my daughters and the millions of others like them ... actually have a sustainable future? he said.\n\nfrom that perspective, i think it's more important for us … to make these kinds of investments and get the job done.
by wayne karl\n\nspring has sprung, and while spring season is normally an occasion to celebrate, with days growing longer, weather getting warmer and real estate heading into busy season, everything feels a little different this year.\n\ncanada's real estate markets are dealing with myriad of issues. in the toronto area, it's an acute supply shortage, skyrocketing prices and a resulting affordability crisis.\n\nin b.c., a compositional shift towards softer sales and slowing price growth.\n\nin alberta, it's all about recovery, as the province and housing sectors claw their way out of two or three years of economic quagmire.\n\nother provinces are dealing with their own economic- and market-specific challenges and opportunities.\n\nin the resource-intensive provinces of saskatchewan, and newfoundland and labrador, sales activity is still running at lower levels and supply is elevated. this has resulted in weakened price trends for these provinces, according to the canadian real estate association (crea).\n\nin ontario's greater golden horseshoe (the gta, hamilton-burlington, oakville-milton, guelph, kitchener-waterloo, cambridge, brantford, the niagara region, barrie and nearby cottage country), the balance between supply and demand has become increasingly tight. this is expected to lead to continued double-digit price growth, resulting in further erosion in affordability and sales activity in the absence of a significant and sustained rise in new supply, crea says.\n\npressure on policy\n\nagainst this backdrop, add the delicate and often confusing issue of policy. in ontario, for example, the provincial government is facing hard lobbying from multiple sources -- chief among them the ontario home builders' association, ontario real estate association, and the building industry and land development association -- to, in short, make more land available on which to build lowrise homes. and to speed up the approvals process.\n\nthe canadian home builders' association (chba) is also growing more vocal. in early march, it released an in-depth analysis of key factors underlying housing market conditions. the housing supply deficit - not enough homes for families with young children, points to a significant and growing mismatch between housing demand and what the residential construction industry is able to supply, given planning and zoning patterns and lack of available serviced land. the report notes that if current trends continue, canada will see a shortfall of 300,000 family-oriented homes over the next decade.\n\nthere has been a lot of commentary around what's driving house prices in markets like vancouver and the gta, says chba ceo kevin lee. much of this overlooks the fundamental factors of supply and demand, and the increasing number of young families trying to achieve homeownership.\n\nforeign buyers\n\nin toronto, having seen how effective a foreign buyers' tax in vancouver has been to cooling a potentially overheating market there, the city is said to be considering taking similar action. something... anything might be better than to let double-digit price growth continue unchecked, proponents say.\n\nbut, critics argue, slapping a tax on foreign purchases is short-sighted and will do nothing to facilitate a long-term solution to increase the supply of new homes.\n\nif all of this wasn't complex enough, add the prospect of the national housing strategy. due out at some point this year, this federal initiative will attempt to address the varied and challenging issues, involving differing provincial and regional economies, housing markets and conditions, from affordable housing to rental markets to homeownership.\n\nbudget 2017\n\nuntil then, we were looking to the 2017 federal budget, tabled on march 22 to see what, if anything, ottawa would include to begin tackling some of these challenges. at the very least, it would have been reasonable to expect some modernization of the existing home buyers' plan to allow canadians impacted by sudden and significant life changes to buy a house without tax penalty. many thought such changes would be included in budget 2016, but none were forthcoming.\n\nbudget 2017, while making housing a priority by proposing to invest more than $11.2 billion over 11 years in a variety of initiatives, still comes up short on addressing affordability for first-time buyers.\n\nthe housing-related allocations in this budget are principally for affordable/social housing, so the key challenge of affordability for market-rate housing, and especially for first-time homebuyers, remains an issue, chba's lee told ypnexthome.\n\noriginally published on ypnexthome.ca\n\nfollow huffpost canada blogs on facebook
christian textbooks used in thousands of schools around the country teach that president barack obama helped spur destructive black lives matter protests, that the democrats' choice of 2016 nominee hillary clinton reflected their focus on identity politics, and that president donald trump is the fighter republicans want, a huffpost analysis has found.\n\nthe analysis, which focused on three popular textbooks from two major publishers of christian educational materials ― abeka and bju press ― looked at how the books teach the trump era of politics. we found that all three are characterized by a skewed version of history and a sense that the country is experiencing an urgent moral decline that can only be fixed by conservative christian policies. language used in the books overlaps with the rhetoric of christian nationalism, often with overtones of nativism, militarism and racism as well.\n\nscholars say textbooks like these, with their alternate versions of history and emphasis on christian national identity, represent one small part of the conditions that lead to events like last week's riot at the u.s. capitol, an episode that was permeated with the symbols of christian nationalism. before storming the capitol, some groups prayed in the name of jesus and asked for divine protection. they flew christian and jesus 2020 flags and pointed to trump's presidency as the will of god. the linkage between christian beliefs and the violent attack on congress has since pushed evangelical leaders to confront their own relationship with trump and their support for the rioters.\n\nthese textbooks made this brand of nationalism more mainstream, said kathleen wellman, a southern methodist university history professor who is working on a book about the two christian publishers. i'm struck by how coherent of a worldview [the textbooks] promote and how thoroughly it resonates in current culture.\n\nrepresentatives from bju press and abeka did not respond to inquiries about how many schools use their products. however, a 2017 huffpost investigation found that about one-third of christian schools participating in private school choice programs used a curriculum created by these two publishers or a similar company called accelerated christian education, amounting to around 2,400 schools. the number of schools using these company's products that do not participate in a voucher program likely amounts to thousands more. (voucher programs allow students to use taxpayer funds to attend private schools.)\n\na passage in a history textbook published by abeka.\n\nboth abeka and bju press have ties to christian colleges. abeka was launched in the 1970s by arlin and beka horton, who also founded pensacola christian college, a florida institution that outlaws dancing and other satanic practices, such as astrology. bju press is affiliated with the evangelical bob jones university in greenville, south carolina, which famously lost its tax-exempt status after banning interracial dating in the '80s, a policy it didn't reverse until 2000.\n\nwe unequivocally condemn any rhetoric that promotes illegal or violent behavior, amy yohe, managing editor of abeka publishing, told huffpost. one of abeka's core goals is to teach constructive citizenship through textbooks that accurately represent the facts of history, enabling students to learn from the life lessons it teaches, both positive and negative.\n\nbju press did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nhowever, scholars who study religion in america say that many of the ideas present in the publishers' textbooks overlap with rhetoric heard from the rioters last week. christian nationalists argue that the united states was founded as a christian nation and has a special covenant with god, meaning that its citizens must implement a particular vision for this country or they will fall out of favor with god. the textbooks parrot these ideas, said andrew whitehead, associate professor of sociology and director of the association of religion data archives at indiana university-purdue university indianapolis.\n\nas we see in these textbooks, they're afraid of outside forces or the u.s. won't be what it should be, said whitehead. there's always a particular prescription ― they have to be on god's good side. i think that's a big part of it.\n\npassages from the textbooks reflect an overarching worldview in which america is constantly moving away from a moral center, with christians on the front lines beating back the forces of immorality.\n\none passage in an 11th-grade u.s. history textbook from abeka states, although many false philosophies were popular in america before 2000, the new millennium heralded a dramatic acceptance of immoral ideology on a national scale. … three such philosophies are globalism, environmentalism, and postmodernism.\n\nbelieving religion — particularly christianity — to be divisive, globalists discourage its influence on public life, it continues.\n\nby parroting such conservative political views under the guise of christianity, the textbooks give those views more legitimacy, making it difficult to distinguish between fact and opinion. while all textbooks, including the secular, cherry-pick narratives and have their biases, these ones fuse a religious worldview with trumpian talking points using anti-media and anti-immigrant rhetoric.\n\nobviously it's too simplistic to say these textbooks are causing people to think something, but they play a unique role in giving visual credibility to these ideas by having them be in a very traditionally trustworthy artifact, said adam laats, professor of history and education at new york state's binghamton university. there's a sense that they couldn't put it in a schoolbook if it wasn't true.\n\nhuffpost's previous investigation of these textbooks found that they also dismiss evolution as junk science, characterize nelson mandela as a marxist agitator who helped drive south africa to radical affirmative action, and suggest that satan hatched the idea of modern psychology. many of the schools that use these books also ban lgbtq students and families, and the books repeatedly condemn homosexuality. at one point in an abeka textbook, slavery is described in purely economic terms, saying that slaves seemed to be better investments than indentured servants.\n\ni absolutely thought of these textbooks when watching what played out last week, wellman said. it's the anti-science culture, anti-elite, the identification of christianity with military culture.\n\nwin mcnamee/getty images trump supporters gather near the east front door of the u.s. capitol after groups breached the building's security on jan. 6, 2021.\n\nwhen discussing protests against the iraq war and president george w. bush's low approval rating at the time, the abeka 11th-grade u.s. history book points the finger at the media in part, saying that much of the war opposition in america was the media, supported by a large number of hollywood entertainers, and that spurred on by the media, many americans wanted a change from the policies of the previous eight years.\n\nwhen discussing president obama, the textbooks accuse him and his administration of stoking racial divisions. below is a passage from that abeka history book:\n\nmany americans' views about race relations had improved at the time that obama was inaugurated. unfortunately, americans' views of race relations declined after obama came into office. race riots in places such as ferguson, missouri, and baltimore, maryland, greatly escalated racial tensions and worsened strife between minorities and local police. president obama's attempts to resolve these problems often seemed to make the situation worse.\n\nthe books do not mention that such protests came in response to the deaths of unarmed black men, including michael brown and freddie gray jr., at the hands of police.\n\na high-school-level textbook from bju press also blames the black lives matter movement for racial discord. it says:\n\ndespite president obama's call for racial harmony, his eight-year term of office saw an intensification of racial discord. several controversial shootings of black men led to protests, some of which were violent and destructive with black communities bearing the brunt of most of the destruction. groups such as black lives matter sharpened the divide between police and citizens, and black and white, with divisive rhetoric. mixed messages from the obama administration, the department of justice in particular, seemed to increase the racial discord.\n\nthe textbook does not mention that those controversial shootings were at the hands of police officers or explain the societal changes black lives matter is trying to achieve with its supposedly divisive rhetoric. the book does not lay out for its teen readers what those mixed messages from the obama administration were.\n\nother targets of the textbooks include globalists, environmentalists and multiculturalists.\n\naccording to multiculturalists, advancing the achievements of western civilization was an act of hatred toward other cultures. they encouraged people to define themselves by race, sex, or sexual orientation rather than by the pillars of western civilization, such as nation, family, and god, reads the abeka american history textbook. however, many conservatives and christians within america have attempted to quell these philosophies and once again turn america into a united, moral nation.\n\nthe textbooks don't give a full-throated endorsement of trump, noting his crude remarks and previously liberal positions, but they ultimately represent him as someone on the side of christians who is fighting for their values. one description from the abeka textbook reads:\n\ncontrary to the high hopes that obama's presidency would bring the country together, americans were bitterly divided leading up to the election in 2016. the democratic party had become increasingly concerned with identity politics, which is the idea that a person's race, sex, and sexual orientation form the most important parts of their humanity and that politics should reflect that belief. republicans, meanwhile, believed that their politicians had been too compromising with the increasingly radical left and that they needed a political outsider who would not back down or compromise with the democrats. ... the republican party nominated real estate mogul and reality television star donald trump from new york, whose determination and bombastic mannerisms gave republicans the fighter they wanted. as a businessman, trump stated that he would 'take the brand of the united states and make it great again.' however, many conservatives were wary of trump because of his occasional vulgar speech, his past immoral behavior, and his public support of homosexual marriage; but some were persuaded by trump's choice for his running mate — indiana's conservative governor mike pence.\n\nevangelical christians were one of trump's most important voting blocks. though white evangelicals only represent about 15% of the electorate, they made up about 23% of the vote during the 2020 election, according to the associated press. about 8 in 10 white evangelical christians voted for trump last year.\n\na passage from an abeka high school history book.\n\nimages from the capitol riot felt more familiar than shocking to 28-year-old mel garman, who grew up attending evangelical christian schools.\n\nthere were the christian flags, like the ones she used to pledge allegiance to in school, waving alongside american flags. the rioters' rhetoric, focused around saving the country, defeating enemies and promoting the will of god, could have come straight out of one of her childhood classrooms, where she said she was taught a distorted version of history with nods to white christian supremacy. last week's insurrectionists could have been her classmates, her teachers, her pastors. she felt a wave of recognition as she watched the pictures on social media.\n\nover the course of my life i can see how what i was taught in christian schooling has impacted me, and the riots on jan. 6 played into it. that whole belief system revolves around the idea that you want the rest of the world to think like you, said garman, who is now a social worker. it's a 'the ends justify the means' type of thing.\n\nsince jan. 6, popular pro-trump evangelical leaders have felt driven to judge the rioters' actions, with some offering full-throttle condemnations and others issuing more temperate responses.\n\nthe secret service had to escort the vice president of the united states to safety out of the capitol building. gunshots were fired. tear gas was deployed in the capitol rotunda. people were killed. ... this was an assault on law. attacking the capitol was not patriotism; it was anarchy, said rev. john hagee of cornerstone church in san antonio during his sunday sermon, before going on to rally support for law enforcement, according to the associated press.\n\nmiles away in kentucky, brian gibson, pastor and founder of his church, blamed the riot on antifa agitators, a conspiracy theory for which there is no evidence.\n\nyou don't get 2 million people together without having some radicals in the crowd or some simple people in the crowd that you could lead anywhere, right? he said, also greatly exaggerating the size of the crowd that day.\n\nin other places, teachers in public schools that don't rely on christian textbooks are struggling to explain to their students the dynamics that allowed such violence to occur. in chicago, high school teacher raven althimer discussed the harsh realities of the insurrection with her students, who are black.\n\nthey think of when they had black lives matter over the summer, peacefully protesting, and were tear-gassed. people are literally storming the capitol and nothing is happening to them, althimer told huffpost. one of my students said, 'if 20 of us had done that, we all would have been dead.' i said, 'no, 20 of you wouldn't have even gotten that close.'

loujainhathloul fahad albutairi (left) is a popular saudi comedian. loujain hathloul (right) is a prominent women's rights activist in saudi arabia. both have been harassed by the saudi government.\n\na tv producer's twitter thread is going viral after he called on lawmakers to come to the aid of two well-known activist friends who have been arrested amid saudi arabia's ruthless crackdown on dissidents.\n\nkirk rudell, whose producing credits include american dad! and will & grace, drew attention to the plight of women's rights activist loujain hathloul and comedian fahad albutairi in a twitter thread wednesday. both were reportedly arrested last year, and hathloul remains in detention. albutairi's status was not immediately known.\n\nrudell called on the u.s.

twitter thread ― an excerpt of which is included below ― propelled her story back into the spotlight this week. his post follows the high-profile killing of saudi journalist jamal khashoggi, a columnist for the washington post who had criticized the country's royal family.\n\nrudell tweeted that he first met albutairi, dubbed the seinfeld of saudi arabia, and his then-wife hathloul a couple years ago during a recording session for fox's american dad! rudell is a co-executive producer and has written for the animated tv series. albutairi voiced a minor character in a 2017 episode of the show, according to imdb.\n\nhathloul, who rose to prominence for defying saudi arabia's ban on women drivers, and albutairi continued to keep in touch with rudell over the years, the tv writer said. but rudell wrote that his communication with them ceased after they were allegedly detained by saudi officials in march 2018.\n\nwhile jared kushner's buddy [saudi crown prince mohammed bin salman] was planning to murder khashoggi, he was also imprisoning many others, including fahad and loujain, rudell tweeted.\n\nrudell urged high-profile figures like trevor noah, host of comedy central's the daily show, as well as rep. adam schiff (d-calif.) and the newly democratic-led house of representatives, to focus on albutairi and hathloul.\n\nthey were just young, creative people, trying to make

has been arrested several times since then for protesting saudi arabia's male guardianship laws and ban on women drivers.\n\nmohammed bin salman became publicly associated with the government's decision to lift the ban by permitting women to apply for driver's licenses, which was announced just a few months after he gained new power by becoming crown prince in the summer of 2017.\n\nsome world leaders saw the move as a signal that the crown price would herald in a more progressive era for the middle eastern kingdom. but the infamous killing of khashoggi, which the cia concluded had been ordered by the crown prince, sent shockwaves through the region.\n\nhathloul and albutair were reportedly detained by the saudi government in march 2018. she was released, but ultimately detained again in may 2018, along with several other saudi women's rights activists.\n\nshe is being held in the country's notorious maximum-security dhahban prison, according to amnesty international. she has not been formally charged.\n\n[hathloul] appears to have been targeted as punishment for standing up for women's rights in saudi arabia, sara hashash, amnesty international's media manager for the middle east and north africa, told huffpost in a statement.\n\ninstead of detaining her for months without charge the saudi arabian authorities should release her and all other women human rights defenders detained in connection with their peaceful activism immediately and unconditionally, she added.\n\namnesty international reported in november 2018 that activists detained at dhahban prison had been subjected to torture and sexual harassment.\n\nalbutairi was reportedly arrested in march 2018 while working on an acting project in jordan. he was handcuffed, blindfolded and flown to saudi

had ended, though it's unclear why or when this happened.\n\nsome twitter users warned that rudell's decision to include screenshots of alleged conversations he had with hathloul could pose a risk to

jake paul/youtube jake paul posted the mystery brand-sponsored video i spent $5,000 on mystery boxes & you wont believe what i got... (insane) on his channel.\n\nyoutube's top influencers have cashed in on highly lucrative sponsorship deals to promote an online gambling company to their young fans, and youtube doesn't have a problem with it.\n\nin recent weeks, celebrity youtubers jake paul, bryan ricegum le and others have faced fierce backlash after uploading videos to their wildly popular channels featuring mysterybrand.net, a website that lets users pay for a chance to win a variety of prizes.\n\npeople who are 13 or older can sign up on mysterybrand.net to buy virtual mystery boxes, which range in price from $1.99 to more than $1,299.99, and are marketed to contain an item from brands including apple, ralph lauren, xbox, gucci, supreme, nike and rolex. after paying for a box, users can open it on-screen to reveal their prize, then either order the item for delivery or sell it back (typically at a much lower price than the cost of the box) to receive online credit and try again. they can also select prizes to create their own box with customized odds, which tend to be far more expensive. little information about mystery brand is publicly available, though the website states its terms and conditions are subject to polish laws.\n\nyou could get a pile of shit or you could get a rolls-royce, 21-year-old paul, youtube's second-highest-paid star, told his 17.7 million subscribers in a recent video sponsored by mystery brand. i want you guys to go to mysterybrand.net right now and play this game and tell me or tweet me or something if you guys win this, ok? urged paul, who said in 2018 that his youtube audience is primarily comprised of 8- to 16-year-old kids.\n\nmysterybrand.net top prizes listed on mysterybrand.net include a $173,691.36 louis vuitton trunk.\n\n'it's just a scam'\n\nmysterybrand.net, which is riddled with grammatical errors, quietly removed its top prizes ― including beach vacations, premium california real estate and luxury vehicles ― following a maelstrom of scam accusations on social media in the wake of paul and le's viral videos. its now-deleted photo of a $250 million most expensive los angeles realty mansion was actually an image of a $188 million bel air home, the daily beast and others reported. and until recently, mystery brand's prize list included a 2018 lamborghini centenarió ― only 40 of which have ever been produced (all prior to 2018). the same goes for its real car rolls-royce phantom 2018 ― no such car was made last year.\n\nafter people called the website out on twitter, it took down a section of its terms and conditions that stipulated it could refuse to issue prizes to users who don't claim them within one hour. angry reviews on reddit and mystery brand's facebook page claim some users received fake merchandise or never got their prize items at all. critics, including controversial swedish youtube influencer pewdiepie, who has stoked outrage over his anti-semitic videos in the past, have raised another issue: in their promotional posts, paul and le curiously won items of far higher value than unsponsored users did in their mystery brand videos. le quickly won an $11,000 chanel purse which, according to odds listed on mysterybrand.net, he had a less than 0.17 percent chance of doing.\n\nmystery brand is like gambling. it was very addictive. ian yael, 21, a youtuber and former mystery brand user\n\nian yael, a 21-year-old university student from mexico city, spent hundreds of dollars and opened nearly 20 boxes on mysterybrand.net before winning a $1,100 louis vuitton pocket knife and ordering it for delivery in mid-october. but three months later, the item has not even been processed for shipping, his account shows.\n\nmystery brand is like gambling. it was very addictive, yael said. but it's just a scam. in messages viewed by huffpost, he contacted the website several times to request an update or refund. a representative who goes by the name tim perk repeatedly assured yael, month after month, everything regarding your order is fine, and [it] should be coming soon!\n\nmysterybrand.net courtesy of ian yael ian yael ordered his mystery brand prize for delivery on oct. 14, as shown above. it still hasn't shipped.\n\nin the u.s., gambling is generally defined as paying to place a bet or wager to win a lottery or other prize, and is restricted for minors. the u.s. court of appeals for the fifth circuit has ruled that internet gambling on a game of chance is not prohibited by law, however the justice department maintains that all internet gambling by parties in the u.s. is illegal. within the european union, there is no broad policy on gambling regulation, so each member state enforces its own laws.\n\nperk claimed in an emailed statement to huffpost that the site isn't a scam and its service is not equatable to gambling because other companies sell packages with unknown contents, too.\n\nmystery brand is not much different from those projects, except for the fact that we make the whole process of buying and receiving items from a mystery box fast and transparent in real time, said perk. he added: sometimes, shipping may take up to a couple of weeks since we mostly use the [online marketplace] stockx platform for purchasing and delivering prizes.\n\nstockx was completely unaware of mysterybrand.net, a representative told the verge, adding that no formal partnership between the companies exists. digital marketplace g2a cut ties with the website last week amid the scam and gambling allegations.\n\nmarco and alvin/youtube mystery brand videos have gone viral on youtube.\n\nyoutube unbothered\n\nyael, who spends several hours per day on youtube, said he learned about mysterybrand.net from trending videos on marco and alvin, a popular youtube channel that has featured the website dozens of times since early october. the videos are supposedly unsponsored, but still profit from ad revenue through youtube's general monetization program.\n\nyoutube's community guidelines claim the google-owned company is constantly working to keep youtube free of spam, scams, and other deceptive practices that attempt to take advantage of the youtube community. but the video giant declined to answer why it allows monetized videos promoting a shady gambling website on channels geared to kids and teens.\n\ncreators should be transparent with their audiences if their content includes paid promotion of any kind, a google spokesperson told huffpost, without addressing specific questions about mystery brand videos.\n\nhuffpost confirmed that youtube's algorithm has promoted mystery brand videos, giving them traction and potentially increasing ad revenue for both google and the content creators. as the hosts of marco and alvin explained in a recent post, mystery box content helped them go viral and earn money: we were nothing before mystery brand. we were at 1,700 subscribers before we actually did our first mystery brand video, they said. through mystery brand's name we have been able to grow ... and actually start doing youtube for a living. they now have nearly 70,000 subscribers, and recently apologized for pushing a scam.\n\npaul and le respectively pulled in around 2 million and 2.6 million views on their promotional mystery brand youtube videos in one week. content creators can earn an estimated rate of up to $5 per 1,000 views on the platform from ads. after coming under fire, paul addressed the controversy in a pair of snarky tweets last week before reminding children not to gamble. le filmed a subsequent video acknowledging he was somewhat in the wrong for doing business with mystery brand, lamenting other youtubers had done the same in the past without major scrutiny, and complaining the ordeal had been blown out of proportion. neither paul nor le responded to huffpost's requests for comment.\n\nricegum/youtube bryan ricegum le posted the mystery brand-sponsored video how i got airpods for $4 on his channel.\n\n'imagine how much they offered me'\n\nyoutube stars have made big money directly through mystery brand sponsorship deals. daniel keemstar keem, a youtuber with 4.7 million subscribers, claimed he declined a $100,000 offer from a similar company to promote its service on his channel. le, who has 10.8 million subscribers, suggested mystery brand paid him well above that amount for his sponsored video.\n\napparently they only offered keemstar $100k. my [subscriber] numbers are higher, so imagine how much they offered me, le said in his apparent apology post, attempting to explain why he had agreed to do the promotion. the money was on the table and if i wanted the money i just had to open up a few supreme boxes and shoe boxes and boom, i get the money. so i'm like, 'yo, that sounds easy enough.'\n\nyeezy busta, a youtube influencer with 448,000 subscribers who asked not to use his real name for privacy reasons, confirmed to huffpost that perk from mystery brand offered him a sponsorship deal for tens of thousands of dollars in july. after doing some research into the website and deciding it was a scam, he turned it down.\n\nit was hard to say no to the money, but i felt like in my position it was better for me to save hundreds if not thousands of people from losing hundreds if not thousands of dollars, he said. it really hurts me to see so many kids losing their money. a hundred dollars to me or to other creators isn't a whole lot, but to these kids it might be their savings or their holiday money.\n\ncontent creators should do their due diligence and take responsibility for what they promote, he added. every youtube creator wants to influence their fans in a positive way, but sometimes a check can change people's minds.
hoptocopter via getty images even if oil demand and prices increase post-pandemic, many of the industry's lost jobs are unlikely to come back.\n\nevery time a politician talks about climate policy or a newspaper runs a big story on the transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy, the question of jobs comes up. for those who are opposed to the transition, the common criticism is that moving away from coal, oil and gas would leave hundreds of thousands of americans out of work. for those in favor, the question is how to train hundreds of thousands of oil and gas workers for different sorts of jobs.\n\nrarely do the talking points — or the debates that follow — get into the details of what's actually happening in the oil and gas labor market: that it's an industry already grappling with a dwindling talent pipeline and that a push toward automation was making tens of thousands of oil workers redundant even before the coronavirus pandemic wiped out more jobs.\n\nthe industry lost more than 100,000 jobs between march and august 2020, according to the bureau of labor statistics and consulting firm deloitte (so certainly not the worst-hit sector, but hard-hit nonetheless). even if oil demand and prices increase, not all of those jobs are likely to come back, said ken medlock, senior director of the center for energy studies at rice university's baker institute for public policy.\n\nthat's because it's not just the pandemic that's hurting the industry. other factors are cutting down the oil and gas workforce as well.\n\nfirst, as with most industries, there's automation, which has reduced the number of jobs available in the energy sector over the last several years. when oil prices crashed in 2014, the houston area shed some 86,000 oil and gas jobs and by 2019 had regained only 24,400 of those jobs. why? in large part because in the wake of the crash, oil companies became more efficient and began to embrace automation in a big way.\n\nthe automation trend has continued, medlock said. so when production grew again from 2017 to 2019, that growth didn't require a lot of additional labor input.\n\nthrow global trends toward electrification and clean energy into the mix and the job market wasn't looking that rosy for oil and gas even before the pandemic.\n\nif you're a 30-year-old graduating with an mba and you want to stay in houston and you want to be in energy, you're taking a very different look than you would have 10 years ago. jeff bishop, ceo of key capture energy\n\nand even if the job demand does rebound to any extent, between policy and economic shifts and dwindling social approval of the industry, oil companies may find themselves struggling to hire.\n\nas fossil fuels flag, all signs point to a strong future for renewable energy.\n\nlooking at global investments in the energy space, it's all going to wind, solar, batteries, evs [electrical vehicles]. it's not going into fossil fuels, said jeff bishop, ceo of the large-scale battery company key capture energy. fossil fuels aren't going away, don't get me wrong, especially not in texas. but if you're a 30-year-old graduating with an mba and you want to stay in houston and you want to be in energy, you're taking a very different look than you would have 10 years ago.\n\nlast week — a century ago by 2021 standards — social media lit up with various opinions about a new york times story that highlighted the waning fortunes of new college graduates looking to work in the oil and gas industry. some sympathized with young people graduating into a pandemic, but most wondered why they had chosen to work in the industry in the first place, given what we know about both its impact on climate change and its financial prospects in years to come.\n\nbut actually, bishop and medlock believe the changing energy landscape is not such a big problem for the sorts of white-collar workers profiled by the times, whose skills are largely transferable to any segment of the energy sector. in fact, according to bishop, it's a boon to clean energy startups like his to be able to hire oil and gas workers.\n\ni can teach people power, but i can't teach people the process, procedures and mindset for these big energy projects, he said. just in texas alone, we're putting over $100 million of capital to work and we need a level of rigor around project management, safety and process that oil and gas companies are really good at.\n\nhis company specifically recruits current and former gas employees and recent grads who studied for oil and gas jobs.\n\npeople call houston the energy capital of the world, but houston is really an engineering and logistics capital, medlock said. those skillsets — managing a supply chain, handling materials, chemical engineering — that's all transferable.\n\nthis is not to say that there's a simple one-to-one transition from oil and gas jobs to clean energy jobs. the bureau of labor statistics still doesn't collect data on solar and wind jobs, so the stats that exist are cobbled together, but there are indisputably fewer jobs in clean energy than currently exist in the fossil fuel industry. and while white-collar workers can hop around the energy sector, it's not as straightforward for the various blue-collar workers in oil and gas. welders can work just as easily on a wind farm as an oil rig, but the skills of other oil rig workers are pretty specific to drilling.\n\npaul darrow/reuters some job skills transfer easily between the fossil fuel and renewable energy sectors.\n\nthe idea of employing out-of-work oil hands to plug and remediate abandoned oil wells has been floated a few times in recent years as a transitional job for these blue-collar workers while the economy shifts away from fossil fuels. although oil companies are legally required to decommission out-of-use wells and drill sites, and return the land or sea to its pre-drilling condition, it's fairly common for companies to declare bankruptcy before these asset retirement obligations (aros) are fulfilled. consequently, there are now an estimated 1 to 3 million abandoned wells in the u.s. in need of remediation.\n\nsome pro-transition activists ― like theron horton, a strategist with the aro working group ― have suggested that oil workers could be hired by the federal or state governments to perform this work as they train for new jobs.\n\nthere's 10 years of steady jobs for these people, not boom and bust the way it has been in the oil fields, horton said. and it's work that their skillset and identity is aligned with. plus, it leaves them in situ — they don't have to move, their kids stay in the same schools. ten years is a long time to transition, so it's really common sense convergence here. it's also worker solidarity, for these people in the fields not to feel like they're abandoned by society.\n\nbut despite the number of such wells, others, like medlock, are not convinced that such an approach would put a large enough number of people back to work.\n\nmeanwhile, in the white-collar world, if oil prices do rebound, it's more likely that oil companies will be chasing graduates than the other way around. the fossil fuel industry has been worried for years about the lack of interest shown by younger generations in working for oil and gas companies. even a few years ago, young people saw careers in the industry as difficult, dangerous and harmful to society. between the 2014 crash and the pandemic, now it also seems financially unstable. so even as they lay off workers in the field, oil companies continue to recruit at universities to avoid creating a generation gap in their workforce, a problem the industry grappled with in the 1980s.\n\nunlike the '80s, oil companies these days are competing for workers with more stable and more popular industries, including clean energy.\n\nbishop said he's not worried that the people he's hired away from oil and gas will defect back to fossil fuels if prices hit $100 a barrel again.\n\npeople want stable, well-paying jobs that have purpose, he said, adding that he's regularly contacted by individuals who have an oil and gas education but are interested in his firm, especially folks coming out of business school. they know they're gonna be in energy, and they see the writing on the wall: you need to be in the energy transition now.\n\nhuffpost's work in progress series focuses on the impact of business on society and the environment and is funded by porticus. it is part of the this new world series.

dubai (reuters) — iranian president hassan rouhani urged the incoming u.s. administration on wednesday to return to a 2015 nuclear agreement and lift sanctions on tehran, while welcoming the end of tyrant president donald trump's era.\n\nu.s. president-elect joe biden, who takes office on wednesday, has said the united states will rejoin the pact, which includes restrictions on iran's nuclear work, if tehran resumes strict compliance.\n\nthe ball is in the u.s. court now. if washington returns to iran's 2015 nuclear deal, we will also fully respect our commitments under the pact, rouhani said in a televised cabinet meeting.\n\ntoday, we expect the incoming u.s. administration to return to the rule of law and commit themselves, and if they can, in the next four years, to remove all the black spots of the previous four years, he said.\n\ntensions have grown between tehran and washington since 2018, when trump quit the deal between iran and six world powers that sought to limit tehran's nuclear program and to prevent it developing atomic weapons. washington reimposed sanctions that have badly hit iran's economy.\n\niran, which denies ever seeking nuclear arms, retaliated to trump's maximum pressure policy by gradually breaching the accord. tehran has repeatedly said it can quickly reverse those violations if u.s. sanctions are removed.\n\nantony blinken, biden's choice for secretary of state, said on tuesday the united states would not take a quick decision on whether to rejoin the pact.\n\ntyrant trump's political career and his ominous reign are over today and his 'maximum pressure' policy on iran has completely failed, rouhani said. trump is dead but the nuclear deal is still alive.\n\nbiden appears to see a return to the deal as a prelude to wider talks on iran's nuclear work, its ballistic missiles and regional activities. but tehran has ruled out halting its missile programme or changing its regional policy.\n\nbiden's choice to lead the pentagon, retired army general lloyd austin, said on tuesday that iran posed a threat to american allies in the region and forces stationed in the middle east.\n\nthe united states and other western countries have turned our region to a powder keg, not iran, foreign minister mohammad javad zarif told state tv.\n\n(writing by parisa hafezi; editing by angus macswan)
ready your tractors and plows—the farm bill is upon us. this omnibus package of legislation, reauthorized every 5 to 7 years, shapes virtually every aspect of our food and agricultural system. yet this wide-ranging, $500 billion piece of legislation, which aims to ensure a safe and sufficient food supply for our nation, fails to take steps to guarantee that the food we produce actually makes it to our plates. congressional agriculture committees recently commenced hearings to begin preparation for the 2018 farm bill, which makes this the perfect time to discuss how the next farm bill can invest in solutions to reduce the nearly 40% of food that goes to waste in the u.s.\n\nreducing food waste offers a significant opportunity to impact the economy and environment. we spend $218 billion to produce, process, transport, and then dispose of 62.5 million tons of food each year. wasted food eats up 20% of our nation's freshwater, cropland, and fertilizer before ending up in the landfill, where it adds 113 million tons of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere annually. at the same time, one in seven americans are food insecure. much of the food we currently waste is still safe, edible, and nutritious, and redistributing just 30% of this food could feed every food insecure american.\n\nwith preparations for the 2018 farm bill already under way, now is the time to rethink the role the federal government can play in reducing food waste to protect people, preserve our planet, and provide economic benefits, while helping us value food as a resource. this week, the food law and policy clinic of harvard law school, in partnership with food policy action and refed, released opportunities to reduce food waste in the 2018 farm bill, which recommends policies congress can implement to tackle food waste in the next farm bill.\n\nthere are myriad opportunities to incorporate food waste into the farm bill, including many simple, easily implemented changes, like tweaks to statutory language, eligibility requirements, or grant selection processes that can allow many farm bill programs to address food waste. for example, the farm bill includes several grant programs to support distribution, processing, and marketing of food for sale. broadening eligibility language to include food recovery organizations and allow grant funding to support distribution of food that is donated but not sold can ensure less is wasted. for other programs, directing usda to preference applicants with a plan to donate surplus food, or who pledge to create such a plan, would provide a strong incentive for producers to take steps to donate more and reduce their waste.\n\ncongress can also enact new policies in the farm bill to address key drivers of food waste, such as clarifying and standardizing confusing best by and sell by date labels. currently, manufacturers have broad discretion over date labels and use a wide array of mystifying phrases that generally indicate a product's quality, not safety. misinterpretation of these labels by consumers, businesses, and even regulators (who in some states restrict the sale or donation of such safe, wholesome food) puts more food in landfills. the upcoming farm bill is the perfect opportunity to establish a system that limits date labeling language to two standard options, a quality date and a safety date, cutting down both consumer confusion and wasted food. industry groups are already on board—the food marketing institute and grocery manufacturers association recently announced a voluntary initiative to just use two standardized date labels: a standard best if used by for quality and use by for safety—and federal legislation can ensure this standard takes root nationally.\n\nthe 2018 farm bill can also build on state-level pilot programs. many states and localities have implemented policies limiting the amount of organic waste that businesses can send to landfills. in massachusetts, implementation of an organic waste ban achieved a five-fold increase in waste diversion, and created more than $175 million in economic activity and 500 jobs in just two years. measures like these have tremendous potential, but also require significant up-front investments to build waste diversion infrastructure. the farm bill could provide dedicated planning and implementation funding to support state governments that implement similar bans, making the wins seen in massachusetts replicable across the nation.\n\nin 2015, usda and epa announced the first-ever u.s. food waste reduction goal—a bold and aggressive goal of halving our food waste by 2030. if the federal government doesn't invest in food waste reduction, then we will fail to hit the mark. it is time for congress to tackle the issue of food waste in the u.s.; a farm bill that remains silent on the topic is a missed opportunity to break our food waste habit and achieve significant social, environmental, and economic benefits in return.
a cincinnati elementary school is under fire for reportedly limiting students' trips to the water fountain.\n\na sign, photographed hanging on the wall of carson elementary school, reads getting a drink by permission only. that means you must ask the teacher before going out into the hall for a drink. you will get one pass per week to get a drink of water; after that points will be deducted from your grade.\n\nthe school immediately drew criticism for the harsh policy — not only does it have the potential to leave students dehydrated, but it also punishes them for needing a drink. parents raised the alarm about the sign and made it clear that the policy was unreasonable. you're not going to fail my kid because he's thirsty and he wants a drink, one concerned parent said to a local news channel. if my kid's playing in the gym room and he's hot and sweaty and he asks for a drink and he goes to get a drink, are they going to deduct a point from him? asked another. a mother put it simply, i thought it was not right that they were depriving the children of having water.\n\nthe sign went public on tuesday, and as of wednesday, carson elementary has already removed it. the school district is calling the policy a misunderstanding. it released a statement apologizing and clarifying the issue: there was a sign posted at carson elementary intended to remind students when it is appropriate to ask to leave class for a water fountain break. the sign's directive was outside school policy, a result of a misunderstanding about the school's procedures. when school officials learned about this, the sign was removed. students are permitted to ask for permission to leave class for needed restroom or water breaks at no risk to their grades. the school district has since confirmed that students' grades will not be affected.\n\nconventional wisdom tells us to drink eight eight-ounce of water per day. according to the mayo clinic, the directive is easy to remember, and it's a reasonable goal. some people may need less than eight glasses per day. as they say, most healthy people can stay hydrated by drinking water and other fluids whenever they feel thirsty. that extends to students — and means way more than one trip a week to the water fountain.\n\nread more from yahoo lifestyle:
while politicians and policy-makers have made mouth noises about the amount of time spent on the big standardized test and the prep therefor, those elements only scratch the surface of how test-and-punish policy has messed with american schools.\n\nat various times in ed history we have talked about teacher-centered schools, community-centered schools and student-centered schools. what we have seen over the past decade is the rise of the test-centered school.\n\nin the test-centered school, regardless of what its mission or vision statement may say, test results are the guiding force.\n\nin the test-centered school, there are remediation courses, but these are not remedial courses in the classic sense of trying to help students who are behind in their comprehension of content. these are test prep courses, in which students' time and attention is devoted to practicing the skills of test-taking. perhaps the school uses a program package so that students can work independently on computers, drilling multiple choice responses to test-style questions, over and over and over and over and over, day after day after day after day after mind-numbing day, until the students have been taught that english and/or math (because these remedial courses are never required in non-tested departments) are miserable disciplines filled with nothing but drudgery and boredom.\n\nthese remediation courses will have two other side effects. first, they will fill up the student's schedule, so that students who have not done well enough on the test must take remediation 101 instead of shop or art or band or accounting. these will be the students whose strengths are not english and math, but they will not be able to fully pursue their strengths, but must instead spend their school day focusing on their weakness, their area of failure. if you have never spent your days being bad at something, you may not understand just how corrosive to the spirit it is.\n\nif you want to get a sense of how this is, just imagine switching the classes involved. sorry, pat, but no junior honors english class for you until you can finally play a decent b-flat scale on trumpet, said no school ever. sorry, mrs. bagswatter, but chris can't sign up for ap calculus until that physical fitness test is passed in pe.\n\nthe other side effect will be on what the school can offer. your english and math teachers will have to make room in their schedule for test prep 101, which means that they don't have time to teach any elective courses.\n\nin fact, running a test-centered school system doesn't just affect how time in school is used, but how the school is actually structured. middle schools in particular may feel the push in test-centered districts (though i had a hard time finding current research about middle school structure trends, and i've folded in anecdotal through-the-grapevine stuff here). one tradition of middle schools is for 7th and 8th grade, but that leaves the whole school ranking based on the results of eighth grade testing. so districts may feel test-based pressure to move sixth and even fifth graders under the middle school roof to help with school ratings, or shift to old school k-8 schools, sidestepping the middle school rating issue entirely.\n\nbottom line -- we have districts that are looking at structural changes based not on what's best for the students or even what works best with the available physical plants. they are looking at structural changes primarily based on what will have the best effect on their test-based accountability measures.\n\nin a test-based school, it comes down to the test scores and accountability measures. in pennsylvania, ap test results can count toward a school's ranking. many states are now moving toward using sat's as the bs test for high school ranking. consequently, where decisions about students taking college entrance exams might have been based on what the student needs (will the ap credit be any use to her at her chosen school? does he even intend to go to college?), they are now based on how the student's choice affects the school. this spring, somewhere in america, a high school principal is going to say, i don't care if the credit isn't going to be any use at pat's school in pat's program -- that kid's the strongest student we have in that department. you get pat in there to take that damn ap test, whether pat wants to or not.\n\nand that ultimately is the problem with test-centered schools; the relationship between the school and the student is turned upside down. instead of asking, how does this help us meet the educational needs of our students, the school asks, how will this affect our test scores? in a test-centered school, the school is not there to serve the students -- the students are there to meet the needs of the school. and no -- there isn't a scintilla of evidence that test prep serves student needs, nor that test results are an important indicator of their education.\n\nmaybe we offer bribes. maybe we restructure school. maybe we drill forever. maybe we make it clear that we will accept no excuses. it doesn't matter. the students are there to crank out the scores the school wants, and policies are measured by that metric -- will this get students to give us the scores we need from them? that's separated from the question of does this meet the students' educational needs by a chasm so large that you could lose the entire us education system in it.\n\nsure, much is riding on test-driven policies these days. but at some point administrators and leaders and parents and classroom teachers have to step up and stand for the needs of the students before all else. because if we aren't going to stand up for our students, what are we going to stand up for?\n\noriginally posted at curmudgucation
president-elect joe biden has unveiled an economic relief plan that would deliver $1,400 to most americans and invest in a national vaccination program — and also endorses a whole host of democratic policy priorities from increasing the minimum wage and expanding paid leave to extending unemployment benefits.\n\nbiden addressed the nation on the details of the plan, called the american rescue plan, on thursday night as he prepares to assume control of the federal government next week amid a still-raging pandemic throttling the country's health care system and economy. on average, the coronavirus has killed more than 3,000 americans a day over the past week, and unemployment claims nationwide are on the rise. nearly 1.2 million americans applied for unemployment benefits last week, according to the latest report from the department of labor.\n\nthe $1.9 trillion plan is designed to both immediately address those crises, while also delivering on longer-term democratic priorities.\n\nthere is real pain overwhelming the real economy, biden said. it's not hard to see that we are in the middle of a once-in-several-generations economic crisis within a once-in-several-generations public health crisis.\n\nthe 19-page outline sprawls from taxes to health care to workplace safety, and it's not clear which of its policies will remain top priorities when negotiations begin in earnest. some items, such as unemployment benefits, are already on the coming capitol hill agenda this year.\n\nthe plan, as currently designed, would likely need bipartisan support to pass congress. but democrats, who will soon have control of the senate majority, also have a legislative maneuver called budget reconciliation available to them, which will allow them to pass certain proposals with only a simple majority.\n\njim watson via getty images we are in the middle of a once-in-several-generations economic crisis within a once-in-several-generations public health crisis, president-elect joe biden said.\n\nbiden includes $1,400 direct payments in his proposal, which added to the $600 checks sent out with the last relief package would amount to the $2,000 he vowed to get out to americans.\n\nin its last covid-19 relief bill, congress extended federal unemployment benefits for gig workers and the long-term jobless only until april. biden's plan would extend benefits through september, and also boost the $300 per week federal supplement to $400.\n\nthat's a more modest increase than top congressional democrats are currently demanding. sen. ron wyden (d-ore.), who will be the chairman of the senate finance committee once democrats take control of the senate, and was instrumental in writing the original $600 unemployment insurance program in march, said he intends on pushing a return to that original benefit.\n\nthe new jobless claims are going to be especially important to senate democrats and it will really strengthen our case, wyden said thursday morning, citing new numbers released thursday showing 18 million americans claiming unemployment aid. the original four-month law actually reduced the poverty rate.\n\ntom williams via getty images senate democratic leader chuck schumer (d-n.y.), right, and sen. ron wyden, (d-ore.), will be instrumental to negotiations on this covid-19 relief and economic recovery package.\n\nthe unemployment provisions, along with the direct payments, have gotten some pushback from left-leaning lawmakers, who had understood biden's promise of $2,000 to be on top of the existing $600 congress approved last month, not including them.\n\n″$2,000 means $2,000. $2,000 does not mean $1,400, rep. alexandria ocasio-cortez (d-n.y.) told the washington post, additionally tweeting that she hoped the unemployment benefit would be retroactive to when the original program lapsed over the summer.\n\nsen. bernie sanders (i-vt.), who will soon be the chairman of the senate budget committee and was among the most vocal champions of the $2,000 checks, was more direct in his praise.\n\npresident-elect biden has put forth a very strong first installment of an emergency relief plan that will begin to provide desperately needed assistance to tens of millions of working families facing economic hardship during the pandemic, sanders said in the statement.\n\nthe plan also appears to omit a proposal favored by wyden and many democrats to tie benefits to the unemployment rate instead of setting an arbitrary cut-off deadline. biden supports the idea and it's mentioned as a possibility after the september cut-off, but a senior official said he is not prioritizing economic triggers for jobless benefits in the administration's first proposal.\n\nin a statement after the proposal's release, wyden said he looked forward to taking the lead on the proposal while reiterating his support for increasing the jobless benefit and making the program more responsive to the economy.\n\na core pillar of biden's proposal is boosting vaccination, through what he's calling a national vaccination program that will provide states and local governments with extra funding, above and beyond what last year's covid-19 relief bill offered. biden has said his goal is to administer 100 million doses in the first 100 days of his administration ― a pace that is higher than current levels, but still a lot lower than what is likely necessary to achieve herd immunity by summer.\n\nthe biden plan also calls for the federal government to launch community vaccination centers around the country and deploy mobile vaccination clinics to hard-to-reach areas, although the transition team has not specified whether the federal government will be creating and running those centers directly or whether it will simply be providing support to state and local governments, many of which have already launched some efforts along those lines.\n\nalso in the rescue proposal: a call to hire 100,000 public health workers, both to combat the pandemic and create jobs, as well as funding for schools to test and prepare classrooms for a return to in-person learning.\n\nbiden plans to deliver remarks on friday outlining his plan to speed up the vaccine rollout in more detail.\n\nthe vaccine rollout in the united states has been a dismal failure thus far, he said.\n\nmuch of biden's opening bid is an expansion of assistance already on the books and some new revenue streams for struggling public works. it includes an additional $30 billion in rental and utilities assistance, $5 billion for housing those at risk of homelessness, extensions of the eviction moratorium and the increased nutrition benefit, more than $150 billion in funding for schools and funding for struggling public transit systems, among other programs.\n\nthe incoming administration also wants to pass a slew of changes to low-income tax credits that democrats have sought in recent years, including an increase in refunds for parents from the child tax credit and a boost to the earned income tax credit for childless adults. but biden has apparently not embraced proposals to make the credits payable in advance, meaning the changes wouldn't benefit anyone until 2022, and would only boost refunds for one tax year.\n\nif parents received tax credits in advance ― as house speaker nancy pelosi (d-calif.) and ways and means chair richard neal (d-mass.) proposed last year ― the policy would resemble the kind of child benefit that is standard in other advanced countries, and it would probably put a huge dent in child poverty.\n\nthe proposal's $1.9 trillion price is significantly higher than anything republicans have been comfortable with in recent months, but biden has repeatedly argued deficit spending is necessary to combat the pandemic's damage. the proposal does not include any tax increases or revenue raisers to offset the cost of the aid.\n\nthe consensus from economists from everywhere from the fed to the imf to other top institutions is that at this very precarious moment in the crisis, the senior biden official said. the risk of doing too little at this moment is far greater than the risk of doing too much and therefore. the investments in this package will actually deliver real relief, prevent scarring, prevent human suffering and actually put us on a path to a stronger recovery, and a stronger and more stable fiscal position.\n\nthat said, democrats do have a lot of political considerations to take into account. many biden officials remember the political failures of the 2009 economic relief package, the american recovery and reinvestment act, a policy that economists maintain was economically sound, but republicans made so politically toxic that democrats lost control of the house just a year later.\n\nthat's a history that will likely define the initial negotiations as biden comes into office with slim majorities in both chambers of congress.\n\nunity is not a pie-in-the-sky dream, it is a practical step to getting things done, said biden, who has often insisted he will find common ground with republicans despite skepticism from other democrats.\n\ngop lawmakers were largely silent on the plan on thursday night — neither senate republican leader mitch mcconnell nor house minority leader kevin mccarthy released a statement — but the proposal drew praise from the traditionally republican-leaning u.s. chamber of commerce.\n\nwe applaud the president-elect's focus on vaccinations and on economic sectors and families that continue to suffer as the pandemic rages on, the group said.
during the partial government shutdown that started in december 2018 and became the longest in u.s. history, the fossil fuel-friendly trump administration plowed ahead with its energy dominance agenda. as about 800,000 federal workers went without paychecks, the interior department worked to boost oil and gas development in the alaskan arctic, processed fossil fuel drilling applications and permits, and even brought back dozens of furloughed employees to ensure offshore drilling activities continued.\n\nnow, amid a global coronavirus pandemic that has upended daily life and slashed oil prices, trump and his team have once again prioritized fossil fuel production.\n\nthe administration is considering bailing out the oil and gas industry, which has been hit hard by an overseas price war between saudi arabia and russia and a drop in global demand due to the coronavirus. that relief is expected to include the department of energy purchasing 77 million barrels of crude oil from u.s. producers, enough to fill the nation's emergency reserve to capacity, at a cost of $2.5 billion.\n\npresident trump says he has instructed the secretary of energy to buy large quantities of crude oil for strategic reserve during the coronavirus response https://t.co/fiamzraaku pic.twitter.com/fopp207miw — cbs news (@cbsnews) march 13, 2020\n\nthe interior department is also moving forward with fossil fuel lease sales, as the bureau of ocean energy management offered up a sweeping 78 million acres in the gulf of mexico for bidders on wednesday despite environmental groups' calls to halt the sales during the pandemic. john filostrat, a spokesman for the bureau, said the event was live-streamed with only a handful of boem workers, with bids submitted either by mail or in person at the bureau's new orleans office.\n\nwednesday's auction yielded about $93 million for just shy of 400,000 acres ― the lowest total for any u.s. offshore auction since 2016, according to reuters. twenty-two companies participated in the sale.\n\nthat amounts to roughly half the previous lease sale, which took place last august, and marked the first time since region-wide sales began in 2017 that total bidding failed to surpass $100 million. it's a sign that oil prices are too low for anyone but industry behemoths to make offers, said an analyst for energy consultancy wood mackenzie.\n\nwith the recent drop in oil price, it came as no surprise that the bidding dollar amount was significantly lower, said mfon usoro, a senior research analyst covering the gulf of mexico for wood mackenzie. we think more lease sales are still in the cards, but higher oil prices will be required for bid amounts to climb back to historical norms.\n\nindeed, the sale came the same day the price of oil plummeted to its lowest level in 18 years, with west texas intermediate, the primary u.s. benchmark for crude, falling to $22.90 per barrel on wednesday, a 15% plunge and the cheapest price since 2002. brent crude, the global gauge for oil prices, dropped 9% to $26.16 per barrel. at those prices, it's nearly impossible for many u.s. fracking companies, responsible for the majority of the country's oil production, according to the energy information administration, to pay back steep debts, prompting the trump administration to consider measures to bail out drillers.\n\nbut analysts told huffpost last week to expect a wave of bankruptcies of smaller producers that could lead to consolidation within the industry as oil majors, the companies that almost exclusively had the capital to bid in wednesday's auction, buy up troubled rivals.\n\ndavid mcnew via getty images pump jacks draw crude oil from the long beach oil field near signal hill, california.\n\nplunging prices and mergers aren't the only things that could cost big oil companies in the near term. almost immediately after wednesday's auction took place, the legal challenges began. earthjustice filed a lawsuit wednesday on behalf of several environmental groups asking a federal judge to block the gulf of mexico lease sale on the grounds that it violated the law by failing to fully analyze the risks new drilling posed to the public. brettny hardy, an attorney for earthjustice, called it the latest example of the administration putting profits before the health and safety of people and the planet.\n\nonshore, the bureau of land management is scheduled to hold oil and gas auctions this month in montana, colorado, wyoming and nevada.\n\nmost of blm's oil and gas lease sales are run entirely via an online platform (only alaska does in-person sales, and those are not scheduled until november), so no postponement is planned at this time, blm spokesman greg fuhs told e&e news on tuesday.\n\nkate kelly, public lands director at the left-leaning center for american progress, was among those who expressed outrage over the administration's actions. it's both tone-deaf and fleecing taxpayers to be holding lease sales during a public health crisis, she told huffpost.\n\nthe coalition to protect america's national parks, an organization representing current and former parks employees, also called on the department of the interior to halt oil and gas auctions, as well as public comment periods and major policy proposals.\n\nthere are huge implications and consequences surrounding proposed policy changes and lease sales, phil francis, the coalition's chair, said in a statement. these actions should be given full and deliberate consideration, not rushed through at a time when we should be focused on the health and safety of the american people.\n\nthe interior department did not immediately respond to huffpost's question about whether oil and gas operations have been identified as mission critical services. but in an email statement, an agency spokesperson said that the health and safety of the public and our employees is our highest priority.\n\nall doi actions, including lease sales, are being evaluated on a case-by-case basis and adjustments are being made to ensure we are allowing for proper public input, while protecting the health and safety of the public and our employees, the statement said.
the staff at the mandalay bay resort and casino in las vegas either interacted with mass shooter stephen paddock or entered his room at least 10 times before the night he killed 58 people at a music festival from his suite, a hotel representative has reportedly revealed. the day of the october attack, paddock had a room service delivery and a housekeeping call, the hotel said.\n\nit wasn't clear, however, if anyone entered paddock's room that day, or, if they did, what they saw.\n\nthe revelation was made by a hotel representative responding to questions from the las vegas review-journal concerning reports that paddock had hung a do not disturb sign on his door for three days as he prepared for his massacre. the hotel has come under fire for apparently failing to check on a guest who turned out to be a mass killer.\n\npaddock, 64, fired more than 1,100 rounds of ammunition on concertgoers at the route 91 harvest festival from the broken window of his 32nd-floor corner suite at mandalay bay on oct. 1. he then killed himself. he had an additional 4,000 rounds in his room along with an arsenal of weapons. it's not clear what his motive was.\n\na representative of mgm resorts, which owns mandalay bay, emailed the information on paddock interactions after the newspaper asked if changes were being considered to hotel policies on entering rooms without a guest's consent.\n\nmandalay bay staff, room service and housekeeping had contact with [stephen] paddock or entered his suite more than ten times over the course of his stay, including the three days leading up to october 1. as a result of these interactions, there was no need to conduct a welfare check on paddock, the representative said in an email friday.\n\nthere were numerous interactions with stephen paddock every day at the resort, including a room service delivery and a call with housekeeping on october 1, all of which were normal in nature.\n\nthe representative did not respond to further requests to elaborate on details of the interactions or what staff may have observed. the spokesperson said the do-not-disturb policy had not changed.\n\nall mgm resorts properties follow a health and welfare check operating procedure that stipulates a welfare check be performed after two consecutive days where a do not disturb sign has been displayed on the door and the guest has not interacted in person or by phone with housekeeping or other hotel staff over the same period, the representative said in a statement, fox tv reported. our staff reserves the right to enter the room if it is deemed appropriate to conduct a welfare check.\n\nafter criticism that mandalay bay apparently did not check on paddock's room for a period of time, disney world resorts changed its do not disturb sign to a room occupied sign and said rooms would be checked by staff at least once a day. a spokeswoman did not link the change to the vegas mass shooting but told the review-journal it did so for safety, security and guest experience.
the 116th congress is the most diverse in history, with incoming members expanding political representation on a number of fronts. for the first time, congress now includes muslim women, native american women, an openly bisexual senator and the youngest woman ever elected to serve in either chamber.\n\nyet despite that progress, congress is once again beginning a new session without a single member who openly identifies as atheist, according to a pew research center analysis of the latest cq roll call faith on the hill survey.\n\nthe questionnaire identified only one representative ― sen. kyrsten sinema (d-ariz.) ― who says she is religiously unaffiliated. sinema, who has taken issue with the atheist label in the past, has been the only openly unaffiliated member of congress since she was elected to the u.s. house in 2012. (she's also the first openly bisexual member of the u.s. senate).\n\nan additional 18 members of the 116th congress responded don't know or didn't list a religious faith on the latest questionnaire.\n\nthe survey underscores a longstanding lack of political representation among the growing ranks of americans who say they don't believe in god, are questioning the existence of a higher power, or simply don't subscribe to traditional organized religion.\n\nnearly one-quarter of u.s. adults now consider themselves to be religiously unaffiliated, compared to just 0.2 percent of congress, or 1 in 535 members, according to pew. meanwhile, more than 88 percent of congress identifies as christian ― including all but two republicans, both of whom are jewish ― compared to just 71 percent of the u.s. public. overall, the 116th congress is slightly more religiously diverse than the prior congress, according to pew.\n\nthis gap in representation has persisted as atheists, nontheists, agnostics and other so-called religious nones continue to battle for public acceptance following decades of social and political prejudice toward their views.\n\nalex edelman via getty images sen. kyrsten sinema (d-ariz.) participates in a ceremonial swearing-in on january 3, 2019. rather than use a traditional bible, she placed her hand on a book from the library of congress that contains the texts of the arizona and u.s. constitutions, a spokesperson said.\n\nthe simplest definition of an atheist is a person who doesn't believe in the existence of gods. ten percent of americans say they fit that description, according to a 2018 pew survey. in the current political climate, however, the word atheist can be more controversial, often used to hint that someone lacks a moral center or is openly hostile to organized religion.\n\namid that cultural backdrop, there have been no open atheists in congress since 2012, when then-rep. pete stark (d-calif.) lost his seat to a challenger. stark had already been in congress for over three decades when he publicly acknowledged his nonbeliever status in 2007. former rep. barney frank (d-mass.) also waited until after he'd retired to announce that he doesn't believe in god. no candidate has ever entered congress as an avowed atheist.\n\nthe absence of openly atheist representation in the highest ranks of government presents a problem for the religiously unaffiliated, said roy speckhardt, executive director of the american humanist association (aha), a nonprofit that promotes the philosophy that people can be good without a god.\n\nit's critically important to see ourselves reflected in those who represent us, said speckhardt. when that isn't the case, it's very much like a billboard for minorities who are underrepresented, whoever they are.\n\nbut speckhardt also called into question the accuracy of the latest faith on the hill survey. he noted that rep. jared huffman (d-calif.) has publicly questioned the existence of god and said he embraces the humanist label, which holds that one can lead meaningful, ethical lives capable of adding to the greater good of humanity without theism or other supernatural beliefs, according to the aha. rep. jamie raskin (d-md.), a member of the aha, has similarly identified as a humanist in the past, though he's distanced himself from the atheist label.\n\nhuffman appears to have responded don't know or otherwise refused to list a religious faith on the faith on the hill survey. but his office said the data was outdated, and confirmed that huffman identifies as a nonreligious humanist. raskin, meanwhile, is among the 34 members of congress who identify as jewish.\n\nthe washington post via getty images rep. jared huffman (d-calif.) has publicly questioned the existence of god and said he embraces the humanist label, but in a recent survey, he responded don't know or otherwise refused to list a religious faith.\n\nwhatever terms congressional representatives choose to identify their religious beliefs, it's clear that the stigma against atheism and lack of religious affiliation in politics is beginning to erode, said speckhardt.\n\nin 2018, huffman and raskin were among the founding members of the congressional freethought caucus. the group's mission, the founders wrote, is to promote sound public policy based on reason, science, and moral values, protect the secular character of our government, and champion the value of freedom of thought worldwide.\n\nin the years ahead, speckhardt said he hopes congress will make progress on initiatives of particular importance to nonbelievers, including measures to preserve the separation of church and state and protect the rights of nontheists abroad.\n\nthere will be no openly atheist torchbearer helping to lead that charge, at least for now. but it's only a matter of time before that changes, said speckhardt.\n\na recent poll commissioned by the aha suggested that in safely blue districts, a candidate's atheism is a nonissue, or even a plus, for a large portion of the electorate.\n\nwith some members of congress likely identifying as religious only to avoid the potential negative repercussions of saying they don't believe in god, the nonbeliever community must show that it will have the back of any politician who publicly embraces the atheist mantle, said speckhardt.\n\n[we have] to point out to them that we would much more appreciate their openness about their deeply held convictions, versus hiding them or lying about them, he said. their integrity and their alliance on issues matters to voters much more than whether they happen to believe in god or not.\n\nthis has been updated to include a response from rep. jared huffman's office

sean kilpatrick/the canadian press conservative mp michelle rempel garner speaks in ottawa on may 7, 2019.\n\ncanada is in crisis.\n\nso begins the buffalo declaration, a document released by conservative calgary nose hill mp michelle rempel garner thursday. the declaration is co-signed by three other alberta tories, and demands equality for the province under the constitution.\n\nbesides now getting to use the excellent pun of referring to these mps as the buffalo wing of the conservative party — and developing a hankering for blue cheese dressing along the way — this document reignited debate about western alienation, conversations that followed last fall's election after the ruling liberals didn't win a single seat in alberta or saskatchewan.\n\nit's also sparked a wave of critiques from albertans and other people across canada, arguing that the alienated westerners don't represent their views and legitimize dangerous separatist sentiments.\n\nwatch: alberta premier reacts to letter calling for ottawa to deny teck project. story continues below.\n\nbut what is this document and how seriously should you take it?\n\nhere are some answers to your buffalo declaration questions.\n\nwhat is the buffalo declaration?\n\nthe buffalo declaration is a 13-page document and accompanying webpage released on feb. 20 signed by four conservative members of parliament. it outlines concerns about alberta's role in the federal government and what the signees call a push for equality for the province. the authors definition of equality has a number of different pillars, from repealing carbon taxes to changing the size of parliament.\n\nthe declaration outlines the challenges faced by alberta and possible solutions. it contends that alberta is physically and economically isolated from canada's power structures.\n\nit's structurally quite similar to the 2001 firewall letter, written by future-prime minister stephen harper and other prominent albertans to then-premier ralph klein urging him to to fully exercise alberta's constitutional powers by creating a provincial police force and withdrawing from the canada pension plan.\n\nthe buffalo declaration, however, is targeted at justin trudeau's federal government rather than the provincial one. in fact, it is quite sympathetic to jason kenney's ucp government in alberta and how it's handled separatist sentiment.\n\nwe support premier jason kenney's initial efforts in this regard, as his government's fair deal panel explores the creation of a provincial revenue agency, withdrawing from the canada pension plan, establishing a provincial police force, and other measures, the report reads. but we must go further. much further.\n\nwe must go further. much further - the buffalo declaration\n\nthe much further in question seems to be demanding things that would require a rewriting of the constitution, such as shifting resource projects to be under the control of the provinces and rewriting equalization payments. as well, the document calls for repealing policies such as the carbon tax and enforcing rule of law on energy project protests.\n\nit even asks for trudeau to recognize alberta as culturally distinct from the rest of canada.\n\nthere's a lot going on there.\n\nthe document's proposing over a dozen structural and policy changes to how canada works. many would require referenda, and most would require the support of the federal conservative party before pushing trudeau on them.\n\nand that brings up that this document, notably, is targeted at the upcoming conservative leadership race.\n\nstory continues after video.\n\nany leadership contestant for the conservative party of canada who seeks the support of albertans should be prepared to address this declaration, the document reads.\n\nnotably, rempel garner — who's leading the charge on the declaration — has expressed interest in a run for federal party leadership in the past, but has not formally declared anything for the current race.\n\nwho is behind it?\n\nalberta currently has 33 conservative mps in the house of commons, but only four have signed this document.\n\nrempel garner is leading the charge on the declaration, but it is also co-signed by banff-airdrie mp blake richards, medicine hat-cardston-warner mp glen motz and peace river-westlock mp arnold viersen.\n\nalbertans are questioning if confederation is broken. they feel disconnected from, and disrespected by, the rest of canada, richards wrote in a facebook post.\n\nalberta is not, and never has been, an equal partner in confederation. the people of my province are suffering and need real, structural change. a line in the sand must be drawn. here it is. https://t.co/hc4z5cyn4n — michelle rempel garner (@michellerempel) february 20, 2020\n\nmotz was in transit friday and unable to return huffpost canada's request.\n\na representative from viersen's office deferred to rempel garner for all inquiries related to the declaration.\n\nthe offices of both rempel garner and richards did not respond to huffpost's request for comment.\n\nwhy is it called the buffalo declaration?\n\nahead of confederation, the area now covered by saskatchewan and alberta was proposed by the then-northwest territories premier as a possible large province called buffalo.\n\nthe federal government feared this would concentrate too much power in one province and grow to rival quebec and ontario, the authors argue, though there is little historic evidence proving this.\n\nnurphoto via getty images a herd of bison is seen in a field west of calgary.\n\nthe authors argue the name is meant to evoke the glory days of alberta before it starting being taken advantage of by the federal government.\n\nbut aren't bison a tricky subject on the prairies?\n\nyou bet.\n\nwhen the first european settlers arrived in north america, as many as 60 million bison inhabited the continent's grasslands, according to the u.s. fish and wildlife service. and yes, bison are different than buffalo. scientifically speaking, buffalo actually refers to animals like water buffalo in africa. bison refers to the big brown woolly folks the buffalo declaration used as their logo.\n\nplains bison were almost wiped out entirely in the late 1800s by over hunting, largely the result of colonial settlers on the prairies. bison populations had remained steady for thousands of years previously and were incredibly important to indigenous communities.\n\nthey have made a comeback in recent times. 2018 was the first time bison roamed freely in alberta in 140 years.\n\nmany critics of the manifesto immediately pointed to the irony of using buffalo in its name.\n\nit takes one hell of a lot of nerve to name the #buffalodeclaration after an animal sacred to first nations, when most of their complaints stem from how canada keeps stopping them from rampantly screwing over aboriginal populations, and destroying the land. #abpoli #cdnpoli — jeff rybak🍁 (@jeffrybak) february 21, 2020\n\nhow dare a bunch of white settlers invoke the buffalo that their ancestors deliberately genocided to deprive indigenous ppls of self-sufficiency, as a declaration of a need to separate. fuck you colonizer scum. — âpihtawikosisân (@apihtawikosisan) february 21, 2020\n\nwait, all this talk of western alienation sounds a lot like wexit?\n\nit sort of is! the issues and concerns outlined are very similar to those put forward by the folks behind wexit, aka the separatist movement.\n\nthose folks want alberta — and sometimes other western provinces — to leave canada to a certain degree. some want to form a new country, others propose joining the united states while others just want alberta to start governing more of itself a la quebec.\n\nseparatists have been specifically dismayed about equalization payments, where federal funds are transferred between wealthy and less wealthy provinces to help ensure reasonably comparable health care, education and welfare in all regions. opponents of equalization say alberta pays an unfairly large share, and argue that it should be allowed to keep all of its oil revenue.\n\non this, the buffalo declaration and wexit agree. they also agree on what both sides call an unfair treatment from ontario in specific.\n\nand while the buffalo declaration claims to be about the west wanting in as opposed to wanting out, they document does work to legitimize alberta separatism.\n\nstructural, constitutional change must happen within confederation or a referendum on alberta's independence is an inevitability, the declaration reads. it is not our job to explain alberta's value, it is now up to canada to show they understand alberta and our value to confederation.\n\none way or another, albertans will have equality. - the buffalo declaration\n\nthe document even ends with a bit of a threat.\n\none way or another, albertans will have equality.\n\nit's important to note the struggles that have plagued alberta separatists for decades, including an unsavoury connection to alt-right and white nationalist movements in the province. parties have struggled to gain footholds campaigning on these alienation-inspired ideas\n\nthe most recent separatist group, wexit, has largely faded from public consciousness in the past few months as it struggled to reconcile its more radical members with actual political process.\n\nhow many albertans actually want this?\n\nthat's the big kicker here. only four tory mps are actually signed on to this declaration.\n\nif we're talking about alienation and separatist sentiments, according to two different polls in the months following the 2019 election, — one from thinkhq and one by abacus data, less than 28 per cent of albertans surveyed actually support separatism.\n\nit's difficult to gauge support for the policies outlined in the buffalo declaration because, frankly, they have so many different goals, varying in scope.\n\nsupport for having trudeau acknowledge alberta as a distinct culture is likely vastly different than rewriting the constitution to give alberta more seats in parliament.\n\nwhat are the people saying about this?\n\nwhile there is little formal polling on it, the document's been heavily critiqued on social media, with people particularly drawing attention to its ideas around alberta's unique culture and the assertion that the province is treated like a colony, many calling the latter statement outright racist.\n\ni long for the day when #cdnpoli sees this for the racist ahistorical revisionism it is and sanctions politicians who try to trade in it accordingly https://t.co/vfjbguc2oo — melanee thomas (@melaneelthomas) february 20, 2020\n\nthanks to @michellerempel for defending albertas

illustrated by louisa cannell.\n\nengagement rings may no longer be required to cost three months' worth of income, but they are still pretty expensive. it might be the last thing on your mind when you got engaged, but just like any other forms of valuables, financial protection is called for in case something bad happens to it.\n\npeople often make the mistake in thinking that an engagement ring is automatically insured under a homeowners policy, says jerry ehrenwald, president and ceo of the international gemological institute. however, many policies only provide limited coverage, which could leave you footing the bill — or a big chunk of it — if you need to replace an expensive item. every couple should consider a insurance policy appropriate for their ring. read on for all the essential tips you need to know to get started.\n\npick a provider\n\ndetermine the type of coverage you actually need: most homeowners policy will only cover a maximum of $1,000 to $2,500 for personal jewelry, which might work if your ring cost was on the lower end of the spectrum. however, if your ring had a much higher value than that, the smart thing to do is to get an extension — also known as a rider — that specifically provides coverage for your ring. give your home insurance provider a call to figure out the personal property limit, and the type of rider available to you.\n\nget an appraisal\n\na receipt for your ring is required by the insurance provider, and you'll also need to get a jewelry appraisal to determine the real value of your ring. check your insurance company's guidelines to make sure that the type of appraisal you're paying for fits the requirements. the american gem society has an online directory for the appraisers in your area. expect to fork over $50 to $100 an hour for this service, based on an estimate listed on jewelers mutual.\n\nhow much it costs\n\nengagement ring insurance plans work on an annual basis, and according to investopedia, you'll be paying $1 to $2 for every $100 the ring is worth. the number fluctuates according to where you're based: you'll be expected to pay more for your coverage for places with higher theft rates.\n\nread the fine print\n\nas with all insurance policies, it's important to read the policies thoroughly and evaluate whether they fit your specific needs. some riders will cover accidental loss, while others won't account for other damage beyond theft or loss. another important answer to get on paper: what counts as sufficient proof that your ring is gone and will need to be replaced. if you want a more tailored plan for your piece of bling, consider going to a company that specialize in jewelry insurance, such as gemsafe.
rep. tulsi gabbard (d-hawaii) told cnn on friday that she definitely will seek the 2020 democratic nomination for president, ending months of speculation.\n\nher bid makes sense on its face: democrats swept the 2018 midterm elections with a crop of young candidates like gabbard, many of them with public service backgrounds and from historically underrepresented communities. (she is a military veteran and was the first hindu member of congress.) much of the party also associates her with the ongoing revolt against its establishment. in 2016, she surrendered a plum democratic national committee post so she could endorse sen. bernie sanders (i-vt.) and argue top democrats were unfairly helping former secretary of state hillary clinton secure the party's presidential nomination.\n\nprogressives are already welcoming the news: let them make their case and we'll find out who has the most compelling narrative, commentator cenk uygur said of gabbard's taking on left favorites sanders and sen. elizabeth warren (d-mass.), whose 2020 plans are already in motion.\n\nbut the mythos linking the congresswoman to the party's rising left wing collapses over the critical question of how to handle the world beyond america's shores. like sanders and warren, gabbard is acutely attuned to the left's frustration with endless wars. what she's offering, however, is a fatalist view starkly different from the optimistic global vision of progress they've been pushing into the national conversation.\n\non domestic matters, gabbard is in line with her counterparts: she supports a $15 minimum wage and single-payer health care, and she says democrats need to do more to resist money from corporations and billionaires. yet on foreign policy, she's gone rogue, tying the anti-intervention rhetoric adopted by nearly every democrat (and republicans like president donald trump) to embracing global leaders who flout international human rights standards and complain of persecution by american empire.\n\ngabbard's language is that of the old left, holding up the u.s. government as obsessed with unwisely projecting its influence, often for the sake of monied interests ― and, she asserts, in secretive risky ways ― while neglecting its own people at home. it's a mode that echoes the kind of anti-elite talk that trump built his campaign around while he lied about his past position on the invasion of iraq. (why have politicians of both parties gotten americans trapped in these far-away places?)\n\nand it connects seamlessly to another trump-style view: a deep skepticism of foreigners, particularly muslims. gabbard has voted to make it harder for refugees from iraq and syria to enter the u.s., courted indian prime minister narendra modi, despite his links to anti-muslim violence that killed hundreds, and spent years as a fox news darling for her willingness to claim president barack obama was making americans less safe by supporting arab rebels in syria and not using the phrase radical islam. (obama aides and many experts warn that language risks implying a problem inherent in a religion followed by 1.6 billion people; gabbard and trump argue the language is essential to explain the rise of groups like the islamic state.)\n\nwhat sanders and warren have tried to do, notably in a series of recent speeches, is offer a vision of a new left that addresses voters' deep skepticism of u.s. adventurism abroad without veering toward the idea that the world can't be fixed and that's just not americans' problem. they're rejecting too the old-school internationalism associated with clinton and many republicans — the idea that u.s.-led diplomacy combined with smart limited use of force is the key to world order. they have challenged the notion that it's essential to appear tough in the face of traditional adversaries like russia for the sake of american global standing. instead, they're talking about multilateral efforts to improve the lives of u.s. citizens as well as people abroad.\n\nthe sanders/warren narrative seeks to unite a global left against a status quo in which oligarchs with disproportionate political power are tied to the national security state and brutal military missteps — both in the u.s. and in rivals like russia and china. in that view, challenging the status quo of american foreign policy doesn't mean prioritizing dialogue with anyone no matter their track record, as gabbard did with brutal syrian dictator bashar assad ― it means reconsidering relationships with entire societies and trying to address their concerns in just ways, whether under anti-american regimes like assad's or u.s. partners like saudi arabia.\n\nthe fight is going on on the left of the party, and you have the two better-established candidates from the left of the party trying to define a new kind of internationalism, said heather hurlburt of the new america think tank.\n\ngabbard's views are more a left hard-realist direction, she added, referring to a school of national security thought that suggests it's a waste of time for the u.s. and others to try to prioritize principles like inalienable human rights in global affairs.\n\nthe fight is going on on the left of the party, and you have the two better-established candidates from the left of the party trying to define a new kind of internationalism. gabbard's views are more a left hard-realist direction. heather hurlburt of the new america think tank\n\nto hurlburt, a longtime follower of the debate over how democrats should talk about foreign policy, it's difficult to see who gabbard will appeal to.\n\nthere's a mass feeling across the public… that trump has walked away from what are perceived as american values, and that's gotten a huge reception both from people who were organized and active in politics and people who weren't, hurlburt said. she sees sanders and warren seeking to wed that concern to the issue they are best known for highlighting domestically, economic inequality.\n\nas the race takes shape, gabbard's rivals ― of whom there are likely to be many ― will know they can make political hay of her controversial views and over episodes like her visit to assad amid his devastating campaign against his own people.\n\nwhat's unclear is how those politically close to her will handle what will be an internecine battle. gabbard has developed deep roots in the party's left wing, working with the sanders institute, founded by the senator's wife, jane sanders, and frequently posturing as the democrats' leading antiwar voice when more mainstream members of the party succumb to militarism the party's base dislikes, as when they endorsed trump's strike against assad in 2017.\n\nthe quiet hope among backers of sanders and warren so far is that her campaign will ultimately fizzle out before things have to get ugly.\n\nbut that's far from assured, given that many of gabbard's supporters ― particularly in parts of the peace movement ― are fervent and have been hoping for this kind of announcement by her for years.\n\nthe left realists are present in a lot of places and are able to be spoilers quite effectively, hurlburt said. though their numbers are vanishingly small, they're loud and articulate, and they have a critique that can be very resonant when you look at some of the disasters going on around us.\n\nhow the contest evolves will determine how serious that fight gets ― and for now, it hasn't even officially begun.\n\nthere's no incentive for anyone to make any point out of attacking gabbard loudly and publicly unless she starts to get some traction, hurlburt said.\n\ncorrection: an earlier version of this story misidentified gabbard's role at the sanders institute.
stefani reynolds via getty images david frederick would run the office that represents the united states before the supreme court if he became joe biden's solicitor general.\n\non the campaign trail in 2019, joe biden said that fossil fuel executives should be held liable for climate change and those who refuse to take responsibility should be jailed. we should be able to sue oil and gas companies just like we did the drug companies, just like we did with the tobacco companies, he said in a february debate. and on his campaign website, biden pledged to strategically support ongoing plaintiff-driven climate litigation against polluters.\n\nnow just weeks away from inauguration, the president-elect is considering a corporate lawyer who has defended royal dutch shell against climate liability lawsuits to serve as solicitor general, the administration's top legal advocate who argues cases before the u.s. supreme court, according to two sources with knowledge of the process.\n\ndavid frederick, a partner at the washington, d.c.-based law firm kellogg, hansen, todd, figel & frederick, is considered a serious enough candidate for solicitor general that the group demand justice singled him out as someone it would oppose in a public letter last month.\n\nfrederick served as a clinton-era assistant to the solicitor general from 1996 to 2001 and appeared on the obama administration's short list for the top job in 2008.\n\nthe biden transition team, which is expected to announce its justice department picks sometime after tuesday's closely watched senate runoff elections in georgia, did not respond to questions about frederick's candidacy.\n\nthroughout his lengthy legal career, frederick, 59, has notched notable progressive victories at the nation's highest court, winning decisions in favor of tyson foods workers whose wages the meatpacking giant stiffed, against tobacco companies advertising light cigarettes as safer, and against a gas facility that british oil giant bp tried to build in delaware waters.\n\nbut some progressive advocates say frederick's recent work defending shell, in which he's argued that lawsuits trying to hold oil companies liable for climate change have no legal grounds, should be disqualifying.\n\nkellogg, hansen, todd, figel & frederick, pllc frederick, pictured here in his law firm website photo, is a widely known democratic litigator who has already argued more than 50 cases before the supreme court.\n\nsurely they can find an accomplished lawyer in this country that hasn't made millions going to bat for the fossil fuel industry, said jesse bragg, the media director at the boston-based anti-corruption group corporate accountability. experience in the energy industry is not a prerequisite for solicitor general, and there are plenty of people who have extensive careers that don't include defending oil companies.\n\nreached by email, frederick directed huffpost to his law firm. the firm declined to comment.\n\nthe equivalent of saying 'oh, murder is not illegal'\n\na flurry of litigation against oil giants began in 2015 after inside climate news and the los angeles times revealed that exxon mobil corp. had understood the science of global warming decades before the company started promoting misinformation denying that climate reality. three years later, the dutch publication de correspondent unearthed documents showing that even after shell's own scientists warned that emissions from burning oil were trapping heat in the atmosphere, the corporation's management team chose to emphasize the scientific uncertainties of global warming.\n\nfive states ― connecticut, delaware, massachusetts, minnesota and rhode island ― and a number of cities ― including new york, baltimore and oakland, california ― have filed lawsuits since then, making the case that some of the biggest oil companies operating in the u.s. broke the law by hiding the reality of climate change.\n\nthe industry had the science 30 years ago and knew what was going to happen but made no warning so that preemptive steps could have been taken, harold koh, a professor of international law at yale law school who served as legal adviser to then-secretary of state hillary clinton, told inside climate news. the taxpayers have been bearing the cost for what they should have been warned of 30 years ago. the companies are now being called to account for their conduct and the damages from that conduct.\n\nin court filings in california and rhode island last year, frederick argued that federal law prevents states from suing shell and other oil companies over climate change. he contended that federal law also provides no remedies for damage due to global warming and that shell could only face climate litigation in the netherlands, where it is headquartered.\n\nit's a very different exercise than defending a criminal defendant where the lawyer might say, 'sure, murder should be illegal, but my client didn't do it,' said marco simons, general counsel at the environmental legal nonprofit earthrights international. this is the equivalent of the lawyer starting out the case by saying, 'oh, murder is not illegal.'\n\nthe pushback highlights the legal challenges in prosecuting shell, a globe-spanning corporate empire valued at nearly $140 billion, for planetary harm on a scale that few, if any, lawmakers could have imagined when writing the environmental statutes currently on the books. two of the biggest cases against rival exxon mobil, for example, take a narrower approach, arguing that the company violated state laws in new york and massachusetts by not disclosing relevant information to investors and making deceptive advertising claims about the safety of burning fossil fuels.\n\naccused of selling 'his progressive bona fides'\n\nlawyers who have argued cases alongside frederick say his record shows that he's willing to take on the oil industry.\n\nwhile representing the state of delaware in the mid-2000s, he persuaded the supreme court to block bp's bid to build a liquefied natural gas facility in delaware waters on the grounds that it violated state laws protecting the coastline.\n\nhe worked tirelessly to protect the coastal zone act in delaware, which is one of our treasured environmental laws, said max walton, a partner at the wilmington, delaware-based law firm connolly gallagher who argued the case with frederick. i can't think of a human being who works harder and smarter and more fair than david frederick.\n\nthe washington post via getty images president-elect joe biden has vowed to make climate a top priority of his administration.\n\nin 2016, the supreme court ruled against exxon mobil in a case that frederick argued on behalf of the state of new hampshire, forcing the oil giant to pay a $236 million fine for contaminating groundwater.\n\ndavid frederick is the most capable, pro-consumer supreme court litigator in the country, and has demonstrated his ability over more than 50 supreme court arguments, todd webster, a former chief of staff to sen. chris coons (d-del.), told politico last month. he is literally the guy progressives turn to when their cases reach the supreme court, so that we win at that level.\n\nbut progressive critics say it's that record of winning smaller-scale victories against oil companies that made him appealing to a company like shell.\n\nwhat shell is purchasing in getting his time is a lawyer who is known to be a democrat who had some good clients, and that provides a positive sheen to their cause, said jeff hauser, director of the center for economic and policy research's revolving door project. frederick is selling to shell the fact that he is a progressive, and there ought to be consequences for his progressive bona fides when he does that.\n\nshell did not return a call requesting comment.\n\nat odds with the future vice president\n\nfrederick's arguments put him at odds with some of the top officials in the incoming biden administration. among those who signed legal briefs in favor of allowing oakland's case against five oil giants, including shell, to move forward in the california courts were vice president-elect kamala harris; biden's secretary of state pick, antony blinken; his future climate diplomat, john kerry; his choice for climate czar, gina mccarthy; and xavier becerra, the likely next secretary of health and human services.\n\nother potential names reportedly under consideration for solicitor general include sherrilyn ifill, director of the naacp legal and educational defense fund; david cole, national legal director of the american civil liberties union; and barbara underwood, new york state's solicitor general.\n\nthere's no lack for public interest and public service-experienced litigators, hauser said. we don't need to rotate between republican big law and democratic big law.\n\nkevin robillard
