1. making a lot of stupid rules. companies need to have rules—that's a given—but they don't have to be short sighted and lazy attempts at creating order. whether it's an overzealous attendance policy or taking employees' frequent flier miles, even a couple of unnecessary rules can drive people crazy. when good employees feel like big brother is watching, they'll find someplace else to work.
more recently, trump's interior department finalized a rule that permanently slashed protections for hundreds of species of migratory birds by legalizing all unintentional killings, including those caused by oil and gas infrastructure, power lines and wind turbines. and the epa completed a so-called science transparency rule that will block certain peer-reviewed scientific studies from the rule-making process.
in the last two years, the indignities of that deferred dream have impressed themselves on me with a vengeance. the miasmic swamp we now call our politics is not only the era of donald trump, whose treatment of women has always been abhorrent. it's the era of brett kavanaugh, with his blackout beers and the specter of sexual assault. it's an era of unrelenting assault on women's health care at home and abroad, with abortion protections hanging in the increasingly precarious balance of the supreme court. the near miss of the clinton loss is all the more painful in an era of the male grotesque.

new york, the birthplace of the nation's annual climate march, has plenty of its own pollution problems. for example, in queens, the city's largest borough, the ravenswood generating station has another two years under city law to keep burning 3,264,000 gallons of fuel oil each year, producing annual emissions equivalent to about 500,000 cars. the city is also of the world's top garbage producers, and its recycling services lag behind other major metropoles.

republicans generally favor reducing government spending and enrollment in safety net programs. but kicking people off benefits is unpopular, so it's politically easier to push reforms that sound bureaucratic and benign. the new policy's block grants, for instance, are an administrative maneuver masking a clear goal: reduced spending and fewer people getting benefits. in the 1990s, the republican congress and democratic president bill clinton converted cash welfare into block grants, resulting in significantly less aid being provided to low-income families.

the vermont senator's critiques of the democratic party are well documented, as cnn reported last july. throughout the 1980s and 1990s, he was adamant that a progressive movement could not be built within the party and was highly critical of the moderate new democrats who argued that the party's progressivism in the 1960s, 1970s and early 1980s had alienated voters.
in a sense, all revolutions are led by victims; the overturning of power necessitates the victory of those without it. and it is indeed revolutionary to set fire to the locker room (or boardroom, or situation room). but it's also important to remember that sexual victimhood has long been synonymous with women's public voices. indeed, it has mainly been all society will tolerate hearing. mary beard is not the first historian, but is certainly the latest and loudest to note that for millennia, when women speak to power it is to decry their own martyrdom to men's genitals, usually as a precursor to their own death. the rape of lucretia, for example, became a trope of european art, from shakespeare to titian to britten, because, as the ancient story goes, the daughter of a roman prefect denounced a monarchical prince named sextus — making nominal the conflation of sex and abusive power. he brutalized her before she took her own life.
if water scarcity troubles the capital, it's already and every day reality for indigenous peoples in chile. in the northern regions, the impact of mining and the lack of regulation of water markets have led to water scarcity and the contamination of watercourses in local communities.

for forty years until the turn of the millennium, business got used to commodity prices decreasing as growth surged. but this pattern then reversed dramatically, as the rise of urbanization intensified shortages of many resources while putting others such as water and soil under great stress. in recent years, prices have skyrocketed and crashed dramatically. prices for metals like copper, iron, tin and nickel, have nearly doubled between 2000 and 2015. the real price of oil in august 2015 was still 55 per cent higher than in august 2000.
people in this category respect sharif solely because they fear him. these are mainly the politicians, both from the government and the opposition. they want him to retire as soon as possible or at least suffice with an extension. they certainly do not want him to overthrow the democratic government and stage a coup, as seen at least on three occasions in pakistan's history. general sharif's recent movements, ranging from his trip to the united states soon after prime minister nawaz sharif's meeting with president obama in october 2015 to his latest visits to saudi arabia and iran have all alerted pakistan's democratic forces. in their views, general sharif has established a parallel government against that of prime minister nawaz sharif. given his tremendous popularity among the people and the unfinished war against the taliban, general sharif is unlikely to face public resistance should he decide to overthrow the elected government. in spite of the circumstances that profoundly favor him, general sharif's decision to retire without finding a pretext to extend his term or troubling the feeble democratic government, is laudable. this is good for pakistan's democratic institutions and his own legacy.

bolsonaro, whose presidency will begin with a new year's day inaugural ceremony in brasília, has routinely praised brazil's military dictatorship, which gave way to the return of democratic governance in 1985. and his rise to power shares many similarities with the military regime's: bolsonaro has seized on widespread discontent and fatigue with an incapable and corrupt political establishment, on fervid opposition to a leftist party that had spent more than a decade in power, on an economic collapse that brazil has only slowly begun to escape, and on rising levels of violent crime.

still, just because the ways and means chairman can ask the irs for a person's tax returns ― and the law says the treasury department is required to hand them over ― doesn't mean the trump administration will obey the law. a spokesperson for the department previously said any such request would be reviewed for legality, meaning democrats could be in for a court battle if they make their request. the possibility of a long legal fight may be another reason not to waste time now.

president donald trump is insisting that congress give him $5.7 billion to build a wall on the border with mexico, a proposition democrats describe as a costly and immoral boondoggle. with talks at a standstill in washington, the president headed to the border on thursday to make his case for the wall. he said he is considering declaring a national emergency to get the funding democrats have denied him, a maneuver all but certain to be challenged in court.
republicans have won every u.s. senate race in kansas since 1932, often by comfortable margins. roberts won a u.s. house seat representing western kansas in 1980 and was elected to the senate in 1996. but his seat was in play in 2014 as republicans sought to reclaim a senate majority, after opponents on both the right and left painted him as an out-of-touch washington insider.
president-elect joe biden is expected to give a speech thursday outlining his plan to speed vaccines to more people in the first part of his administration. his transition team has vowed to release as many vaccine doses as possible, rather than continuing the trump administration policy of holding back millions of doses to ensure there would be enough supply to allow those getting the first shot to get a second one.
local transit officials announced wednesday that 13 subway stations in washington will close this coming weekend until after jan. 20, with affected stations landing within a planned security perimeter set up for the inauguration. during the closures, trains will pass through the closed stations without stopping, according to the washington metropolitan area transit authority. more than two dozen bus routes will also be detoured around that perimeter starting friday.
and what exactly did grady flores do to warrant spending the next six months in jail? she photographed a peaceful protest outside hancock field air national guard base near syracuse, new york. the base is where the u.s. trains pilots to launch drone strikes in the middle east, particularly in afghanistan, pakistan and yemen. it wasn't a crime for her to be taking pictures of the demonstration, but when she briefly and unintentionally -- yes, unintentionally -- stepped onto a road that belongs to the base, she violated what authorities called an order of protection, which had been issued in 2012 to forbid protesters from approaching the home or workplace of col. earl evans, a commander of the 174th attack wing of the air national guard. she had never met evans, never threatened him, never showed any intention of harming him.
ford's name appears all over del duca's website: doug ford claimed the deficit was billions of dollars higher than it is so he could justify cuts to ohip+, hospitals and other health services … there's nothing that doug ford loves more than ripping up transit plans … doug ford brags he's done a lot for small businesses … the first thing doug ford tried to do was pave the greenbelt.
twitter added that trump's personal account would be locked for 12 hours following repeated and severe violations of its policies. future violations, it said, could result in the account's permanent suspension. shortly after that, it was reported facebook was blocking him for 24 hours. (instagram, which is owned by facebook, said it, too, would impose a 24-hour ban.)
for now, though, ocasio-cortez has proven able to parry the attacks, simply by holding up a mirror to the men who are convulsing in anxiety as she rises to influence.
plunging prices and mergers aren't the only things that could cost big oil companies in the near term. almost immediately after wednesday's auction took place, the legal challenges began. earthjustice filed a lawsuit wednesday on behalf of several environmental groups asking a federal judge to block the gulf of mexico lease sale on the grounds that it violated the law by failing to fully analyze the risks new drilling posed to the public. brettny hardy, an attorney for earthjustice, called it the latest example of the administration putting profits before the health and safety of people and the planet.

if the shutdown drags on, and landlords start going broke, it's possible they could try to justify evictions based on another part of the regulation. it says owners can evict tenants for business or economic reasons, such as sale of the property, renovation of the unit, or desire to lease the unit at a higher rental.
this absolutely doesn't mean you should stop shopping, but you should be cautious and follow simple protective measures like regularly washing your hands, not touching your nose and mouth if your hands aren't clean, staying home if you're sick, covering your mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing, keeping a distance of at least three feet from people who are coughing or sneezing, and seeing a doctor if you have a fever, cough and trouble breathing.
2015 saw a rise in the use of the term mindfulness to describe right action. here's one: this report shows how businesses around the world will spend $10 trillion on low carbon technology with the right policy framework.
that remained the dominant republican posture throughout obama's two terms, and when republicans in 2017 seized full control of both the presidency and congress, they didn't even bother trying bipartisanship. they went right to passing legislation through reconciliation, using it for their tax cut and their ultimately failed attempt to repeal the affordable care act.

my only real goal was to get dorsey to speak in specifics, about anything. in almost every interview he does, he'll lament his past mistakes and talk about his various high-minded visions for improving the platform: improving conversational health, reducing echo chambers, increasing transparency and about 10 other rote, buzzy phrases.
brazil's elites and its media, meanwhile, underestimated the strength of the anti-establishment surge taking place under their feet, or the dynamics allowing it to fester. over and over again throughout the last two years, brazilian political observers and journalists assured me not just that bolsonaro wouldn't win, but that he couldn't. when they didn't ignore him outright, they treated him as a sideshow; surely his worst, most provocative statements would be enough to convince brazilians he was too radical a reactionary.
although dallas' use of money bail is in some way unremarkable, it also employs some particularly egregious practices. after bail hearings, deputies have a unusually direct way of extracting cash from defendants who can afford bail.

so what does explain the vast differences between cities, states and countries in the severity of their covid-19 outbreaks? the answer is primarily public health policy: places with political leaders who instituted early lockdowns, strict mask orders and competent testing, tracing and quarantine regimes have passed through the pandemic relatively unscathed.
both flexibility and agility are subjective requirements and you may need to ask for clarity. sometimes they'll say they want you to be flexible, but it's more about compromise than it is about being flexible, watkins said. and when i say compromise, i mean you're always on the losing end of that compromise, meaning that you're going to do whatever they ask, because you're flexible.

following the great recession in 2012, england, for example, tripled tuition in one year to approximately $11,000 (9000 pounds). the intent was to offset steep declines in government funding. despite a significant outcry by students and other critics, these high tuition costs have stayed.

the justice department and election officials nationwide have stated repeatedly that there's no evidence widespread voter fraud occurred during the 2020 election, and yet trump has continued to falsely claim for months that the democrats rigged the process against him. he's been especially critical of mail-in voting, making unsubstantiated allegations of election fraud and whipping his base into a frenzy.

maybe we have seen the writing on the wall that trump is going to come back. so, this is the time that you appease so that trump 2.0 will be a little less aggressive on the trade front. i think that's a calculation that a lot of other countries also made when they gave the trump administration a renegotiated deal, especially china. why would china offer a phase 1 deal at the end of january, a minimal but a symbolic victory?
while it's true the economy has grown stronger since the great recession, improvements predate trump. much of the blue-collar wage growth he boasted about in his state of the union speech most likely results from state minimum wage increases rather than trump's policies. and in the first annual comprehensive review of trump's tax cuts and jobs act, the congressional research service reported that the legislation did not live up to its promises. according to the crs, the gross domestic product grew at 2.9%, which shows no significant boost to the economy given its positive trend before the bill passed.
a deranged mob of americans, fueled by lies about election fraud peddled by the president of the united states along with multiple senators and house members, sacked the u.s. capitol on wednesday as part of an insurrection encouraged by donald trump to stop the constitutional process allowing for the peaceful transfer of power taking place within the building.

years later, i find myself returning to organ pipe almost every week, but not as a park service employee. now i return with a bullhorn and media crews. in the past year, trump has dynamited sacred indigenous sites, butchered hundreds of ancient saguaro cactuses, and pulverized swaths of wildlife habitat to build the wall along the monument's southern border.
inslee is the second governor to sign the pledge, following newly elected minnesota gov. tim walz (d). california gov. gavin newsom (d), who was sworn in this week, took a similar pledge ― called oil money out ― but the oath was limited to the oil industry in the golden state. but inslee is the third likely contender for the next democratic presidential nomination to take the pledge, after sens. bernie sanders (i-vt.) and jeff merkley (d-ore.).

the sign went public on tuesday, and as of wednesday, carson elementary has already removed it. the school district is calling the policy a misunderstanding. it released a statement apologizing and clarifying the issue: there was a sign posted at carson elementary intended to remind students when it is appropriate to ask to leave class for a water fountain break. the sign's directive was outside school policy, a result of a misunderstanding about the school's procedures. when school officials learned about this, the sign was removed. students are permitted to ask for permission to leave class for needed restroom or water breaks at no risk to their grades. the school district has since confirmed that students' grades will not be affected.
atlanta (ap) — usually it's a president's first midterm election that reorders a white house's political approach and priorities. for president-elect joe biden, his most defining congressional election is coming before he takes office.
what we are seeing today is the fundamental fallacies of the employer-based health care, and the reason for that is that it is likely, over the two-month period, tens of millions of americans are going to lose their jobs and lose their health care as well, sanders told huffpost in a phone interview. the idea that we look at health care in america as an employee benefit is totally absurd.

the new management team is apparently being framed as part of a reorganization, according to harvard's nieman lab. since being hired in october, l.a. times editor-in-chief lewis d'vorkin has quietly brought on a number of editors from around the country. in addition to upbin, who had worked with d'vorkin at forbes, he hired former fox sports executive steve miller as an assistant managing editor for digital; louise story, a renowned former new york times reporter, as managing editor; the washington post's sylvester monroe as an assistant managing editor; and will tacy of good media as an editor.

his people have taken their cues: in the days before the election, bolsonaro supporters proudly destroyed memorials to franco in rio, and the symbols of american white nationalism ― including a flag of kekistan, the mythical country created and worshipped by alt-right fanboys in online forums ― began to show up at bolsonaro rallies. the night of the election, his supporters waved banners commemorating the former army colonel who carried out the military dictatorship's torture program.

to many brazilians who support bolsonaro, the chaos trump has sown and the threats to the tenets of american democracy he poses are nothing to worry about. the u.s. economy, after all, is doing well, and trump is, in their view, responsible. he's an outsider who came in and shook up the system, and the establishment just hasn't learned to cope with that yet.
i believe that people make mistakes and there's opportunities to change, and that needs to be recognized. so it's something that i'm passionate about, she said, the des moines register reported.

some democrats are supporting a bill that would provide backpay for people like howard who work under federal contracts and lost wages because of the shutdown. such a bill has not made it into law in the past. i hope that congress will step up to the plate and pass some kind of bill for the contractors who aren't getting anything, howard said.
so for truvada to make the greatest possible impact on hiv rates, its use as prevention would need to reach a critical mass among at-risk black msm. instead, prep has increasingly found its niche among white msm, a demographic that has already long benefited from a dropping hiv diagnosis rate, to the tune of an 18 percent decline between 2005 and 2014. during that time, diagnoses among black msm rose 22 percent, with an 87 percent surge among young black msm. (in promising news, however, the hiv rate among black msm, including youths, has leveled off in more recent years.)
inslee's plan is the most straightforward and most familiar, because he wants the state legislature to create something that progressives have wanted as part of the affordable care act all along. he's calling for the state to create a public option ― a stand-alone insurance plan, which a state agency would manage, available to people buying coverage on their own through the state's exchange, washington healthplanfinder.

in february 2020, the trump administration began bulldozing and blasting sites within organ pipe cactus national monument, a unesco biosphere reserve that is home to numerous endangered species, to make way for trump's wall along the u.s.-mexico border. the sites included cultural and burial sites sacred to the tohono o'odham and other native american tribes.
a core pillar of biden's proposal is boosting vaccination, through what he's calling a national vaccination program that will provide states and local governments with extra funding, above and beyond what last year's covid-19 relief bill offered. biden has said his goal is to administer 100 million doses in the first 100 days of his administration ― a pace that is higher than current levels, but still a lot lower than what is likely necessary to achieve herd immunity by summer.

in exchange for accepting less federal money, these states would gain new authorities to alter their medicaid programs without seeking further federal approval. depending on a state's specific plan, it could impose eligibility and benefit cuts, cost-sharing and other burdens on a subset of adult medicaid enrollees.
he will need nearly all democrats on board, however, in order to prevent republicans from clearing the chamber's 60-vote threshold to bring a measure to the floor.
under the trump policy, announced in january, a state facing increasing medicaid enrollment or higher spending on medical care for enrollees could choose to jettison people from the program or eliminate covered benefits. the alternative would be for the state to increase its own spending to maintain coverage and benefits, which would be significantly challenging because nearly all states must balance their budgets and can't turn to deficit spending. and given that this proposal is designed to appeal to republican state officials, tax increases to finance additional spending would be unlikely.

i just ... i don't think it's constructive. i'd rather hear constructive ideas on what we could fix. we get a lot of complaints. we get a lot of issues, and they're all coming from a good place of good intent. but we have to dig under and figure out what the patterns are that we need to prioritize and fix. because we can only do so much at once. so when somebody constantly tells me, delete the site, it's just not helpful. whereas other folks tell me, hey, you know if you do this one thing you would just have a massive impact.
on jan. 19, the newsroom voted overwhelmingly to unionize, 248 to 44, with the newsguild. given the turmoil in recent days, the union sent a note to members informing them of their so-called weingarten right to be accompanied by a union representative in any meeting with management in which discipline seems possible. after workers vote to unionize, a company generally has to keep the status quo in place as the parties bargain toward a contract, meaning that, legally speaking, it would be tough for the company to fire a bunch of newsroom staffers and give their work to new non-union workers.
on inauguration day, speaking from the steps of the capitol building, trump reaffirmed those allegiances and priorities: we are not merely transferring power from one administration to another, or from one party to another, but we are transferring power from washington d.c., and giving it back to you, the people.

moore said on friday that he was trembling with rage while watching the extraordinary scenes unfold at the capitol, partly because the rioters were displaying christian symbolism. photos and videos from the siege show one rioter holding a sign that reads, jesus saves. another person appears to have entered the capitol carrying a large white flag with a red cross on a blue canton, which is often called the christian flag.

he sent the cut over on a group email to which wilde responded that she would be happy to take a look and would submit her cut shortly, the hollywood reporter wrote. the response apparently did not sit well with labeouf who responded again by suggesting that the correct response would have been to write thank you and that 'we should go with this' in reference to the one he submitted. per a source who saw the email, he also wrote: 'great jazz musicians know when not to play.'
flat out denying access to shelter is never the answer, and exclusionary and dangerous policies that discriminate have no business being funded by the taxpayer, maril wrote in an email. (irs filings indicate the hope center has received some government grants in the past.)

how many albertans actually want this?
simply cutting pollution, however, won't be enough to restore faith in a politically divided imperial superpower that seesaws between one party that accepts climate science and another that has for nearly two decades now rejected it whole-cloth. under president barack obama, the u.s. pledged just $3 billion to the u.n.'s green climate fund, a pot of money meant to help poor countries adapt to climate change and leapfrog over the fossil fuel phase of economic development. he had delivered just $1.5 billion by the time trump took office and canceled all future payments.
some of the tweets in greene's thread now have twitter labels saying that this claim about election fraud is disputed and cannot be replied to, retweeted or liked due to a risk of violence.
i don't believe that voting rights should be forever stripped, and i don't believe restoration should be in the hands of a single person, she said. those who complete their sentences shouldn't have to wait for my say or any future governor's say before they get that dignity back, she added.

the article comes one day after the post reported that kushner is under investigation as part of the fbi's probe into whether trump's campaign team actively colluded with russian officials to try to sway the outcome of the 2016 presidential election.
an upcoming vote in the senate will determine whether states can help their residents prepare for a time that all workers should have the right to enjoy: retirement. while that seems like a goal congress should support, the house and senate already voted to block the department of labor (dol)'s rule allowing cities to establish their own retirement plans. now, they're looking to put state plans in jeopardy with a vote on s.j. res 32.
in comparison to other investments, an investment in pmi payoff ranks very high on default risk, because there is none, and on expected return. the drawback has been the complexity of the process, which has made it difficult to determine exactly what the rate of return is. eliminating this uncertainty is the reason we developed the spreadsheet.
california gov. gavin newsom (d) announced a statewide order requiring all 40 million californians to shelter in place and stay at home except for essential work and errands.
president donald trump's insistence on downplaying the coronavirus risks reached dangerous levels on monday as he scoffed at medical advice and proposed opening up the economy despite skyrocketing case numbers.
at the same time, power in congress has been centralized in leadership offices. this has made it almost impossible for lawmakers to work on legislation independently of leadership and get a vote on the floor. this centralization began in the 1980s under democratic speaker tip o'neill but accelerated under gingrich and his successor, speaker dennis hastert (r-ill.), who refused to bring any bills to the floor that did not have majority support within his own republican party caucus. this has meant any legislation that might have cross-partisan support but is not supported by leadership has no chance of getting a vote on the floor. this is how former speaker paul ryan (r-wis.) blocked the yemen war powers resolution, a bill to end u.s. support for the saudi war in yemen that had backing from republicans and democrats.

it's a phenomenon that may even have health and well-being payoffs. a number of studies have demonstrated the mood-boosting power of music, including a 2013 university of missouri study that showed listening to happy music (and trying to feel happy during it) might elevate mood.
the things i talked about in my coming out post in 2012 weren't false. the joy i felt was real! the love i felt was real, but something in me wanted to die, he wrote. it's the thing that wants to die in all of us when we don't have hope for attachment to a person we are oriented towards.

panic and confusion over a given program's status are the essential byproducts of a government shutdown. in 2011, for instance, the mere threat of a shutdown prompted a social services agency in washington, d.c., to warn more than 100 elderly residents that they would lose their next home-delivered meal. the shutdown ultimately didn't happen.

liberty counsel has spent years advocating against lgbtq rights, prioritizing the religious liberty of conservative christians over the civil rights of queer americans. the organization represented kim davis, the now-former kentucky county clerk who was jailed in 2015 after refusing to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples. staver, who served as her lawyer, painted her as an evangelical christian heroine, comparing her at one point to jewish people who were persecuted by the nazis.

about 73% of the ioc's income of $5.7 billion in the latest four-year olympic cycle (2013-2016) was from selling broadcast rights. the u.s. network nbc makes up at least half of the broadcast payments. another 18% of ioc income is from sponsorships.
meanwhile, california's formula for calculating the income limit making families eligible for subsidized child care and preschool has been falling over the last decade relative to the state's median income. as a result, families are disqualified for subsidized child care at a lower income than in the past. according to the california budget and policy center, that means a single mother of two would have to spend 70% of her income to cover the full cost of child care.

the council requested the ministry to lift curbs on both prepaid and postpaid connections, even offering an explanation in person if required by the ministry. the ministry didn't respond to the letter.
trump transformed the supreme court with three new justices, the most named by any president since ronald reagan. progressive judicial activist groups wasted no time in calling for liberal stephen breyer, the oldest supreme court justice at 82, to retire as soon as biden is inaugurated and make way for a younger progressive justice. democrats do not want another elderly justice dying at an inopportune time, as happened with the late justice ruth bader ginsburg. if breyer does step down, biden is expected to nominate the first black female justice, as he promised to do during his presidential campaign.
there are practical steps it can take now – for example, targeting financial support on local authorities with acute shortages of suitable housing, rather than those councils which are simply ready to spend – that would make a real difference to people's lives. the committee has called for the government to show more urgency in tackling homelessness and publish a cross-department strategy with clear targets.
the stakes couldn't be higher. the health and well-being of tens of thousands of the most marginalized members of society hang in the balance, as does the promise that black lives really do matter.
there, they had some significant outside help. a coalition of liberal groups and unions teamed up to spend tens of millions of dollars and make more than 10 million door knocks, and succeeded in contacting 93% of the 3.1 million voters targeted. the effort was led by blackpac (4.9 million door knocks), the labor union unite here (1.6 million) and the stacy abrams-founded new georgia project (1.3 million). another member of the coalition, the latinx advocacy group mijente, knocked on the door of every registered latino voter in georgia.
the sanders campaign's strategy of relying on younger and more independent voters, who typically show up less at the polls, carries risks. the number of registered democrats in iowa declined relative to this time in 2019, according to data released by the office of the iowa secretary of state. that means the campaign will have to recruit that many more people to register as democrats on the day of the caucus.

a truly feminist government would also fund the women, peace and security agenda. over the last decade, the issue of women, peace and security was largely neglected by the canadian government, despite canada's leading role in achieving united nations security council resolution 1325. reports on canada's national action plan were frequently late, and the agenda was underfunded. the scarcity of funds has been one of the key challenges of implementing the wps agenda at both the national and global level.

pence, who will preside over wednesday's congressional joint session, sidestepped trump's denials monday until a man yelled out that he must do the right thing on jan. 6. pence promised that we'll have our day in congress, though he offered no details about what that might mean. scores of republicans in congress have pledged to protest the electoral college count, but pence has no legal authority to override biden's win.

larry cohen, chairman of our revolution, the offshoot of vermont sen. bernie sanders' 2016 presidential bid, said progressives will press democrats in congress to use the budget reconciliation process to work around the senate's 60-vote filibuster threshold. cohen argued that tactic might be used to accomplish long-sought goals like ending tax subsidies to fossil fuel companies and enabling the centers for medicare & medicaid services to negotiate as a single customer with pharmaceutical companies.
tennessee's stakeholders agree with this approach. across the state, educators, teacher preparation programs and stakeholders, like the state collaborative on reforming education (score), have helped to build momentum for these changes. score's recent report, prepared for day one: improving the effectiveness of early-career teaching, uses current research to outline specific recommendations for the future of tennessee's educator preparation system. these recommendations align closely with commissioner mcqueen's vision and echo the goals laid out by state education leads in ccsso's task force report, our responsibility, our promise, which provided the foundation for our ntep work.

do a simple google search for asian women and you'd think we were on sale. i'm not condemning asian women for being sex positive, but the pervasiveness of unrealistic and hypersexualized images of asian women feed the stereotype that asian women are sexually available to western men. these images aren't just dehumanizing, they put us at risk for violence. as rachel kuo writes: these stereotypes leveraged against east asian women have been normalized, just like rape culture. these tropes can be found in representations in media, comments that harass us sexually and racially, and ways we're constructed via laws and policy.

meanwhile, advocates for agricultural workers may press democrats to halt a new trump rule that will drive down the minimum wage on farms. the outgoing administration has moved to phase out a survey that helps determine the base pay for agricultural guest workers; the new methodology will produce lower pay rates for poor migrant workers and slash farmers labor costs. the labor department finalized that rule in early november.
finally, newsom called for legislation that would open up medi-cal, the state's version of the medicaid program, to undocumented young adults. california already offers medi-cal to undocumented immigrants until they turn 19. this would push the eligibility age up to 26.

having established i wasn't a townie, the bartender proceeded to give me a third grade book report on randsburg. i learned that their chief export is the same as their average annual rainfall: no dice. i also learned that randsburg was originally a mining town in the 1800's. gold, silver, and something used for making batteries. i don't know if the mines are still operating, but in the same way you might not ask a waiter if he's been on any great auditions lately, i took one look around at the burnt out houses that dotted the village and decided not to ask, how's business?
the type of voter who takes advantage of early voting ― older, whiter, and wealthier ― is already likely to vote, and more likely to vote republican, the authors wrote in a blog post last year. our findings confirm that early voting on its own has a negative and statistically significant effect on democratic vote share in all three presidential elections we analyzed. the availability of early voting in isolation raises the republican vote by about six percentage points.
if we want to transition the global economy away from fossil fuels as fast as we need it to, we need china to be doing a lot of the heavy lifting because of how strong its new-energy production capacity is, werner said. the u.s. would be able to move a global green new deal diplomatically and would be able to line up financing for it in ways that would be complementary to what china brings to that project.

trump frequently talks about factory workers, and just this week he was in western pennsylvania pledging to fight for them. but in the past year he has delayed implementation of rules designed to protect workers from inhaling toxic substances, including beryllium (a major hazard for steelworkers) and silica dust (a major hazard in construction). the plan, once again, is to scale back the rules in ways that expose many more workers to the hazards.

i have two teen daughters whose figures make them look much older than they actually are (13 and 15 years old). during a holiday get-together, my father-in-law repeatedly made awkward comments around them, like, i hope your dad buys a shotgun for when boys come to the house. my girls were really uncomfortable, but my husband laughed it off as the kind of joke that every dad ― or grandfather, in this case ― makes when talking about teen daughters. but the girls didn't like it one bit, and neither did i. how do i talk to my husband and his dad about this so future holidays aren't so cringeworthy?
that said, having to ban an account has real and significant ramifications, he continued. while there are clear and obvious exceptions, i feel a ban is a failure of ours ultimately to promote healthy conversation. and a time for us to reflect on our operations and the environment around us.
biden has axed the so-called muslim ban or travel ban, one of trump's earliest policies from january 2017 that banned foreign nationals from seven muslim-majority countries from entry into the u.s. the supreme court upheld a very stripped-down version of it in 2018.

i think the other thing that pleasantly, i'm not going to say pleasantly surprised me, but which is good - we've got a very good cohesive team. it would be nice to have a lot more than 12 mps, but they are pretty harmonious and work together. they are very good and it has made my life a lot easier.
but this supreme court is far from normal. it has been a toady for far-right ideology and republican policies. while lower courts overruled trump's orders limiting migration from predominantly muslim countries as a patent violation of the first amendment's ban on religious discrimination, the supreme court upheld it by a 5-4 vote.

the women's agenda includes 10 policy issues, including racial and immigrant rights, and economic and environmental justice. board member linda sarsour said that the policies, compiled by a committee of women from various national and grassroots organizations, establishes a precedent for not only the new congress to work on, but sets a narrative for 2020. if you want to be my president and you don't have a position on the issues that are part of this woman's agenda, then don't knock on my door until you have an answer for these policies.
in contrast, latino americans ― and recent immigrants in particular ― appear to experience better health than non-hispanic white americans. this occurs despite lower education and income and reduced access to health care services. researchers call this the hispanic paradox (or latino paradox). the exact cause of this phenomenon is not yet well-understood, but some experts speculate healthier diet, strong family ties and lower smoking rates among latino americans may be contributing factors.
while the trump administration, industry groups and other project supporters touted the pipeline's potential to create thousands of new jobs, environmentalists and native american groups have long warned about its potential climate and other environmental impacts. the pipeline has already suffered a number of failures, including a nearly 400,000-gallon spill in north dakota in october 2019.
i just came from georgia. i lived there for a month during the senate runoff and i saw some of the most remarkable organizing. that, for me, is a reflection of what is possible over the next four years ― to push this administration to do the right thing. if you see even some of the policies that biden has already proposed and some of the first-day executive orders, one of them is repealing the muslim ban. that was a big campaign that came out of our movement.

(from left to right) rebekah mercer, robert mercer, stephen bannon when politicians take money from megadonors, there are strings attached. but with the reclusive duo who propelled trump into the white house, there's a fuse. last december, about a month before donald trump's inauguration, rebekah mercer arrived at stephen bannon's office in trump tower, wearing a cape over a fur-trimmed dress and her distinctive diamond-studded glasses. tall and imposing, rebekah, known to close friends as bekah, is the 43-year-old daughter of the reclusive billionaire robert mercer. if trump was an unexpected victor, the mercers were unexpected kingmakers. more established names in republican politics, such as the kochs and paul singer, had sat out the general election. but the mercers had committed millions of dollars to a campaign that often seemed beyond salvaging. that support partly explains how rebekah secured a spot on the executive committee of the trump transition team. she was the only megadonor to frequent bannon's sanctum, a characteristically bare-bones space containing little more than a whiteboard, a refrigerator and a conference table. unlike the other offices, it also had a curtain so no one could see what was happening inside.

i'd like to end the role of money in american democracy. but i certainly would not be willing to deny women the right to run for office until we had solved that problem. indeed, one hopes that more women candidates, knowing their own difficulty in the race for campaign funds, might be more sympathetic to campaign finance reform.

we're sorry for any degree that our existence, and the publicity of our supposedly successful marriage made you feel 'less than' as you made your own terribly difficult choices. and we're sorry if our story made it easier for people in your life to reject you and your difficult path as being wrong, the jan. 25 blog read. if this is you, we want you to know: you were right.
highlights of actions biden is taking wednesday:
but that doesn't fully explain the fervor with which conservatives hang on her every word, waiting for her to slip, and dig through her past for any feeble sign that she isn't who she says she is. there's an existential, panicked tinge to the behavior here ― what you might call aoc derangement syndrome. indeed, some experts say conservative men are obsessed with ocasio-cortez because they're threatened by her.
london (ap) — with daily coronavirus infections surging as a result of a new virus variant, the british government faced mounting pressure saturday from teachers' unions to keep schools in england closed for at least another two weeks.

the federal class action lawsuit, filed this week, details a callous pretrial process in which dallas county judges file rapidly through arrestees, assigning predetermined bail amounts based solely on the type of charge. as in many jurisdictions in texas and around the nation, when judges assign bail they don't ask whether individuals can afford to pay the money. they also don't consider other non-monetary conditions that might otherwise allow poorer defendants to be released while awaiting trial. this process leaves many people left to languish in jail, where they may end up losing jobs or shelter, getting stripped of access to public assistance or other support systems, or being separated from their families. although these defendants are still legally presumed innocent under the law, they are effectively punished long before any determination of guilt.

i'll pause here to acknowledge that, yes, i married a white guy. my husband loves me for all of who i am, inside and out. he has been a strong supporter of my identity journey. he is an incredible father to our kids. but he is indeed a white guy. like, scandinavian ancestors on both sides white. and our first son looks like a carbon copy of those ancestors. fair skin, blue eyes, stick-straight towhead blond hair.

most u.s. states ― oregon and washington being the notable exceptions ― don't require companies to pay employees for missing even a single hour of work when they take time off to bury a loved one, but some companies do it voluntarily. three days is the typical allotment for time off.

in the past decade, as the opioid overdose epidemic ravaged much of the rest of the country, san francisco and most of california seemed immune. fentanyl started showing up in california only in 2015, and its death toll was limited. appalachian and new england states were seeing fentanyl in 2011, and by 2013 it was killing people by the dozens in a single day.
flynn, who was pardoned by trump in november after pleading guilty to federal felonies, posted a video last year showing him taking a qanon oath. wild conspiracies peddled by the anonymous q include belief that an elite cabal of celebrities and democrats traffics children for sex and even sacrifices them in satanic rituals.

on tuesday, stricker was one of three kansans who testified in a closely watched federal lawsuit challenging the law. stricker and a handful of other kansas voters are the plaintiffs in the case and contend the law violates a federal requirement that state agencies can only ask people the minimum amount of information necessary to assess their eligibility to vote when they give them the opportunity to register. to justify the law, kansas officials have to prove that such a restrictive registration policy is justified by a substantial number of noncitizens on the voting rolls. in many ways, that is the same question at the heart of the national debate over voter fraud, which several studies have shown is not a widespread problem.

healthy democracy relies on mutual support for a basic set of rules, but in the aftermath of the 2014 presidential election, brazil's center-right establishment began to disregard the old consensus. the center-right social democratic party, or psdb, questioned the results of rousseff's narrow re-election that fall, giving oxygen to fringe social media conspiracy theories that the workers' party president had benefited from election fraud.
other southern baptist leaders have condemned the riot and have even criticized trump's role in inciting the chaos. but most haven't gone so far as to call on the president to resign.
the point is that stock traders don't respond to new information, they respond to each other. when they bid on stock prices, traders aren't stating their beliefs about the true value of a company, but making inferences about how to play the reactions of other traders, who, in turn, are doing the same thing. when corporate earnings come in unexpectedly high, traders expect the stock to go up and bid accordingly. it has very little to do with a company's long-term or even near-term prospects. it's just what people do.

after more than a century of inaction from congress, the senate unanimously approved legislation in december that would make lynching a federal hate crime.
all of this reached its apex with trump. starting with his days on the presidential campaign trail, where he suggested that saying if hillary clinton were elected president, second amendment people could do something about it, trump has stoked the idea that political disagreements should be settled by whoever has the most guns.
to counteract these attacks, warnock went up at the start of the runoff with a series of ads designed to portray him as an everyday georgian about to be slandered. one ad shows him walking a suburban neighborhood with his dog and ends with him comparing republican sen. kelly loeffler's incoming attack ads to, well, dog poop.

according to zachary warmbrodt, writing in politico in november, the fed registered strong concerns about using the resources of the federal reserve to finance fiscal spending. but former federal reserve chairman ben bernanke, who is now at the brookings institute, acknowledged in a blog post that the fed could operate with little or no capital. his objection was that it is not good optics or good precedent to raid an independent central bank. it doesn't look good.
republicans countered with their own massive ground game, with the national republican senatorial committee hiring 1,000 field organizers. while republican turnout in the runoff also was high, it lagged behind democrats in some crucial conservative areas. but gop operatives said trump's refusal to accept the election results limited their ability to portray the race as an essential check on democratic control of washington.

huffpost's previous investigation of these textbooks found that they also dismiss evolution as junk science, characterize nelson mandela as a marxist agitator who helped drive south africa to radical affirmative action, and suggest that satan hatched the idea of modern psychology. many of the schools that use these books also ban lgbtq students and families, and the books repeatedly condemn homosexuality. at one point in an abeka textbook, slavery is described in purely economic terms, saying that slaves seemed to be better investments than indentured servants.
the big question is how doctors, hospitals, drugmakers and all the other industries related to health care would react. some would figure out how to become more efficient or live with lower margins. some would react simply by reducing capacity, right at a moment when millions of newly insured people were seeking it.

perhaps most poignant among recent studies is one published in science last week, showing that shortfalls in girls' self-image regarding their intellectual aptitude begins as early as 6 years old. at age 5, children don't differentiate by gender who they predict will be really, really smart, but by age 6 a significant difference emerges among both boy and girl respondents, with both attributing the characteristic of being smart to boys/men more than girls/women. these aren't endogenous developments, of course, but rather are shaped by cultural attitudes from caregivers, family, and the media. a new york times article by the study's authors adds an illuminating example: in 2014, google searches for is my son a genius outnumbered searches for is my daughter a genius by two to one.

some of the trouble has been bipartisan ― plenty of states with democratic governors pursued premature reopenings over the summer and have struggled with testing and now vaccinations. some of it is the result of decades of economic non-policy that left the united states uniquely vulnerable to supply chain disruptions. but it is hard to imagine that biden could do worse than the trump administration's raving, dishonest incompetence.

while her early announcement betrays her embroiled position, it has already been an effective distraction. right before the holiday season, a seemingly unprovoked news cycle saw articles in several major outlets ― the new york times, gq, rolling stone and even the senator's longtime loyal hometown paper, the boston globe ― questioning or outright rejecting her viability as a candidate. the editorial board for the globe turned against the presidential hopeful, calling her a divisive figure and suggesting that after testing the election waters, she should stay on the beach.
we are living in particularly troubling times. we are facing serious humanitarian crises in yemen, south sudan, somalia, syria, the lake chad region and many other places. a few days ago we learned that united states president donald trump has instructed state department officials to find ways to cut contributions to the united nations by 50 per cent. this means serious cuts to peacekeeping, providing vaccines for children, monitoring rogue nuclear weapons programs and promoting peace talks from syria to yemen. the united states is the number one contributor to the united nations.

huffpost uk tech has launched huffpost-apocalypse, a project that aims to investigate what an apocalypse would mean for humanity, how we can best delay the end of the world, what the world will look like after we're gone and what the best viable options for survival will be for anyone left. join in the conversation with #huffpostapocalypse on twitter. to read more from the series, visit our dedicated page.
a critique of ubi from the left is that it would make businesses think they can lower wages and working standards, because their employees have more money to begin with. the right tends to argue that even if that's the case, it wouldn't matter because basic income receivers would now have more bargaining power since they could survive even if they have to leave a bad job and find another one.
but, critics argue, slapping a tax on foreign purchases is short-sighted and will do nothing to facilitate a long-term solution to increase the supply of new homes.
president donald trump said national guard troops are being activated to help new york, california and washington state respond to the coronavirus pandemic.
but even as the #metoo moment becomes a movement, employers are trying to stop individuals from obtaining the accountability and justice that so many are demanding.
we ask that you honor your pledge to support climate liability lawsuits by selecting a solicitor general who has demonstrated their commitment to fighting for people, not polluters. letter to biden team from more than 50 environmental groups
the company also did extensive work to help supporters pass brexit, prompting the observer to accuse the operation last year of hijacking democracy. it continues to carry out political, governmental and military investigations and campaigns around the world.
austin and biden could try to win over skeptics. the former general could publicly emphasize that he values civilian control of the armed forces and avoid using his military title, while the incoming president could be careful to avoid trump-style posturing with the military. and the choice has positive ramifications for other big concerns about the national security world, like the severe lack of diversity among high-level officials. austin would be the first-ever black chief of a diverse defense department whose leadership is almost totally white.
but to government employees, the effect is the same: workers who are willing to clock in are denied paychecks and many are barred from even venturing onto the job site, as a result of decisions made by management.
in an average week in the u.s., around 11 murder-suicides occur. the vast majority of murder-suicides — when a person kills someone else (or multiple people) and then themselves — occur within intimate partners or families. the perpetrator, usually a man with a gun, targets his spouse or girlfriend or other family member before taking his own life.
i absolutely think that is a decision the legislature should be making, said conservative rep. blake carpenter, a wichita-area republican.
fare states in the complaint as an organization dedicated to improving the lives of individuals with food allergies, fare's mission is directly impacted by american airlines' explicit and discriminatory policy of denying pre-boarding to individuals with food allergies.
vanessa wruble, a jewish activist and one of the initial organizers of the 2017 march, said that she was troubled, when working with the co-chairs, by anti-semitic comments, some of which echoed farrakhan. mallory and sarsour have publicly denied this.
despite the fact that ontario's liberal party has no permanent leader and only six elected members, it has more support than ford's pcs, according to recent polls.
this is uncharted territory, michael kane, executive director of the national alliance of hud tenants, told huffpost. he said the section 8 system will start to break down as the shutdown continues, and building owners will be forced to eventually shift costs to tenants.
saving seats is a long-standing practice and normally does not cause a problem of this magnitude for either party involved. but there is always the awkward feeling when some of your party are not there and you are trying to save them seats ― and those you have informed that you are saving seats angrily move to another area to sit.
there is an important counterpart to equilibrium theory: the ideal self or person that exists in such a self-calibrating system. in a providential framework, humans are expected -- at their best -- to show faith in the divine hand, to trust that god works all things together for good (romans 8:28). in the newer language of equilibrium, ideal market actors (those who avoid irrational exuberance) are called to trust in the self-regulation of the market. true disciples, the story goes, should show faith in the market's capacity to return to equilibrium.
and this trend exists outside of canada, too: american men are also less likely than women to heed coronavirus-related health warnings.
at a farewell address from his job as defense secretary, brown said, most satisfying of all is that for four years our nation remained at peace despite the world tensions and turmoil that constantly pose challenges to our interest and peace.
ocasio-cortez's first piece of legislation was the green new deal, social and economic reforms to address climate change and economic inequality, issues that are also core to the ndp platform. sanders, a u.s. senator, has made public health care a core part of his campaigning.
this week, trump and his team also quietly appointed anna seidman, a longtime lawyer at the trophy hunting advocacy group safari club international, to lead the u.s. fish and wildlife service's international affairs program, as huffpost reported friday. seidman repeatedly sued fws and other federal agencies during her 20 years at sci, an organization with more than 50,000 members that has close ties to the trump administration.
this is personal for me, sandberg said when making the announcement at the makers conference, a women's leadership event sponsored by aol, the parent company of the huffington post. i lost my husband very suddenly. facebook provided leave and flexibility, and now we're doing more.
for uninsured americans, the bill would cover any health care items and services that are medically necessary or appropriate to maintain a person's health, get a diagnosis, or go through rehabilitation, at medicare rates, which are substantially lower than what private insurers pay providers. in other words, this would not cover elective surgeries like a hip replacement during the pandemic, but would cover cancer treatment or an inhaler for asthma. many hospitals have stopped elective treatments during the pandemic as health care providers struggle to get the resources they need to address the surge in covid-19 cases.
we're in a position now to move on in a way that we haven't been until this moment, biden said.
the conviction that individuals have a right to violently resist the government simply if they don't like its policies became turbocharged in reaction to the election of barack obama, the country's first black president. it was common at protests against his signature policy achievement, the affordable care act, to see gadsden flags — a reference to the violent consequences of government overreach — and the protests often featured an armed contingent.
since the cold war, both the us and russia have kept 1800 warheads ready to launch within minutes as soon as a potential nuclear attack is detected. this nuclear hair trigger is intended to prevent a nuclear first strike by ensuring that weapons will be launched before they are themselves destroyed. but this policy has brought the world very close to a nuclear war several times in past years when equipment faults and innocent signals were thought to be nuclear attacks in progress and launches were only countermanded at the last minute. now, nuclear commanders warn this risk is even higher due to continued cyber-attacks. many argue that weapons should not be kept ready to fire at short notice as a nuclear response would always be possible.

announced shortly after rudd's apology, the policy for improving outcomes for indigenous australians is on track to hit just three of its seven targets.
this story has been updated with a statement from a dhs spokeswoman.
in the event your home is damaged by the extreme cold, you might be eligible for financial relief through your homeowner's policy.
as asian-americans, we have benefited from the work of black and brown activists who literally died so that we could reap the rewards of the civil rights movement. and unfortunately, while we have benefited from their work, those communities are consistently left behind. some would say this is incredibly unfair and as asian-americans, we owe it to them to not leave them behind. but hey! we're basically enabling white supremacy when we allow white power structures to view non-whiteness as pleasurable or interesting. we also allow them to control the consumption and appropriation of us! it's like we can bring all non-white people down by accepting this bs as a compliment! efficiency!
hoffman said there's no need to panic. however, health agencies must be ready, which is why investing in public health even between outbreaks is so vital.
the u.s.'s actions in iran have brought us closer to another disastrous war in the middle east, he said in a statement on twitter.

kirk rudell, whose producing credits include american dad! and will & grace, drew attention to the plight of women's rights activist loujain hathloul and comedian fahad albutairi in a twitter thread wednesday. both were reportedly arrested last year, and hathloul remains in detention. albutairi's status was not immediately known.
the central issue is not economic. it's that these platforms enable users to get lower cost services by bypassing laws, zoning, regulatory, insurance, taxation and safety requirements. such restrictions are there for good reason, notably those involving safety.
residents and opposition figures say the syrian government and its allies are deliberately harming civilians in a scorched earth policy to force rebels to surrender.
there have been reports of a dog in hong kong being quarantined after testing 'weak positive' for the virus, but who maintain on their website that there is no evidence that pets can be infected with novel coronavirus.
the movement took root locally, too. in 2019, city council lawmakers enacted a package of measures requiring landlords to slash climate pollution from the city's biggest buildings, making it easier to build solar panels and small turbines on rooftops, and establishing a new loan program for renewable energy. months later, new york state passed one of the ambitious climate laws in the country, mandating a carbon-neutral economy in less than 30 years.
she merely claims to have native ancestry, as do millions of others like her, said ruth hopkins, a dakota/lakota sioux writer and co-founder of last real indians, a news site focused on tribal issues. her claim is valid, and she and those like her have the ability to be powerful allies for native nations struggling to deal with real-life problems stemming from colonization, imposed poverty, treaty breaches, forced assimilation and attempted genocide.
at the time it made me feel excluded and made me feel invalid in who i was.
that constant deployment is taxing on response workers, as they're going nonstop 24/7 with little relief, said jeremy konyndyk, a senior policy fellow for the washington-based center for global development who led parts of the 2014 ebola response for the obama administration.
the plot is to create such mutual destruction that if successful ... will result in serious damage to society as a whole, said lee. that is why police action today is necessary.
sue becker, an attorney for kobach's office similarly pressed donna bucci, 59, about how difficult it would have been for her to prove she was a citizen. bucci, who was born in maryland, tried to register to vote in 2013, but her name was purged from the rolls because she didn't have a birth certificate or a passport and couldn't prove she was a citizen. becker asked bucci how difficult it would have been for her to call the secretary of state's office to explain her situation during a break at work.
the letter noted that campbell had one opportunity to send us any information that addresses our concerns, after which a review board would decide whether there is substantial evidence to question your test scores. if the board concluded the evidence showed irregularities, she would have the option of canceling her scores herself, retaking the test to prove her scores, or pursuing arbitration. instead, campbell found civil rights attorney ben crump, who has subsequently sent a letter to ets requesting that her scores be released within 14 days.
those crossing between formal border points do so because of the safe third country agreement, a deal prohibiting people from requesting asylum at land border offices.
yet brokering a cooperative peace between the u.s. and china will be key to any global decarbonization plan. abandoning plans to contain china's growth and instead working together could help quickly deploy clean energy and climate solutions worldwide, said jake werner, a china researcher at boston university's global development policy center. china's manufacturing capacity for clean energy products is unmatched and could be expanded, he said, while the u.s. controls the financial system and boasts an unrivaled network of formal alliances.
the number of families apprehended by border patrol while traveling through the el paso sector, which includes a part of the chihuahuan desert, has risen by more than 1,500 percent over the past year because of policies that dissuade immigrants from using legal ports of entry and an increased military presence at the border. advocates worry a border wall will only exacerbate the problem and lead to more health issues for children traveling through remote regions that lack access to medical services.
on monday, cuomo had suggested allowing young people to return to work sooner and testing people who have recovered to ensure they're no longer carriers of the virus.
the earlier report also found that 60 percent of the undocumented had resided in the united states for 10 years or more, including 1.9 million for at least 20 years. the average length of residence of the undocumented will continue to increase into the foreseeable future. the 2013 study also found that more than one-half of the four million persons eligible for the deferred action for parents of americans and lawful permanent residents (dapa) program and the 1.5 million eligible for the expanded deferred action for childhood arrivals (daca) program entered the united states prior to the year 2000.
there's little value to european travel restrictions. poor use of time & energy. earlier, yes. now, travel restrictions/screening are less useful. we have nearly as much disease here in the us as the countries in europe. we must focus on layered community mitigation measures-now! — thomas p. bossert (@tombossert) march 12, 2020
he maintained that the nationwide fentanyl epidemic has been primarily supply driven. but for unknown reasons, the cartels decided not to push fentanyl in california until recently, he said. if fentanyl is starting to become a demand issue here in california, that could be really bad news.
the last four years have been just so horrible. it's taken a toll on me mentally, physically. now, i feel like i can finally take care of myself again. i couldn't do that the last four years because i was fighting for my life.

as states start dialing back their war on marijuana consumers, altieri said, it is important that those who were most negatively impacted by our oppressive prohibition are able to see previous harms remedied as best as possible and be given the opportunity to participate in the benefits that come along with legalization and regulation.
among economically developed countries, the leader is israel and it's not even close. as of tuesday, more than 1 in 5 israelis had received at least one vaccine dose, according to data from our world in data. and the rolling seven-day average for daily doses in israel was 0.75 per 100 people. the comparable figure for the u.s. was 0.19.
it's not just individual workers who would benefit from the establishment of these plans—many smaller nonprofits without the infrastructure to offer an employer-sponsored plan could also remain competitive in attracting employees if workers could access a retirement plan through their state. eastmont community center in los angeles is a nonprofit that fully supported passage of the california secure choice retirement program. teresa palacios, executive director at eastmont, says that, having a low-risk and low-cost retirement plan accessible to all employees would benefit everyone in our community. it is not uncommon to see children taking care of their elder parents because they cannot support themselves with their fixed social security benefit.
president-elect joe biden is facing mounting pressure to drop a prominent lawyer currently working for one of the world's largest oil companies from the transition team's list of potential nominees for solicitor general.
at the same time, undocumented persons with long tenure and strong family ties will not likely leave the country or secure status in large numbers. thus, a path to legal status and citizenship for a large percentage of the undocumented constitutes the most effective and sound way to reduce this population. of course, with far fewer out-of-status residents, dhs's massive enforcement infrastructure could be used to target primarily non-citizens who represent a security or public safety threat, to regulate us borders, and to tackle the challenge of visa over-stayers.
in my experience working with organizations in limbo, i've encountered five recurring factors that affect the balance within an organization and slow or totally halt its progress.
of course, you'd also think he'd know better than try to beat freshman rep. alexandria ocasio-cortez (d-n.y.) on twitter.
he also threatened to kill her.
you are going to respect this plant. you're not just going to come in here and grab on us. you're going to respect what we have to bring to the table, and we've been doing this a really long time, and you're not just going to come in here and grab it, unsworth said. as women, we're finally getting the chance to scream that as a group.
if this happens, it wouldn't be the first time that undergraduate education has been free in new york. for most of its history, up until the 1970s when new york city was in dire financial straits and the state had to step in to bail out the city university of new york, cuny was free to many of the city's residents.
like other coronavirus strains, the wuhan virus can be spread through coughing, sneezing or general contact with someone carrying the pathogen. experts recommend taking all the regular precautions that people should be taking during flu season anyway — washing hands often, coughing into your elbow instead of your hand, not going to work if you're feeling unwell, avoiding contact with sick people, and seeing a doctor as soon as possible if you're showing symptoms.
the probe, chang'e 4, is symbolic of the growth of the chinese space program and the capabilities it has amassed, significant for china and for relations among the great power across the world. the consequences extend to the united states as the trump administration considers global competition in space as well as the future of space exploration.

on sunday morning, the 12-hour lock-out appeared to be triggered after greene tweeted a long, conspiracy-filled thread disparaging georgia's voting systems manager and secretary of state — two republicans — for declaring biden the winner of the state's presidential election, and democrats the winners of both of the state's senate runoff races.
while fischer might well be a bigot, he's certainly not an idiot. he has to know that his claims about washington are untrue and that point returns me to my two questions.
these senate seats are truly the last line of defense, trump said. he added, it's really fight for our country, not a fight for trump.
rather than focus on the high-minded policy debates over health care and legislative pragmatism that have dominated the national media narratives, caucus-goers who expressed their preference for sanders there tended to refer broadly to his commitment to expanding access to health care and education, and immigration reform. several also cited what they see as his authenticity, honed over decades of progressive activism.
it's been particularly horrible to see ford's government revoke liberal environmental policies because they haven't replaced them with anything significant, del duca said.
even some republicans are hopeful. michael steel, once a top adviser to republican house speaker john boehner, a chief obama foil along with mcconnell, blamed obama's capitol hill troubles on his personal approach to his fellow politicians. conversely, steel said, president-elect biden is a legislator by avocation, by training, by instinct, by experience in a way that former president obama was not.
it is there that scientists believe the virus leapt from animals to humans – but that doesn't mean you'll catch coronavirus from your household cat or dog.
and so the care economy needs to be addressed directly. and we need to pay our caregivers more. we need to pay people who are full time caregivers, and we need to make sure our daycare workers are paid above the minimum wage and have real careers.
gillibrand, along with sen. patty murray (d-wash.) and reps. rosa delauro (d-conn.) and ayanna pressley (d-mass.), sent a letter to the incoming biden administration and congressional leaders on wednesday, urging them to prioritize paid leave.
on kushner's talk with kislyak, the white house said in march: the two spoke about potentially establishing a more open line of communication in the future. the meeting was similar to dozens of others that took place over the course of the campaign with representatives of other foreign countries. they have not reconnected since the initial meeting.
the huffington post reached out to baylor university for comment but did not hear back by the time of publication.
typically, that responsibility falls to state attorneys general. but in georgia, residents can file a complaint against any city or county they judge to be breaking state immigration law.

many of those killed in the crash were on their way back to their studies, in universities and secondary schools across canada. others were preparing to resume their jobs teaching in those institutions, or doing research.
wonder woman star gal gadot drew controversy last week for organizing a bunch of celebrities to sing john lennon's imagine, with many critics decrying the video as not doing anything to actually help the situation.
the hit came shortly after iran launched missiles at two military bases in iraq — including one where canadian troops were stationed — in response to a u.s. drone strike that killed iranian maj.-gen. qassem soleimani in baghdad. canadian troops were not injured in the iran missle strikes.
beletsky admitted there was still a lot of uncertainty surrounding kratom, and said it warrants further research to better understand its full range of effects and possible harms. but considering there are an estimated 3 to 5 million kratom users around the u.s., according to industry figures, he added that the relatively low number of supposed kratom-related deaths ― even in questionable cases like these ― could actually suggest that kratom is not very harmful.
the direct payments congress sent most households last year in response to the coronavirus pandemic were so popular with the american public that lawmakers approved a second round of checks last month, and biden promised to do a third.
touring the country could build a grassroots base for eventual green new deal legislation that the last major federal climate bill ― the 2009 cap-and-trade proposal known as the waxman-markey bill ― never received.
stymied on the legislative front, trump has carried on his war against obamacare by using his executive authority. and here he has been more successful.
many others ― san francisco, berlin, barcelona, to name a few ― have followed new york by restricting or banning both airbnb and often uber too.

advocates are now looking to the biden administration ― which this week plans to announce an overhaul to the nation's immigration laws and a pathway to citizenship ― to earn the trust of undocumented immigrants as a part of his promise to vaccinate 100 million people a day during his first 100 days.
buttigieg and klobuchar really don't seem to like each other.
cuomo acknowledged their departures show the level of disrepair around trump and why he may be remembered as the worst.
those who support the terrorists are responsible for the situation in eastern ghouta, kremlin spokesman dmitry peskov told a conference call with reporters. neither russia, nor syria, nor iran are in that category of states, as they are waging an absolute war against terrorists in syria.
i watched with the rest of the world this month as more than 150 women and girls gave stomach-turning accounts of mental and physical abuse at the hands of former usa gymnastics doctor larry nassar.
fentanyl showed up in san francisco early compared to the rest of the state. it was rarely seen in other parts of california until last year.
the whole time, i was surrounded by a lot of white people. a lot. however, i take far less issue with that ― i made wonderful friends and had incredible, life-changing experiences ― than i do with my attitude along the way. i was in full-on racial denial. i didn't even join any affinity groups for black, indigenous and other people of color or try to make any friends who looked like me.
women are very worried about what they're seeing in terms of far-reaching and longterm impacts of this pandemic, she told huffpost canada.
the document's proposing over a dozen structural and policy changes to how canada works. many would require referenda, and most would require the support of the federal conservative party before pushing trudeau on them.
the repeal has certainly been a long time coming. shortly after the policy was enacted, the aoki family challenged it in aoki vs. deane, when they protested redding elementary school principal's refusal to admit their child. the board sided against them.
the north also displayed a variety of solid-fuel weapons designed to be fired from mobile land launchers, which potentially expand its capability to strike targets in south korea and japan, including u.s. military bases there.
rempel garner is leading the charge on the declaration, but it is also co-signed by banff-airdrie mp blake richards, medicine hat-cardston-warner mp glen motz and peace river-westlock mp arnold viersen.
in 2017, seattle city council candidate teresa mosqueda became the first person in the country to win their first election running with democracy vouchers. she had kept hearing that she should run for city council from participants in a program she ran for the afl-cio that encouraged women, people of color and working-class people to run for office. she was the kind of person she was trying to get to run: a latina in the labor movement who didn't come from money. but her background also presented an obstacle to funding a campaign ― until seattle's democracy vouchers became available.
under the criminal code, child pornography is any visual representation of a person under the age of 18 engaged or depicted to be engaged in a sexual activity.
due out next week, the journal drills into the central paradox of trump and negotiation: the president spent his career positioning himself as the consummate deal-maker. he's listed as the author, after all, of the art of the deal, though it was ghost-written. yet, there's little evidence he's actually good at deal-making. many of his best real-estate deals were actually put in place by george ross (who handled real estate negotiations), and roy cohn, the legendary attorney, was trump's original fixer and known for being a brutal negotiator, writes university of pennsylvania wharton school professor g. richard shell in a piece for the issue.
with respect to the central bank, the european central bank, is now doing what it takes as it pledged in 2012 , but the european banking union is still incomplete. this is largely because of resistance to a single deposit insurance, especially in germany, which sees this guarantee as a form of debt mutualisation.
it's important people recognize the racial diversity that exists within the latino community. we are not a monolithic group.
while title ix was intended to protect equal access to education for women and girls, it also protects the men and boys who experience the terrible consequences of sexual violence in schools, from kindergarten through college. to strip them of even these bare protections of the law does no service to boys and men.
it is scary to not know what's next, how long will this go on? a couple of weeks or months? how long can we afford it? she said.
the health risks to australians from the global covid-19 pandemic are increasing significantly and quickly. we now recommend you reconsider your need for overseas travel at this time, including to indonesia and bali. indonesia has confirmed more covid-19 cases, dfat's smart traveller website said on saturday.
the former navy seal and montana congressman made an impression. his military service and qualities of leadership attracted me the most, cannon said.
congress is increasingly unable to comprehend a world growing more socially, economically and technologically multifaceted — and we did this to ourselves, rep. bill pascrell (d-n.j.) wrote in the washington post on jan. 11.
for example, a growing number of u.s. students are pursuing their degree outside of the u.s. in countries such as germany and scotland as they look for ways to escape the rising cost of college at home. even though some u.s. students can receive subsidies to offset their education, those in the middle- and upper-income levels tend to receive minimal support and are also most likely to see studying abroad as a possibility.
the european food safety authority (efsa) report, which covered wild bees and honeybees and included a systematic review of scientific evidence published since efsa's 2013 evaluation, is seen as crucial to whether the european moratorium on neonicotinoid use remains in place.
adam said creating these dolls requires a lot of diy know-how. she finds her own fabric and sews all the outfits herself. she pays attention to detail ― the flowers on eslimah's skirt, for example, were hand-painted to look like the ones in the original photograph. muhammad's helmet was made out of polymer clay, covered in fabric, then decorated by hand.
i am a senior at emerson college, in boston. i created my own program at emerson, which is called writing and publishing on inequality (and here i am, doing just that). i wasn't really a supporter of yang, but i didn't oppose him either (i'll vote for any democrat that makes it to the general election, even if i disagree with them on many economic issues). i write for a data science conference company, and i receive a basic income.
so, for me, when i watched insurrectionists and white supremacists storm the capitol ― people who had announced days in advance that they were coming to the capitol ― and to see that they were treated with kid gloves really shows you everything we were trying to expose in the last four years under this administration. law enforcement is not here to protect everyone the same and not everyone will be held accountable the same. and i've experienced that. i've been arrested over 20 times on capitol hill grounds, inside the capitol and outside the capitol. so to watch people just walk right in, break windows, steal mail from federal government officials ― it was a very triggering but eye-opening experience for the rest of the country.
they're currently doing as much damage control as possible, but they knew, ocasio-cortez said on friday, referring to the fact that there were at least 70 stop the steal groups active on facebook following the capitol riot, according to an investigation by media matters. not only did they know, but they allowed it.
in its september forecast, the world trade organization (wto) warned that it was worried world trade would only grow by 1.7% (in volume) in 2016. this is its lowest growth since 2009, the year of the global financial crisis, when international trade started retreating.
since last week the court building has been closed to visitors while working on expanding remote working capabilities to reduce the number of employees in the building. it also postponed oral arguments for at least the rest of the month and extended filing deadlines for most cases.
traditionally, the courts have cut the president a wide berth when it comes to allowing extra-legal powers during a genuine national emergency. lincoln suspended habeas corpus during the civil war, when the south had invaded parts of the union. roosevelt, with no justification, was able to incarcerate patriotic japanese-american citizens during world war ii.
time and again, msu, usa gymnastics and the u.s. olympic committee have neglected to remedy decades of institutional failures, despite embarrassing resignations, criminal charges and even bankruptcy.
in the midst of a partial government shutdown that has left thousands of federal employees without pay, top trump administration officials ― including vice president mike pence ― may be cashing in on substantial salary raises.
all members of the group, called ffc-acrush, are androgynous people assigned female at birth ― and they're quickly rising to fame in china.
you look at what's happening in germany, you look at what's happening last night in sweden, trump told a large crowd of supporters in a hangar at the orlando-melbourne international airport. sweden. who would believe this? sweden, he added. they took in large numbers. they're having problems like they never thought possible.
coronaviruses often spread between animals, but some make the jump from animal to human when they mutate, which appears to be the case here, according to steven hoffman, a professor of global health, law and political science at york university.
there is no intent to provoke women or instigate them to violence, he said. the bat is to prevent violence.
on the other side is political economy planning, which is to change a feature or features of the social-political environment to produce a certain movement of actors. creating certain programs and offering benefits to something or someone is political economy planning. firstly, a policymaker must ensure that they understand the social-political environment of their country, for each country is similar to different types of terrains. there are your actors, an established belief system, political structure, and so on. once the terrain is understood, they must evaluate what they want to add to the terrain and what it may cause to the terrain and other terrains. there are many examples of this in the united states of america: the h-1b visa program, the federal visa program, eb-5, and the recent move of general electric (ge) to boston. the h-1b program was designed to fulfill job shortages in specialized industries and it attracted numerous employees; whereas, the eb-5 attracted foreign investors by exchanging an investment in property for a fast track to a green card. then ge was attracted to boston because of their employees' preferences and the tax relief package it had received for relocating to boston. but, despite the usefulness of political economy, it has it limits for it can increase investment too much to make a city unaffordable or it can place foreign workers into a tough living situation. the cost of political economy is what it does to a terrain, as previously described.
amid that cultural backdrop, there have been no open atheists in congress since 2012, when then-rep. pete stark (d-calif.) lost his seat to a challenger. stark had already been in congress for over three decades when he publicly acknowledged his nonbeliever status in 2007. former rep. barney frank (d-mass.) also waited until after he'd retired to announce that he doesn't believe in god. no candidate has ever entered congress as an avowed atheist.

what to make of these numbers from a policy perspective? the cms report suggests that the united states seems to have turned a corner on the undocumented population and, for a variety of reasons, should not witness the kind of large-scale unauthorized migration flows that it experienced in the 1990s and early 2000s. indeed, the multi-year trend has been an overall decline in this population. as cms's 2013 report shows, a far higher percentage of visa over-stayers now join the ranks of the undocumented each year (58 percent in 2012) than persons who cross us borders without authorization.

now, in my mid-fifties, i appreciate even more the gifts i was given in fourth grade. i am writing a book about caring for aging parents -- the first such effort since through the forest. i care less about how others judge me and more about how they make me feel. as life doles out its sorrows and joys, what is really worth cherishing seems abundantly clear. while i've had to say goodbye to those i love, like my dad, his loss somehow reconnected me to my beloved teacher. i am deeply grateful. not only that i had the benefit of a remarkable teacher who inspired my capacity for joy and creativity, but that i was able to tell her after half a century, the impact she had on my life. it's never too late to reach out and express thanks to that extraordinary teacher in your life. i hope you were fortunate enough to have had one, like mrs. gerlip, who not only developed your mind but nurtured your soul.

well, before you banned alex jones, you said, we're going to hold jones to the same standard we hold every account, not taking one-off actions to make us feel good in the short term and adding fuel to new conspiracy theories. i'm assuming those conspiracy theories were the allegations of bias against conservatives on the platform.

narang decided she couldn't stay silent. as someone who knows survivors of sexual assault, she never wants her 13-year-old son to see the sticker, or be ok with violence against women. so, she posted the image to facebook as a way to call it out: this company represents everything that the [oil and gas] industry needs to fight against.
as historians of science and economics note, a worldview based on divine providence was gradually switched out with a new framework: equilibrium. the same principles of order and regulation were maintained, but without the language of an external guide. instead, this was all accomplished internally, through the logic of the system itself. smith could talk about the hand of god without reference to god, but the idea that some rational force was leading things in orderly fashion still lingered.

two of the local women struck up a conversation with me, proving once again that what i have cannot be taught. they told stories of a neighboring tavern that had since been shut down after the authorities discovered it was a brothel. i smiled and nodded, and googled the term when i returned home. incidentally, yikes. they went on to describe the proprietor, a woman whose name i can't recall, so i'll make up something dignified. apparently, if you gave old beaver jugs a single dollar, she'd climb a step ladder in an ill-fitting skirt, hoisting her business district skywards and presenting the patronage with a view of the second thing i had to google that night. incidentally, yikes.
most of these shutdowns have happened in jammu & kashmir, where the information blackout has now entered its fifth month — the longest recorded internet shutdown for a democracy globally. this most recent kashmir blockade began on august 5, 2019 shortly before the indian government abrogated kashmir's autonomy and statehood. on october 14, the government allowed some leeway by restoring postpaid phone connections in the valley with curbs still in place for mobile internet.

the fda's presentation of kratom-related deaths appears to follow a broader practice, in which officials seem to be determining that any fatal incident involving kratom must therefore be related to the drug. but this haphazard characterization of kratom's supposed deadly risks does nothing to expand our understanding of how the drug supposedly kills people, if it does at all. and in fact, lumping these cases together despite their obvious dissimilarities may end up producing a misleading narrative about kratom's actual effects, said leo beletsky, an associate professor of law and health sciences at northeastern university.

this apparently wasn't a lesson learned by our prime minister during his university days. in fact, it's now quite obvious mr. trudeau thinks he's quite within his rights as prime minister to use fallacious reasoning to prop his decisions and policies in parliament, and in front of the cameras.
if the democratic party is going to build on its midterm election gains ― after a decade of historic and catastrophic losses ― it needs to be more responsive, accountable and politically savvy than warren has been. it is naive to think this issue will stop haunting her, and no, that reality is not unfair. she had other options, but she has spent the past six years stubbornly digging the hole she is now stuck in. native people warned her. repeatedly. she ignored us. now the democratic party needs to not make the same mistake.

china said thursday that it had no new local infections of the novel coronavirus from the previous day, a major turning point in the unprecedented effort to beat back the disease. thirty-four new cases of the virus were reported, but they all involved people who had come to china from other locations. the new york times notes that experts say the country would have to record no new local infections for 14 days before the outbreak could officially be declared over.
congress has already appropriated funding for roughly three-quarters of the federal government, leaving many agencies unaffected by the shutdown. house democrats, who assumed the majority last week, passed bills that would reopen shuttered agencies other than dhs, which is at the center of the funding dispute. but republican leaders in the senate have refused to take up those bills and stood alongside the president, who threatened to veto any legislation without full wall funding.

it's important people recognize the racial diversity that exists within the latino community. we are not a monolithic group. our national origins, ethnic backgrounds and indigenous histories are distinct and varied. social scientists and public health researchers are beginning to recognize this and have identified drastic health inequities within this group. without question, the latino-american population as a whole faces economic and social barriers that the average non-hispanic white american doesn't. but the heaviest health burden of all seems to fall on latinos who have darker skin or who identify as black.
any encroachment on the fed's turf is viewed by wall street and the mainstream media with alarm. but to people struggling with mounting bills and crumbling infrastructure, the development has promising potential. the portal to the central bank's stream of riches has been forced open, if just a crack. the trickle could one day become a flow, a mighty river of liquidity powering the engines of productivity of a vibrant economy.

6. going back on their commitments. making promises to people places you on the fine line that lies between making them very happy and watching them walk out the door. when you uphold a commitment, you grow in the eyes of your employees because you prove yourself to be trustworthy and honorable (two very important qualities in a boss). but when you disregard your commitment, you come across as slimy, uncaring, and disrespectful. after all, if the boss doesn't honor his or her commitments, why should everyone else?

this began in mashhad as opposed to tehran, and really percolated at least in the first 24 to 36 hours outside the capital. that's a very important distinction in that tehran has always been the center of political gravity for the islamic republic and contemporary iran, she said. that quick escalation is a real point of concern for the regime, because it suggests that this is no longer about one individual or faction versus another, this is very much about a sense of alienation at a basic level.

the actual effect of what trump called his bold regulatory reduction campaign has been protecting planet-heating emissions from cars and power plants and ending the u.s. commitment to the climate goals of the landmark international paris agreement that almost every other nation is still committed to. the president has shortened the review process under the national environmental policy act, clearing the way for new infrastructure projects, particularly those dealing with fossil fuels, to ignore climate change as an issue altogether. and he's stripped federal protections from nearly half the nation's wetlands and hundreds of thousands of streams, proposed making it legal to incidentally kill migratory birds, and cleared the way to approve old, bee-killing pesticides and new, potentially human-killing forever chemicals.

at the very least, a democratic senate should allow biden to more easily reverse many of the labor policies of the trump era ― not just legislatively through the congressional review act, but by reshaping the national labor relations board, which referees disputes between employers and unions. the trump picks for that board have made it more difficult for many workers to bargain collectively. if sen. mitch mcconnell (r-ky.) is deposed as the senate's leader, biden would have a much easier time installing union-friendly nominees who could undo the previous board's decisions.

for our part, salesforce in canada offers free high tech training through trailhead, which trains participants on salesforce expertise, helping prepare canadians for the nearly 30,000 salesforce-based jobs projected to be created in the country between now and 2018. but there's much more to do to keep pace with the continued digitization of the economy, and investment in the required infrastructure is critical to all efforts.

a solid deal-maker also doesn't make an enemy out of his counterparty. ideally in politics or diplomacy, he's built up some goodwill with them. trump, on the other hand, demonizes and belittles his political opponents (and sometimes his allies).
obama picked ken salazar, an oil and gas ally, as his interior secretary, and balanced new federal support for renewable energy with boosts to fossil fuel drillers, promising an all of the above energy play. the approach relied on congress, both chambers of which democrats controlled when obama took office, to enact a new carbon pricing scheme that would gradually increase the cost of fossil fuels and incentivize a shift to solar, wind and energy efficiency. democrats' landmark cap-and-trade bill ― a conservative and incrementalist policy that aimed to set a cap on carbon emissions, then let companies trade pollution permits ― fizzled in 2010. going forward, the gop, seemingly hell-bent on obstructing anything obama proposed and financially encouraged by dark-money groups unleashed by the supreme court's 2010 citizens united ruling, adopted a full-fledged position of denying the reality of climate change itself.

we are working to end america's wars in the middle east, trump claimed tuesday night. since may, the president has sent more than 20,000 additional american troops to the middle east, including deploying some to saudi arabia for the first time since 2003. he's simultaneously complicated the alliances that washington could lean on for support instead of investing its own resources, most notably with his high-profile abandonment of a crucial u.s. partner in the counter-isis fight, the syrian kurds, last year.

democratic lawmakers recognized the inadequacy of their efforts back in the spring. house speaker nancy pelosi (d-calif.) began referring to phases of the legislative response ― cares was phase three (congress, it turns out, had actually passed two previous phases of relief so negligible as to have already been forgotten). when the next bill merely topped-up an almost instantly exhausted small business relief program, lawmakers changed phase four to phase three-and-a-half. and when no further relief came from washington for several more months, pelosi stopped talking about phases.

i feel so relieved knowing that trump is leaving office. we're not under the illusion that just because biden and harris are in the white house, all of a sudden black freedom comes. there's no illusion there. but donald trump was absolutely the most oppressive, repressive, racist, sexist, violent so-called leader we could have. so i am relieved to see him go. i think the whole world is exhaling. we're all sharing a collective sigh of relief.

your father-in-law? he may be a bit more challenging; old heads tend to be pretty set in their ways. but you have the leverage, here, because you are in charge of how much (or how little) he gets to hang out with his granddaughters. and you're not going to make your kids spend time with people who make them feel uncomfortable — family, friends or otherwise. make that very clear and institute a zero tolerance policy going forward. note: this is a conversation you need to have with their grandfather, because he needs to see how serious you are about it. if you leave the discussion up to your husband, there's a good chance the message could be lost in translation.

south korea's joint chiefs of staff said in a statement that it is studying the weapons displayed by north korea but didn't immediately release a detailed assessment.
in most industrial countries, labor (which abounds and is in part underused) becomes increasingly expensive through taxation and social insurance costs. thus we encourage replacing labor with more machines, materials and energy. yet materials and energy (relatively scarce, thus worth saving) are lightly taxed in comparison, or even subsidized, which stimulates their use, abets joblessness (adding to social costs) and increases waste.
that said, there's been little political consensus around expanding health coverage beyond covid-19 testing, and so far changes have been on the margins. congress expanded medicare's coverage of telemedicine in the last relief bill but did not include subsidies for cobra, the federal law that allows recently unemployed americans to continue their health plans at personal cost, or for the affordable care act. the trump administration decided against reopening the affordable care act's marketplaces to the 28 million people who were uninsured before the pandemic.

meanwhile, the pandemic has caused a huge uptick in unpaid work. mothers are now homeschool teachers, just like hughes. and with covid-19 rates disproportionately higher for black americans, it stands to reason that the burden of caregiving also falls hardest on their shoulders.
bernhardt played a key behind-the-scenes role in many regulatory rollbacks during zinke's tenure, as mother jones highlighted in an october profile. those efforts include a plan to dismantle obama-era protections for the greater sage grouse, a move that would open up millions of acres of the declining game bird's habitat to energy and mineral development. bernhardt is also leading a charge to revise the endangered species act, one of america's bedrock conservation laws. the proposed changes would make it easier to remove recovered species from the protected list and would change how federal agencies go about designating habitat as critical to the long-term survival of species.
the law requires that schools base their special ed decisions on need, not opinion, or space availability, or money, or teacher training or other subjective positions, kerry steiner, who worked with a texas school district as part of a parent training project, told the publication at the time. it was heartbreaking to see schools not do that.

bushroot was a squat, gnome-like creature that one of the bros had sketched out at the beginning of the semester to be our dorm mascot. it had bulging eyes and a dark shaded face ringed by short spiky hair. the guys proudly hung photocopies of the bushroot sketch up on all their walls. they would approach the sketch and ask, bushroot, should i take another hit from this bong? or someone in the room would suddenly whisper 'shroot and then they'd all repeat the name in turn, escalating the volume until they were shouting. they would invite the girls, myself included, to chant bushroot along with them and then they would hoot and holler when we did.

democrats have hammered perdue and loeffler, each among the senate's wealthiest members, for conspicuously timed personal stock trades after members of congress received information about the public health and economic threats of covid-19 as trump and republicans downplayed the pandemic. none of the trades has been found to violate the law or senate ethics, but warnock and ossoff have cast the republicans as self-interested and out of touch.
even inadvertent offence is tough to avoid, he adds, noting that norovirus drew ire for unintentionally containing the widespread japanese family name noro. and this was after the diarrhea-causing flu bug was initially named the norwalk agent, in reference to the town of norwalk, ohio, where an outbreak emerged among schoolchildren in 1968.
after five decades of its existence and as an alliance that consists of 28 independent countries -- including three permanent un security council members -- the north atlantic treaty organization (nato) is one of the largest and the strongest collective defense alliance of its kind. the adversaries of the allies have contested their formation, development, and existence. nato was known as an alliance against the soviet union only. so, why has the alliance expanded and strengthened even three decades after the collapse of the ussr? does such an alliance still need to exist?

her vulnerability to a challenge could speak to the changing nature of the democratic electorate. support for a green new deal unites disparate primary voters from the 2016 election. among new york 4th congressional district voters who picked sen. bernie sanders (i-vt.) in 2016, 55 percent said they would support a pro-green new deal candidate, compared to 8 percent who wouldn't. among voters who picked former secretary of state hillary clinton in the 2016 primary, support for a green new deal proponent hit 46 percent, compared to 19 percent who don't.

advocates, meanwhile, upped the ante. groups such as new york communities for change and the local chapters of democratic socialists of america and the green new deal-crusading sunrise movement started demanding the government replace consolidated edison and national grid, the investor-owned utilities that currently deliver the city's electricity and heating gas, with government-run alternatives. and activists stepped up fights against new gas pipelines into the city, including one currently under construction in north brooklyn.

it is not uncommon to see anti-china headlines splashed across the media these days. even in 2020, it is disappointing to see the casual racism and the normalisation of sinophobic narratives that appeared before and during the white australia policy still exist. the daily telegraph took such casual racism to a new level with a front-page headline, china kids stay home, while its victorian equivalent, the herald sun, carried a headline that said, china virus pandamonium. these messages are intended to create a perception to fuel anti-chinese sentiment to appeal to certain parts of the population.
on tuesday, gottlieb reiterated concerns about kratom's potential for abuse, addiction, and serious health consequences; including death. as proof of the drug's deadly harm, the fda released reports on 36 deaths involving the use of kratom, culled from academic research, medical examiner reports and adverse event reports. gottlieb also said the fda plans to release the eight newly received reports.
at one point, they recall, nix explained that the national rifle association's database of members would be a valuable way to target donors. wilson typed an emoji with rolling eyes next to the statement because it was so obvious. he told people that he came away thinking, red flag, red flag, red flag. in response to an extensive set of questions, nix disputed this account of the meeting. he denied that cambridge analytica had obtained any data via facebook—a source of controversy for the firm ever since the guardian reported in 2015 that ca based its data on research spanning tens of millions of facebook users, harvested largely without their permission. nix also claimed that it was the cruz team that didn't have access to the rnc's data trust for much of the cycle and that all data used for the majority of the campaign was provided by cambridge analytica. however, mike shields, then the rnc's chief of staff and data trust's senior adviser, told me the cruz campaign was in fact the second to sign an agreement with data trust, in 2014. meanwhile, the red flags kept coming. wilson found the data scientists that ca sent to houston to be highly efficient at the day-to-day work of his research operation. but according to cruz staffers, when he began to test ca's specialized models, he found that they were notably off, with, for example, some male voters miscategorized as women.

the girls were used to getting what they wanted. at renaissance, robert was an eccentric among eccentrics. the firm is legendary for shunning people with wall street or even conventional finance backgrounds, instead favoring scientists and original thinkers. robert himself, by all accounts, is extremely introverted. rarely seen in public, he likes to spend his free time with his wife and three daughters. when, in 2014, robert accepted an award from the association for computational linguistics, he recalled, in a soft voice and with quiet humor, his consternation at being informed that he was expected to give an oration on some topic or another for an hour, which, by the way, is more than i typically talk in a month. sebastian mallaby's account of the hedge-fund elite, more money than god, describes him as an icy cold poker player who doesn't remember having a nightmare. he likes model trains, having once purchased a set for $2.7 million, and has acquired one of the country's largest collections of machine guns. for years, robert has embraced a supercharged libertarianism with idiosyncratic variations. he is reportedly pro-death penalty, pro-life and pro-gold standard. he has contributed to an ad campaign opposing the construction of the ground zero mosque; doctors for disaster preparedness, a group that is associated with fringe scientific claims; and black americans for a better future—a vehicle, the intercept discovered, for an african-american political consultant who has accused barack obama of relentless pandering to homosexuals.

ready believes that free tuition is necessary but not sufficient to create economic impact. between 2005 and 2014, the city's public school enrollment grew by almost 25 percent (though the number of low-income kids receiving free lunches also increased). kalamazoo now has more college graduates, and the erosion in its population has stopped.
in most states, we are not even allowed to lay eyes on the test, and we will receive a single score for your child. all of this is useless. we will learn nothing about your child, and nothing about your child's class (except how well they did on this test). if an administrator or a teacher tells you that the test results will give them valuable information about your child, ask them why they have not already collected that information by other means and if not, what they've been doing for the past eight months.

people have focused on this issue of a carbon tax, but it may not be necessary to finance renewable energy infrastructure, inslee said. we may find other ways to finance this. you look at the trump tax cuts that were misbegotten and gave all these tax benefits to the upper-income groups, and people weren't worried about the deficit when they did that.
so why does this 'economy of common sense' fail to catch on? let's take gold as an example. its stock above ground is estimated at 180.000 tonnes, equivalent to a cube with sides of just 21 m. a portion of the world's worked gold has been circulating for millennia, melted and re-melted into countless artifacts. thereby, relatively little material generated a great deal of usage value over time. another portion of the world's worked gold is instead extracted from mines, at cost of great environmental damage and consumption of energy, returning quickly back underground to the vaults of banks - producing no technical usage value.

gymnastics requires an enormous amount of dedication and trust from parents. training and travel are expensive, and transporting kids to and from practice is time-consuming and complicated. logistical and financial matters aside, gymnastics injuries can be severe, and the level of trust parents and kids must have in coaches is extreme. at twistars, as at most gyms, parents sign a terrifying disclaimer listing all the horrible things that could happen to their kids: broken bones, paralysis, death. those worst-case scenarios tend to flit through the mind when you watch your child hit the springboard or fall off the beam.

i first addressed my hair, which seemed like an obvious place to start at the time. i felt grateful that at this point in my life, i was no longer beholden to my parents' no chemicals in your body policy. i began to pay increasingly large percentages of my income to hair stylists to burn the crap out of my hair with sketchy chemicals ― relaxers, texturizers, keratins, thermal reconditioners, smoothers, serums, rinses ― that made my eyes water, my nose run and my scalp scream. i figured it was the price i had to pay to scorch out any traces of bushroot.

age has emerged as the crucial dividing line ahead of the democratic caucuses here, neatly dividing the coalitions of the two septuagenarians in a way education, class and geography do not. sanders, whose bold agenda includes aggressive plans to wipe out student debt and battle climate change, disproportionately draws support from millennials and members of generation z. biden, who has unveiled more cautious policy proposals, is heavily reliant on the gray-haired. each is struggling with the opposite demographic. (the coalitions for both warren and buttigieg are more consistent across age groups.)
the analysis, which focused on three popular textbooks from two major publishers of christian educational materials ― abeka and bju press ― looked at how the books teach the trump era of politics. we found that all three are characterized by a skewed version of history and a sense that the country is experiencing an urgent moral decline that can only be fixed by conservative christian policies. language used in the books overlaps with the rhetoric of christian nationalism, often with overtones of nativism, militarism and racism as well.

the decision that i made, as the longest-serving independent in the history of the united states congress, i said, 'if we are going to win this race, we have to do it within the democratic primary process,' sanders said in a 2016 interview with nbc's chuck todd. he decided to not run as an independent because he didn't want to be a spoiler in the presidential race.
a second wave of research has risen up to answer such questions, just as workers in clinics, nonprofits and the more progressive public health departments around the country have undertaken an extensive process of trial and error to see just what might be the magic formula needed to help prep succeed among black msm.
it showed the entire blow-up of the country coming, caddell told me. a whole new paradigm developing. no republican had yet emerged as a front-runner in the 2016 primary, but the hanleys believed ted cruz could take caddell's insights and ride them all the way to the white house. they saw cruz as a unicorn: a dedicated fiscal and social conservative who had broken with his party repeatedly. they were dismissive of trump. he doesn't understand politics or geopolitics or anything about the running of the government, alice hanley told me recently. rebekah mercer saw the koch network as hopelessly soft on trade and immigration and was hungry for a way to promote her own more hard-line ideology. robert mercer and cruz had met before during a conference in february 2014, when lee hanley had invited them to the five-diamond breakers resort in palm beach for a grilling session. robert was impressed by cruz's intellect, according to a person at the meeting, but worried that the 43-year-old senator was too young and might struggle to capture voters' imaginations. still, robert warmed to him over the course of many weekends at various hanley homes. apparently, cruz can hold his alcohol (his preference is cabernet), which is a prized attribute in the hanleys' circle. as the mercers weighed whether to get involved in a presidential race, their calculus was quite different from that of other megadonors, most of whom run massive corporate empires.

if the trudeau government really wants to be back, we need to begin by meeting our international obligations. the first step would be to increase canada's official development assistance (oda), which sits at an embarrassing 0.26 per cent of gni. the international goal is 0.7 per cent, and many other donor countries have reached this, but the liberal government has given no indication that it will even attempt to make an increase at any point in this mandate. frankly, that's unacceptable. canada should set a timetable to reach the 0.7 per cent goal. if the liberal budget doesn't include an increase in oda, that will be a massive disappointment to canadians who believe we need to do better on the world stage.
it's still a much more dangerous drug than heroin, which is typically sold as black tar in california and tends to be inconsistent in potency and quality, he added.
and while the relief for past convictions is a component built into california's new marijuana laws, the process is not automatic or well-known. individuals with past marijuana convictions must know the relief exists, petition the courts themselves to file the appropriate paperwork and may need to retain an attorney to do so. the process can be time consuming and costly. gascón's approach, however, is novel because no action is required from eligible individuals with past marijuana convictions to take advantage of the law. his office is applying the relief process on its own.
while emphasizing that he's generally in favor of banning lynching, staver claimed the bill is being used to further other proposed federal legislation that would explicitly protect queer americans from discrimination at work and in other contexts.
on the grounds outside, rioters erected a giant wooden cross and a gallows with a noose. reporters were beaten and threatened with death. their cameras and equipment were smashed and burned. echoing trump's long-standing calls that the press were the enemy of the people, rioters scrawled murder the media, on a capitol doorway. a rioter murdered a police officer with a fire extinguisher. another rioter was shot dead by a police officer while trying to break into house speaker nancy pelosi's chambers. in perhaps the most indelible image, rioters commandeered a scaffold and used it to take down an american flag and replace it with a trump make america great again flag.

when president obama took office in 2008, he correctly rejected the past policy of supporting non-democratic, corrupt, and abusive regimes simply because they are strategic partners of the united states. the arab spring of 2011 brought hope that democracy might just have a chance in the middle east. but the task has proven to be exceedingly difficult, as events and policies in egypt, syria, libya, and yemen have led president obama to continually retreat from his policy of distancing the united states from these totalitarian regimes.

many people fearful of ubi say they don't like it because it would disincentivize people from working. because who would work more if they could survive to work less. the research shows a minimal decrease in working hours, and even then, it's mostly attributed to parents, who are working less to spend more time with their children, or to students who are working less so they can study more, like myself. most people will still work extra because they want to afford their standard of living, and don't want to move.

the legislation calls for researching at least six different types of batteries to store excess wind or solar power for times when the wind doesn't blow and the sun isn't shining. that would, in theory, offer the increased energy reliability needed to replace a network of gas-fired peaker plants on the new york waterfront. those plants provide backup power when demand is high or there's a malfunction at power stations upstate.
it's hard to imagine a better moment for democrats to pass paid family and sick leave, and to do something to improve the state of childcare. the coronavirus pandemic has added a level of urgency to these issues, as paid sick leave would help reduce the spread of covid-19 and a lack of paid family leave has pushed hundreds of thousands of parents, mainly women, out of the workforce.
the drc, home to over 80 million people, has never had a peaceful democratic transition of power. president joseph kabila had delayed last month's election to choose his successor for two years. the election commission has put off releasing the voting results until at least jan. 6. in the meantime, both the ruling party and the opposition forces are claiming victory.

however, this president has gone beyond the pale, over and over again reaching new lows in his leadership of this country that i love. i cannot and will not reward him as he pushes a self-centered agenda that hurts the district i represent, endangers our country's struggles for unity and abdicates any moral authority that the rest of the world has accorded to america in the past. i hope that there will come a time soon when republicans who i respect will also understand that to be silent is to be complicit. history has always judged silence and complicity harshly in these times of moral consequence.
even if we did try to stop travel, it still happens anyway. the good news about travel that's done through official channels like flights is that you can track it and if someone does get a case, you can use some contact tracing knowing who that person traveled with and who they were around, he said. generally travel bans don't work and people find ways around them.

in 2009, then president-elect obama expressed a belief that we need to look forward as opposed to looking backwards in previewing his administration's free pass to george w. bush alumni. that view was at odds with a commitment to justice, since, by its very nature, justice is always retrospective ― crimes are committed, criminals are charged, juries or judges weigh the evidence and proceed to punish (or not) accordingly.
this must happen because it is the white conservatives who are the true victims of a liberal elite that disdains them.
with nearly 20,000 cases reported as of friday, spain overtook iran to become the world's third-hardest-hit country by the pandemic after china and italy. the madrid region accounts for 628 deaths and 7,165 cases. spanish authorities said on friday they would turn a madrid conference center into a giant makeshift military hospital for thousands of coronavirus patients.

the three biggest states in the country with unified democratic control of government are california, new york and illinois. how this trio balances its budgets affects the largest numbers of people and sets the tone for democratic governance in the country.
the saudis began this new year by executing 47 citizens on january 2, some by the barbaric method of beheading. these executions came after a total of 158 in 2015. presumably the saudi government sought to begin the year with a warning that it will not tolerate the crime of opposing the saudi regime. these executions, some of them for people who merely spoke out against the state, is a slap in the face of all those democracies in the world.
if you ask me, i don't expect the map will be online for that much longer.
suddenly flashing lights appeared behind us and we realized we were being pulled over. panicking, javier looked at me and said, no tengo papeles, or i don't have papers.

sen. elizabeth warren (d-mass.) supports withdrawing american troops from military engagements in syria and afghanistan, she told msnbc host rachel maddow on wednesday night.
your first step should be to examine your expenses and look for any nonessential spending you can cut right now.
trump and his allies say those numbers don't matter, because the tax cut will mean higher wages and more jobs ― both of which will benefit american workers. and lately trump has been touting news of one-time bonuses that companies are offering, supposedly because of the tax cut, as vindication of the gop argument.
opponents, however, including the utah restaurant association, say the law incriminates those who drink responsibly.
it remains unclear what new powers hunt will get with his new 'social care' title. the department of health is already responsible for most of the sector, although councils were passed control of community care budgets years ago and former cabinet office minister damian green had a cross-departmental role on funding the policy.
the world health organization says it temporarily dubbed this new virus 2019-ncov (pronounced 20-19 en-koh-vee), a step the who employs for very new diseases so that inappropriate names do not become established.
cuomo also announced an executive order mandating hospitals to increase their capacity by 50%, and to double if possible. he is also considering other measures, such as granting clemency to some older inmates, as reports of covid-19 outbreaks in state prisons start to rise.
another pitfall is expecting to live at the same level as your parents are at this phase in your life. remember that your parents have (hopefully) spent decades accumulating their wealth. you will get there too, if you keep your expectations in check and don't spend beyond your means now.
the unfortunate aftermath of being seen as part of a monolith of passive, soft-spoken asian women is that it becomes much more difficult to be taken seriously when we actually want to move up in the ranks. give up! it's too much work to try to get ahead and change structural inequity; just keep working twice as hard as your mediocre male peers to get half as far. it makes for good cardio. it also keeps up that pesky model minority stereotype ― the one that says that asian-americans are inclined to higher levels of socioeconomic success, and therefore no action needs to be taken to reduce the real socioeconomic disparities that exist.
the same day, in georgetown, texas, ruben tobias retrieved a handgun from his room and began firing on his girlfriend and her 15-year-old daughter. then, he turned the weapon on himself. his girlfriend escaped with injuries, but her daughter, described as a fun loving free spirited child, did not.

members of the media and political elite were sure that, with da silva and the pt seemingly discredited, a moderate, establishment figure from the center-left or center-right would emerge. but brazilians made their fatigue with the centrist establishment clear: whereas the workers' party still won more seats than any other party in congressional elections, the center-right was crushed in the first round of voting. cynicism, corruption and the pursuit of unpopular economic policies under temer had left a vacuum on the right, and along came bolsonaro to fill the void.
job search strategist melanie l. denny said this can be code for a heavy workload. it typically means there's a lot of work to do and things are always busy, so be ready to work quickly because almost everything is time-sensitive, she said. you'll have to learn fast and work fast and your job may be in jeopardy if you can't keep up.
when varma met her sister in the district jail in lucknow, she noticed that a clump of her hair was missing.
it was also difficult for ramirez-rosa to outflank garcia from the left. garcia enjoyed strong progressive credibility for taking on emanuel in 2015, and was part of the coalition of chicago politicians who backed the insurgent 1983 mayoral bid of harold washington, the windy city's first mayor.
since a new session of congress has begun, the senate-approved act and a corresponding bill in the house that's still in committee will likely have to be reintroduced.
state agencies are already making a push. last june, new york's department of public service issued a report outlining an energy storage roadmap. in december, the state's public service commission released a plan requiring utilities such as conedison to procure a total of 350 megawatts of storage as part of a broader blueprint to decrease the state's dependence on fossil-fueled peaker plants. the new york state energy research and development authority earlier vowed to conduct a study on how to move every sector in the state to 100 percent renewable energy, although politico reported last week that the report had not been made public by the end of 2018 as promised.
it will only divide us further. — rep. jim jordan (@jim_jordan) january 9, 2021
trump's bullying of warren is part of the president's record of disrespecting tribes ― like the time he made a pocahontas crack about her during a white house ceremony honoring native american world war ii veterans ― and destroying or taking their land.
but what i'm saying is, people will very publicly share these instances when they happen, of twitter saying that their address being posted doesn't violate the policy. and i'm sure you've seen some of them before. so why did candace owens' outrage about being labeled far-right compel you to address that so publicly, whereas the others might not have?
in the post, laurel weed wrote about how being married to her husband had brought her both immeasurable joy and pain. there was a void in their connection, and it wasn't just about sex, she wrote.
if your dog is outdoors much of the day for any reason, they must be protected by a dry, draft-free shelter that is large enough to allow them to move comfortably, but small enough to hold in body heat. the floor should be raised a few inches from the ground and covered with cedar shavings or straw. the doorway should be covered with waterproof burlap or heavy plastic.
the clarion call capped off sanders' roughly nine-minute response and stood in stark contrast to the humdrum address the two top democrats in congress gave immediately after trump's speech.
if successful, the legislation would be the biggest move toward granting status to people in the country illegally since president ronald reagan bestowed amnesty on nearly 3 million people in 1986. legislative efforts to overhaul immigration policy failed in 2007 and 2013.
the department of homeland security announced last week that it can waive the restrictions for journalists, humanitarian workers and people conducting business in any of the four countries -- but the exemptions are considered on a case-by-case basis and do not offer guaranteed protection to people who have these specific reasons to travel.
i quit stressing about the wreckage that is my house. i recently picked up some extra freelance work. i could put the money i'm earning into the kids' college fund, but instead i'm using it to hire a housekeeper. because i like when my house is clean, but i don't have time to clean anymore, and i'm tired of stressing about it so dammit, i quit!

rep. mario diaz-balart (r-fla.) announced wednesday that he has tested positive for covid-19. the republican congressman said he had developed symptoms of illness, including a high fever and headache, on saturday. on wednesday, he got notice he had tested positive for coronavirus. though he has been self-quarantined for several days, he was on the floor of the house voting on friday, where he presumably came in contact with other lawmakers.
republicans didn't have time for the normal legislative process — democrats say it was hard to call it a process at all. the house ways and means committee held only four hearings — two in may and two in july. but because the bill had not yet been drafted, the hearings were limited to the broadest subjects. how tax reform will grow our economy and create jobs was one. how tax reform will simplify our broken tax code was another.

denmark, for example, saw attendance from outside the eu drop by 20 percent in one year, after it introduced tuition fees for international students in 2006. sweden too saw a massive drop in international students after it introduced fees in 2011-12 - the number of international students plummeted by 80 percent. (some modest recovery has happened in recent years.)
trump has vetoed eight other bills, but those were all sustained because supporters did not gain the two-thirds vote needed in each chamber for the bills to become law without trump's signature.
― as told to alanna vagianos
when trump spoke in switzerland, weeks' worth of warning signs already had been raised. in the ensuing month, before the president first addressed the crisis from the white house, key steps to prepare the nation for the coming pandemic were not taken.
kim's comments are likely intended to pressure the incoming u.s. government of joe biden, who has previously called the north korean leader a thug and accused trump of chasing spectacle rather than meaningful curbs on the north's nuclear capabilities. kim has not ruled out talks, but said the fate of bilateral relations depends on whether washington abandons its hostile policy toward north korea.
we're not slowing it, and it's accelerating on its own, cuomo said, explaining that experts describe it not as a freight train but a bullet train.
this law is backed by scientific research, data and outcomes from over 100 countries that have already changed their laws to .05 percent bac and reduced impaired driving, she said in a statement. reducing bac limits will not discourage alcohol consumption, but it will deter dangerous drinking and driving.

theresa may's language has changed dramatically on this in the past two years. in january 2017, she uttered the infamous line that no deal is better than a bad deal. having lost the last election, she's been forced to now effectively threaten tory mps that my bad deal is better than no brexit at all.
first of all, [it's] something that mitch mcconnell has never cared about. and we've been unable to convince senate republicans to care about. second, there's not enough women in congress. that is an impediment, because, again, not all members of congress understand the disproportionate impact covid's placed onto the shoulders of women and caregivers.

jana riess, a mormon blogger, said that the subtext of both men's remarks seemed to be a reiteration of the church's position that homosexual behavior is in violation of god's commandments, but that all people are loved.
i can't emphasize enough how much a conviction affects a person's life the moment it happens. almost every application they fill out will ask, 'have you ever been convicted of a crime?' mayor jenny durkan said at the conference. while we cannot reverse all the harm that was done, we can give back to those people a record that says they were not convicted.

that americans no longer trust their institutions or elites should not be a source of wonderment ― it should be seen as a rational response to the declining trustworthiness of the people with the most power in this country. if with great power comes great responsibility, then why is our criminal justice system so focused on jailing poor people for being unable to pay fines for modest offenses or nonviolent drug possession?

since ocasio-cortez, a 29-year-old working-class democratic socialist, unexpectedly toppled powerful white male incumbent joe crowley in a june primary, she's become an object of fixation among republicans, especially republican men. conservative writer ed scarry posted a photo of her backside on twitter, questioning whether her black suit was befitting of a girl who struggles. right-wing media discovered that she ― like a lot of people named alexander, alexandra or some variant thereof ― went by the nickname sandy in high school. a self-proclaimed proud christian dad on twitter circulated a video of her dancing in a t-shirt in college as if it would be a career-damaging revelation. a republican strategist referred to her as the little girl on fox news, which runs segments about her constantly.

when a great crime is committed, society can only move on when those responsible have been held accountable. this is a basic tenet not only of criminal law, but of truth and reconciliation commissions and other projects aimed at national healing. what exactly constitutes accountability and responsibility are, of course, dependent on the nature of the crime and the roles different figures played in its execution. but the principle is based on the idea that to be forgiven, one must first acknowledge responsibility and, in many cases, endure punishment. without accountability, social wounds will not heal, but fester.

in another crackdown friday, youtube shuttered the war room podcast and an associated channel of onetime white house strategist steve bannon for repeatedly violating our community guidelines, a youtube spokesperson said in a statement. the guidelines bar videos from presenting lies about the 2020 election. the plug was pulled shortly after trump's personal attorney rudy giuliani again lied about the presidential election, baselessly claiming it had been rigged.

republicans chose a different approach for their 2017 bill. that year congressional republicans were under tremendous pressure from trump, his base, and their wealthiest donors to do two big things: repeal obamacare and enact tax cuts by the end of the year. their first legislative effort failed. on july 28, the effort to repeal obamacare died with a no vote by sen. john mccain, r-ariz.
recognizing that kids are expensive and that raising them presents obstacles to employment, most other countries pay parents a child benefit or child allowance. the u.s. could get there, however backwardly, through a set of changes to its complicated system of tax credits.

weddings are not cheap — especially for the bridal party. it's perfectly acceptable to tell a bride you simply can't afford to splurge on a dress, bachelorette party and a flight to her destination wedding right now. just try to avoid any passive aggressive notes that will make her feel worse, i would be if you didn't choose a $500 bridesmaid abomination. instead, you might have to be a bit more open about your finances than you might want to be. but your openness will help your friend empathize with your situation more.

in the real world: a major goal for my team and i is to produce videos answering business transformation questions for executives. vlogging is a new endeavor for us and the initial videos have been far from perfect. the fact is that we could have scrutinized and re-shot it many times and still not achieve perfection. however, we value the message as more important than the actual delivery. we trust that over time, with practice, our process and end-result would organically improve. by finding the balance between criticism and acceptance, we are able to move forward. one of sheryl sandberg's favorite mottos (which is prominently displayed on the walls at facebook) is, done is better than perfect... aiming for perfection causes frustration at best and paralysis at worst.
roughly 400,000 federal workers have been furloughed since parts of the government shut down last month. another 400,000 have been forced to work without pay. democrats quickly passed legislation to reopen the closed government agencies after taking back control of the house on thursday. but senate majority leader mitch mcconnell (r-ky.) vowed to block the bill, and trump said he would veto it.

the narrative arc must bend back from prey toward powerful leadership once more. we must learn to braid these notions together and find a place for progress within them, to build a reality for women and men alike that reflects our truth and our potential. (we saw an excellent example of this when oprah winfrey spoke at the golden globes this month, connecting recy taylor's rape to rosa parks's radicalism to her own place on that stage. such personified leadership aroused the public's vapors clamoring for a presidential run from, yes, another television star.) we've got a lot more to break than just silence: we must redefine the very notion of what women are and what men are, and how we can share not just our bedrooms and break rooms, but power itself.

dorsey's initial response was we didn't add that, before trying to explain it away as people gaming the system. twitter's algorithm promoting misinformation isn't some grand manipulation of the platform, though. it's the platform doing what it was built for. it makes sense, then, that dorsey finds himself unable to talk about specific solutions. how can you fix something when you're not even sure what the actual problem is?
at first, when he won the election, i felt like nothing i had said or did mattered. i was devastated. today, his fan base continues to hate me. i get hateful messages on social media. some folks have thanked me. some of the other women who came out against him have reached out to me in support. for me, the decision to speak out was a fork in the road of my life. i had always been somewhat of an activist, but coming forward set me on a path i won't turn back from.
such a surge would substantially benefit sanders, who has consolidated younger voters in the state after many considered warren and buttigieg earlier in the cycle. the same poll finds him winning the support of 39% of iowa democrats under 35, compared to 19% for warren and 14% for buttigieg. biden earns the support of just 7% of younger democrats, even trailing entrepreneur andrew yang.

casey's judgment isn't a reflection of biden, or his deal-making skills. it's a reflection of a congress ― and especially a senate ― that is almost universally regarded as broken, riven by partisanship, allergic to compromise, in hock to donors on both sides of the aisle and incapable of passing all but the most essential pieces of legislation. casey blames this decay on an extraordinarily right-wing republican party, an analysis backed up by many nonpartisan analysts of the legislative branch.

the trump legacy will include: the most corrupt administration in american history, the grandest handover of policymaking to corporations of all time, the most overt and vicious racism and anti-immigrant xenophobia of any administration in modern times, unparalleled incompetence, cruelty and callousness in its mismanagement of the pandemic, and rushing the globe toward climate catastrophe at the exact moment when the world needed the united states to pivot away from fossil fuel reliance, said robert weissman, president of the liberal group public citizen. there's a long list of 'accomplishments,' far beyond these lowlights.

the fight for $15, which is funded by the service employees international union, has challenged that entire premise. it argues that mcdonald's really is the boss inside stores, exerting control over workers through the menu, the supplies and uniforms, the training materials, and even computer programs that determine labor costs. the franchise model, it says, merely helps the company shirk its duties to workers, by shifting legal liabilities onto franchisees when workers get shorted on pay or fired for union activism.

but zero cost-sharing could also encourage people to get care they don't need, which could mean unnecessary (and potentially harmful) tests and treatments, all while driving up costs throughout the system. purely from a budgetary standpoint, the federal government would have to spend a lot more money if it's assuming responsibility for every single dollar on every single medical bill for every single american.

in 2011, they made one of their most consequential investments: a reported $10 million in a new right-wing media operation called breitbart. i don't know any of your fancy friends, robert mercer told sheldon adelson, and i haven't got any interest in knowing them. that the family gravitated toward andrew breitbart's upstart website was no accident. the mercers are purists, says pat caddell, a former aide to jimmy carter who has shifted to the right over the years. they believe republican elites are too cozy with wall street and too soft on immigration, and that american free enterprise and competition are in mortal danger. bekah mercer might be prepared to put a democrat in susan collins' seat simply to rid the party of susan collins, a family friend joked by way of illustrating her thinking. so intensely do the mercers want to unseat republican senator john mccain[2] 2. some have speculated that mccain may have angered the mercers in 2014, when the senate permanent subcommittee on investigations, on which mccain was the ranking member at the time, asserted that renaissance had used complex financial methods to underestimate its taxes by $6 billion. renaissance has told the new york times its tax practices are lawful. that they gave $200,000 to support an opposing candidate who once held a town hall meeting to discuss chemtrails—chemicals, according to a long-standing conspiracy theory, that the federal government is spraying on the public without its knowledge.

as for potential violations of ethics rules, canter said there do not appear to be any. the trump administration's ethics pledge bars political appointees from participating in certain matters involving former employers or clients for two years, but defines former employer as someone for whom the official worked within two years of their appointment. jorjani left the charles koch foundation and charles koch institute, where he'd worked with hooks, in january 2012.

by far the clearest example of this is the tax cut and jobs act, which the republican congress passed and trump signed in december. the legislation showers the vast majority of its benefits on businesses, investors and the wealthy ― by permanently reducing taxes for corporations, the owners of pass-through businesses, and holders of large estates. and although it also lowers some taxes for lower- and middle-income households, those cuts are smaller and temporary.

congress can also enact new policies in the farm bill to address key drivers of food waste, such as clarifying and standardizing confusing best by and sell by date labels. currently, manufacturers have broad discretion over date labels and use a wide array of mystifying phrases that generally indicate a product's quality, not safety. misinterpretation of these labels by consumers, businesses, and even regulators (who in some states restrict the sale or donation of such safe, wholesome food) puts more food in landfills. the upcoming farm bill is the perfect opportunity to establish a system that limits date labeling language to two standard options, a quality date and a safety date, cutting down both consumer confusion and wasted food. industry groups are already on board—the food marketing institute and grocery manufacturers association recently announced a voluntary initiative to just use two standardized date labels: a standard best if used by for quality and use by for safety—and federal legislation can ensure this standard takes root nationally.

while many speech codes are absurd, fighting them—even at colleges bound by the first amendment—has required more than 60 lawsuits since 1989. and all of the 56 suits that have concluded have resulted in either a speech-protective court decision or the repeal of the speech code.
biden isn't ruling out a legislative pathway. in the $1.7 trillion climate plan he released in 2019, which set a goal of achieving net-zero emissions by 2050, biden said he will demand that congress enacts legislation in the first year of his presidency to establish a system for achieving that 2050 target. he said he will call on congress to make huge investments in energy and climate research and incentivize a rapid shift toward clean energy technologies.
for now, though, the tactic seems to be democrats' best hand before trump's national address and trip to the border later this week.
the administration has aggressively rolled back environmental and climate regulations, including president barack obama's clean power plan, a policy limiting greenhouse gas emissions from power plants. at interior, zinke overturned an obama-era moratorium on new coal leases on federal land, scrapped a hydraulic fracturing rule meant to better protect public health and curtailed a rule limiting the amount of methane that can be released from oil and gas operations on federal and native american lands.

because there is no public support for a federal european union, many have envisaged alternative ways to fix the euro. the ceo of the european stability mechanism (esm) klaus regling has proposed that euro could be saved by a combination of the banking and capital market union and a rainy day fund. this fund would allegedly be used when asymmetric shocks occur. the fund would be financed jointly by all euro countries. however, because of the persistent differences in competitiveness, its transfers would become permanent, like in the us. only the most competitive members of the eurozone would have sufficient income to finance the fund. any financing through the european central bank (ecb), would need to be covered by european tax-payers later, when it would become evident that weaker countries are unable to pay back their loans and when seigniorage revenues would be unable to cover the losses of the ecb.
but what if we took the concept of teacher autonomy one step further? pressing for collective autonomy--where groups of teachers work collaboratively to make school-level decisions about a variety of factors--has even greater potential to benefit students. and to make teaching a more attractive career path. given my own experiences as a mother of three and a teacher leadership advocate, i fear that autonomy for individual teachers won't empower them enough to bring forth the school cultures we need for all students to learn.
this time, though, the military was not coming to depose a president; it was rolling through celebrations of a new one. jair bolsonaro, a federal congressman and former army captain, had just won the election to become brazil's 38th president.

president donald trump has tweeted his support for the demonstrations against the brutal and corrupt iranian regime. his administration also criticized former president barack obama's shameful inaction during the 2009 unrest (while simultaneously banning iranians from entering the u.s.).
the proposed new rules would make it harder to prevent that abuse from happening and harder to hold schools and perpetrators accountable when it does. they would ignore the low-level sexual misconduct like inappropriate comments or groping that research tells us is a precursor to child sexual abuse. they would also create safe spaces for abusers by limiting schools' responsibility to address sexual assaults that happen off-campus, even when a child is assaulted by a classmate or teacher. they would even interfere in the neutral, fact-finding investigative process by subjecting child victims to cross-examination by their abusers, ensuring that the process of seeking justice and support services is as traumatic as possible and discouraging victims from coming forward.

dairy is one. on dairy, it is not an issue of tariffs but certification. india has been saying that the american dairy products can surely come into india, but they have to assure the indian consumer via packaging, that none of the products that are up for sale are procured from animals that have been fed blood meal. blood meal is a protein supplement that the american dairy industry uses to get greater yield from their cattle. it is derived from dead ruminating animals, dead bones, dead blood and so on. india is putting the argument that it hurts our religious sentiments if products like that are going to be up for sale and no one is going to buy them. so, the u.s. dairy industry needs to create a different production line just to cater to the indian market. a production line in which cattle have not been fed blood meal and reinvest in a specific packaging for the indian market. that is what their dairy industry has not been willing to do.

napoleon also probably would have been perplexed at the criticism of obama over the syrian episode. napoleon, certainly no wimp, thought that the ultimate achievement for any military commander was to get an adversary to capitulate without ever having to use force. in other words, why waste lives, ammunition, and other resources fighting when smart maneuvering could achieve the same result.

right now, florida is considering passing a sweeping anti-immigrant piece of legislation known as hb9. florida house speaker richard corcoran (r) sponsored the bill that is designed to serve as a two-prong political strategy for his own benefit. first, hb9 is nothing but an unapologetic attack on immigrant communities, currently being promoted via an unapologetically racist television ad, aimed at capitalizing on trump's and miller's white nationalist view of america. the second goal of hb9 is to paint corcoran as a no-nonsense conservative, allowing him to boost his political image even if his xenophobic bill tanks in the state legislature.

although 95 percent of people who own homes carry homeowners insurance, only 41 percent of renters have renters insurance, according to the insurance information institute, which put the annual cost of a policy at an average of $188 in 2015. one reason for the disparity is that mortgage lenders often require homeowners to carry insurance on a property they're financing, while there is usually no such equivalency when leasing a property owned by someone else. but just because no one is making renters buy insurance, is that actually a reason not to? unfortunately, the value of insurance often eludes us until we need it. here are some things to consider if you're debating whether renters insurance is right for you: 1. how valuable are your belongings? there's a good chance you would weep harder if an airline lost your suitcase containing all your favorite clothes than if something wrecked your thrift store sofa. but what about a fire that comes along and destroys your apartment, wiping out all of your belongings and leaving you with ash and rubble? how much would it cost you to replace everything you lost? most people think only of their big-ticket items like electronics and furniture. but the average renter owns $30,000 worth of possessions, according to allstate. when you add up the value of all of your stuff, you may find that you would not be financially able to replace everything at once. generally speaking, the older you are, the more possessions you've acquired.

h.r. 1 would require states to create independent commissions that would be responsible for drawing congressional districts. state lawmakers currently have the power to draw districts once a decade, and both parties have manipulated that process to their advantage. in 2011, republicans saw an opportunity to take control of state legislatures, control the redistricting process and lock in an electoral advantage for the next decade. they executed that plan extremely precisely and well.

lilly irani, a google user experience designer from 2003 to 2007, said that even a decade ago, the contractor system created a hierarchical system where contractors were promised inclusion among the full-timers in exchange for taking depressed wages, strainingly competitive work circumstances and strict disciplinary structures. full-time google workers like me at the time were usually unaware of this tiered system unless we were friends with people on the other side.

that's a big problem because students aren't confined to one classroom. nearly all interact with many teachers and other adults in the course of a day, week, and year. even elementary schoolers go to physical education or music class with specialty teachers. they work with aides. they go to the lunchroom where they interact cafeteria workers. they go to the front office. and eventually, they go into a new grade level and yet another teacher's classroom. but there are very few connections between these adults for the benefit of my children.

the view was also a political calamity ― obama's governance strategy of burying the broadly accepted failures of the bush presidency created a path for bush's enablers in congress to secure historic victories in the 2010 midterms. and the obama administration's failure to prosecute bankers and other elites responsible for economic cataclysm added fuel to the fire of resentment that led so many americans to the tea party, and ultimately, trumpism.

while there have been a variety of additions and enhancement to us economic and social policy since women's suffrage in the 1920s and the rise of civil rights activism for ethnic and racial minorities beginning in the 1950s, there still are a number of items that must be addressed so that the foundations on which historically disadvantaged groups may be established more consistently. social and economic policy took a somewhat sharp conservative turn in the 1980s, and with it slowed down the environmental policy-making progress typified in the 1970s. during this time, despite the advances, environmental conservation was missing in social and economic policies. social and economic issues, while provided as reasons for various environmental policies like the clean water act and the clean air act, mostly paid lip service to social and economic issues.

in 2015, usda and epa announced the first-ever u.s. food waste reduction goal—a bold and aggressive goal of halving our food waste by 2030. if the federal government doesn't invest in food waste reduction, then we will fail to hit the mark. it is time for congress to tackle the issue of food waste in the u.s.; a farm bill that remains silent on the topic is a missed opportunity to break our food waste habit and achieve significant social, environmental, and economic benefits in return.

the saudi effort to sustain the life of their regime is broad and profound. for decades, saudi arabia has spent billions of dollars for madrasas and mosques that spread their wahhabi brand of islam, and has funneled comparable sums to insurgents such as the al-qaeda, the islamic state, and jubhat al-nusra directly and indirectly through covert operations. the saudis support all those who oppose assad in syria. they seek to sway the outcome of sudan's civil war and install their puppet regime in yemen.

the invariable objection to exercising the government's sovereign money-creating power is that it would lead to hyperinflation, but these figures belie that assumption. if adding €100 billion for infrastructure increases gdp by €232 billion, prices should actually go down rather than up, since the supply of goods and services (gdp) would have increased more than twice as fast as demand (money). conventional theory says that prices go up when too much money is chasing too few goods, and in this case the reverse would be true.
with scott's signature, vermont will join eight other legal-weed states, as well as washington, d.c., in a growing movement away from federal law, which still classifies marijuana as a schedule i substance, alongside heroin and lsd. vermont legalized medical marijuana in 2004, and is currently among nearly 30 states, plus the territories of guam and puerto rico, and the district of columbia, with such programs in place.

i believe the most critical precaution one can take is to pre-board the aircraft in order to be able to thoroughly clean the area from the last occupant. this becomes even more important if the airline you have chosen serves your allergen. children are especially likely to put their hands in their mouths. those of us without food allergies worry about the germ factor on planes, but for a food allergic person, what was eaten before we boarded is potentially lethal if we touch it and then ingest it.
an antidote emerged: channeling those passions by engaging in market transactions, and believing that such acts, while competitive, would contribute to the common good. the invisible hand would ensure that all market activities, however self-interested, would lead to a net benefit for society as a whole. taming the passions and trusting in providence -- or, better, in the market god of equilibrium -- thus became key virtues of capitalism.

as her former press secretary paul harrison wrote recently: may never succumbed to foul language even under the greatest of stress. however, the news i had just delivered – that ultimately saw penny mordaunt appointed international development secretary – led to probably the fruitiest expression i ever heard her say. it wasn't the first time patel had enraged a prime minister, either, having been given a furious dressing down by david cameron for her role in vote leave in the run-up to the 2016 eu referendum, which catapulted her into the limelight. huffpost uk understands that cameron was exasperated with patel's role in the campaign because she was repeatedly attacking policies that featured in the tory manifesto on which she had been elected just a year previously. it eventually cost her promotion to the cabinet – as employment minister she would have been a natural replacement for iain duncan smith as work and pensions secretary when he quit – because cameron did not want to reward bad behaviour.

no, not at all. we did a bunch of conversations with the folks in the media that we — that certainly i — have never talked to before. so in the past, we do tend to stick with more of the financial press or the tech press. both of which tend to be more on the other side of the spectrum. so, our default is probably to go to that, so we don't inherently reach out to everyone and talk to everyone. so one is having conversations, two is getting as much perspective as possible. to me, i think it's useful to hear perspective, even if i don't believe it, just to hear what other people are saying. i value that, so i'm not going to stop. but it's not an agenda to mollify, it's an agenda to listen and hear, like, what's being said and why it's being said.

americans, raised on action movies, seem to think the nation will be seen as weak internationally if it is not constantly bombing someone, leading presidential candidates, in a democracy, to give the public what it demands -- macho hot air. of course, this disease among the people leads the nation to an exhausting state of perpetual war for no good reason. many other empires have gone into the graveyard of history because of such exhaustion -- both financial and psychological -- all the while believing that they were special and that it could never happen to them. unfortunately, with a nearly $19 trillion national debt, promises to defend many nations all over the world, a costly far-flung worldwide military apparatus, and ubiquitous armed interventions in unimportant places such as syria, the american empire, without a major retraction and renewal, will likely travel down the same road to ruin.
last week watson told bbc radio 4 that the current chaos in the tory party meant that there may be no parliamentary majority for theresa may's chequers compromise plan for brexit. even though we'd prefer a meaningful vote in parliament – and i have said many, many times it's highly, highly, highly unlikely we will support a people's vote, and we have not called for it – we haven't taken that off the table. because there are a rare set of circumstances where parliament just can't make a decision on it and, in those circumstances, you'd keep your options open. demands for a 'people's vote' on the final brexit deal hammered out with brussels have intensified in recent months and greening has been joined by 'remainer' tories anna soubry and dominic grieve in backing the idea. no.10 firmly dismissed the proposal but the liberal democrats, snp and large numbers of labour activists want a fresh vote because the original eu referendum did not specify which type of brexit the uk would get.

not hardly. your policy may have an overall ceiling on the total amount it will pay out per claim, and may also set limits on individual categories of loss. for example, there may be a cap on jewelry. if that's the case and grandma's diamond ring is stolen from your apartment, your policy may limit your claim to $1,000, even though the ring was valued at $3,000. the way to get around these limits is to have a personal property endorsement for extra coverage on an item. and yes, that will cost more.

in a way, ocasio-cortez is the most formidable opponent to president donald trump the democratic party has put forth yet. she has even more of a knack for social media than america's first twitter president; she's anti-establishment like he is; she breaks all the rules of how a politician is supposed to behave; and she has an undeniably strong emotional appeal.

obviously it's too simplistic to say these textbooks are causing people to think something, but they play a unique role in giving visual credibility to these ideas by having them be in a very traditionally trustworthy artifact, said adam laats, professor of history and education at new york state's binghamton university. there's a sense that they couldn't put it in a schoolbook if it wasn't true.

for the first march in 2017, the shock of trump's election and the fear that that carried was great enough to hold that coalition together, but it would be kind of miraculous if that had held over time, said nancy whittier, a sociology professor at smith college. the women's march has to figure out: is it a broad anti-trump mobilization? is it around intersectional feminism and not necessarily trump? is it around specific issues like sexual violence? the march has kind of been all of those things so far.

monday's decision caps a five-year legal fight brought by six youth activists from boulder county. the activists, led by xiuhtezcatl martinez, filed a petition with the state's oil and gas regulatory body in 2013 asking that new permits be suspended until a comprehensive scientific study could show that new activity would be safe. when the petition was denied, the activists sued and ultimately won a favorable decision in the martinez case in the state's appeals court last spring.

to sanders, the loss of that endorsement to warren was especially biting because his political director, analilia mejia, was a former head of the new jersey working families party. several people with a say in wfp's endorsement process told huffpost at the time that warren's team had simply put in more work for it, with sanders forgoing the opportunity to address wfp delegates in a private address in which warren and former housing secretary julián castro participated.
the polarization isn't entirely the result of the corruption investigation ― on the left and the right, the parties of implicated politicians have spent years trying to discredit car wash. temer repeatedly attempted to curtail it; congress tried to kill new anti-corruption legislation in the middle of the night; da silva and the pt decried it as an elite effort to destroy the left, which wasn't entirely true, given that a rash of politicians from other parties were removed from office and sent to prison, too.

according to beijing sources familiar with the chinese government information on wednesday, there used to be two main political factions within the ccp leadership competing for power, influence and control over policy initiatives. they are the communist youth league faction and the shanghai faction. they deserved to be the main powers since the youth league faction produced former president hu jintao and premier li keqiang, and the shanghai faction produced former president jiang zemin. their close allies monopolized key positions of the ruling party. but now it is not easy to find high ranking officials of these factions in the office of the ruling party. it's because most of them have been relegated to less important posts as a result of a recent reshuffle. chinese vice chair li yuanchao, who is widely considered to be a protégé of hu jintao, is even embroiled in rumors of losing his post.

in the 1990s at the request of the united nations, nato became involved in the bosnian conflict. the first peacekeeping experience of the allies in the region, but it was firmly criticized and opposed by serbia and nato's adversaries. finally, nato's cooperation in the balkan peninsula de-escalated the conflicts. the region experienced years of conflicts, but the presence of a nato-led forces have minimized the clashes and casualties. today most of these nations live in harmony. the allies consider forbidding the revival of nationalist militarism in the balkan peninsula as a historic achievement.

your child is not allowed to discuss specifics of the test with anyone, so there will be no after-test conversation that would help her glean lessons through reflection. your child will not get any specific feedback telling her which answers she got right, and which she got wrong. you will not get any feedback on the test except a single blanket score between 4 (super-duper) and 1 (not so great). once this test is done, you will not know anything about your child that you did not already know.

we have programs like calfresh and calworks to support low-income families, but despite being a clear necessity, direct diaper assistance remains 100% non-governmental. low-income parents have to rely on a network of diaper banks, food banks, social service agencies, community and faith based groups, because government assistance programs like food stamps and calfresh do not cover diapers. unfortunately, this blind spot is getting worse.

almost everyone interviewed for this article, supporters and detractors alike, described her style as far more forceful than that of other powerful donors. rebekah mercer is rarely photographed. however, occasionally she can be found in the background of news photos, uncredited in the captions. here she is arriving at trump tower on december 8, with nick ayers and kellyanne conway. drew angerer/getty images but then the mercers aren't typical donors in most senses beyond their extreme wealth. (the exact number of their billions is unknown.) robert mercer is a youthful-looking 70. as a boy growing up in new mexico, he carried around a notebook filled with computer programs he had written. it's very unlikely that any of them actually worked, he has said. i didn't get to use a real computer until after high school. robert went on to work for decades at ibm, where he had a reputation as a brilliant computer scientist. he made his vast fortune in his 50s, after his work on predicting financial markets led to his becoming co-ceo of renaissance technologies, one of the world's most successful quantitative hedge funds. a longtime colleague, david magerman, recalls that when robert began working at renaissance in 1993, he and his wife, diana, were grounded, sweet people. (magerman was suspended from renaissance in february after making critical comments about robert in the wall street journal.) but money changed all that, he says. diana started jetting off to europe and flying to their yacht on weekends.

i think it took a lot of us by surprise. and not just because it is the capital city, mathews said. but the fact that these notices have been a longstanding requirement in the terms and conditions of telecom licenses - so if the government gives us any orders for internet shutdowns, we are obligated to comply otherwise our licenses could come under scrutiny even leading to possible cancellations.

activist groups like colorado rising have asked polis for a moratorium on new drilling, which is unlikely to happen, but they say they're encouraged that democrats could reinvigorate that debate. democrats have discussed a number of potential bills that would codify the demands of the martinez case or give local communities more power to say no to drilling (a state supreme court decision in 2016 barred townships and counties from passing fracking bans). as with the 2014 commission, any new debate is likely to be closely watched by states like texas and pennsylvania, which are dealing with their own fracking booms.

2. be strong without being harsh. strength is an important quality in a leader. people will wait to see if a leader is strong before they decide to follow his or her lead or not. people need courage in their leaders. they need someone who can make difficult decisions and watch over the good of the group. they need a leader who will stay the course when things get tough. people are far more likely to show strength themselves when their leader does the same. a lot of leaders mistake domineering, controlling, and otherwise harsh behavior for strength. they think that taking control and pushing people around will somehow inspire a loyal following. strength isn't something you can force on people; it's something you earn by demonstrating it time and again in the face of adversity. only then will people trust that they should follow you.

the inauguration of president joe biden is expected to bring a return to the paris climate agreement, immigration reform, economic relief and more. on a less policy and more pawlicy-focused note, biden's swearing-in to the highest office in the land also marks a return of dogs to the white house.
others couldn't help but poke fun at trump losing access to a platform where he so often went off the rails. his penchant for tweeting throughout the day and late into the night ― sometimes to reveal major policy decisions or announce white house shakeups ― has become a defining characteristic of his presidency.
the call for a criminal investigation is among the strong reactions lawmakers and watchdog groups have expressed about the phone call. but democrats and outside groups differ on how to hold trump accountable for his misdeeds.

there's no language in the irs plan for a shutdown that calls for payments to be withheld or delayed, williams said. filing deadlines most certainly still apply, and the irs takes postmarks very seriously.

cooperation, not cold war, with china
vagins noted that other countries, including france, china, australia and greenland, reported increased rates of domestic violence once they implemented shelter-in-place policies. natural disasters in the past have also corresponded to increased rates of domestic violence. after hurricane harvey hit houston in 2017, for example, domestic violence murders spiked.

it was kind of a macho thing, 'step out in the hall, mano a mano,' downs said. it was weird.
as always, women are cast as one thing or another, never both. and this year we've gone from the heights of heretofore unknown leadership, desexualized and fearsome, to the ancient trope of sexualized victimhood. as chimamanda ngozi adichie has said, in talking about what she calls the danger of the single story, the trouble with stereotypes isn't that they're wrong, it's that they're incomplete. this year, we traded in one incomplete story, albeit one of extraordinary power, for another ― this one of extraordinary (and all too ordinary) victimhood. we flooded our prismatic channels of conversation with stories of abuse and harassment, drowning some of the most powerful men who shape our very culture.
this supplemental testimony will allow the senate to see further corroborative evidence as it considers articles of impeachment, a democratic official working on the senate trial said in a statement to reporters. if declassified, it would provide the public further understanding of the events in question.

ossoff and warnock have countered with warnings that a republican senate will stymie biden's administration, especially on pandemic relief.
this attitude helped to build and create the republican party coalition that won five out of six presidential elections from 1968 to 1988 and control of both chambers of congress in 1994. but since then the party has increasingly relied on either non-democratic or un-representative elements of the american political system, such as the electoral college, the u.s. senate, the judicial branch and gerrymandering, to gain and hold power. the most glaring statistic to show this is that republicans have now lost the popular vote in seven out of the last eight presidential races. they also have now lost the popular vote in four successive presidential elections, a feat surpassed only by the five straight wins by democrats franklin roosevelt and harry truman. conservatives, and specifically white conservatives, are increasingly a political minority. and they know it.

amid pressure to demonstrate that a 2020 campaign would not repeat the same mistakes, sanders' former campaign manager, jeff weaver, announced wednesday that he would not be returning in that role for a second run. sanders has also apologized for the mistreatment of some women and promised that his campaign team has already taken steps to improve.
it might prohibit some of the unnecessary filing, balli said. he turned to the representative from the attorney general's office.
there have been some positive steps from this government. the recent announcement on sexual and reproductive rights and health was a welcome shift in priorities. but a closer look at the details reveals that the money announced to great fanfare on international women's day is actually not new money: it will be taken from the existing canadian aid budget. that's not good enough.
we were ready; you are not.
due to the concentration of black households affected by the furlough, majority-black counties should brace themselves for acute harms. county workers, like teachers and police officers, won't be furloughed, but they are at risk if the recession is protracted and the county's revenue declines because furloughed federal workers reduce their economic activity and perhaps even experience downward economic mobility as they become unable to pay for household expenses.
he appears to have misrepresented the facts to congress, virginia canter, chief ethics counsel at the watchdog group citizens for responsibility and ethics in washington, told huffpost in an email. that raises the question of whether he knowingly gave a false statement under oath ― in other words, committed perjury. jorjani did qualify his statement with the phrase to the best of my recollection.
the world's longest undefended border is no longer open for routine, casual traffic between canada and the united states.
by 2015, 146 countries had implemented such support schemes.
undeniably, policymakers have ample precedent for the detrimental effects of government dictating rail routes and pricing. so too, as wilner notes, do the most vocal proponents of forced access.

like many students, campbell took the test more than once in an effort to improve her scores. while she scored a 900 the first time she took it, she improved her score by 330 to 1230, a score high enough to earn a scholarship for students graduating from florida high schools. but rather than celebrating, campbell has been battling the educational testing service (ets), a nonprofit organization that administers the sat on behalf of the college board.

teachers like my children's have the knowledge, skills, and definitely the will to make decisions that will improve student learning. but in isolation--empowered only to make choices about their own classrooms, if that--teachers in most american schools will still have to fight the system in order to do just a sliver of what they have the capacity to do. what we, as communities, want them to do. what their students so desperately need them to do.
right now, democrats seem to be just as locked into their position as trump. on tuesday, a group from the house declined the president's offer for a lunch meeting, though there were reports that behind-the-scenes talks were happening.
these food ads push foods that contribute to obesity, only worsening a public health crisis that disproportionately affects communities of color, said study author jennifer harris of the rudd center.

the trump administration's family separation policy is more than a bureaucratic lapse in judgment. it is and was a cruel policy inconsistent with the values of this nation, said senator dick durbin (d-ill.) in a statement. it's inconceivable that the government of the united states chose to secretly separate thousands of children from their parents or guardians, was unable or unwilling to reunite these families for months due to incompetent leadership and poor planning, and still doesn't know how many children were separated.
he said the federal government will deploy teams to support states doing mass vaccination efforts if they wish to do so.
the president's senior white house adviser and son-in-law told sky news arabia wednesday about the work he's put in to develop the proposal for the region.
but the congressional budget office has been much more conservative about the efficacy of government spending during the pandemic, assuming that only a fraction of every federal dollar will actually result in economic output. based on the cbo's more cautious estimates, the latest stimulus legislation is a stunning $6.8 trillion short of february 2020.

politicians and cable tv news anchors have been unabashedly mocking warren since she announced her dna test results. in an october speech at a glitzy new york city dinner, outgoing u.n. ambassador nikki haley joked that when trump found out she was indian-american, he asked me if i was from the same tribe as elizabeth warren. cnn's don lemon and chris cuomo called haley's jokes hilarious and appropriate. fox news' tucker carlson's coverage has been dripping with racism. last month sen. rand paul (r-ky.) tweeted a photo of a wooden teepee and said he was looking for warren but couldn't find her.
sanders' relationship with the party has notably softened since that first presidential run. he served on the senate democrats' leadership team and his 2016 campaign managed to push the democratic national committee to change rules around superdelegates, lessening the power of party insiders in the nominating process.
however much you tip your uber driver, it's probably not enough. and however much uber pays its drivers, it's almost definitely not enough, either.
the year ahead offers much excitement, and freight rail will be a part of much of the action. we hope that discussions can be more productive, focusing on how to make businesses and the tax code more competitive or improving a beleaguered regulatory system; not on advancing questionable policy at the direct behest of narrow yet powerful interests.

arbitration agreements have become highly controversial for the way they hamstring employees and weaken their legal power. by sending disputes to an arbitrator, they force workers to pursue their claims individually and outside of court, preempting any collective action. and even though they're supposed to be neutral third parties, arbitrators are often cozy with the companies that workers are squaring off with, as the new york times detailed in a recent series.
she could have recalled parliament last week or she could have delayed until tomorrow when parliament returns itself, he said.
the new jim crow chronicles how people of color are shut out of society by mass incarceration, the letter states. that the very prisoners who experience the worst racial disparity in incarceration in the country should be prohibited from reading a book whose precise purpose is to examine and educate about that disparity adds insult to injury.
as for whether or not it can be verified as a world record, a spokesman for the world meteorological organization told the washington post it doesn't officially keep track of monthly extremes. but weather extremes expert christopher burt says it's likely the hottest record ever set on earth, an assessment the u.n. agency said it has no reason to doubt.
robinson also rebuked kobach and his team throughout the day for not following usual procedures for entering documents as evidence, at one point having to remind them that they should know something because it was evidence 101. at another point in the afternoon, lawyers and robinson had to sort through the confusion of a reply-all email thread because the court had incorrect email addresses for kobach and some of his team and aclu lawyers had sent documents to those incorrect addresses.

in fact, running a test-centered school system doesn't just affect how time in school is used, but how the school is actually structured. middle schools in particular may feel the push in test-centered districts (though i had a hard time finding current research about middle school structure trends, and i've folded in anecdotal through-the-grapevine stuff here). one tradition of middle schools is for 7th and 8th grade, but that leaves the whole school ranking based on the results of eighth grade testing. so districts may feel test-based pressure to move sixth and even fifth graders under the middle school roof to help with school ratings, or shift to old school k-8 schools, sidestepping the middle school rating issue entirely.
women said this would happen, noted rachel o'leary carmona, the executive director of the women's march. this is exactly who we knew trump to be. this is exactly who we said he was. and this is exactly why we got him out of office. because this attempted coup is just the beginning of what he could have done if he got another four years.
if a case is identified, the ministry will convene several co-ordination and communication processes, including the clinical team treating the case to ensure they have the scientific and technical expertise and support that they need. we will also share communications with our broader health-system partners for their situational awareness, david jensen, a spokesman for ontario's ministry of health, said before the virus reached the province.
we're excited to see so many 2020 hopefuls and 2020 potential candidates embracing the idea of a green new deal, corbin trent, a spokesman for ocasio-cortez, said by phone friday. we hope to further define the scope and scale of what the green new deal is and what it can do for our economy and our country.

chip somodevilla via getty images barack obama's governance strategy of burying the broadly accepted failures of the bush presidency created a path for bush's enablers in congress to secure historic victories in the 2010 midterms.
population density — the number of people per square mile — roughly measures how close people live to each other. it doesn't measure the type of work they do, the frequency of their face-to-face interactions or how often they go to church. since march, the coronavirus has struck dozens of rural areas via meatpacking facilities, prisons and superspreader events. homes being spaced far apart does not prevent the activities that actually spread the virus.
the government on wednesday advised that australians do not travel to italy after italian premier giuseppe conte enforced a lockdown on the whole country. it is the worst-affected country after china and is at the highest level of warning on dfat's four-level advice scale.

we did not see aboriginal and torres strait islander cultures and peoples as the gift they are, a gift which should have been honored but which was cast aside, disparaged and ridiculed, he said. on the 10th anniversary of the national apology to the stolen generations, i extend my respect and on behalf of all honorable members to all those aboriginal and torres strait islander people who despite immeasurable pain have survived.
kamin also told reporters at the time that biden would like congress to work to cancel $10,000 in debt for all federal student loan borrowers, but did not provide details on other actions the president could take or would like to see. other leaders within the democratic party, including sen. elizabeth warren (d-mass.), have pushed for canceling $50,000 in debt for all student loan borrowers through executive order.

pay-go is terrible economic policy. and i am voting what i believe is my conscience on the issue, khanna told huffpost.
one area of apparent disagreement was on the question of the boycott, divestment and sanctions movement to end the israeli occupation of the palestinian territories. in september, ramirez-rosa's refusal to renounce the nonviolent movement cost him a spot as running mate in state sen. daniel biss' democratic gubernatorial run. garcia condemned bds unequivocally in a december interview with huffpost, and volunteered it unprompted as an area of policy disagreement between the two candidates.

but none of this is really true. when keynes bemoaned the ignorance of stock traders more than 80 years ago, he wasn't insulting their education. he was pointing out that any precise value judgments about a company's future prospects require knowledge of the future ― something nobody possesses.
luxembourg's foreign ministry confirmed the previously planned stop there was canceled, but declined to give further details. the eu declined to comment.
the incoming president supports a pathway to citizenship for many undocumented immigrants ― including dreamers, the young undocumented immigrants who came to the u.s. as kids. he's also pledged to increase the refugee cap and ease restrictions on asylum-seekers.
but biden paired the checks with an array of other policies that are more complicated and outright unwelcome among republicans on capitol hill, who have panned the proposal despite some support for additional direct payments. even with democrats controlling the senate, passing the bill would be difficult.
likewise, del duca said the most important thing the liberals need is a leader who can hit the ground running as soon as the convention is over.

in short, said gene steuerle, coordinator of treasury's reform effort from 1984 to 1986 and now a fellow at the non-partisan tax policy center in washington, individuals got a modest tax cut and corporations got a modest tax increase. perhaps most important, the measure did not increase the national debt.
the two men were among the four kentucky residents who filed an impeachment request to the state house of representatives last weekend, arguing that beshear violated the rights of kentuckians with executive orders imposing various restrictions meant to halt the spread of covid-19, even though the kentucky supreme court unanimously ruled in november that dozens of beshear's orders were legal and reasonable.
a public lands bill that was held over from the last congress is expected to get a vote next week, for example ― and it has support from a number of western democratic senators.
[the biden administration] should let law enforcement do its job and pursue investigation, lieu said. once they get the facts they should let prosecutors decide what they want to do with it.
so, i mean, a lot of our work right now is looking at the prioritization of the queues and making sure that, no. 1, we're protecting someone's physical safety as much as we can and understanding the offline ramifications of using our service. so that's work in flight. most of our priority right now in terms of health, which is the no. 1 priority of the company, is around being proactive. how do we remove the burden from the victims or bystanders from reporting in the first place? it's way too mechanical. it's way too much work. if people have to report, we should see it as a failure. if they have to mute and block that's another degree, it's a little bit less. but ultimately, we want to make sure that the number of reports that we receive is trending downward. and that will be because of two reasons. one, people are seeing far less abuse or harassment or other things that are against the terms of service. or that we're being more proactive about it. so we want to do both. so a lot of our work is that, and then better prioritization in the meantime. a lot more transparency, clearer actions within the product.
senate republicans should instead bring to the floor the house-passed bills to reopen the government, the aide said monday.

despite trump's repeated promises that mexico would pay for the wall, u.s. customs and border protection says americans have committed $15 billion for more than 700 miles (1,120 kilometers). it is unclear how many miles are under contract and what penalties the government would have to pay for canceling them.

the deal between israel and the unhcr, which was to be carried out over the next five years, had rested on the agency's ability to relocate some 16,000 of the refugees to developed countries where the agency has resettlement programs ― including in europe, the u.s., canada and australia, spindler told huffpost. as of monday, no country had officially agreed to take in any of those refugees.
i don't think there will be another opportunity to work with republicans if he doesn't get this right, he said.
watching congress edge toward fuller representation of half the country's population is exhilarating. but for me, it's only created a hunger for more representation. our nation's legislature is far from achieving gender parity. even as the democrats do a better job of electing leaders who look like the people they'll lead, the republican caucus became even whiter and more male in the 2018 midterms. and as the long, long process of the 2020 election begins to rumble into being, i've found myself returning to a longing i felt acutely during the agonizing contest of 2016: i want my next president to be a woman.
his biggest regret is that the liberals' anti-racism plan is no longer being implemented under ford.
after the incident, the aclu of new mexico and southwest women's law center wrote to walgreens to tell the company about the incident and ask more about its policies. in april of this year, walgreens responded that when a pharmacist at one store refuses to fill another prescription and another pharmacist is not on duty, customers can be sent to another location, the aclu suit says.

worst of all, however, was the lack of concern for state and local governments. back in july, the center for budget and policy priorities, a liberal-leaning think tank, estimated that the coronavirus crash would create state government budget shortfalls of about $555 billion ― a figure that would increase substantially if local and tribal governments were included in the calculation. the cares act included just $150 billion in state and local government relief.
pakistan's powerful army chief, general raheel sharif, has stunned his supporters and critics with monday's unanticipated announcement that he would not seek an extension for his job when the duration of his service expires in november. i don't believe in extension, he said on twitter through a military spokesman. in a functioning democracy, this announcement would be deemed very strange because the army chief is not supposed to publicly speak about his job. it is generally the president or the prime minister who, with the consultation of the parliament, decides whether or not the commander should be offered an extension.

though kohn described the part where her daughter signed the postcard as willa, daughter of sally kohn as ridiculously embarrassing and wants to make sure her daughter doesn't think that her name opens doors, she was so impressed by the message. she said her family listens to npr at home in the mornings, and she thinks willa must have gotten the motivation to write to devos from hearing news reports.
d'vorkin replied thanking her and assuring the team that there would be more discussions to come. when, exactly, d'vorkin intends to hold those discussions remains unclear.
given the severity of the challenge we now face, it would be easy to see 2018 as an irreversible step backward, the sealing of our already grim fate. yet despite all this, 2018's midterm elections showed that politicians do have a path forward with american voters when it comes to comprehensive action on climate. the message, as it turns out, isn't any sort of brilliant political calculus either. it's a return to kitchen-table issues: jobs and economic opportunity.
it was horrifying for us. we had never seen anything like this. we realised how polarised ahmedabad was. we were the only muslims in a 10 kilometre radius, naheed said. that was our first experience with the gujarat model of polarisation.

students of color, and in particular low-income students, already face an uphill battle on college admissions tests that have a long history of implicit bias. and it poses an additional barrier to higher education even for students who have done everything their college counselors have told them to do, like taking a standardized test earlier in high school to establish a baseline result.

new york city's system has enabled candidates ― especially those from less affluent neighborhoods ― to more consistently rely on small donors in their districts. the city's public financing system gives candidates an incentive to reach out to a broader and more diverse array of constituents to fund their campaigns, a 2012 study by the brennan center and the progressive think tank demos found.

4) high profile uber board member, arianna huffington has come out and stated that she will take personal responsibility for holding uber's feet to the fire to resolve the situation. of greater concern is prior to this event, what questions was the uber board asking? uber's track record of recent claims of drivers sexual harassment, coupled with very low women in technology numbers and uber's unwillingness to demonstrate transparency in those numbers all rest on the feet of the board. why were these questions not asked before the incident surfaced?
a number of questions therefore arise when considering the implications for the free college policies in the u.s.: could free college policies reverse the trend of more u.s. students studying outside of the u.s. to escape high fees? could improved state funding in support of making college more financially accessible to domestic students stop colleges from actively seeking international students? or, could it push these students into the private sector which will likely have more room as students take advantage of free public education?
pence and trump did not speak for days after the capitol riot. the vice president had to be spirited to safety in the capitol basement after rioters, some chanting hang mike pence, penetrated the building.

one of the ways this faith is demonstrated is through taming the passions. as the economic historian albert hirschman recollected in his 1977 book the passions and the interests, early capital markets emerged amidst heated debates about the place of virtue and vice in civil society. disorderly rushes of emotion and desire were viewed with suspicion and seen as destabilizing to newly formed european nations.
compared with their counterparts across latin america, brazilians have always shown a low level of support for democracy. that support has eroded even further amid the crises: in 2017, just 32 percent of brazilians agreed when latinobarómetro, which conducts polls across the region, asked if they agreed that democracy may have problems but is the best system of government. no other latin american nation showed less support for democracy, while other surveys found that nearly two-thirds of brazilians had lost faith in political parties, the presidency and congress. more than half of brazilians said they would support a more authoritarian style of government if it solved problems.
our hsus television commercial explains what's at stake with this vote, but doesn't show the actual cruelty that bears and wolves endure. if we did show a hunter shooting a wolf puppy at point-blank range, or a grizzly bear thrashing to escape a steel-jawed trap, viewers would recoil and the networks would pull the ads off the air. and that's part of my argument: if you cannot watch it or broadcast it, it certainly shouldn't be allowed on lands labeled as national wildlife refuges.
it should. but again, we're not in a great state right now with our systems because they rely upon reporting. so we're not going to take any action unless it's reported. and then we take action, and we have a whole queue that we have to get through. we're moving to a world that's a lot more proactive by utilizing machine learning. but that will have errors and mistakes. so we don't feel good about anyone being doxed, certainly. we want to catch everything as much as we can, but there are limitations to how much we can do.

students like campbell and kuhnell feel like they're being punished for working hard to improve their scores. when they defend themselves, they receive the implicit message that they are not good enough ― a message that the millions of students who struggle with standardized tests have already received. the result is that our college campuses are less diverse than they might be and disparities in access to higher education are perpetuated.

any claims that beshear has acted outside of his authority ― which i do not think he has ― can be handled by the courts, douglas said. it would sorely undermine democracy for the legislature to impeach a governor simply because they don't agree with his policy choices, as opposed to impeaching trump for inciting a riot to overturn democracy.
the importance of knowing both sets of tools available to policymakers can ensure that one is aware of what may be a result of certain decisions that is taken by government. in addition, this is helpful for policymakers to understand that an effective policy deals with all tools, and not solely one. a policymaker that uses economic planning and political economy planning will be able to ensure that his or her policy can be more effective because it allows one to try to manipulate certain outcomes by using history as a guidebook.

over the long, hotly contested 2016 democratic primary, i had many occasions to doubt that such a desire was valid. clinton's candidacy sparked an unparalleled degree of animus among many on the left. her cautious, technocratic policies and stiff mannerisms became subjects not only of mockery, but of genuine loathing.
that optimism was pierced this week when administrators at the university owned by the church of jesus christ of latter day saints clarified in a letter posted online wednesday that same-sex romantic behavior was still not allowed on campus. the letter said the recent revision to what is known as the honor code didn't change the moral standards of the church or the faith's opposition to same-sex marriage.

during the great recession, in the predominantly african-american prince george's county, in maryland, right next to washington, d.c., teachers and parents lamented that their schools were in disrepair and that teacher turnover was increasing in the face of frozen wages. church pastors said there was more demand for the food in their pantries. but as the foreclosure crisis slashed county tax revenue, the county government and nonprofits could scarcely keep pace with resident demand. the black middle class, unlike the white middle class, already tends to live in communities with more poverty. when the black middle class is distressed, black communities' already fragile stability is further undermined.

even discounting the party's tacit and active encouragement of leaders who made all attempts to polarise the delhi electorate, shah's comments are ironic because, as frontline has pointed out, the home minister led this hate campaign. at a rally in delhi, he had said that people should press the evm button with such anger that the protesters in shaheen bagh feel the current.
caloway williams, a byu senior who is gay, called the letter a slap in the face that he interpreted to meant his faith doesn't love or accept lgbtq people. he called it infuriating to hear top leaders speak of their love for everyone and then see policies that don't match that principle.

though not as sharp and cutting as 30 rock, mr. mayor finds more of its stride when it makes bremer's mediocrity and overconfidence the punchline. for example, at his first press conference as mayor, bremer explains that he made his fortune selling billboard space.

india is trying to get a totalisation agreement on people who have h1-bs. a totalisation agreement is how do you square the circle on social security and taxes when you have individuals who split their time between the us and india. that is the next step on to the axiom that indians are going to continue to dominate h1b visas. but immigration being such a hotbed issue and at the core of trump's 2016 campaign, and possibly once again in the 2020 campaign, i don't think anyone wants to sort out the h1b visa, right now. it's going to be on the back-burner.

we underestimate the importance of physical attraction in long-term relationships. in the beginning, couples make commitments to grooming, wearing clothes that make them feel desirable and feeling good about themselves. when you start to feel like roommates, you might need to change out of your sweats and comfy clothes and get ready for an intimate night together. take a long bath or shower, put on something that makes you feel good about yourself, and put energy into feeling sensual. even if you are staying in for the night, put something on that makes you feel open for sex and connection, like your favorite lingerie or use a new massage oil or perfume. ― shannon chavez, psychologist and sex therapist

there needs to be coordination or at least agreement among national accreditation committees, medical schools and health systems across the country so that we and our fourth-year medical student peers elsewhere have the ability to join forces to battle this pandemic. included in this discussion should be ways that new doctors are covered as they enter into their first jobs, such as employee benefits, health insurance and appropriate access to ppe. we acknowledge that this is not an easy administrative task, but the absence of a transparent national policy compels hospitals to currently reject critical help from qualified new physicians in a time of dire need.

equal pay day is meant to highlight the fact that women still make less than men in nearly every job, every industry and at every level of educational attainment. yet, as we mark this symbolic day year after year, the gender wage gap hasn't budged much over the last two decades. and although pay discrimination is technically illegal, the tools we give women to fight the gap ― like the equal pay act of 1963, which mandated equal pay for equal work, and the lilly ledbetter fair pay act, which extended the time period women have to file complaints ― are pretty weak.
trump has badly twisted the role of uniformed officers even further. he flirted with deploying the military against protesters, and in his failed effort to steal the 2020 election, spoke of commanders as my generals, pardoned soldiers and contractors who committed war crimes and left nearly half of the key civilian jobs at the defense department empty.

being in the same bed at the same time as your partner increases the likelihood of having sexual contact. if you find yourself avoiding going to bed until after your partner is asleep, you may be consciously (or subconsciously) decreasing the odds of having sex. you need to ask yourself some tough questions: why don't i want to be awake in the same bed at the same time as my partner? are there aspects of my sex life that are disappointing or anxiety-provoking? avoiding may feel easier than hurting your partner's feelings, but an honest conversation (first with yourself and then with your partner) may keep you from ending up in a sexless marriage. ― resnick anderson

in fact, congress has already recognized these realities. the first coronavirus emergency bill that trump signed includes additional medicaid funding for states as a means of shoring up their budgets. that law also forbids states from cutting enrollment or benefits as a condition for receiving the temporary bonus funds. extra medicaid funding is a common form of helping state budgets and providing economic stimulus during recessions.

quickly, u.s. intelligence and public health officials began doubting china's reported rates of infection and death toll. they pressed china to allow in u.s. epidemiologists — both to assist the country in confronting the spread and to gain valuable insights that could help buy time for the u.s. response. u.s. officials also pressed china to send samples of the virus to u.s. labs for study and for vaccine and test development.
there are myriad opportunities to incorporate food waste into the farm bill, including many simple, easily implemented changes, like tweaks to statutory language, eligibility requirements, or grant selection processes that can allow many farm bill programs to address food waste. for example, the farm bill includes several grant programs to support distribution, processing, and marketing of food for sale. broadening eligibility language to include food recovery organizations and allow grant funding to support distribution of food that is donated but not sold can ensure less is wasted. for other programs, directing usda to preference applicants with a plan to donate surplus food, or who pledge to create such a plan, would provide a strong incentive for producers to take steps to donate more and reduce their waste.

the local opposition has also questioned the move, with infrastructure spokesman anthony albanese querying in the guardian why the government was happy to back advanced defence manufacturing after it withdrew support for the car industry.
another problem with underpaying staff and letting them flee to k street or elsewhere is the loss of institutional knowledge and experience. with persistent turnover, congress is left without strong institutional capacity to do its job of overseeing the executive branch. an executive branch agency may have dozens of staff ready and able to deal with congressional requests while a congressional committee or member office is limited to a handful of staff, many of whom may have limited experience. this dynamic has enabled the executive branch to seize more and more power over the past four decades.
the cut in the bank's key rate is the first since the summer of 2015 and brings the rate to a level it hasn't been at since early 2018.
trump, too, was merely a symptom of a larger disease, a product of declining faith among americans in their democratic institutions. and bolsonaro adopted many of trump's strategies: he, too, encouraged violence against critics, appealed to nativist and racist fears, and suggested that if he lost, it would be the result of political rivals' shenanigans. he also called for imprisoning not just his opponent, but activists who worked on the left. he targeted civil society, suggesting that nongovernmental organizations and human rights groups would be shut down. he promised to give law enforcement even more leeway to kill on sight and decried the media as agents of fake news who were simply protecting the corrupt establishment.

you say you're helping out as much as you can, but what does that mean, exactly? are you offering to cook (and are they healthy meals)? are you doing the laundry without asking? do you know what an arabesque is or how to braid your daughter's hair? i hate it when husbands talk about helping out around the house as if they're being heroic by lending a hand.
kong said when news of the novel virus hit canada, there was already an impending sense of fear in the chinese-canadian community that they'd experience what they went through with sars.
in the same way it's not entirely clear why health disparities exist between non-hispanic white americans and the general latino-american community. it's also not entirely clear why health disparities exist between afro-latino americans and white latino americans in particular. however, opportunity differences may help explain. afro-latinos share similar sociodemographic characteristics with that of non-hispanic black americans, including high poverty rates, disproportionately low incomes and highly segregated neighborhoods. all of these factors are strong determinants of health; recent studies have shown latin-american immigrants who identify as black report lower educational achievement (11.64 vs. 12.77 years of education) and weekly earnings ($718.38 vs. $760.95) compared to black americans.
it is widely accepted that public colleges typically educate the most first-generation students and those from the lowest socioeconomic class. in the race for students, do public and private colleges and universities really educate different students by income level or is the pool of applicants from which they select similar in 2017?

the president's many conflicts of interest will also come under the microscope. his refusal to divest from his business means that he still makes money when lobbyists, big corporations and foreign governments pay to use his properties. trump's involvement in the decision not to move the fbi headquarters in downtown washington, d.c., has also raised concerns about a conflict of interest as the building is across the street from the president's hotel. cummings and rep. peter defazio (d-ore.), the new chairman of the house transportation and infrastructure committee, will investigate these conflicts.
fourteen lakers players were tested on wednesday, and results on thursday confirmed two cases, sources told the los angeles times and the athletic. the team will likely now test its remaining players, according to the athletic.

confusion may be the biggest problem with renters insurance. between different exclusions and limits, it can be hard to figure out what's covered. and who wants to pay money for something they don't understand? go over your contract with your insurance agent and ask questions. put the ball in their court, and ask them why you need renters insurance; let them spell out various scenarios. and if you have particular concerns ― are you covered if your iphone goes for a swim in the toilet? ― raise them.

agreeing to a waiver for austin ― particularly so soon after doing the same for mattis ― also sends a troubling signal about military service, observers argue. it could convince rising stars in uniform that the pinnacle of their careers should not be earning four stars but taking over the entire pentagon, because it may come to be taken for granted that a former soldier should be defense secretary.

cities around the world are experimenting with ways to get vehicles off the streets. los angeles is phasing out heavy-duty diesel trucks from its port and overhauling the mass transit system, while norway is replacing car parking spaces with bike lanes and closing certain streets to private traffic in its capital city, oslo. brussels and ghent in belgium have also been experimenting with car-free initiatives, with mixed success. in paris, major intersections are being redesigned to prioritize pedestrians and cyclists over vehicle traffic.
congressional democrats are supportive of this push for more antitrust oversight. rep. jerry nadler (d-n.y.), the incoming chairman of the house judiciary committee, told antitrust regulators at an oversight hearing in december that congress had abdicated its role for too long by allowing pro-big business administrations, both republican and democratic, to erode antitrust laws.

millions of people descended upon iran's capital in june 2009 after hardliner president mahmoud ahmadinejad secured a second term in an election marred by damning claims of vote-rigging.
the classic slapstick movie airplane doesn't have a single scene as ridiculous as this real life situation. somethings are unthinkable. i vote with my wallet and this company is on my do-not-spend list until further notice, mostly because of the ceo's indifference to the situation. simply playing it down will not work in the 21st century. information is everywhere and as a business you have to be proactive and do three things.
that is exactly what has happened with the sweeping policies in democrats' h.r. 1, which they're calling the for the people act. the bill's campaign finance provisions on public election financing, dark money disclosure and democracy vouchers have all been field tested. the same is true of automatic voter registration, felon re-enfranchisement and the use of independent, nonpartisan redistricting commissions.

recently, we've seen a disturbing increase in incidents where airline passengers have disrupted flights with threatening or violent behavior. these incidents have stemmed both from passengers' refusals to wear masks and from recent violence at the u.s. capitol. this dangerous behavior can distract, disrupt and threaten crew members' safety functions, faa administrator steve dickson said in a video released by the agency on thursday.
as with trump, bolsonaro's attack on corruption went beyond hypocrisy. it was a herrenvolk appeal — spoils for the dominant class, banishment or marginalization for everyone else — and the tubthumping about corruption fit into larger themes about the contamination of brazilian identity by the country's underclasses.
in alberta, we have proactively issued a province-wide advisory to doctors to ensure physicians are aware of the virus, are able to take recommended actions and promptly alert public health officials if they encounter a suspected case, tom mcmillan, a representative for alberta health, told huffpost canada.
trump separated thousands of immigrant children from their parents in a policy that will go down in history as among the cruelest actions of his administration. he downplayed the coronavirus pandemic, which has thus far killed at least 375,000 americans.
in 1935, the nlra told workers that they could say #metoo. the supreme court should confirm that in the epic systems case and ensure that the option provided by the law continues to open the door to public courts. the collective consciousness-raising and storytelling of #metoo is one way to form a group. but it should not be the only way.

since the moment we became a couple, i've felt like i'm constantly looking over my shoulder, and i spend every waking moment (and many of my dreaming ones too) petrified by the fear of javier being discovered. i wake up each morning terrified for him over whom or what he might encounter that day, and i go to sleep thanking god he returned home to me and our daughter.

the textbooks don't give a full-throated endorsement of trump, noting his crude remarks and previously liberal positions, but they ultimately represent him as someone on the side of christians who is fighting for their values. one description from the abeka textbook reads:
while white house officials have assured the public that they are working on providing masks to health care professionals, the timeline on doing so is not clear.
another could be prioritizing fair trade agreements with the countries whose raw materials currently fuel the green industrial supply chain. biden looks likely to boost domestic mining of the materials needed to make solar panels and batteries for electric cars and homes. but the existing supply chains already cause significant environmental destruction overseas.

raina thiele, a former white house liaison for tribes who now runs a consulting firm with expertise in tribal policy, said it has been very odd to see that the few native people who are quoted in the press are critical of warren for having pride in her ancestors because, as a native alaskan, thiele said she was raised to always be proud of her heritage.
it seems harsh, but hear us out. if you don't enjoy spending time with her on an average, humdrum day, then you definitely won't like hanging out during her peak emotional state. and she might not like it either — you think you have a great poker face, but your annoyance and discomfort are totally seeping through. do the bride a favor and let her be surrounded by people who really do want to be there. as for what to tell her, perhaps honesty is not the best policy, in this case. spare her feelings and use one of the above reasons instead.

it was, she says, the days in the middle east that taught her the dangers of a theocratic government imposing its will on the people. (she tells me that, no, her personal views haven't changed, but she doesn't figure it's her job to do as the iraqis did and force her own beliefs on others.)

the flagship coronavirus legislation was the cares act, passed in late march with a unanimous senate vote. conventional wisdom in washington regards the law as a smashing success. even the chronically malcontent left has cheered the cares act for temporarily boosting unemployment benefits by $600 a week ― a level that put modest upward pressure on wages, since some workers found themselves better off financially after losing their jobs. generous provisions for big business prevented a financial panic, and though clumsy, the hundreds of billions of dollars allocated to support small businesses did not go to waste.

what i've learned over the last three years is that love doesn't need papers to be validated. love doesn't need a social security number to be real. the love i have for javier is so deep and so visceral and every day my love grows as i watch him interact with our beautiful daughter. she gives us so much hope and fills us with so much more love, and it is a love that binds us together and makes us stronger. it is also a love that scares some people ― that many say should not be allowed to even exist ― and it is partly the fear of this love that makes immigration reform so emotional and so hard to achieve.
last week, dan strauss, senior vice president and general manager for entertainment and lifestyle, met with a group of entertainment section editors. strauss, who works at the times under the tronc business side, introduced several of the editors to christina schoellkopf, who is listed internally as a senior social media manager and who strauss said would be running the entertainment social channels on a day-to-day basis. schoellkopf, however, had been hired under newco, meaning she was technically a business employee and reported directly to a business manager.
test-centric schooling leaves our students with the impression that they go to school to learn how to pass the test, and then to take the test. that is a terrible model for learning and for life. contrary to what test supporters say, life is not all about standardized tests. you will not take a bubble test to get married or to have and raise children. whatever your career, it will not involve a steady daily diet of test prep and test taking. show your child that the big standardized test is not the point of school.

the coalition has been joined in some states by local conservative organizations, including gun rights groups and the eagle forum, who also do not want to see the constitution opened up for revision.
beyond that, the reason warren even decided to release her dna test results, for better or for worse, was to try to move on from president donald trump's constant mockery of her native ancestry and racist attacks on her as pocahontas. she has been relentlessly harassed. boston shock jock howie carr said in march that he got her spit on a pen and tried to get a dna sample from it. he encouraged readers of his boston herald column to grab her water glass at a st. patrick's day event so he could do a dna test. one of her political opponents mailed two dna test kits to her house.

queens officials, including constantinides, have long blamed the plants for the two neighborhoods' high levels of asthma, which earned one part of northern astoria the nickname asthma alley. in 2017, the city council passed legislation requiring the utility operators to stop using no. 6 fuel oil by 2020 and no. 4 oil by 2030. the new bill would be the first to lay the groundwork for phasing out the plants altogether.

it turns out the interior official did in fact have contact with the koch network.
the democratic sweep in tuesday's georgia senate runoff probably won't alter much of the incoming biden administration's reform agenda. progressive hopes for everything from action on climate change to judicial reform remain limited, if not nonexistent. even without the pandemic, the country and the world are marching steadily toward various modes of destruction.
there's no such thing as a devil or hell.
but even if the motion fails on wednesday night, the labour leader is perfectly free to try again at a point when he feels he can get more success.
in fact, president obama and speaker ryan not only agree on this point, but they have nearly identical proposals: expanding the earned income tax credit (eitc) for childless adults -- the one group that the federal tax code taxes into poverty -- to make it a more effective work incentive. that's good news, and policymakers would be wise to follow their lead.
democrats in the senate and the house, where their majority is also razor-thin, will still have to contend with more conservative members of their party who are resistant to progressive reforms.

pa wire/pa images lewes mp maria caulfield has spoken out against decriminalisation of abortion.
blackface in 30 rock was only the tip of the iceberg. the show had a long record of racist, transphobic and ableist jokes and storylines. the throwaway bit about disability rights activists in mr. mayor is reminiscent of how 30 rock often made disabled people the subjects of ridicule. for instance, in one episode in season 3, kenneth the page (jack mcbrayer) has a crush on a woman who is blind. he is too shy to talk to her, so he enlists tracy (tracy morgan) to pretend to be him, with the joke being that she can't tell them apart.
last week's unprecedented riot at the u.s. capitol ended with five dead, including a capitol police officer the rioters beat to death, and countless officers and journalists assaulted by the mob. the violence has shaken the country and ignited a new impeachment attempt against president donald trump for inciting the attack.
contact your u.s. representative today and urge him or her to oppose h. j. res. 69. the young resolution is indecent in the extreme, and we must raise our voices against this policy change in the loudest way we know.

still republicans did have at their fingertips other research on the cost of their bill. one report in particular was released dec. 18, 2017, by the tax foundation, a conservative think tank in washington. it published a rosier estimate that found the tax bill would add only $448 billion to the national debt over 10 years, less than half what the jct would report four days later. indeed, the tax foundation had issued numerous reports on republicans' proposed tax policies and bill ideas throughout 2017, many of which carried weight among republicans on the hill, washington tax experts and lobbyists said.
the survey underscores a longstanding lack of political representation among the growing ranks of americans who say they don't believe in god, are questioning the existence of a higher power, or simply don't subscribe to traditional organized religion.

7. being apathetic. more than half of people who leave their jobs do so because of their relationship with their boss. smart companies make certain their managers know how to balance being professional with being human. these are the bosses who celebrate an employee's success, empathize with those going through hard times, and challenge people, even when it hurts. bosses who fail to really care will always have high turnover rates. it's impossible to work for someone eight-plus hours a day when they aren't personally involved and don't care about anything other than your productivity.
so we simply can't talk about the gender wage gap without talking about the fact that even when women do the same work that men do, they get paid less. women aren't self-selecting into lower pay; they are devalued no matter where they go. and it's not just happening in separate fields like teaching and computing, but also within companies themselves. new jersey's law, which focuses not on comparing the exact same jobs but on ones that are basically the same, is designed to address that problem.
the federal government has to come in and handle this, cuomo said.
with election season well underway, education is sure to come up as a hot topic. politicians make big promises but come up with nothing more than empty bromides. who can argue with a policy called no child left behind or every student succeeds? but it takes more than political promises to truly inspire children, show them the gift of their own potential and prepare them to tackle life's many challenges.

biden has already indicated his displeasure. in a speech last week, before his election victory was certified by congress, the president-elect said he intends to speed up vaccinations by having the federal government take a stronger role to make sure that vaccines are not only available, but that shots are going into the arms of more americans.

the end of trumpism will not be when trump is defeated at the polls or even when he is impeached. it will be when america comes together as a nation and acts to ensure that elites like trump who transgress against our shared laws suffer consequences proportionate to their actions.

. . . wall street bankers and mainstream economists will argue that greenbacks and other such proposals would be inflationary, depreciate the dollar, tank the bond market, and bring an end to western civilization. yet, we've seen four years of the federal reserve--now on its third quantitative-easing program--experimenting with its own type of greenback program, creating new money out of thin air in the form of credits in federal reserve notes to purchase trillions of dollars of bonds from big banks and hedge funds. while the value of the dollar has not collapsed and the bond market remains strong, neither have those newly created trillions trickled down to main street and the struggling middle classes. the most significant effect of the fed's programs has been to prop up banks, bond prices, and the stock market, with hardly any benefit to main street.
the warning comes as airlines and cruise ship companies across the globe are reducing or canceling their operations.
there's no guarantee the study will result in a workable proposal. but the impact could be huge. of the 24 power plants in new york city, 21 burn gas, contributing to the roughly 30 percent of the city's greenhouse gas emissions that come from the utility sector, according to city data. the other three burn petroleum, an even dirtier fuel, and would likely be affected by any policy aimed at drastically shrinking fossil fuel's share of the city's electricity production.
but others claim the republicans just cherry-picked a few gop-backed ideas from the baucus-camp work. baucus said in an interview with the center that the 2017 tax law has some elements of the legislation he and camp proposed, such as cutting the corporate tax rate, only taxing domestic corporate profits, and reworking taxes on the profits of multinationals to get them to return their money to the united states.

at the local level, teachers and principals are a vital part of the planning process, including the crafting of the local adaptation of the national core curriculum. technically, final decisions are made at the local political level. however, generally speaking, politicians don't meddle with school activities and the local curriculum.
jorjani not only knew about the department's awareness review policy ― under which political appointees were told if their names showed up in documents about to be released ― but often examined records before their release, according to documents made public by the environmental group earthjustice. cq roll call reported in june that interior political appointees regularly delayed and in some cases withheld records.

this had enormous implications. the family separation policy split at least 5,400 immigrant children from their parents, according to american civil liberties union, although advocates believe the number may be higher. those kids included infants who were still breastfeeding, toddlers and other small children. all of them went through immense trauma, often adding to pain and fear they'd experienced in their native countries, which many were fleeing to seek asylum, and on the journey to the u.s.
mckenzie said it made her feel whiplash and that her religion was telling her she was dirty for who she is and unwanted by god. she's reassessing whether she wants to finish her studies at byu even though she loves her professors and the education she's receiving.
but the messages i was receiving from the broader society around me were powerful and persistent. as i got old enough to make my own decisions, i chose to attend mostly white academic magnet programs in middle and high school. i made no efforts to diversify my social circle. ditto with my extracurricular activities: violin, cross country, competitive swimming and ― the kicker ― field hockey.

when an event or natural disaster makes your apartment unlivable ― even for just a few days ― will you have another place to stay, or will you need to head to the nearest motel? many renters insurance policies cover your housing expenses if you are displaced. keep in mind that staying in a hotel for more than one night may cost more than your annual renters insurance premium. plus, not all your friends will welcome you if you have pets, and the couch in your mom's house was never really all that comfortable anyway.
we have algorithms that can determine, based on the network, based on what people are doing elsewhere, based on the number of reports, based on mutes and blocks, whether this is a conversation that you'd want to stay in or you'd want to walk away from. and that doesn't inform any direct action, but it can inform enforcement actions and whatnot, like when a human has to actually review. so toxicity is one such metric, we call it receptivity. like, are the members of the conversation receptive to each other? we have variety of perspective as an indicator. we have shared reality.

congress has already passed a bill to make testing for the coronavirus free, and democrats have also been pushing for coronavirus treatment to be cost-free as well. even president donald trump said the federal government will pay providers for treating uninsured patients. but this plan from sanders and jayapal goes significantly further.
the army will continue testing for safety hazards posed by accommodating articles of faith, fanning said. and for the time being, soldiers with religious accommodations to grow beards will be restricted from military schools and positions where proximity to toxic chemical agents may arise.
but is this really the issue on the minds of tribal leaders? george-kanentiio said he recently attended the american indian justice conference, which brings together tribal leaders, judges and lawyers to work on policies related to drug abuse, tribal security and tribal youths. nobody talked about her dna test at all, he said, because they were focused on tribes' serious problems with domestic abuse, youth suicide, environmental contamination, loss of territory and horrifying levels of missing and murdered native women.
the sanders/warren narrative seeks to unite a global left against a status quo in which oligarchs with disproportionate political power are tied to the national security state and brutal military missteps — both in the u.s. and in rivals like russia and china. in that view, challenging the status quo of american foreign policy doesn't mean prioritizing dialogue with anyone no matter their track record, as gabbard did with brutal syrian dictator bashar assad ― it means reconsidering relationships with entire societies and trying to address their concerns in just ways, whether under anti-american regimes like assad's or u.s. partners like saudi arabia.

the important thing to note is this isn't abnormal … this kind of development is exactly what the world has been preparing for because we know that these things are going to happen, hoffman added.
many other countries with national health insurance systems don't have that kind of capability, which is likely one reason that vaccination in countries like france and germany has had a slower start. it may be no coincidence that the u.k., the european country administering shots the quickest, is also the one where, as in israel, the government is heavily involved in the provision of care and not just its financing.
some republicans like the idea of expanding the child tax credit.

even before trump, roberts voted with the court's four liberals to uphold most of the affordable care act. when trump referred sneeringly last year to an obama judge, roberts declared indignantly (and somewhat disingenuously), we do not have obama judges or trump judges, bush judges or clinton judges … what we have is an extraordinary group of dedicated judges doing their level best to do equal right to those appearing before them.

the previous administration had peeled back similar lgbtq protections in other areas. under then-president donald trump, the department of health and human services tried to scuttle an obama-era regulation that forbade discrimination against transgender people in health care settings. as with the bostock case, that measure was based on the administration's narrow reading of sex discrimination.
but ethics probes have plagued the department under president donald trump. zinke resigned in january 2019 under a cloud of scandal and federal investigations. david bernhardt became the subject of a probe four days after being confirmed as the new secretary, shortly after the new york times reported that he intervened to block a scientific report on the threat certain pesticides pose to endangered species. in december, the agency's inspector general concluded there was no evidence that bernhardt exceeded or abused his authority or that his actions influenced or altered the findings of career [fish and wildlife service] scientists.
in the republican and democratic presidential debates, president barack obama's ultimate rejection of using force against syrian dictator bashar al-assad for using chemical weapons against his own people, keeps being raised as an issue. in all cases, the debate moderators have been pushing the candidates to call out the president for being weak. in the democratic debate, the candidates avoided this characterization, but of course the republicans bring up the episode second only to the equally overstated and unimportant episode of the obama administration's response to the attack on diplomatic facilities in benghazi, libya--principally because current candidate hillary had a bigger role in benghazi simply because she had left her post as secretary of state eight months before obama made the decision not to use force against assad.

4. be a role model, not a preacher. great leaders inspire trust and admiration through their actions, not just their words. many leaders say that integrity is important to them, but great leaders walk their talk by demonstrating integrity every day. harping on people all day long about the behavior you want to see has a tiny fraction of the impact you achieve by demonstrating that behavior yourself.

in short, whether you are an employee or a consumer, you can be locked out of court by formulaic statements about the waiver of rights to which the argument is that you agreed when you applied for a job or got a cell phone or loan. and however good arbitration between equally powerful companies may be, what we know now is that pushing people into single-file arbitration against companies erases their rights.

much of biden's opening bid is an expansion of assistance already on the books and some new revenue streams for struggling public works. it includes an additional $30 billion in rental and utilities assistance, $5 billion for housing those at risk of homelessness, extensions of the eviction moratorium and the increased nutrition benefit, more than $150 billion in funding for schools and funding for struggling public transit systems, among other programs.
sir vince cable says the lib dem policy of holding a referendum on the final brexit deal is now much more appealing to voters, despite the party not getting any traction with that message at the snap general election last year. it is six months since the 74-year-old was elected as lib dem leader, 30 years since his party was founded and one year until the united kingdom is due to leave the european union. cable is speaking to huffpost uk on valentines day - before meeting his wife rachel at a nice romantic restaurant down by the river. the chances of stopping it are now quite high, cable says of brexit. i take the view the lib dems are important players. we have 12 mps - but we have 100 peers and we have a big army in the country. but we are not going to do this on our own. we've got to do it by working with people in the other parties. it was supposed to be somewhat different. under tim farron, the lib dems hoped to entice a large chunk of the 48% who voted 'remain' to back the party with an overtly pro-eu campaign. but it did not really work. farron, having had his religious beliefs and views on homosexuality put under the microscope, resigned. he has since said he regrets saying he did not think gay sex was a sin. it wasn't helpful and he acknowledged that himself.

the arguments revolved on themselves, quickly devolving into bitter tedium. i recognized the real stakes behind the policy arguments ― the accurate diagnosis that, under obama, progress had been too slow, and democrats too eager to seek compromise, leaving millions bereft of health care and slipping through the cracks of a slashed social safety net.

he's been making versions of that claim since he first became president. but it was a lie then and it is a lie now. he spent most of 2017 working with the republican congress to repeal the affordable care act, including with legislation that would have undermined or eliminated entirely the key parts of the law ― including a requirement that insurers charge everybody the same premiums, regardless of medical status, and that all policies include comprehensive benefits.

the budget newsom unveiled thursday offered up a bunch of goodies for young children and their parents, including a plan for statewide universal pre-k and all-day kindergarten, as well as more money for subsidized child care. he also announced an increase in benefits to undocumented immigrants. it was an astonishing contrast to the policy priorities of the trump administration.

the sheer size of the u.s. population helps explain why the trump administration delegated not just actual vaccine delivery but also most of the planning for it to the states, which have then leaned heavily on local health departments. but that, in turn, helps explain why vaccine rollout has fallen so short of the initial goals.
but sometimes you want to return that impulse buy (our impulses are not always good ones).
araby said third-party delivery services appeal to companies like albertsons because another company has to worry about the fleet and the logistics of employment: you don't have to maintain the truck, you don't have to worry about accidents and all that goes with that. and the third-party companies ultimately don't have to worry about much of that either, because everyone is using their own cars.

both campaigns and the democratic senatorial campaign committee knew pulling off the upsets would demand the type of massive ground game democrats had eschewed during the pandemic era. christie roberts, a senior adviser at the dscc, had begun searching for an operative to run a unified field operation even before election day. it was one of the crucial shifts the party made before the two-month runoff campaign that proved essential to warnock and ossoff's victories in elections that saw record-breaking turnout.

i have been surprised, however, to hear that women in northern europe – the most gender-equal region in the world – report the same grievances. while researching my latest book on women in power, i interviewed 18 female politicians in sweden and the netherlands, certain that their experience in public service would starkly contrast that of their latin american peers. after all, in those countries, women already occupy 40% of political positions – and they didn't need a quota system to do it. only in a gender-equal paradise could that happen, right?

even better would be a law covering all american workers. the fair pay act, which would require equal pay for comparable jobs, gets reintroduced every session of congress. but its main champion in the senate, tom harkin (d-iowa), retired in 2014, so now it has a sole sponsor in rep. eleanor holmes norton, the nonvoting representative in the house for the district of columbia. these days, it rarely gets even a mention in conversations about the gender wage gap.
according to the government's shutdown plan, only 12.5 percent of irs employees are authorized to work during the current non-filing season. the plan also states that processing certain tax refunds and issuing tax refunds are non-excepted activities during this time, meaning that the employees responsible for performing those duties will be furloughed during the shutdown.
the comparisons aren't arbitrary. lampitt described some of the qualities that make people comparable even if they hold different positions: the amount of revenue they oversee, or how many employees they manage or how much operational oversight they wield. minnesota, which requires that state government employees be paid the same for comparable jobs, analyzes people's work based on how much knowledge, problem solving and responsibility is required, as well as the working conditions of particular jobs.

the stock market is a good story ― one of the best. but it doesn't mean what most people think it does. the stock market is not an important measure of national well-being, productive capacity or material wealth. it isn't even a reliable gauge for the health of specific companies, and is only tangentially related to helping them raise capital. the most iconic contemporary capitalist institution is, in truth, inessential to the operation of capitalism itself. the stock market, in the words of the late british economist john maynard keynes, is merely the outcome of the mass psychology of a large number of ignorant individuals.

both abeka and bju press have ties to christian colleges. abeka was launched in the 1970s by arlin and beka horton, who also founded pensacola christian college, a florida institution that outlaws dancing and other satanic practices, such as astrology. bju press is affiliated with the evangelical bob jones university in greenville, south carolina, which famously lost its tax-exempt status after banning interracial dating in the '80s, a policy it didn't reverse until 2000.

black communities, many of which are still recovering from the great recession, stand to be among the hardest hit―again. african-americans are more likely than other racial or ethnic groups to work for the federal government: they constitute 18 percent of federal workers and 13 percent of the population. furthermore, black-owned businesses disproportionately rely upon government contracts, though they remain underrepresented among federal contractors. and black americans, due to their disproportionate levels of poverty stemming from centuries of exclusion from the most rewarding jobs and underinvestment in their communities, are in greater need of federal support, even when the economy is booming.

a word of caution ― check your spending before your money disappears into a puff of toys, gadgets and baby accessories. does your bouncing baby really need that fancy stroller? or would it be more helpful for you all in the long run if that money went into an investment fund or savings account ― or went to pay off debt? don't let emotions rule your purchases, for baby or for you.
but for case, the church's opposition to women crystalized in the 1970s, when church leaders made clear that the ordination of women to the priesthood was not going to happen. adding to the limitations on women was pope john ii's insistence on complementarity, a theory that assigns specific roles to each gender.
today, medicaid is an entitlement program, like medicare and social security, meaning that spending automatically rises to cover the costs incurred for medical care. the federal government finances more than half of medicaid expenses, with states picking up the remaining share, which eases the fiscal burden on states, especially when the economy is poor. but states that adopt the healthy adult opportunity program would give up that open-ended guarantee of federal funding.

that $8 billion can give overwhelmed state and local authorities the ability to hire extra staff, both for planning and for administering the shots. it would have been great to get the funding months ago, when public health experts and officials were begging for it, warning of precisely the sorts of problems plaguing the u.s. effort now. but the money will still help a lot ― especially because the pace needs to pick up a lot more.

still, brazil has spent much of the last several decades fashioning itself into a shining example of what a democratic latin america could one day look like. former president fernando henrique cardoso stabilized the economy in the early 2000s, then leftist president luiz inácio lula da silva, a working-class firebrand, presided over a period of rapid growth that had brazil's economy on pace to surpass those of france and the united kingdom.

in my life, i have had a number of good teachers, plenty of mediocre ones and a few who were truly exceptional. in the sixties, rote learning and duck and cover were de rigueur. like the all-important cursive, to succeed in elementary school, you needed to stay within the lines. i was generally pretty good at that. years before i began to question authority (the mantra of my generation), i was an obedient, rule-abiding kid. i liked school, even though i had a series of teachers who were more like glee's irascible coach sylvester than kindly will schuester. my expectations were low.

it's just ridiculous that people have to suffer and go through hardship and be stressed out. larry howard, worker at the national zoo
government shutdowns are costly affairs. federal agencies must spend time and energy developing contingency plans in the runup to a closure, then have to make up missed work once the government finally reopens. as the messy situation in national parks has demonstrated, the government's work does not stop just because funds haven't been appropriated for that work. agencies will face a backlog of responsibilities to handle once they are fully operational again.

echo hawk knows all about native people being erased. she helped lead a groundbreaking $3.3 million research project called reclaiming native truth, the largest public opinion research initiative ever conducted by and about native americans. not surprisingly, it found that the majority of americans know little to nothing about native people. most of what they know comes from popular culture, the media and the toxic stereotypes they perpetuate. some people don't even know that native americans still exist.
but his 2014 gaffe about the recliner showed how his sharp tongue could sometimes get him into trouble. after then-president barack obama had a contentious lunch in 2010 with gop senators, roberts called the democrat pretty thin-skinned and told reporters, he needs to take a valium before he comes in and talks to republicans.

united spent days running around like chickens, trying to peck up as much spilt corn as they could. in the end, after 150,000 views, united caved and offered carroll payment to make the video go away. but it was no longer about the money and he turned them down flat. in fact, he suggested they donate the money to a charity. as archie bunker used to say, whoop-dee-do!
this simple concept was formulated by aristotle in his distinction between oikonomia (care for the house) and chrematistics (care for money). but it was abandoned by many modern economists when the political economy seemed to become subordinated to quantitative economics; because it is difficult or impossible to directly measure the real usage of things, in its place we measure the quantity of their production and purchase.

returning to the maastricht treaty and to the no bail-out rule would mean that persistent differences in living standards and market based debt restructurings would be enacted. esm and the european financial stability facility would be wound down after their current programs would end. ecb support (qe and omt) programs would stop. this would lead to the default of greece and its likely exit from the euro. in the long-run, asymmetric shocks and persistent income differences would be likely to force several additional countries to leave the euro.

the senators were, however, doing their jobs, questioning a judicial nominee who has used his religious faith to justify his policy positions. for gabbard to say this amounts to religious bigotry is to drag out another right-wing trope.
these remediation courses will have two other side effects. first, they will fill up the student's schedule, so that students who have not done well enough on the test must take remediation 101 instead of shop or art or band or accounting. these will be the students whose strengths are not english and math, but they will not be able to fully pursue their strengths, but must instead spend their school day focusing on their weakness, their area of failure. if you have never spent your days being bad at something, you may not understand just how corrosive to the spirit it is.

by all accounts, leaving syria should have been relatively unpopular, especially among the president's core supporters. in past surveys, a majority of trump's backers and the public as a whole backed the president's decision to order military airstrikes in syria in 2017 and favored using u.s. troops to combat islamic extremists in iraq and syria last year.

federal land use is a long-simmering issue across the american west. arguments magnify the tensions of east vs. west priorities: wilderness vs. livestock; urban vs. rural; day trips vs. country livelihoods. yet almost everyone agrees that the laws governing public land are inadequate and obsolete--leftover from the 1870's push to settle the west. to prevent widespread land degradation and abuse of the system, the grazing laws were revised in the 1930's and then the 1970's. however, much has changed since then and the law has not evolved accordingly.
sanders never won full control of city government, but he organized enough voters to elect some allies onto the board and win veto power. he soon became popular enough to win reelection by a 20-point margin.
notably, rempel garner — who's leading the charge on the declaration — has expressed interest in a run for federal party leadership in the past, but has not formally declared anything for the current race.
ocasio-cortez joined the protests, adding the political star power needed to grab headlines in a competitive, fast-moving news cycle. the 29-year-old socialist darling from new york also proposed a resolution to establish a select committee on a green new deal in the house, providing a counteroffer to pelosi's panel.

this is not just because women choose to work in lower-paid jobs, picking passion over pay. over a half century, the data show that if women enter a particular job that pays well en masse, wages drop. when women started working in parks and camps, for example, pay fell 57 percentage points. when men took over the previously female-dominated job of computing, on the other hand, compensation shot up.

and while he has pitched his surge to power as the result of a populist revolt, his base of support mirrors that of the old coup masters: wealthy financial elites, segments of the population willing to trade the rights and lives of the poor and marginalized for their own safety and economic prosperity, and traditional parties and politicians who refuse to acknowledge their own roles in creating the monster before folding themselves into his arms.
her endorsement helped nudge stacey walker, the chair of iowa's linn county board of supervisors, into sanders' corner. and ocasio-cortez also played a role in securing sanders the endorsement of the center for popular democracy action.
jackie gillan, president of advocates for highway and auto safety, also applauded the law as a victory, saying it will ensure the safety of utah residents and visitors.
his tenure did not include obvious successes in such long-standing u.s. foreign policy challenges as reining in the iranian and north korean nuclear programs, ending the u.s. war in afghanistan or containing an increasingly assertive china.

progressive congressional leaders have also noted that a change in house rules alone would not clear the path for deficit-increasing legislation to become law. since pay-go is also written into the legal code, congress would have to enact another law overturning it ― or otherwise exempting a particular bill from it.
because they experience considerable labor market discrimination, african-americans have long relied upon the public sector—federal, state and local government—for steady employment in good jobs. government civil service work is an essential pillar in the foundation of the black middle class, so furloughs stand to harm black people significantly. this kind of racially disparate impact of government policy has a long history.

trudeau said thursday that canada's immigration system owes some of its success to its private refugee sponsorship program, which has long been viewed as the global gold standard for similar community-led efforts. the program allows church groups, families, and other community groups to privately sponsor and help resettle refugees.
biden is pulling the plug on trump's 1776 commission, a highly controversial panel he established last fall in response to black lives matter demonstrations across the u.s. the commission purported to promote a patriotic education but was widely panned by historians as presenting a pseudo-historical take on america's racist past and erasing truths about slavery and the civil rights movement, all in the name of propping up trump's own agenda.
there is another option: biden can stick with his plans to work with republicans, provided he's willing to significantly limit his ambitions on key issues and risk the wrath of the democratic party's left wing.

the legislation includes no funds for state and local governments, and according to economists mark paul and adam hersh, is at least $2.1 trillion short of what the economy needs to return to pre-pandemic health. paul and hersh assume that government spending is about or a little more efficient at boosting economic growth than its direct outlays ― payments are spent on other activity, which in turn encourages more activity.
mr. trudeau's rhetorical strategy isn't benign. it belies the notion that his policy decisions cannot be described to canadians; that facts are not within the ability for us to grasp or argue through.
i believe this was the right decision for twitter. we faced an extraordinary and untenable circumstance, forcing us to focus all of our actions on public safety. offline harm as a result of online speech is demonstrably real, and what drives our policy and enforcement above all. — jack (@jack) january 14, 2021
will the republican leadership allow rep. louie gohmert (r-texas) to continue serving on the house judiciary committee? like king, gohmert has an exhaustive history of making remarkably ignorant and racist comments. in june of 2011, gohmert took to the house floor to accuse obama of being loyal to the muslim brotherhood. last year, gohmert introduced a resolution wanting to declare march 31, cesar chavez's birthday, as national border control day. last october, gohmert floated the idea that the president should invoke martial law to deal with the caravan of immigrants he characterized as gangbangers.
days before mccaul and her legion of self-proclaimed sister survivors confronted nassar in court, i published a piece about the 140 women who had publicly accused nassar of sexual abuse at the time. while their stories had commanded attention in the lansing area (thanks to first-rate reporting from local media), they hadn't yet garnered the international attention they would ultimately receive. it was frustrating, and disappointing, to see dozens of stories of serial abuse brushed aside by mainstream media.

holcombe hopes that local jurisdictions ― and other states that may legalize one day ― give a leg up in the industry to even more people, especially those who don't have the funds to start a business and who may have a marijuana conviction that makes getting a bank loan difficult. holcombe said cities could address this through allocating a portion of marijuana sales tax to fund these equity applicants' start-up businesses while also prioritizing women and minority business applicants.
keeping these protections for our nation's schoolchildren in place is our collective responsibility, and i encourage individuals and institutions to submit comments opposing the rule changes before the jan. 28 deadline. but in particular, i appeal to the parents who are so worried about their sons facing false accusations that they are in favor of throwing out these victim protections.
a spokesperson for the nlrb said the agency declined to comment.
the chances of trump making such a contentious move may have multiplied due to the uproar over his jan. 6 speech in which he repeatedly urged his supporters to fight for him. some legal experts say this could open him up to lawsuits or even criminal charges.
sean hannity is losing it over progressive democrats' green new deal, a policy proposal that would push the country toward 100 percent renewable energy over about a decade.

ocasio-cortez's power is a direct threat to conservatives because her very existence in congress as a young, latina, working-class woman threatens to upend the social order that has kept white men in the ruling class for centuries. (eighty-eight percent of house republicans are white men, most are over the age of 50, and the party's voters are majority white and male.) on top of that, she is using her position and platform to directly challenge that order ― to attempt to get money out of politics, raise taxes on the super-rich and level the playing field.
and the big chains do offer a big upside: their massive scale. they have a large workforce of pharmacists already trained to give vaccines, appointment systems already in place, and physical facilities all over the country. that's bound to help a lot in the coming months, as supply increases and many more people become eligible.
no matter your age, it's easy to covet all the great new things other people seem to have. many of us have gotten caught up in keeping up with the joneses. but this game isn't sustainable and doesn't result in long-term happiness. trying to keep up with someone else's standards isn't going to get you anywhere.

cable has been here before of course. he served as acting leader in 2007 during the transition from sir ming campbell to nick clegg. but that was under very different circumstances than where he finds his party today. we had never been in government. so, you know, there was nothing to defend. it was all attack, attack, attack. ten years on cable, the former business secretary, acknowledges his association with the coalition has been a factor in the past but this diminishing as an issue. we do know from our surveys there about 25%+ of the electorate are considering voting for us. they may not, and they haven't firmed up on it, but there is a potential market, he says. from my recollection a majority of those who currently not voting for us but considering it are labour, on the left labour people. i guess the coalition was an issue for them but will become less so over time. the whole brexit thing has brought other issues to the fore. there are some good things happening, cable says of his party's position. we have this record level of membership, lots of enthusiastic young people. we are the youngest of the three parties, i've discovered, in terms of average age. you go around the country and lots of kind of idealistic young people, full of energy who want to do things and that's really good.

washington recorded the first u.s. coronavirus case in january, and now has more than 2,000 people who have tested positive. this order is enforceable by law, but the legal penalties are not what should convince people to follow these orders, inslee tweeted. the real penalty may be the loss of a loved one to covid-19. there are 110 washington families who can tell you what the pain of that loss feels like.

the 2010 reconciliation vote came after a year in which president barack obama and democratic leaders in the senate undertook exhaustive negotiations with republicans, over not just health care but also an economic stimulus package and climate legislation. in fact, democrats had deliberately kept reconciliation as a last resort for their health care bill, in the hopes they could get gop buy-in.

what is powerful now, four years later and in my experience organizing for the last 20 years, is that now we see intersectionality in a way that we have never seen before. we've seen racial justice movements working with climate justice movements working with gender justice movements in ways that are really unprecedented. i believe that the women's march ― and our contribution as women-of-color leaders in the women's march ― forced our movement to understand that we cannot win this in silos. we cannot defeat donald trump or his policies in silos. once donald trump goes after one of us, he's gonna go after all of us ― and that's, in fact, exactly what he did. so i think in the next four years, under the biden administration, you will see a lot more intersectional power building across movements and across communities.
although there are more than 10,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus in canada, and over 100 deaths, one in eight canadians still think the threat is overblown, according to an angus reid poll released tuesday.
today's world is deeply interconnected, and information communicated by multiple forms of media, networks, social media and peer relationships shapes the moral compass of children and young people. in education, people of varying backgrounds come together and get to know many different customs, communal practices and beliefs. learning together across the boundaries of languages, cultures, religions and beliefs creates a setting for genuine interaction and communality.
look at some of the allies that america has — japan, south korea, canada, mexico, the uk. trump has a style of insulting and being brash about things on twitter, but mostly issues with these countries have been solved behind closed doors because their relationships have been institutionalised over 40, 50, 60 years. with institutionalised relationships, a lot of these differences get divided down the political ladder, where empowered cabinet secretaries can make decisions. with india and the u.s., it's a one step forward and two steps back kind of situation.

beforethe coronavirus crisis, the foreign influence and interference debate had a deep and profound effect on the reputation of chinese-australians. propelled by a 2017 joint abc/fairfax media investigation , the topic of foreign influence became an instant news item. topics that have come under the scope of foreign influence, bringing intense public discussion and scrutiny, include research collaboration between institutions, foreign students studying in australia, foreign investment and political donations. despite the overarching theme of foreign influence, the only country that consistently gets a mention in australian media and public commentary is china.
in the netherlands, since the 1970s gender mainstreaming effort, the idea of gender equality is so firmly instilled that citizens won't vote for parties whose candidate lists aren't roughly gender-equal, ensuring women get on the ticket. the eu first began to legislate equal pay and equal rights for women in 1979, pressuring member states to adopt such laws nationally. so a top-down cultural shift has been underway for decades.

the only alternative to having a renters policy is to not have one! that means you'd better be prepared to handle losses on your own if something happens. some people manage by putting aside a little each week for an emergency fund, should they ever need to replace or repair their belongings. the problem with that is you likely wouldn't have enough saved to replace everything all at once: a 2016 federal reserve study found that half of americans don't have enough savings to cover a $400 emergency.
chris carlson/associated press president donald trump listens as franklin graham prays at a nov. 1 campaign rally in hickory, north carolina.
power in brazil has always remained concentrated largely among a white and wealthy elite; literacy and education rates are still low, especially among the poor; an over-militarized and under-trained police force has continued to kill large numbers of poor (and mostly black) citizens; and the return to democracy was marked by more than a decade of economic instability and hyperinflation that perpetuated vast social, racial and income inequality.
the president is not the only bad actor here who must face punitive measures. sens. josh hawley (r-mo.) and ted cruz (r-texas) led the attempt in their chamber to overturn the election results, championing trump's conspiracy theories. hawley gave a now-infamous fist-pump to the assembled mob shortly before they began rioting. reps. mo brooks (r-ala.) and madison cawthorn (r-n.c.) both spoke at the trump rally ahead of the attack and spread the lie that the election had been stolen from the president through mass fraud. all four men have decried the violence that ensued, but none have apologized for their role or even acknowledged any responsibility for the insurrection. if any of them respected their offices, they would resign. since they will not, the house and senate should expel them and let their constituents select replacements.
the president of the mormon church is believed to be a living prophet able to receive divine revelations from god. succession is based strictly on seniority. nelson was the longest-serving member of a church body known as the quorum of the twelve apostles, which meant that he was next in line for the role of president. he became part of the quorum in 1984.

even more than women, the alt-right loves to bully jews. if they can associate something they dislike with a jewish person, however tangentially, they default to froth-mouthing. whitefish has been judged by the alt-right/paleo-nazis to have given offense to richard spencer, so these self-proclaimed savages threatened an armed march through whitefish to show the jews and everyone else who's in charge.

lawmakers and advocates began to discuss what it might look like if legalization policies embraced restorative justice. how can communities of color, whose access to the networks and means required to start a business for cannabis had long been oppressed by the rules governing it, now benefit from what is projected to be the largest and most profitable market in the u.s.?
that is no minor thing. medicare pays far less than commercial insurers and hospitals say the reimbursements are not sufficient to cover their costs. it's why a public option could potentially offer lower premiums but also why, historically, proposals have generated such intense opposition from hospitals.
the proposal's $1.9 trillion price is significantly higher than anything republicans have been comfortable with in recent months, but biden has repeatedly argued deficit spending is necessary to combat the pandemic's damage. the proposal does not include any tax increases or revenue raisers to offset the cost of the aid.
today, lawmakers in 16 states and the district of columbia announced new legislative efforts designed to protect americans from intrusion into their personal data by schools, employers or government. the proposed laws focus on a range of issues, such as email and other electronic communications, employees' use of social media, cell phone trackers and license plate readers. should these measures pass, it would send a strong signal to other states and congress that americans remain concerned about protecting their privacy.

i'm sorry, the call you've made to the american people cannot be completed at this time, or ever.
world war ii ended with the death of around 36.5 million europeans and it left europe devastated with social, economic, security, and political crises. the former soviet union has expanded its influence through aggression and suppression in the region. in may 1985, the ussr formed the warsaw pact (the treaty of friendship, co-operation, and mutual assistance), a collective defense treaty among the soviet union and seven soviet satellite states in eastern and central europe. the ussr assumed that the union and the pact would defeat nato, but on the contrary, the pact dissolved in 1991. the former ussr was defeated in the cold war and nato has succeeded in its first objective.

the political right has not done well in latin america in the last few decades, levitsky, of harvard, said. so right-wing politicians are looking around for a new formula, and illiberalism ― really egregious illiberalism ― may be that formula. if he's perceived to be successful, it will be reproduced.
separatists have been specifically dismayed about equalization payments, where federal funds are transferred between wealthy and less wealthy provinces to help ensure reasonably comparable health care, education and welfare in all regions. opponents of equalization say alberta pays an unfairly large share, and argue that it should be allowed to keep all of its oil revenue.
world health organization: biden also is directing the government to rejoin the world health organization, which donald trump withdrew from earlier this year after accusing it of incompetence and bowing to chinese pressure over the coronavirus.
biden's action sets the tone for a more engaged federal role in curtailing a disease that has so far killed 400,000 americans ― accounting for roughly 20% of global fatalities, a percentage far higher than every other developed country.

the report does not specify the exact number of kids who were separated from their parents and guardians because orr staff were only informally tracking the issue, nor does it explain why these children were taken from their families. it's likely impossible for the government to determine the full scope of how many migrant kids the trump administration has taken away from their parents.

in march, the department will follow-up the release of the teacher preparation report card with its own annual report that will allow preparation providers to focus on effective interventions to drive improved outcomes. these annual reports will also be used to determine ongoing approval for all providers. the teacher preparation report card and the forthcoming annual report are two steps tennessee has taken to accomplish better transparency and focus on continuous improvement for educators. as a member of the council of chief state school officers (ccsso)'s network for transforming educator preparation (ntep), tennessee has committed to strengthening educator preparation through specific policy levers, including how teachers are prepared, licensed and equipped to help kids on day one. now in its fourth year of existence, ntep currently connects 13 states and experts from over 20 national education organizations to elevate best practices in transforming educator preparation.
west virginia, in particular, is working exclusively through small, independently owned pharmacies. that turned out to be a smart move because the independent pharmacies already had strong working relationships with the long-term care facilities. and that enabled them to deal with logistical issues quickly, starting with the need to get consent from patients or (when patients have diminished capacity) their families.
the @potus account is passed on to whoever holds the executive office, but trump has rarely used it, instead favoring his @realdonaldtrump handle. twitter permanently shut down that personal account friday evening after determining it carried a risk of further incitement of violence.
the trump administration has constantly rehauled the immigration enforcement system to scare off the migrant families and children. but none of it ― zero tolerance prosecutions for petty immigration offenses, a six-week experiment with systematic family separation, the mobilization of the national guard and u.s. military, a court-enjoined policy barring migrants from asking for asylum ― have stopped them from arriving.

instead of listening to marginalized voices, warren listened to trump. in her elaborate dna test rollout, the senator was more focused on one-upping the trolling president than protecting native rights ― a promise she made and broke in less than a year. the dna test not only used the same rhetoric about race, blood and native identity that the far right is using to attack tribal sovereignty but also was politically stupid.

but here in san francisco's gritty tenderloin district, where fentanyl was only rarely seen until last year, drug users tell a starkly different story. for many of them, fentanyl is a high-value drug that, if used carefully, can prevent dope sickness and deliver a strong high for a fraction of the price of heroin.
rather than paper over those differences, common defense said it was trying to represent the views of its membership. when surveyed, about 75% of its members support sanders or warren, but there was not a clear mandate for either candidate, according to the group.
pubs have been ordered to close from midnight tonight, as the u.k. government escalates measures to fight coronavirus. prime minister boris johnson has previously urged people to avoid pubs, clubs, theatres and other such social venues in order to try and slow the spread of the virus. but despite the plea, many londoners were still gathering in pubs in some parts of the capital this week. the government also announced it would step in to pay 80% of the wages of workers to encourage employers not to layoff staff.

new york city is about 10 days away from widespread shortages on ventilators, masks and other supplies needed to treat patients with covid-19, said mayor bill de blasio. he warned that more people will die if president donald trump doesn't step up his response to the pandemic.
the announcement from mayor bill de blasio came roughly a week after the democrat was inaugurated for a second term. it marks his strongest action yet to address global warming and its associated sea-level rise, which devastated the city with massive flooding during superstorm sandy in 2012.

the massive #metoo moment demonstrates women and men in the workplace still face illegal practices, and that they need each other to make structural changes as well as to obtain individual remedies. the nlra is a key part of that change. so, too, is a new legislative proposal introduced in both the house and the senate to end forced arbitration of sexual harassment claims brought by workers.
these themes of victimhood from a leftist elite have suffused conservatism since religious, business and white racist conservatives came together in the middle of the 20th century in reaction to the new deal, the civil rights movement and the women's and gay rights movements.

you reap what you sow, the company account posted wednesday evening, just hours after the capitol riot. you can't keep people locked up in their house. you can't keep ignoring the needs of your citizenry. you can't keep antagonizing the people. then act surprised when they rise up and it boils over, the post said beneath a meme based on an image from the riots.
as with all insurance policies, it's important to read the policies thoroughly and evaluate whether they fit your specific needs. some riders will cover accidental loss, while others won't account for other damage beyond theft or loss. another important answer to get on paper: what counts as sufficient proof that your ring is gone and will need to be replaced. if you want a more tailored plan for your piece of bling, consider going to a company that specialize in jewelry insurance, such as gemsafe.

you'll be required to spend 14 days in quarantine in a designated facility if you arrive in japan from mainland china, hong kong, macau or south korea.
not being able to move away from this top heavy approach is a failure. if we had moved away then we wouldn't have been at a stage where a head of state, in this case trump, would be used as a leverage point to say — he is coming next week — do you want to get this deal done or not. if we had progressed on building this relationship on multiple levels, these issues would not play out in the open. these would be settled behind a consultative dialogue that happens behind closed doors.
adherence beyond the federal purview, then, will require americans to comply out of a collective sense of civic duty.
although sanders has been engaged in a high-profile fight in the national press with biden over their respective social security records, j.d. scholten, an unaligned democrat making a second bid to challenge rep. steve king for a u.s. house seat in northwest iowa, is not sure if his particular message on social security was breaking through the noise to ordinary voters.
however, the change is just now making headlines following a los angeles times feature on jessie meehan, a cisgender woman who claims she was discriminated against at a walgreens store in hollywood, california, last year. meehan said she was very surprised and shocked when she was asked to use the men's restroom while visiting a walgreens in june, during the city's pride celebrations.

even trump's signature promise, that he would build a massive concrete wall along the 2,000-mile southern border of the u.s. and force mexico to pay for it, was a failure. after four years, he managed to build only 80 miles of steel fencing in areas where there had been no barrier at all, using money he raided from the pentagon's construction budget meant for, among other things, schools and housing for military families. mexico has not paid anything.
besides the economic hit, asian communities in canada faced racism at personal levels. the ontario government's post-sars commission found cases of chinese workers getting terminated from their jobs and chinese tenants unlawfully kicked out by landlords. funeral homes cancelled victims' funerals if they heard the body came from a hospital dealing with sars.

tokyo is officially spending $12.6 billion to organize the olympics, although a national government audit office says it's at least twice that much. the local organizing committee budget of $5.6 billion is private money, with the rest coming from japanese taxpayers. about $1 billion in the local operating budget is to come from ticket sales, which would be lost if the games go ahead without fans in empty stadiums.

employers in health care, emergency response and corrections would have to inform the agency when they become aware of a covid-19 case that probably resulted from work. but other entities would not have to do so unless there was objective evidence that the transmission was work-related, or there was evidence reasonably available to the employer ― for example, if a whole slew of people who work right next to each other got sick.

meanwhile, most of the state's population remains under a broad stay-at-home order as icu capacity dwindles. in hard-hit los angeles county, the total covid-19 death toll has reached 10,850 and confirmed cases topped 818,000. the county reported more than 7,700 people hospitalized, including 21% in icus.
that day proved to be a harbinger of what was to come. for the next four years, trump followed up with policies, actions and comments that were tremendously painful for hundreds of thousands of people. that suffering was borne primarily by minorities and people of color: latinos he demonized, black people he denigrated for protesting against racism and brutality, muslims he continually attacked, transgender people he licensed discrimination against, asian americans he insulted.
in a test-based school, it comes down to the test scores and accountability measures. in pennsylvania, ap test results can count toward a school's ranking. many states are now moving toward using sat's as the bs test for high school ranking. consequently, where decisions about students taking college entrance exams might have been based on what the student needs (will the ap credit be any use to her at her chosen school? does he even intend to go to college?), they are now based on how the student's choice affects the school. this spring, somewhere in america, a high school principal is going to say, i don't care if the credit isn't going to be any use at pat's school in pat's program -- that kid's the strongest student we have in that department. you get pat in there to take that damn ap test, whether pat wants to or not.

participation by women in scientific research is rising--women now outnumber men majoring in biological sciences and the percentage of women awarded doctoral degrees in life sciences grew from 15% in 1969 to 52% in 2009. yet women's participation in other stem fields (science, technology, engineering and math) still lags; fewer than 20% of undergraduate majors in computer science and engineering are women, and as they rise through the ranks, disparities persist. women are still underrepresented in faculty positions, female engineers publish in more prestigious journals but their work is cited less frequently, and editorial boards for journals in stem fields remain overwhelmingly male.

walter stahel, the swiss architect and industrial adviser, has been since the '70s one of the fathers of the idea of a circular economy, for which he argues with a 'river and lake' metaphor. thus far, the economy is conceived as a river, in which we should try to double the flow rate per capita every ten or twenty years no matter whether in this eternally doubling flow the content of beneficial nutrients or detrimental toxins grows faster. instead, a circular economy would be rather like a lake. citizens and policy makers would rather preserve and improve the quality and accessibility of this lake, without increasing the affluent and effluent river more than absolutely necessary.

the subjects of the senate finance committee's hearings were just as vague: comprehensive tax reform, individual tax reform and international tax reform. the hearings totaled 11 in the house and senate. forty-five witnesses were called, never more than five per hearing. nearly half came from inside the beltway. none dealt with specifics because the tax bill was still being drafted — in secret.

rebekah was incensed that trump had a tougher immigration policy than cruz did—she particularly liked trump's idea for a total ban on muslims. subsequently, cruz proposed a 180-day suspension on all h1-b visas. meanwhile, even though the cruz staffers generally got along well with their ca counterparts—they sometimes took the visitors country-western dancing —the firm remained a source of friction. in retrospect, wilson told people, he believed that nix resented the campaign for allocating work through a competitive bidding process, rather than favoring ca. two weeks before the iowa caucuses, wilson assigned a contract to a firm called targeted victory. ca then locked its data in the cloud so it couldn't be accessed by roe's team. the data remained unavailable until, a cruz campaign source said, it was pretty much too late to be useful. cruz won the iowa caucuses anyway. the cruz operation became so fed up with nix that they pushed back, hard, on ca's bill for its second six-month contract. wilson was able to negotiate the fees down after, as cruz staffers recalled, a ca representative accidentally emailed him a spreadsheet documenting the houston team's salaries. (nix said ca had intended to send the spreadsheet.) still, the campaign wound up paying nearly $6 million to ca—which represented almost half of the money the mercers had pledged to spend on cruz's behalf. the acrimony lingered long after cruz exited the race in may. when he decided not to endorse trump at the gop convention, the mercers publicly rebuked him.

moro spent years positioning himself as apolitical, but his pursuit of da silva took on an air of zealotry. the conviction was criticized as sloppy and legally questionable by independent brazilian legal experts, and the timing of certain revelations from moro — wiretapped phone calls between rousseff and da silva, released in 2016 in the midst of her impeachment; testimony accusing da silva, haddad and the pt of graft, unsealed the eve of the election — suggested the judge was putting a finger on the scales of the cases and, perhaps, the election. (in november, moro agreed to serve as the head of the national justice ministry under bolsonaro.)
the president's trip came a day after disclosure of a remarkable telephone call he made to the georgia secretary of state over the weekend. trump pressured republican brad raffensperger to find enough votes to overturn georgia's election results ahead of wednesday's joint session of congress that will certify biden's electoral college victory. the call highlighted how trump has used the georgia campaign to make clear his continued hold on republican politics.
it may sound simple, but hardly ever provides a remedy. most people never file claims for arbitration because, as #metoo has reminded us, most people do not go it alone to challenge powerful opponents ― especially not their current employers. even starting requires finding and figuring out how to use the rules on the website of organizations like the american arbitration association ― or locating a lawyer willing to help on claims that may be of great value to the individual but that are under $10,000. that's why states provides small claims courts to make individual pursuit of cases easier, and why class actions in regular courts bring together a lot of claimants who share the expenses of lawyers skilled at amassing the evidence needed. because it is hard, expensive and scary to go it alone, and because the procedures for doing so are complex, most people who have been injured don't do anything. they lump it by absorbing the losses and, as we know from #metoo, by suffering in silence.
on the campaign trail in georgia, warnock regularly invokes his family's working-class background, telling stories about how his father used to rouse him from bed early in the morning and noting he was only able to attend college because of scholarships. during his event in savannah on sunday, he spoke about his mother's work picking somebody else's cotton and somebody else's tobacco in the 1950s.
and these are only the problems of my (privileged) young kids. many students come to school hungry, lack heat at home, or don't dream of college because they don't believe they will live long enough to attend.

she pointed to a 2012 washington state university report showing that although white people in the state use marijuana at a slightly higher rate than black and latino people, they are arrested far less. black people were arrested at 2.9 times the rate of white people between 1986 and 2010. latinos and native americans were arrested at 1.6 times the rate of white people.

the scale of the defeat – truly catastrophic rather than merely awful as some whips had hoped – makes it very difficult to see how may can win over rebels by merely tweaking her defeated deal.
at first, while i was still hurting inside, i felt motivated to keep climbing the white privilege ladder to get as far away as i could from the position of being a victim of racism. i would collect my latest (white) gold star and think, suck it, syracuse! as i became more enmeshed in my 20-something rat race life, however, it became more subconscious. i am naturally hardworking and competitive (aka type a), so i began enjoying my aggressive life pursuits more simply for what they were. i began to go long stretches of time without thinking about syracuse or bushroot or any of that pain. in fact, i never told a soul about bushroot until this year.

trump's photo-op and the police crackdown on protesters was just days after [the death of] george floyd. those who want to maintain an oppressive and racist regime are perhaps most threatened by the organizing component. that's where i think you see the call for police violence against protesters ― it's because trump was threatened by the protest. the lesson for us is we can't give up the protest, even in the midst of a pandemic.
the tax cut is trump's only major legislative accomplishment, but it wasn't supposed to be. he and his congressional partners spent more of the year focusing on health care, as they tried to repeal the affordable care act. the effort fell short, in no small part because gop repeal proposals looked nothing like what trump had promised.

when democrats re-took the house in 2007, they reinstated expired pay-go rules requiring any new spending to be offset. but following a decade of frustration with republicans' willingness to discard their professed fiscal conservatism to cut taxes for the wealthy ― and a burgeoning field of research downplaying the importance of low budget deficits ― many democrats have soured on pay-go as a vestige of a misguided era of centrist triangulation.
even the much-lauded new deal was a site of racial discrimination by the federal government. the federal housing administration erected barriers preventing black americans from taking out home loans—where most of americans' familial wealth is located. from the 1930s to the early 1960s, 98 percent of all home loans went to white families. the federal government insured loans in white neighborhoods, making loans more financially viable for banks. consequently, these neighborhoods grew in wealth and businesses flocked to them, reinforcing these communities' wealth accumulation. decades of investment in white communities, and disinvestment in black communities, is why the average black family has $1700 in wealth, while the average white family has $116,000. that means many white families have savings allowing them to ride out hard times, like a federal government furlough. but most black families do not.
the unemployment provisions, along with the direct payments, have gotten some pushback from left-leaning lawmakers, who had understood biden's promise of $2,000 to be on top of the existing $600 congress approved last month, not including them.

no matter how the shipper arguments are chopped, cubed, diced, minced, sliced, shredded or otherwise presented, the substitution of government fiat for market-based solutions will adversely affect traffic flows, swell the number of time-consuming and costly interline and yard switches of freight cars, reduce network reliability, and cause an overall reduction in service quality. any immediate price reduction will be transient, at best.

kansas secretary of state kris kobach (r), who is a defendant in the case and is serving as his own lawyer, questioned how much of a burden it would have been for stricker to prove he was a citizen to election officials, noting that there was an election office near the hotel where he worked, so he could have taken his birth certificate there during his lunch hour. stricker said he frequently works nearly 12-hour days and often eats lunch at his desk. plus, in 2014 he had just started a new job and was wary about taking a lunch hour to go to the election office. he has since refused to register on principle, saying an average kansan shouldn't have to take legal action to register. the kansas law has also been blocked since 2016, when a federal judge stepped in and issued a temporary injunction, a decision that allowed 18,000 people who had tried to register at the dmv but failed to prove their citizenship to vote that year.

new delhi — on 5 june, 2019, the trump administration removed india from its generalised system of preference program (gsp), a preferential trade agreement for developing countries under which indian goods worth $5.7 billion had gone into the united states duty free. a day after the u.s. president donald trump announced his first official trip to india, his government removed india from a list of developing countries that are given trade benefits on the grounds that india is a member of the g-20. this naturally makes it harder for india to regain its gsp status, a key demand from new delhi in the fraught negotiations with washington.
while the legislation was hailed as a landmark for lgbt+rights in greece, gay and lesbian couples are still not allowed to marry, adopt children together or adopt the biological children of their partners.
a new generation of left-wing democrats, including reps. alexandria ocasio-cortez (d-n.y.) and rashida tlaib (d-mich.), ran as champions of a green new deal, a sweeping federal policy to end fossil fuel use and guarantee high-wage clean-energy sector jobs to every american. it's a popular idea. one poll released last month pegged the number of registered voters who support a green new deal at 81 percent, including 57 percent of conservative republicans.
the outlook for any of these proposals in the state legislature is unclear. california has a history of aggressive action to help people get health care, up to and including its implementation of the affordable care act. but some of its more ambitious initiatives have failed because legislators could not agree on funding and the state constitution requires a two-thirds vote for new taxes.

the russian-backed syrian state denied government forces had launched any chemical attack as the reports began circulating and said the rebels were collapsing and fabricating news.
deputy national security adviser matt pottinger, a leading aide on trump's china policy, quickly quit in what two sources said was an act of protest against the president's response to the rioting. pottinger did not respond to requests for comment. he was followed by at least five other senior foreign policy aides. transportation secretary elaine chao, who is married to senate majority leader mitch mcconnell, and education secretary betsy devos also resigned in protest.
trump tweeted late last month that the u.s. had defeated the islamic state militant group in syria ― a claim experts reject ― and that it was time for american troops to come home. the announcement sparked immediate backlash from military and intelligence officials, including the resignations of jim mattis, the defense secretary, and brett mcgurk, the u.s. special envoy to the coalition to fight isis.

and while sanders' biggest applause lines typically come when he mentions one of his signature policy pushes ― expanding medicare for people over the age of 65 to the entire american population ― warren avoided directly mentioning the issue, instead repeatedly discussing the importance of medicaid. warren has co-sponsored medicare for all legislation in the senate.
speaking to radio-canada on friday, champagne said the government has to negotiate, country by country, access to airspace and landing rights. they must also ensure an open airport and that flight crews won't be quarantined when they arrive. canadians also have to be able to get to the airport — which isn't always the case when public and private travel is banned and whole regions of countries are under lockdown.

the bill, announced tuesday and set to be introduced wednesday, marks a significant step toward weaning the nation's largest and most economically influential city off fossil fuels. six cities across the united states already generate 100 percent of their electricity with renewables. the city council in washington, d.c., passed a bill last month requiring the city to offset 100 percent of its electricity purchases with renewable energy credits by 2032. but it would be a historic first for a metropolis like new york to shutter existing gas plants like these, and the city's move would likely ripple far beyond the five boroughs as other big cities sought ways to slash climate-changing emissions.
complicating this is the fact that many of these non-union verticals already exist under the actual l.a. times editorial operation, which strives to maintain a strict separation from any business interests. (the paper has a history of trampling the line between business and editorial.) some employees worry this is a precursor to layoffs for the union staffers, whom tronc seems to be actively making redundant. another possibility is that tronc will focus on building up a non-union workforce under newco and kill the union through attrition.
tweets that trump sent out from the @potus account quickly disappeared, indicating twitter may have deleted them, though the company hasn't explicitly stated its involvement. his campaign's twitter account @teamtrump was then suspended after it posted the same remarks from the president.
the number of protesters is also drastically different; there were millions in 2009, compared with thousands over the past week.
the spanish are a very sociable bunch, and an enviable climate means much of life is spent outdoors. all year round in my neighbourhood, bars keep their doors swung open and people sit outside at restaurants. every morning and afternoon, like clockwork, a crowd of children and their families gather at the school gates to gossip, eat pastries and play games.
newsom's comments came monday as the state's death toll topped 26,500 and confirmed cases neared 2.4 million since the pandemic began. the state's swamped hospitals held more than 22,000 coronavirus patients, including nearly 4,700 in intensive care units, the department of public health said.
it's structurally quite similar to the 2001 firewall letter, written by future-prime minister stephen harper and other prominent albertans to then-premier ralph klein urging him to to fully exercise alberta's constitutional powers by creating a provincial police force and withdrawing from the canada pension plan.
contractors are working not just at technology giants. one 2018 npr/marist poll estimated that 1 in 5 americans holds a job as a contractor. as employers increasingly outsource labor to cheaper contractors, temporary contractors working in purgatory arrangements are becoming a permanent part of work life. they could be working at your office too, as they are at mine. a spokesperson for verizon media services, huffpost's parent company, said in an email that only direct employees are invited to the company's holiday party, but they are each allowed a guest (so a contingent worker could attend as a guest if so invited).
it's just the worry that someone says something or looks at you some way and you feel it's because of this virus, or people are avoiding you because of who you are.
ending ban on muslim travelers: biden is ending what is variously known as the travel ban or the muslim ban, one of the first acts of the trump administration. trump in january 2017 banned foreign nationals from seven mostly muslim countries from entry into the country. after a lengthy court fight, a watered-down version of the rule was upheld by the supreme court in a 5-4 decision in 2018.
mike pompeo tagged the nobel prize organization in a tweet alongside a photo taken last summer after the white house helped israel establish full diplomatic relations with the united arab emirates.
but monday's supreme court ruling overturns that interpretation, leaving existing policy in place. the state, the court found, was right to continue to interpret permits by weighing cost-effectiveness and technical feasibility against adverse effects on health and the environmental.

canada was a cheaper destination than other countries, and also an easier one for friends and relatives to visit, she said.
the details and implications of these interactions are so complex that even veteran capitol hill aides will concede they don't understand them fully, deferring to experts and scholars who focus on congressional procedure and the budget process. and virtually every rule has its exceptions and caveats. one example: reconciliation guidelines don't explicitly prohibit changes to nonmandatory spending, several experts told huffpost, and in principle congress could make such changes if it wishes.
in the meantime, find out where to submit your claim and have your documentation ready. castro said if you are laid off, you should file for unemployment insurance through your state. that can be done online; just use the department of labor's list to find your state's website. there may also be a phone option.
should trump attempt to order a wall built based on his emergency powers, he would immediately be sued by members of congress. the democratic house would surely pass a law or a resolution of disapproval while the republican senate would be inclined to back the president. however, trump's move would be massively unpopular, both as policy and as an extra-legal power grab. that might give some republican senators pause. it's not hard to imagine the defection of several republican senators, and a joint resolution blocking the wall. whether trump has to obey that resolution would also end up in court.

fda's data could have severe implications for the future of kratom. the latest press release comes as the agency appears to be leading a push to ban the substance under federal law. following pushback, the u.s. drug enforcement administration postponed a move to place kratom in schedule i, alongside drugs like heroin and lsd. but the fda recently completed an analysis that may help determine how the dea proceeds. a spokesperson for the dea said tuesday that it could take months or even years for the agency to reach a final decision on scheduling.
the other hurdle is that the indian government brings down the prices of american pharmaceutical products like coronary stents and any implants by nearly 65% to 80%. we do that because our consumer base is largely middle income that cannot afford to pay humongous prices for these vital products. the americans say if you want to do that then do that, but why should we take a hit on our per unit cost. you do that on the landed cost. you give us our margins on the per unit cost. the indians are countering that by saying that don't think about the per unit cost, but think about the big market that you are entering. the sheer quantity that you will sell will give you your numbers.

the u.k. foreign office has been billing women for the cost of their rescue from forced marriages overseas, the times newspaper reported this week. the office's forced marriage unit, which assists with rescues of british nationals duped or coerced into marriages abroad, has been withholding the passports of survivors who can't pay for their own rescue, the report said. a survivor of forced marriage responded to the news in a blog post for huffpost u.k. that sheds light on the way some families manipulate their daughters into marrying strange men thousands of miles from home. it's a fascinating read that does credit the foreign office for investigating nearly 1,200 forced marriage cases last year. but it also makes clear how the policy uncovered by the times puts vulnerable women in an even more vulnerable position. these are not victims who had a choice, they didn't go to their local travel agent and book two weeks in the sun, overspending their resources on a jolly and expecting the good old british taxpayer to foot the bill, jasvinder sanghera writes. they are victims of crime at the hands of the very people who should have loved and protected them.
4. treating everyone equally. while this tactic works with school children, the workplace ought to function differently. treating everyone equally shows your top performers that no matter how high they perform (and, typically, top performers are work horses), they will be treated the same as the bozo who does nothing more than punch the clock.
the cdc is currently making preparations to set up a training center for drc ministry of health workers in goma, the capital of north kivu south of beni and butembo. vaccination of frontline health care workers has begun in the heavily populated area, which lies on the rwandan border. the cdc said the ministry of health is also considering moving its ebola response operations there. however, the u.s. agency would need clearance from the state department to re-enter north kivu. it's unclear when ― or if ― that will happen.
some states, naturally, have managed better than others. the three having the most success ― again, based on bloomberg's tracking of vaccines administered relative to population ― are west virginia, north dakota and south dakota. other places doing relatively well include connecticut and maine. alabama is where vaccines are getting into arms the slowest. california is really struggling too.

yet the only way to be sure to halt no-deal is if parliament gives may no choice politically, and possibly legally. that's why nick boles' new eu withdrawal bill is being seized on as a way through the logjam. it could 'instruct' may to choose whatever 'plan b' the commons agrees on.
no matter that gabbard's candidacy is likely going nowhere, her op-ed should be a warning sign to voters and those in the media who, as with trump in 2016, might again buy in to a candidate's claims of evolution while the candidate keeps signaling their actual views.
i know twitter just introduced a new tool for political ad transparency in india, but there's still sort of this question of what twitter will do if politicians actively misuse the platform. has that ever happened where a politician has been removed, and does twitter have any plans for what to do if that happens?
the resulting national spotlight was unlike anything roberts had seen during his previous campaigns.
sen. marco rubio (r-fla.) championed a more generous child tax credit in 2017 as part of the tax cuts and jobs act. (one reason other republicans went along is that the credit helped offset the loss of other family-friendly tax provisions in the law's simplification of the tax code.)

but for legislation to pass through reconciliation, every provision must satisfy certain conditions, including several put in place by the late robert byrd, a democratic senator from west virginia who was concerned lawmakers were using reconciliation for uses too far removed from its original purpose of putting government finances in order.

fey's shows excel when they find clever ways to point out the absurdities of people and institutions that already have plenty of power. over the years, the part of 30 rock that has held up the best is its skewering of the business of television and corporate culture more broadly. the show's profusion of jokes about indecipherable business jargon, product placement, company mergers and the boundless confidence of mediocre white men often went over my head when i watched it as a teenager. but now that i'm an adult working at a media company owned by a telecom company, they seem much more relevant and more laugh-out-loud funny.
others have tried to enter the u.s. between ports of entry, which can be especially dangerous for children. last month, two guatemalan teens injured themselves after climbing the border wall separating arizona from mexico and falling 18 feet. other migrants, including children, have been tear-gassed or hit with rubber bullets while trying to cross the border illegally.

the narrative we must revise is as old as the very existence of narrative. and it will require what women have been acculturated to resist most of all: to make a mess. not just the expression of pristine black gowns or neat hashtags, but embracing of the sort of complicated characters we've long said we want to see. our stories will require nuance and contradictions if we want them to truly rewrite the world ― a panoply of desire and ambition and fury, as varied as we are.
the company is under scrutiny after the new york times reported that officials deployed software that provided misleading data about rides to government regulators.
other contenders for mayor have signaled concern about the issue. maya wiley, the former mayoral counsel and msnbc host, promised to place making new york more resilient in the face of climate change among her top priorities as mayor, a spokesperson said. another mayoral contender, former obama-era housing and urban development secretary shaun donovan, highlighted his work overseeing the recovery from 2012's superstorm sandy. andrew yang, the failed 2020 democratic presidential contender, was spotted filming his own mayoral announcement on the coney island waterfront last month.
he didn't want to waste people's time, said lucie macías, a supporter of ramirez-rosa and a fellow member of the chicago chapter of the democratic socialists of america. he wanted to respect people who had put in effort into this campaign, so it made sense to make the announcement now.
ten years out, once the law takes full effect, more than half of all taxpayers will be paying more and most of the rest will see no change, according to analysis by the tax policy center.
new army regulations released on tuesday state that servicemen and women at the brigade level will now be granted religious accommodations to wear turbans, beards, and hijabs in accordance with their faith. the move comes just days after the new york police department announced its decision to allow officers to wear turbans and grow beards for religious reasons.
she reminded us that he has been so consistent from his time as mayor to his time in congress on the issues that he's cared about, said natalia salgado, cpd action's political director. that kind of reminder, for a lot of folks, when we're dealing with an administration as inconsistent and unstable as the one we're dealing with, is so incredibly refreshing but also exciting.
the coalition this year has successfully lobbied state legislatures in new mexico and maryland to rescind previously passed resolutions that called for a convention. and in nevada, the state senate has passed a rescission resolution and the house is expected to act on it soon.
gottlieb appears to be at least somewhat aware of these constraints.
the former minister says his biggest accomplishment in office was funding a massive expansion of public transit and investments in infrastructure like roads and bridges.

the problem has urgency now because the supreme court is currently considering arguments on whether to keep these barriers to public courts and to class-action suits in place. the reason to use murphy oil, epic systems and ersnt & young as examples is that they are all before the u.s. supreme court, under the aptly named header of epic systems.

we're looking into what can be done as a state measure as we speak, she told huffpost on monday. it's exactly what we should be doing.
i took my time walking back down the road. all kidding aside, things look pretty bleak in randsburg. most of the houses are missing windows, and it clearly rains every time someone plays that piano. the abundance of antique stores makes you feel as though the town is selling off everything it has left. the locals seem to treat their conditions as most small towns treat a brothel. everyone knows it's there. everyone knows what goes on inside, but what are you gonna do, bring it up?
most alarming, we have made the financial security of the elderly almost completely dependent on stock market values by making 401k plans and mutual funds the flagship operations of our retirement system. the value of your nest egg is dependent not on your thrift or prudence, but on when you happen to invest, and when you need to cash out.
update: feb. 26 ― the campaign of democratic presidential candidate pete buttigieg said wednesday it has canceled his trip to florida because he is ill. the trip was to include three fundraisers and a roundtable.
the executive order issued wednesday was one that lgbtq advocates were hoping to see immediately from the biden administration. it should clarify that the federal government as an employer adopts the broader view of the bostock decision as to what constitutes sex discrimination ― that it includes discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity ― while applying that interpretation to other laws like the affordable care act, the fair housing act and other parts of the civil rights act.
the eitc has long enjoyed bipartisan support because it encourages and rewards the work of low- and moderate-income people. rigorous research has cemented its pro-work reputation: during the 1990s, eitc expansions did more to raise employment among single mothers with children than either the 1996 welfare reform law or the strong economy, a well-regarded study found.
a new pathogen that is believed to have originated in a seafood and live animal market in wuhan, china, late in december has spread to at least 15 countries including canada, the u.s., france and singapore.
john bolton said there is no timetable for the pullout, but insisted the military presence is not an unlimited commitment.
under the new executive guidance, federal agencies are to assume that laws forbidding discrimination apply to sexual orientation and gender identity, not just race, religion, sex and national origin. the measure was part of a slew of orders biden signed shortly after his swearing-in, as both a substantive and a symbolic rebuke of the trump era.
the outgoing president also acknowledged that a new administration will be inaugurated on january 20, the closest he's come to conceding the election to president-elect joe biden. trump said his months-long crusade to overturn the election results was merely an effort to ensure the integrity of the vote.

after that date, another option for handling federal loans is to apply for income-driven repayment. depending on the program, you can have your loan payments reduced to 10 to 20% of your income. you need to re-certify your income every year on idr, so if you lose your job in the meantime, your payments should adjust accordingly. in fact, it's possible to qualify for payments of $0 (though you will still accrue interest). and keep in mind that if you have private loans, your lenders may have similar loan hardship programs available.
across the state, only about 5,000 people have so far applied to have their marijuana sentences reviewed for possible relief, according to data compiled by the judicial council of california. in san francisco specifically, only 23 petitions for reduction or sentencing clearing have been filed over the past year, according to gascón's office (the office has no active marijuana prosecutions).
beyond their stark ideological contrasts to president donald trump's agency heads, biden's top-level nominees also appear to signal the new administration's plans to embed climate policies at the state level, cementing the clean-energy transition and making it harder for the next gop president to undo whatever progress his administration makes.
that may be because trump's negotiating style at a base level contradicts all the best practices generally agreed on by experts in negotiation.

like other totalitarian regimes that have no legitimacy and no base of support, the saudis are wrapping themselves in religion. saddam hussein in the 1990s and currently bashar al-assad -- the heads of the baath party in iraq and syria -- both played the religious card. however, baathist doctrine in iraq and syria is basically irreligious. the saudis are using religion as their excuse now, labeling the recent mass executions as preserving their religion when they are actually a message to frighten their citizens into submission.
graham is the president and ceo of the billy graham evangelistic association and samaritan's purse, a christian relief organization. over the past four years, he has been one of trump's most loyal, high-profile evangelical supporters. he's criticized trump very rarely and defended him staunchly through numerous controversies ― from the president's 2017 travel bans to his aggressively obtained photo-op with a bible during anti-racism protests last june in the wake of the police killing of george floyd.
the baltimore sun reports she is taking the step to reduce any potential outbreak for those behind bars. an outbreak in prison or jails could potentially be catastrophic, mosby told her office. now is not the time for a piecemeal approach where we go into court and argue one by one for the release of at-risk individuals.
so it's no surprise that the friedrichs lawsuit was filed by the center for individual rights, a law firm with ties to anti-worker special interests -- like the koch brothers and alec. these are the same interests that have spent decades campaigning to weaken the ability of working people to join together against corporate power and the interests of the 1 percent. for all their talk of freedom and individual rights, billionaires like the koch brothers sure are anti-democratic.

what these advocates are now watching is who will be appointed to the committee and how much funding it will get.
somewhere in there, perhaps later in the year, is the appointment and confirmation of two new leaders to the surface transportation board (stb). putting nominee prognostications aside, two things are clear: the stb will soon have five members for the first time ever - with a 3-2 republican tilt - and the board, even though the rail industry has asked for a freeze to all major rulemakings, will pick up where it left off in considering a bevy of regulatory proposals.

in addition to an act of domestic terrorism, moore called the riot a violation of scripture's calls for christians to submit to governing authorities and refrain from spreading lies. it could have a damaging impact on evangelicals' efforts to witness to those outside the faith, he added.
the idea of employing out-of-work oil hands to plug and remediate abandoned oil wells has been floated a few times in recent years as a transitional job for these blue-collar workers while the economy shifts away from fossil fuels. although oil companies are legally required to decommission out-of-use wells and drill sites, and return the land or sea to its pre-drilling condition, it's fairly common for companies to declare bankruptcy before these asset retirement obligations (aros) are fulfilled. consequently, there are now an estimated 1 to 3 million abandoned wells in the u.s. in need of remediation.
abortion rights campaigners say they are incredibly disappointed maria caulfield has been made conservative vice chair for women in theresa may's cabinet reshuffle. the lewes mp said she was delighted with the job, which will see her serve alongside newly-installed party chair brandon lewis and vice chair james cleverly. but termination provider bpas said it was dismayed at the appointment, as caulfield has previously spoken out against the decriminalisation of abortion and shadow women and equalities minister dawn butler said the government's decision was appalling.
as with the green movement, the iranian government is retaliating with mass arrests and restrictions on dissent. both demonstrations created enormous challenges for tehran, but unlike the 2009 revolt, experts say, today's protests are an extension of iran's civil rights movement fueled by longstanding grievances, rather than a coordinated revolution. several factors highlight the key differences.
consider women's underrepresentation in patenting, an indicator of participation in tech commercialization. although the situation is somewhat murky, since the u.s. patent and trademark office (uspto) collects no demographic information, a report released in november by the institute for women's policy research shows that patents with at least one woman inventor reached only 18.8% in 2010. this marks an increase over the rate in 1977, when 3.4% of patents listed at least one woman inventor; but at current rates, it will be 2092 before women reach parity (i.e., half of all patents will have at least one female inventor).

the longer the shutdown goes on, the more untenable it becomes for owners to keep scraping by without the federal funds they're expecting ― and the more likely it becomes that those owners will start resorting to rent hikes or evictions of these lowest-income renters, as we are now seeing, yentel said.
the vice president told reporters that the democratic leaders also objected to trump's characterization of the situation at the southern border, which pence referred to as a humanitarian and security crisis. pelosi, pence said, began to argue whether we even had a crisis or whether facts are true.

i feel like a lot of anxiety and anger has been misdirected, thiele said of warren's native critics in the press. i do feel like it's about the opportunity to get time in the media. if they are this critical of donald trump, no one is going to cover it. if they are this critical of elizabeth warren, they will get covered. i feel like there are some perverse incentives here.

those are two big takeaways from a new working paper by a group of researchers led by stephen zoepf, executive director of the center for automotive research at stanford university and a researcher at the mit center for energy and environmental policy research, which found that a substantial percentage of drivers for ride-hailing companies probably earn less than they think they do, though their wages are padded thanks to per-mile tax deductions.
i'm not saying it's a negative. i'm saying we shouldn't do it, even if it was a positive, we shouldn't do it. we need to be descriptive as part of our curation guidelines, descriptive of what happened. like, our whole role in that is to find the interesting tweets that show a story from all perspectives. the moment that we inject any sort of categorization, we've lost that promise.

it isn't often that a franchisor like mcdonald's is held accountable for labor law violations at its stores. roughly 90 percent of mcdonald's locations are technically run by franchisees -- the much smaller companies or individuals who tend to the day-to-day operations and ultimately sign workers' paychecks. according to mcdonald's, it's the franchisee who's responsible for the working conditions inside a mcdonald's store.

we are disappointed and are still reviewing the ruling. secretary ross, the only person with legal authority over the census, reasonably decided to reinstate a citizenship question on the 2020 census in response to the department of justice's request for better citizenship data, to protect voters against racial discrimination, she said in a statement. not only has the government asked a citizenship question in the census for most of the last 200 years, 41 million households have already answered it on the american community survey since 2005. our government is legally entitled to include a citizenship question on the census and people in the united states have a legal obligation to answer. reinstating the citizenship question ultimately protects the right to vote and helps ensure free and fair elections for all americans.

of course, when trump vowed to protect the forgotten men and women of our country, he likely had a specific subset of men and women in mind ― working-class americans and, in particular, white working-class americans. stoking their racial resentment has been a theme of his presidency, just as it was a theme of his candidacy.

electoral protests turned violent in beni, with people burning an ebola transit center and scattering the patients waiting for test results there on dec. 27, as well as vandalizing several other health facilities. that violence and other election protests, which focused on ebola facilities after the government blamed the epidemic for the voting delays, led several non-governmental organizations to temporarily stop operations in the region over the last two weeks. at least five international ngos that had been offering critical assistance to the world health organization and the drc ministry of health ― mercy corps, médecins sans frontières, international medical corps, oxfam and the international rescue committee ― have at least partially pulled their personnel out, according to the irc's new field director for beni, dalia al-awqati.

nah, i don't think the dead have a big long list of stuff they want to tell us, unless it's the combination to a safe that contains a few million in unmarked benjamins, or that there was a large insurance policy they never told you about, naming you beneficiary, or most importantly, that i am actually an aristocrat with a title and land holdings in worchesterchestshiresham. you'd hope, if they were able, that the people who precede us in death would make a sincere effort to communicate important information such as i just mentioned. otherwise, i'm not feeling it from them.

two years later, the centrist parties launched an effort to impeach her that looked less like an effort to hold rousseff accountable than a chance for brazil's establishment to seize via goo-goo crusade the sort of power it couldn't win at the ballot box — and protect itself from judicial and public scrutiny in the process. for others on the right, including bolsonaro, it was merely an opportunity to rid brazil of a leftist government that they claimed had waged a war on god, family and the brazilian people.

one reason is that congress is limited to one budget reconciliation bill per fiscal year, restricting how much legislation it can pass with a simple majority and heightening competition for what takes precedence. because congress has not yet used a budget reconciliation bill in fiscal year 2021, which began in october, it can pass one such bill for fy2021 and another such bill for fy2022.
the interior department is also moving forward with fossil fuel lease sales, as the bureau of ocean energy management offered up a sweeping 78 million acres in the gulf of mexico for bidders on wednesday despite environmental groups' calls to halt the sales during the pandemic. john filostrat, a spokesman for the bureau, said the event was live-streamed with only a handful of boem workers, with bids submitted either by mail or in person at the bureau's new orleans office.

trump's creation of a space force, which he appears to believe was a major accomplishment, was merely a bureaucratic renaming of the air force's space command, which had existed since the reagan presidency, with no change in mission or staffing. democrats, however, were able to trade that trump win for paid family leave for federal workers, a longtime priority of theirs.
the majority of singles and couples i met in the lifestyle visited clubs to explore their sexuality in a safe and judgment-free environment, deepen their intimacy with their partner, or have consensual, no-strings-attached sex. the majority of people are in the right place for the right reason, and within that context, sex clubs can be empowering.

now i've read that testimony. now i'll just say: a cover-up is not a proper reason to classify a document, lofgren said during the democrats' oral arguments on wednesday. we urge the senators to review it, and we ask again that the white house declassify it. there is no basis to keep it classified, and again, in case the white house needs a reminder, it's improper to keep something classified just to avoid embarrassment.

hirono and harris had asked buescher if he could rule impartially on issues such as abortion and lgbtq rights, and they had referred to his membership in the knights of columbus, the catholic fraternal organization that is opposed to abortion and same-sex marriage. the questioning touched off a wave of faux outrage on the right claiming anti-catholic bigotry.

in 2011, california's independent redistricting commission drew electoral boundaries for the state for the first time. anyone can apply to serve on the 14-member commission ― which is made up of five democrats, five republicans and four people not affiliated with either party ― but there are strict requirements on who can serve. eligible applicants must be registered to vote in california and have voted in two of the last three elections. in the 10 years leading up to submitting their application, they also can't have run for office, worked for a lawmaker, political party or as a lobbyist, or donated $2,000 or more to a party or candidate. votes from multiple democrats, republicans and independents are required to approve a plan. h.r. 1 would impose similar safeguards on the independent commissions it creates to help ensure the districts are fair.

the most in-demand type of masks are n95 respirators which are often worn by workers in industries such as construction and healthcare. while they might be effective at preventing contact with contaminated liquid, they won't hold back small particles in the air from coughs or sneezes, and so aren't effective protection from covid-19.
the hope center, which is also known as the downtown soup kitchen, wants to continue barring transgender women from sleeping in its overnight shelter for homeless women, and the alliance defending freedom is supporting it in its fight.

these huge first steps show biden is serious about climate action, but re-entering the paris agreement and canceling keystone must be the start of a furious race to avert catastrophe, kierán suckling, executive director of the center for biological diversity, said in a statement. much more is needed, and we're increasingly hopeful the administration will stop approving new fossil fuel projects and speed the transition to clean, distributed energy that climate science and justice demand.

but reconciliation is a notoriously cumbersome and complex process, because of interlocking rules on what legislation can and cannot include. and although it's possible to alter those rules or challenge interpretations of them, doing so usually requires a series of votes from the full senate ― and, in the best of scenarios, the assent of at least 50 senators.

oops. neither of these stories included comments from any elected tribal leaders. the post story didn't include comments from native people at all. of the three native voices mixed in with political pundits in the times story, one is a known warren critic and one is a congresswoman-elect whose positive comments were buried ― a stunning distortion of how many tribal leaders and native people in general feel about warren's move.

biden's transition team did not respond by press time on its strategy for the congressional review act. but with control of the senate, it certainly makes the president-elect's campaign trail promises to undo trump's regulatory legacy a little more likely.
the announcement about watson's donation, along with contributions from several other celebrities, to the uk justice and equality fund followed the publication of a dear sisters open letter in the guardian on saturday. the letter was signed by some 200 women in the british entertainment industry and called on people everywhere to stand in solidarity with hollywood's times up initiative to fight sexual harassment and inequality.

new york wouldn't be the first municipality to carry out a plan seeking universal coverage. san francisco enacted a similar plan in 2007, while newsom was mayor, and one of that plan's architects now is a de blasio adviser. los angeles county, california, and the district of columbia also have local programs that provide coverage and services to uninsured residents that predate the affordable care act.

with wednesday's vote, trump became the first president in u.s. history to be impeached twice, as 10 of his fellow republicans joined democrats in denouncing him. but it appears unlikely to lead to his ouster before his term ends since there are no plans to convene a vote in the republican-led senate, which alone has the power to remove him.
it was bloomberg's first democratic debate. the former republican new york city mayor made it on the debate stage after the democratic party changed the qualification rules to focus more on poll numbers instead of grassroots donations (bloomberg is self-funding). from the get-go, the other democrats on the stage made it clear bloomberg wasn't getting a first-timer's free pass.
dsa has made significant inroads into government in the past 14 months, with several members being elected to state and local posts. but just as ramirez-rosa's success in getting on the ballot reflected dsa's rising prominence, his failure to mount a robust challenge to garcia reflects the limits of the organization's political reach.

i predict to you, and i may eat these words, i predict you as donald trump's shadow fades away, you're going to see an awful lot of change, biden told a virtual gathering of supporters last month. i think you're going to be surprised. it's going to take six to eight months to get it underway, but i think you're going to be surprised.
what trump, miller, homan and the rest of the anti-immigrant restrictionists are overlooking is that an overwhelming majority of americans still support allowing dreamers to stay in the country. if congressional republicans fail to enact sensible protections for dreamers, these ordinary citizens, legal permanent residents and immigrants will hold them accountable ― and step up where necessary.

monday was an important day for america's shrinking middle class. the supreme court heard oral arguments in friedrichs v. california teachers association, a case that could impose radical new limits on the rights of public sector workers -- like teachers, nurses, and firefighters -- to join together to win better lives for their families and communities.

based on the fda's recent public actions, however, it appears to favor outright prohibition, a move that would cut off millions of americans ― many of whom have struggled with opioids or other prescription drugs ― from their preferred method of treatment. some drug policy experts and a handful of congressional lawmakers have said the damage caused by forcing people away from kratom, and possibly back onto other prescription or illicit drugs, would far outweigh the current harms. furthermore, if kratom were to be banned, many individuals would simply continue buying and using it illegally. if feds are worried about controlling kratom now, driving it onto the black market will only make that harder.

i quit these things because i finally understand that playing the martyr has had precisely the opposite effect i intended. instead of giving my best to my family, i subverted my own needs so thoroughly that i became a wilting shadow of who i ought to be, and the me they get is stressed, angry and short-tempered. no more of that nonsense. from now on, everyone, including me, gets the calmest, happiest, most fulfilled version of me.

a tourist tosses back a beer just as the woman is asking the man for half an hour to collect the money. she starts the race against the clock. she calls several contacts from her imo address book, but the first four, at least, don't answer. on the fifth try, a shrill voice on the other end says, hello.
trump directed law enforcement to tear-gas and launch rubber bullets at the peaceful protesters so he could walk to the historic st. john's episcopal church just a few blocks away. once there, he posed with a bible for a photo-op and said, greatest country in the world. and we're going to keep it safe.
hughes tried last year to go for what he called the big lift of comprehensive tax reform, but he was stymied. he thinks the extra revenue gives more momentum to his efforts in 2018. but senate president wayne niederhauser, also a republican, said he wanted to wait for deeper analysis of the impact of the tax overhaul from state financial officials.
we must listen to the voices of lgbtq people, many of whom are christians — to their stories of oppression, pain, joy and historical and present triumph. we must let their stories change those of us who are not marginalized on the basis of gender or sexual orientation and follow in the fight for a more equitable world. i must, as a christian reject any ideology, law or practice that strips people of their humanity.
geddert's wife, kathryn, is now the sole owner of the gym. the athletes, coaches and parents remaining in the twistars community ― some of whom are nassar victims themselves ― will either begin a new era of positivity and respect, or the gym will fail. likewise, i'd like to think that either usa gymnastics and the culture of the sport as a whole will be reinvented, or the sport will go away.

lawmakers like sen. kirsten gillibrand (d-n.y.), sen. patty murray (d-wash.) and rep. rosa delauro (d-conn.) have raised the issue's profile in the last few years, and polling shows actual bipartisan support. biden's campaign agenda favors 12 weeks of paid family leave and seven days of paid sick leave.

he has gotten some number of women ― dozens, who knows ― to sign nondisclosure agreements, both for sexual harassment and for gender discrimination in the workplace, warren said. so, mr. mayor, are you willing to release all of those women from those nondisclosure agreements, so we can hear their side of the story?
states and cities started suing oil companies in 2015 after inside climate news and the los angeles times published documents showing that oil giant exxon mobil corp. understood fossil fuels caused global warming decades ago yet chose to ramp up drilling and fund a misinformation campaign smearing climate science. three years later, the dutch-language de correspondent published a similar exposé on shell.

but do you feel any sense of responsibility for amplifying this sort of misinformation? because this isn't just people saying something on the platform, it's the platform elevating whatever it is. and even if you catch most of them, there's still ones that get through and that have very real consequences.
that evening, graham tweeted that he was deeply saddened by what had happened at the capitol. he later tweeted that both parties bear responsibility for the problems we face today.
for two years, we've lived under a president who has brutally assaulted lgbtq rights at every opportunity, after having seduced a complacent media into thinking that he'd evolved too and that he was actually more accepting on gay issues, as the new york times infamously put it. if we've learned anything, it's that we can't trust media narratives on the civil rights views of candidates — narratives often fed to reporters by the candidates themselves.
harvey weinstein, the disgraced film mogul who is currently serving a 23-year prison sentence for rape and sexual assault, has tested positive for coronavirus.
kruegel added that the fda's analysis was an order of magnitude less rigorous than many of the studies that had already been conducted on kratom. he said the fda's claim was akin to saying that all opioid agonists have the same effect, which is not true based on what we've learned about these compounds. (opioid agonists provide pain relief by binding to opioid receptors.)
this action will ban workplace discrimination based on a person's sexual orientation or gender identity. this is a sharp pivot from trump's administration, which had pushed the supreme court to rule that gay and transgender employees were not covered by title vii.

a series of local events might make for a flashy start to the year, but the sunrise movement's 2020 election push won't end with the monthlong roadshow. the group plans to confront presidential candidates directly, forcing each of the democratic hopefuls to take a position on the green new deal and on whether to accept donations from the fossil fuel industry. it's also preparing to stage protests at as many democratic debates as possible ahead of the democratic national convention in july 2020.
doj began to dramatically ramp up prosecution for illegal entry among parents who crossed the border with children. under past administrations, such as that of president barack obama, families that crossed the border illegally had not typically been charged with a crime, but rather put in immigration proceedings.

with that in mind, prominent progressives are calling on biden to immediately deliver on his promise of $2,000 relief checks, as well as to pass a robust covid-19 recovery package, enact sweeping democracy reforms, cancel student debt, and roll back the trump tax cuts.
of course, the liberals are fond of saying canada is back -- but one and a half years into their mandate, their promises aren't backed up by action. for example, we are still waiting for the liberals to fulfill their electoral promise and table legislation to accede to the arms trade treaty.

in the '90s, the government built fences in border cities such as san diego, california, and el paso, texas, which forced immigrants to make more perilous journeys through the mountains and desert. the number of migrants who died trying to reach the u.s. has skyrocketed and the bodies of nearly 3,000 migrants have been found in southern arizona since 2000, according to the pima county office of the medical examiner.

those who support firing robb might argue that democrats should not observe hitherto political norms under the expectation that republicans will pay them the same courtesy when they regain power. trump has smashed one standard after another as other gop leaders stood by, and mcconnell has been ruthless in reshaping the supreme court to conservative ends.
2. letting accomplishments go unrecognized. it's easy to underestimate the power of a pat on the back, especially with top performers who are intrinsically motivated. everyone likes kudos, none more so than those who work hard and give their all. rewarding individual accomplishments shows that you're paying attention. managers need to communicate with their people to find out what makes them feel good (for some, it's a raise; for others, it's public recognition) and then to reward them for a job well done. with top performers, this will happen often if you're doing it right.

this debate isn't a new one. when sir john a. macdonald unveiled his national policy in 1876, he championed a vision for canadian pacific railway's transcontinental line. the idea received a great deal of criticism initially, but the railway is now viewed as a critical building block of canada. it linked east with west, facilitated communications and the transportation of goods between canada's previously fractured regions, and helped the country compete internationally. high tech now, like the railway then, is the great connector and a key part of our country's competitive advantage and economic future. we must invest in it or risk getting left behind.

asked about climate change during an environmental protection agency briefing a little more than a month ago, zinke said he was proud the united states is now the largest oil and gas producer in the world ― and proud of the fact that we're going to get even better. he repeatedly downplayed the dire conclusions in the latest federal climate assessment, saying scientists relied on the worst scenarios. and while he pitched himself as a champion of public lands, he spent his time in the administration opening up millions of acres of public land to drilling and mining as he worked to pave a better future for the fossil fuel industry by rolling back environmental safeguards.

most of our priority right now in terms of health, which is the no. 1 priority of the company, is around being proactive. how do we remove the burden from the victims or bystanders from reporting in the first place? it's way too mechanical. it's way too much work. ... but ultimately, we want to make sure that the number of reports that we receive is trending downward. and that will be because of two reasons. one, people are seeing far less abuse or harassment or other things that are against the terms of service. or that we're being more proactive about it. so we want to do both. so a lot of our work is that, and then better prioritization in the meantime. a lot more transparency, clearer actions within the product.

republicans need just one victory to maintain senate control and force biden to contend with divided government. democrats need a sweep for a 50-50 split, giving the tiebreaking vote to vice president-elect kamala harris, who will succeed pence as the senate's presiding officer. that would give democrats a senate majority to go along with their control of the house and executive branch.

the ioc, much like other large properties such as fifa and the nfl, the last thing they want to do is refund fees or lower the cost of what the sponsorship is, chase told the ap. the last thing they want to do is give any money back or charge less. so typically what they try to do is negotiate some kind of make-good or substitute benefits.

but bushroot had enough similarities to my appearance that i had to believe it. the shaded skin, for one. and the spiky hair. i understood that my afro-style cropped cut was an unconventional look for our white, affluent, sorority-laden upstate new york campus. it was for me, too. i had never done anything so bold when it came to my appearance. i had gotten a burst of confidence after high school, though, and wanted to make a start strong in this new chapter in my life. i wanted to show up to college and really be someone.

as we know, communities of color have been most negatively impacted by marijuana prohibition throughout the years ― folks have been incarcerated for activity that is now completely legal ― and you have a new demographic now coming in taking over these spaces making millions of dollars through this industry, holcombe said. these programs can provide a tremendous opportunity for low-income folks, folks of color, folks who have lived in neighborhoods that have been over-policed, especially during the height of the war on drugs.

attacks such as the one recently carried out by the taliban on the bacha khan university in northwestern pakistan that killed more than twenty people keep this category of the pakistanis sleepless. these people are appreciative of general sharif's leadership and acknowledge the gains made in the war against the taliban but they are also skeptical of the claims that the army has fully won the war against the taliban. so much credit is given to one man (i.e. general sharif) for planning and executing the operation against the taliban that these people believe general sharif's retirement at a time when the battle against the taliban is not over will keep one door open for the taliban to regain power and carry out attacks on ordinary citizens.
we have a legal obligation to follow the law, and that's what we're going to do, nemes said. i want to make sure that the governor is given adequate time to make his defense to respond if he chooses to respond. and i want to make sure that we treat the petitioners with respect and give them an opportunity to make their cases. they have the right under the law to do that.

we know we are never truly safe. we know we must always keep our guard up. we've been forced to formulate an emergency plan in case immigration and customs enforcement shows up at our door. we have to keep a bag filled with essentials and a couple hundred dollars in the closet so we can attempt to escape at a minute's notice if necessary. we're aware of other individuals who've been discovered, and now they are facing active deportation orders and their families have been ripped apart. recently, an acquaintance of ours was taken into custody by ice and sent to a detention center. his daughter tried to kill herself that same night. i can't stop myself from wondering if javier is next.
another thing survivors need is a fair chance at getting justice and support services when something bad happens to them at school. is the department of education really concerned that there's too little sexual assault in our schools, or that it's too easy for children to find a school leader who believes them and will do the right thing? this, in an era when institutions of all kinds are discovering there's hell to pay for ignoring the truth? when as many as one-quarter of college women are sexually assaulted while in school? twenty million men — and many, many more women and non-binary people — have been victimized by sexual violence. they don't need fewer protections. they need more.
zeroing out planet-heating pollution from the world's second-largest emitter by the middle of the century will require unprecedented changes to the u.s. economy, and biden will need new legislation to do that.
saving money might be out of the question right now, especially if your hours have been cut. but if you have any savings from reducing spending and lowering loan payments, try to squirrel it away into an emergency fund. if you do end up getting laid off, you'll probably need some cash to float you until unemployment benefits kick in or you find a new job.

i'm 100 percent with you on this one, ashley. i'll never understand men who make comments like this. they're inadvertently telling their daughters (or granddaughters), i don't trust your ability to choose the right person, so i'm going to intimidate all of them by putting a killing machine in their faces. that will teach 'em to treat you right. it's straight up stupid. and the fact it's assumed boys will soon come knocking based on your teen daughters' mature looks is really gross and not exactly empowering to them as young women.

it might not be too bad because most of the profits in china are paper profits anyway. people bought $1,000 worth of stock last year and now they think they have $10,000 but really it's $500. of course, multiply that by half a billion chinese speculators and it does add up. global markets, led by china, just hit $75tn – a new record. this is really amazing since global gdp is still lower than it was in 2007 so that means that the ratio of stock valuations is now at an all-time high – isn't that special?
but patel, true to form, was elevated to the cabinet by may within months. this brings us to the latest debacle, which had its early peak with home office permanent secretary sir philip rutnam's explosive resignation on saturday. like may swearing, rutnam's decision to turn down the offer of a six-figure payout in favour of quitting on camera and vowing to sue for constructive dismissal was unprecedented – and provoked by patel. rutnam accused her of bullying staff, briefing against him, and lying about her role in it.

but in private, trump has been known to present his accomplishments in a different light. in december, just hours after signing the tax cut, trump was back in florida at his exclusive mar-o-lago club, where initiation fees are $200,000. while dining with some friends and supporters, cbs news later reported, trump told them what they probably knew already: you all just got a lot richer.

there is a saying i've learned ― la lucha sigue ― that means the fight goes on, and for us it has an especially personal and poignant resonance. every day we fight ― and not just for justice and freedom and fairness ― but also for understanding and kindness and respect, as well as for the opportunities to give just as much as we receive. javier continues to fight for a better life for his family and our daughter, and i continue to fight for him and for our family's life together. everyone deserves to feel safe, to feel secure, and to feel like they belong ― regardless of immigration status.

and, because he is a well-documented all-around good guy, reynolds heeded the call 10 minutes later — in his own way, of course.
we have the beginnings of a tailor-made solution to this problem before us right now. unlike past reforms, which used a one-policy-fits-all-genders mode, the dignity for incarcerated women act seeks to address the unique needs of this swelling population. introduced last summer by senators cory booker (d-n.j.) and elizabeth warren (d-mass.) and co-sponsored by sens. kamala harris (d-calif.) and dick durbin (d-ill.), the bill recognizes the history of sexual abuse shared by so many women behind bars.

the public-facing invitation for the $500-to-$2,800 per head fundraiser does not mention a specific location, merely the island of palm beach. the two hosts, personal injury lawyer bill bone and longtime democratic donor cynthia friedman, have been fixtures on the democratic fundraising circuit for years.
the campaign for trauma-informed policy and practice has detailed the connection between opioid addictions and childhood sexual abuse. victims of childhood trauma are more likely to report debilitating physical pain and be prescribed pain medication, and 80 percent of people seeking treatment for opioid addiction have experienced at least one form of childhood trauma, including sexual abuse. childhood sexual abuse, particularly among women, is highly correlated with opioid abuse. women are increasingly likely to turn to opioids for relief from pain, be it physical, psychic or both. between 2002 and 2013, heroin use among women doubled.

and then i entered fourth grade. my teacher, mrs. gerlip, was a young dynamo who integrated art, music, theatre and other forms of creative expression into a lively curriculum. i blossomed. i formed an all-inclusive fun club with other girls in my class which was all about, well, having fun. i wrote a book i called through the forest about the misadventures of polly and jack who disobeyed their parents and had to fend off wild animals and misguided hunters. as one of the only jewish kids in the school, i had the chutzpah to sing a chanukah song -- in hebrew -- at our annual christmas assembly. much of the joy and self-confidence i experienced that year was attributable to a great teacher whom i never forgot.

she said the ierb isn't doing nearly enough to crack down on immigration, both legal and illegal. she'd like to see all immigration curtailed, because, she said, all immigrants — the latins and the indians — do is drain government resources and take jobs away from american citizens.
many critics of the board, who fall on both sides of the immigration battle, have said it should be disbanded.
twitter and other social media companies have long been criticized for not banning the president or taking harsher action against him after his repeatedly use of the platform to incite outrage and violence. the companies have previously defended leaving up trump's posts as they were of the public's interest.

it's clear that fame, money and attention is what's motivating them, smith said of usa gymnastics and msu. let's be clear, though, you can't buy us off. there's no amount of money, there's no amount of fame or attention that can get us to stop.
accepting the best film prize, three billboards writer and director martin mcdonagh appeared to give a nod to the night's activism.
under obama, republican darrell issa (calif.) wielded the oversight gavel in a unilateral manner by sending out more subpoenas than the previous three chairmen combined. meanwhile, rep. trey gowdy (r-s.c.), the outgoing oversight chairman, led a special committee to investigate the death of ambassador chris stevens and three other americans during an attack in benghazi, libya. the investigation uncovered nothing new that multiple previous investigations had not revealed. instead, the committee was used as a campaign tool against 2016 democratic presidential candidate hillary clinton, who was secretary of state at the time of stevens' death.
well, i mean, people follow people that violate our terms of service and who we take action upon, and if you're only following those people and you're not following anyone else, you tend to see that and the perspective is strengthened. as i said in front of congress, we do make some mistakes where our algorithms can be super aggressive. but do we build bias into our systems? no, it's not in our policies, it's not in our enforcement, and it's not in our algorithms. when we discover it, we remove it. and that's a field of research that we need to continue to invest in, bias in algorithms. so the main thing that we're focused on is how we stay transparent with our actions and continue to be impartial — not neutral, but impartial.
trump also said the department of housing and urban development is suspending all evictions and foreclosures until the end of april. and the department of health and human services announced a new regulation that allows doctors and medical professionals to practice across states lines to meet the needs of overstressed hospitals.
one potential problem is that it could boost the impression that military professionals who are supposed to serve any duly elected commander-in-chief are instead prioritizing their own politics, creating what sen. richard blumenthal (d-conn.) called the perception of republican generals and democratic generals ― and the fear that officers might not fully respect the authority of elected officials whose views they do not personally share.
while staver says that he is generally opposed to lynching (does he really want credit for that low bar?), he and his organization have made it clear with their opposition that they would rather see lgbtq people dead without justice than see them alive and acknowledged as fully human. liberty counsel, which once advocated for kim davis and her refusal to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples, uses quotes around language like transgender and gay on its website to invalidate the lived identities of people who obviously exist.

six states ― alaska, arizona, california, idaho, montana and washington ― use independent redistricting commissions to draw lines for state or congressional districts. (voters in michigan, utah and colorado passed ballot measures establishing independent commissions in the november election.) advocates say lawmakers have firm incentives to draw districts that favor their parties, and the independent commissions offer a firm check to make sure districts are fair.

reynolds' remarks set her apart from several other republicans across the country. in florida, former gov. rick scott (r) made it much more difficult for felons to apply and get their rights back after he took office. in 2015, kentucky gov. matt bevin (r) rescinded an executive order from his democratic predecessor automatically restoring voting rights to some former felons. senate majority leader mitch mcconnell (r-ky.) said on the senate floor in 2002 that voting was a privilege and people with felony convictions shouldn't vote because they would dilute the votes of law-abiding citizens.

the policy, which the federal centers for medicare and medicaid services calls healthy adult opportunity, is the trump administration's attempt to accomplish a long-held republican goal: to shrink medicaid by establishing annual caps on how much federal money goes to state medicaid programs.
in a significant shift, deputy leader tom watson told corbyn in july that he would not stand in his way on party reform, although allies warned the leadership to focus on taking on the tories than 'faction fighting'. katy clark, who is now corbyn's political secretary, will lead the wide-ranging structural review. a senior source at grassroots group momentum told huffpost uk: the review is a very promising first step towards a labour party that is election ready and fit for the 21st century. i'm sure the 500,000 members who showed such energy, enthusiasm and dedication during the last election will welcome having more of a say, and we're glad that every wing of the party is recognising the huge contribution they make. but richard angell, director of progress, labour's centrist pressure group, said: today, labour's new establishment bounced the nec in private session into a series of reforms that amount to a factional power grab and more roles for members in london and the south-east. it is a missed opportunity to not give members in every corner of the country a voice by regionalising the nec. in a bizarre turn of events corbyn's political secretary will be leading a review into party structures rather than working out how to beat the tories and run the country. it is a warped set of priorities when a general election could take place at any point.
a damning new lawsuit against baylor university suggests that baylor went to great lengths to protect its football players, at the expense of alleged victims of sexual violence.
meanwhile in albany, the new democratic majorities in both houses of the new york legislature are preparing to push the climate and community protection act, a bill that would mandate 100 percent renewable energy across the state by 2050. the ccpa has repeatedly passed in the state assembly since it was first introduced in 2016, but the previous republican majority in the state senate refused to hold a vote on it. gov. andrew cuomo (d), who now says he wants to shift the state to 100 percent carbon-free electricity by 2040, declined to champion the legislation last year.
the other asterisk is that different countries started vaccinating on different days because government approvals of vaccines didn't happen simultaneously. the u.k. started first, then came the u.s. and then, finally, the european union. adjusting for that factor, the performance of the u.s. comes closer to that of the u.k., but several european countries, like denmark, ireland and italy, come close to or look better than the u.s.
dennis coker, the principal chief of delaware's lenape indian tribe, which is recognized by the state but not the federal government, also defended warren. his comments haven't gotten much news play.

both elizabeth warren and bernie sanders have campaigned extensively and unapologetically on bringing our fellow troops home, and have stood up for the majority of veterans despite the skepticism and smears of the hawkish foreign policy establishment and the political media who have too often been uncritical cheerleaders of these failed wars we were sent to fight, the group said in a statement.
for bayes-fleming and carroll, who are now hunkered down in an apartment conveniently located next to a grocery store, time ticks slowly by. they may be there for weeks, perhaps even months. quarantine means they aren't allowed to go outside except for essential items, and there is a nightly 8 p.m. curfew.
don't anticipate schools are going to open up in a week. please don't anticipate in a few weeks, newsom said during a news conference, according to the los angles times. i would plan, and assume, that it's unlikely that many of these schools — few, if any — will open before the summer break.almost every school district in the state is closed, impacting more than 6 million students in public schools. districts have continued to teach via online classes and homework. kansas also closed all state-accredited schools, representing nearly 500,000 students, for the rest of the school year on tuesday.
when you came to the business side of things, there was a complete dearth of conversation about inclusion, even though social and racial justice were at the forefront of the talking points around why you should legalize and why you should allow local jurisdictions to give permits, lencho said. but no one was talking about providing permits for those who actually went to jail for cannabis.
perdue and loeffler have answered by lambasting the democrats as certain to to usher in a leftward lunge in national policy. neither warnock nor ossoff is a socialist, as republicans allege. they do, however, support biden's agenda.
all in all, choose a scenario that works best for you. worst case scenario, you can stop your mail from the post office altogether and pick it up when you return from your vacation.
democratic control of the senate also makes sweeping labor reform possible through the protecting the right to organize act (pro act). the legislation, which the democratic-controlled house had passed last year, would ramp up penalties for employers who try to break unions, ban anti-union right to work laws, and expand workers' rights to strike and boycott. the measure would be a huge prize for organized labor, but it has drawn fierce opposition from business groups and could struggle to draw the necessary votes from moderate senate democrats.
those conditions, he said, included defeating what's left of is in syria and protecting kurdish militias who have fought alongside u.s. troops against the extremist group.

the tweets — which began friday and continued saturday afternoon — were what pompeo described as the full story about our foreign policy. they included anecdotes in which pompeo praised both himself and the work of president donald trump's state department in returning hostages from countries such as north korea and pulling u.s. troops out of afghanistan.
twitter users were happy to pile on the governor, who, as one of his last duties in office, signed legislation that stripped power from his democratic successor and gave it to the republican-controlled state legislature.

6. failing to plan for the worst.
the goal of the new york city plan is to promise access to health coverage and health care services to all of the city's 8.6 million residents, de blasio said.
the nlrb is an independent agency that referees disputes between employers and unions, with a five-member board that decides important cases, kind of like a supreme court. the general counsel, who is separate from that board, is supposed to investigate and prosecute cases where employers or unions run afoul of the law, and to manage the work of the agency's field offices.

it is impossible to be essentially keeping tabs on every single traveller that comes in, she said.
on aug. 12, trump addressed the violence by stating, we condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides ― on many sides. he defended the comments on aug. 15, saying, you have people who are very fine people on both sides and claiming he was referring to people protesting against removing monuments to confederates and racists.
if there is ever a question about whether any people should be protected from lynching, we have a problem. if there is a question about whether lgbtq people are made in the image of the god we claim, we have a problem. christians must recognize, particularly in the political realm, when we're failing to hold truly christlike belief and behavior.
in more recent times, other forms of deference have replaced ritual sacrifice (for the most part). instead of cutting the throat of an animal, people take part in worship services, engage in prolonged prayer, or otherwise manifest their deference to a deity. but the root idea that there is a god or gods who bestow favor based on the respect or honor we show them has persisted, at least in the minds of some.
to prevent that from occurring here, warren thinks the administration should direct hospitals in affected regions to delay or cancel elective surgeries. she also wants the administration to explore ways of ramping up ventilator production, whether by guaranteeing purchases in advance from existing manufacturers or working with the defense department to identify new ones and then signing contracts.
the need for earlier investments in black candidates is necessary, democratic operatives said, as a way to capitalize on their abilities to increase turnout among black voters.
for luisa and her teammates, a year and a half of late nights and early mornings and long weekends and intrastate drives elapsed between the indy star publishing its story and nassar's sentencing, at which so many women came forward to tell their stories ― including wieber, for the first time publicly including herself among the victims. it wasn't until then that the scope of what had happened at the gym became clear. one gymnast said a twistars coach fractured her hip, and another's testimony described repeated psychological and emotional abuse.
it shows an extreme disregard for people's rights and for the safety of children, she said. this administration doesn't see these families and children as people who deserve consideration.

between 1910 and 1970, australia had a policy of forcing the indigenous children into state care. it was a policy of racial discrimination, and the decades of damage turned into painful memories that existed like a wound. australia's politicians had battled for years over whether an apology should be made.
the guy who kept apologizing for slavery. awkward.
at the same time, new york gov. andrew cuomo, who began his first term in 2011 by coupling tax cuts with reductions in social spending, has proven resistant to any tax increases targeted at the super-rich. he has at once argued that it would provoke multi-millionaires and billionaires ― with whom he claimed to speak all day long ― to flee the state in pursuit of lower taxes, and wielded the threat of higher taxes as part of an appeal for federal aid.

since he was first elected governor in 2012, inslee repeatedly championed incentives for electric vehicles, with the goal of getting 50,000 on washington state roads by 2020. in 2016, he became the first governor to issue an executive order capping carbon dioxide emissions. a glowing profile published last week in the atlantic credited inslee with pursuing arguably the most progressive and greenest agenda in the country, with fields of solar panels, fleets of electric buses, and massive job growth to show for it.

they probably should have had the foresight to look at the map before they released it, but the app has a policy where you can opt out of data sharing, and that hasn't been done by the soldiers, ruser said.
borrowers with poor credit pay more when they borrow, but there is a reverse side to that coin. when they invest in reducing their obligations, the rate of return is correspondingly high. if the purchaser in my example intended to rent the house rather than occupy it, and if her credit score was 620 rather than 800, her insurance premium would be almost 6 times larger. in that event, the rate of return on the investment required to eliminate the insurance would be 39.26%.
for millennials, people under 40, people like myself, we need to give them a reason to vote for us. we need to give them a reason to vote at all, he told huffpost.
the blame doesn't rest entirely on the standardized testing companies, however; the vast majority of higher education institutions rely on high stakes tests for admissions purposes. while standardized tests do provide a metric to measure student achievement across a range of high school contexts, a growing body of research has shown that they are a better predictor of where students live than of what they know.
few locals have heard of it, but georgia's immigration enforcement review board was created seven years ago, when the state passed one of the nation's strictest immigration laws. trying to keep track of the legal comings and goings of the ierb, as the board is known, can be dizzying.

the younger gabbard, elected to the hawaii legislature herself in 2002 at the age of 21, railed against homosexual extremists in 2004, coming out against same-sex civil unions in her state. that same year she opposed anti-bullying legislation meant to protect gay students, arguing that it would teach young people that homosexuality is normal and natural.

rarely do the talking points — or the debates that follow — get into the details of what's actually happening in the oil and gas labor market: that it's an industry already grappling with a dwindling talent pipeline and that a push toward automation was making tens of thousands of oil workers redundant even before the coronavirus pandemic wiped out more jobs.

congressional democrats also want to reverse some of trump's tax cuts, but they've muddied the message by mainly insisting they would undo the only major tax hike that republicans included in the tax cuts and jobs act. among its various changes, that law capped the federal deductions people can take for what they pay in state and local taxes, which democrats decried as a tax hike on the middle class even though it mostly affected high-income households.

johnson wanted to see a change in the law that would prevent women who accessed drugs for medical termination online from being prosecuted. she said: i wonder if any of us truly believe that those women, in such difficult circumstances, really should be seen as criminals. let me be clear that decriminalisation will not mean deregulation. under the abortion act, a termination not officially certified by two medical professionals is not legal.

kobach said one could also take substantial to mean a small number of illegitimate voters who could end up swinging a close local election. he urged the court to evaluate the proof-of-citizenship law through a kind of intermediate standard and consider whether enough noncitizens were getting around the proof-of-citizenship requirement to render it insignificant.

the dress alteration alone would be challenging, not to mention standing in front of a crowd for the entire reception with swollen feet and a baby who won't stop kicking. um, no, thank you. if you feel comfortable doing so, tell her the truth. if she's ever experienced someone close to her go through those trying nine months, or if she's been pregnant herself, she'll likely understand how overwhelming it can be.

the administration's trade agenda will hinge significantly on its relationship with china. it faces major obstacles. ties between the world's two largest economies reached their lowest point in decades under the trump administration, which waged a haphazard trade war against china and, in its final days in office, declared beijing's brutal repression of its muslim uighur minority a genocide. biden will confront those challenges while both he and chinese officials face pressure from nationalists at home to intensify what looks increasingly like a cold war between the two countries.

it shouldn't go unnoticed that mr. trudeau is clever enough to always add how much he respects everyone's right to their opinion. nice in itself, but in the midst of a rhetorical ploy, it's not nice at all. it only adds insult to injury.

in a 1985 letter newly obtained by huffpost in which sanders debated running for governor, he wrote: whether i run for governor or not is really not important. what would be a tragedy, however, is for people with a radical vision to fall into the pathetic camp of the intellectually bankrupt democratic party.
mattis, who was widely viewed as a possible force of stability and reason, failed to rein him in, experts and lawmakers concur. to cohn, it's clear that both he and george marshall ― the only other person to ever receive the waiver austin is seeking ― failed to prevent the politicization of the military on their watch and relied too much on uniformed personnel over civilians.

on june 2, the american civil liberties union of new mexico and southwest women's law center filed two complaints on behalf of the teenager and her mother, arguing that the pharmacist's refusal to fill the prescription constitutes sex discrimination. the complaint claims it is inconceivable that the pharmacist would have denied service if he believed the medication was being used to treat stomach ulcers—the only reason why a man might get such a prescription.
but the mythos linking the congresswoman to the party's rising left wing collapses over the critical question of how to handle the world beyond america's shores. like sanders and warren, gabbard is acutely attuned to the left's frustration with endless wars. what she's offering, however, is a fatalist view starkly different from the optimistic global vision of progress they've been pushing into the national conversation.

another novel approach the biden administration could take to demonstrate its understanding of the u.s.'s disproportionate share of cumulative emissions would be to commit to funding and deploying technologies and policies to remove carbon from the atmosphere. carbon removal broadly defines a set of approaches that range from nature-based ideas like planting new forests and adopting new soil farming techniques to technological solutions such as direct air capture, machines that suck co2 from the atmosphere and transform it into a material that can be used in building materials or stored underground.

the maga myth was made real when, against all odds, trump shocked the media and democrats and won the 2016 election, despite losing the popular vote. he had promised deliverance, and he had delivered. trump would go on to describe that night at his subsequent rallies. this was a recitation of his victory as a dramatic narrative: a myth. the message is clear: trump won where no one else could, and america was great again because of him. trump was by himself the realization of the myth. as he said in 2016, i alone can fix it. naturally, his reelection campaign picked keep america great as its new motto. removal of trump through democratic elections had become synonymous with the fall of the republic.

to be sure, even a closely divided democratic senate wouldn't give biden everything he wants. senate rules still require 60 votes to advance most major legislation; for now, there aren't enough democrats willing to change that requirement. so, regardless of georgia's results, biden will have to win over republicans in a senate where a bipartisan group of more centrist senators stands to see their stock rise.
nothing was done in this year's budget, but an increase in capital gains tax may still come in the future. in his speech, finance minister morneau declared that going forward, we will close loopholes that result in unfair tax advantages for some at the expense of others. we will eliminate inefficient tax measures, especially those that disproportionately benefit the wealthy.

as for the plane crash near tehran, canada had to scramble to respond because it had no formal diplomatic relations with iran. i believe in dialogue even if it means having difficult conversations. after all, that's the nature of diplomacy. sometimes you do need to have difficult conversations.
beshear has faced numerous legal challenges from republican attorney general daniel cameron and other gop officials since the beginning of the pandemic, and the republican legislature last week advanced multiple bills that would place new limits on beshear's executive powers, a move they'd promised to make in response to his use of executive orders to implement covid-19 restrictions.

the eurozone is in a stalemate. a federal union would be needed to fix its problems, but there is no public support for it. returning to national fiscal responsibility would lead to defaults and exits. half-way solutions will prove insufficient but expensive and obfuscate the issues. therefore, there may be no way to avert the partial or complete break-up of the eurozone in the years to come. the fate of the euro may already have been sealed.
you take all your experienced staff and you drive them off the hill, schuman said. they hit 30 and they don't want to live in a row house, and, you know, they want to be able to have enough money to pay for day care or they meet a special someone and they can't afford to stay on the hill. it takes the people who are experienced and it drives them off.

there are suspicions that some in germany's government, in a country where so many jobs are connected to the car industry, must have been aware of the fraud committed by vw. elkins calls that pure speculation. still, he says, it is understandable that the scandal was first discovered in the united states rather than in germany.

with an estimated 34,000-plus deaths from flu in 2018-19, we have a long way to go in managing risks, chapman said. the respiratory virus risk in restaurants is really more about being in the same location as a lot of people, some of who can be depositing the virus on surfaces like tables, doors, menus, and managing that with a hand washing and alcohol-based sanitizer regime is an effective step to reduce risks of both covid-19 and influenza.

because the working world is changing in the face of coronavirus challenges and becoming more competitive, it may be some time before you're able to secure full-time income again. one of the best ways to prepare for losing your job is to start a side-gig that allows you to replace the income that you may soon lose due to an impending job loss, said roy morrison, digital marketing and growth strategist for meaningful profits.
bail reform advocates have been campaigning to replace this system with one that bases release decisions on individualized assessments that measure a defendant's flight risk and potential threat to community safety. in places like new jersey and washington, d.c., pretrial services agencies now conduct these evaluations and provide recommendations to judicial officers. under this system, many low-level defendants are released without payment, simply on the promise that they'll return for future court dates. others are subjected to some level of monitoring by the pretrial services agency or held without the option of bail.

the other main scenario is a 'regional conflict', for example between india and pakistan. in this case at least 100 smaller nuclear weapons would be used out of stockpiles of around 200 weapons striking mainly large densely populated super cities such as delhi and karachi. a north korea – us scenario could be similar but with fewer but larger warheads being used.

#2 - constructive criticism vs. self-doubt. this applies not only to your co-workers, processes and products, but to you, too! we need to find balance in our criticism. paralysis from self-doubt and perfectionism leads to total lack of progress. however, constructive criticism pushes us towards positive change and achievement. again, this can be a difficult balance to find, especially if you've been in business for a long time, doing things the way they've always been done. you may want to seek out an external resource to help evaluate and constructively critique your people, your processes and your business model.

in response, youth activists and a new cadre of progressive lawmakers, led largely by the bronx's own rep. alexandria ocasio-cortez (d-n.y.), outlined an alternative. the green new deal, a policy framework for the kind of federal industrial policy not seen since world war ii, quickly gained steam. by the time democrats began declaring their bids for president the next year, nearly every major candidate embraced the framework, including the ultimate victor, president-elect joe biden.
in 1761, james otis denounced british writs of assistance which empowered every petty british official to rummage through the homes or businesses of the colonists in search of contraband or smuggled goods. he remonstrated: it is a power that places the liberty of every man in the hand of every petty officer. john adams later chronicled: then and there the child of independence was born.

jail, as opposed to prison, has become a correctional catch basin for women: sixty percent of women in jail are unsentenced, left behind bars because they are unable to afford bond. the remaining 40 percent of female jail detainees are sentenced but have not been moved to a prison because they are low-risk inmates. in 2016, the vera institute of justice conducted surveys of that jail population and found that 86 percent of them reported being sexually violated before being incarcerated.
huffpost talked to doctors, nurses and emergency medical technicians in california, new jersey, hawaii and rhode island about what it's like fighting the pandemic. as they report for duty, the stock of personal protective equipment (ppe), which helps keep them and their patients safe and curbs the spread of the coronavirus, is running dangerously low.

to counter accusations that their bill was passed on speed-dial and was strictly partisan, republicans say the bill was six years in the making. they relied on bipartisan research and hearings, they say, conducted from 2011 to 2014 by democratic sen. max baucus of montana and republican rep. dave camp from michigan. back then, baucus chaired the senate finance committee and camp headed the house ways and means panel, yet they could not persuade a divided congress to take up their tax reform ideas.

in perdue's and loeffler's telling, a democratic senate would rubber stamp a socialist agenda, from ending private insurance and expanding the supreme court to adopting wholesale a green new deal that would spend trillions and raise taxes on every u.s. household by thousands of dollars each year. besides misrepresenting biden's and most democratic senators' policy preferences, that characterization ignores the reality of the senate's roster.

bloomberg should have expected these hits. his record with communities of color, his wealth, and his record with women have all come under intense scrutiny in the last week. yet he appeared unprepared on all fronts. he was muted in his defense of stop-and-frisk policies. he chalked up the harassment complaints to maybe they didn't like a joke i told, refusing to free the women at his companies from the ndas they'd signed, and didn't have an answer for why he has yet to release his tax returns other than to say he's working on it.

5. tolerating poor performance. it's said that in jazz bands, the band is only as good as the worst player; no matter how great some members may be, everyone hears the worst player. the same goes for a company. when you permit weak links to exist without consequence, they drag everyone else down, especially your top performers.

what i would like to see is for the biden administration to let go of this idea that individual passenger electric vehicles solve climate, embrace a public electrification vision, and be realistic about how the global supply chains are organized right now, so they can lay out a vision of green and just trade, she added.
so pleased with the rhetorical success of the goldilocks fallacy, he tried it out again when he approved the tarsands pipelines: one side of the house wants us to approve everything and ignore indigenous communities and environmental responsibilities . . . the other side of the house does not care about the jobs or the economic growth that comes with getting our resources to market.

i hope you also reject misguided calls to make college 'free' and require the two-thirds of americans who didn't take on student debt or who responsibly paid off their student loans to pay for the loans of those who have not done the same, devos wrote in a letter addressed to then-senate majority leader mitch mcconnell. across-the-board forgiveness of college debts is not only unfair to most americans, it is also the most regressive of policy proposals – rewarding the wealthiest sector of our labor force at the expense of the poorest.

it's not exactly comforting as a gay man to know that a politician decided you should be afforded civil rights as a matter of policy while she still personally thinks you're immoral. but even if we could separate these two things and believe that gabbard would passionately defend lgbtq rights the way that, say, now-deceased sen. robert byrd of west virginia — a democrat who was once a member of the ku klux klan — became a supporter of civil rights for african-americans, it's gabbard's actions right now that are still of great concern.

a surge in national coverage of warren finally turned into a polling spike as the summer came to a close. by the time the mid-september debates rolled around, sanders was enough of an afterthought that superrich individuals and members of the democratic establishment ― elected officials, donors and operatives ― were training their fire exclusively on warren.
according to multiculturalists, advancing the achievements of western civilization was an act of hatred toward other cultures. they encouraged people to define themselves by race, sex, or sexual orientation rather than by the pillars of western civilization, such as nation, family, and god, reads the abeka american history textbook. however, many conservatives and christians within america have attempted to quell these philosophies and once again turn america into a united, moral nation.

a flurry of litigation against oil giants began in 2015 after inside climate news and the los angeles times revealed that exxon mobil corp. had understood the science of global warming decades before the company started promoting misinformation denying that climate reality. three years later, the dutch publication de correspondent unearthed documents showing that even after shell's own scientists warned that emissions from burning oil were trapping heat in the atmosphere, the corporation's management team chose to emphasize the scientific uncertainties of global warming.

even a closely divided democratic senate wouldn't guarantee biden everything he wants, given chamber rules that require 60 votes to move most major legislation. but if democrats lose even one of tuesday's contests, biden would have little shot for swift up-or-down votes on his most ambitious plans to expand government-backed health care coverage, strengthen the middle class, address racial inequality and combat climate change. a republican-controlled senate also would create a rougher path for biden's cabinet picks and judicial nominees.

the policy works slightly differently in each state, but the basic premise is the same: when someone interacts with the state motor vehicle or other agencies, they are automatically registered to vote unless they opt out. if they are already registered, their information gets updated if needed. federal law already requires state motor vehicle and some state agencies to offer people the opportunity to register to vote, and automatic voter registration essentially tweaks the process to make registering an opt-out choice instead of an opt-in.

he claimed he would remove the threat of a nuclear-armed north korea, but in the end did nothing ― apart from trading love letters with its dictator, kim jong un. in western europe, trump accused traditional allies of ripping off the united states through the nato military alliance and european union trade policies. the attacks strained those relationships, inuring to the benefit of russian dictator vladimir putin, who has long sought to drive a wedge between the trans-atlantic allies and who helped trump win election in 2016.

so take stock of what you have. and while you're logging your inventory, take photos of the big-ticket items and consider using a home inventory app. should a fire actually occur, having a digital record will ease the claim-filing process. 2. what exactly will a renters policy cover that isn't covered by your landlord's insurance? plenty. generally speaking, renters insurance covers you against losses from fire or smoke, lightning, vandalism, theft, explosion, windstorm and certain types of water damage (such as from a burst pipe, or when the tenant upstairs leaves the bathtub running and floods your apartment). most renters insurance policies do not cover floods or earthquakes. flood coverage is available from the national flood insurance program and a few private insurers. you can get earthquake insurance as a separate policy or have it added as an addendum to your renters policy, depending on where you live. and don't look to your landlord's policy to cover your personal losses. the landlord's insurance will probably cover replacing a window broken by a burglar, but it will not cover the laptop and tv the burglar stole. your landlord's insurance will cover the physical structure of the building ― say, if a tree falls on the roof. a renter's policy wouldn't cover the roof repair, but it would cover any damage that the collapsed roof caused to your personal belongings. 3. what is an actual cash value policy, and is that the kind of insurance you need?
in this respect, the period between 2012 and 2016 will have been particularly volatile in terms of world trade, resulting from the collapse of oil and commodity prices. the imf notes that this fall itself resulted in a 10.5% contraction of all international trade in 2015, when looking at all products.
the eitc, however, largely excludes workers who aren't raising children and completely excludes them if they're under age 25. a young man just out of school who's in an entry-level job gets nothing, and a middle-aged woman with grown kids who works for the minimum wage at the local nursing home gets close to nothing.
the highway measure would be financed in part by a one-time use of federal reserve surplus funds and by a reduction in the 6 percent dividend that national banks receive from the fed. . . . banks with $10 billion or less in assets would be exempt from the cut. the fed's surplus capital comes from the 12 reserve banks. the highway bill would allow for a one-time draw of $19 billion from the surplus, which totaled $29.3 billion as of nov. 25. . . . banks vigorously fought the dividend cut, which was estimated to generate about $17 billion over 10 years for the highway trust fund.
so yes, there is the possibility of getting sick if someone infected with covid-19 is standing right beside you and sneezes while you're both searching for a ripe avocado, or if a droplet from an infected person lands on a package of cereal that you touch and then proceed to touch your face before washing your hands. but we still don't know how much of the virus needs to be present in order for transmission to occur.

the shutdown is now in its 25th day — the longest shutdown in u.s. history. if the government doesn't reopen before the end of february, section 8's tenant-based voucher program will no longer have any funding. that means housing authorities won't make voucher payments to landlords nationwide when march rents are due, possibly leading to evictions.
it would seem that mat staver, the founder and chairman of liberty counsel, and his supporters are trying to prevent lgbtq people from being protected from lynching as a means to keep them from being protected from discrimination. an anti-lynching law is, according to staver in an interview he gave to the christian news siteonenewsnow, only a baby step to one day passing employment, housing and health care legislation that would offer protections to lgbtq people. thus lgbtq people's lives become a small sacrifice for the ideological comfort and control of the religious right. he and liberty counsel seem to care more about what people do in their sex lives than the violence and inequity that they experience because of their identities.
while the mob rioted in the capitol, trump continued to spread conspiracy theories about election fraud and sent his love to the rioters. his tone finally shifted in a statement thursday evening when he condemned those who had breached congressional offices and committed to a smooth, orderly and seamless transition of power to incoming president joe biden.
homeowners should view paying off pmi as a potential investment that can yield a high return. until now, figuring out how large that return was exceeded the capacities of almost all borrowers, but no longer. my colleague allan redstone has developed a pmi payoff spreadsheet, which shows the investment required to eliminate pmi, and the rate of return on that investment, for each of three rules: 80% of original value, 75% of current value after 2 years, and 80% of current value after 5 years. the spreadsheet is on my web site and is available for anyone to download.
it is perfectly acceptable to color outside the lines, but just because you've got a shiny f150, or a maserati, does not make it cool to park on an angle, taking two spots, because you don't want your doors dinged. even though a dead person allegedly said there is no devil or hell, i promise you there is a special place for people who take two parking spots, and it is completely uninhabitable like the gobi desert or flint, michigan.

biden promised to renew temporary protected status for people from venezuela, guatemala and hong kong, among others. the house passed a bill to do that last month, but republicans in the senate blocked it. the president-elect has also pledged to work with congress on other reforms including amending visa programs for permanent workers and expanding protections for domestic violence survivors and undocumented immigrants who report labor violations.

3. hiring and promoting the wrong people. good, hard-working employees want to work with like-minded professionals. when managers don't do the hard work of hiring good people, it's a major demotivator for those stuck working alongside them. promoting the wrong people is even worse. when you work your tail off only to get passed over for a promotion that's given to someone who glad-handed their way to the top­­­­­­­, it's a massive insult. no wonder it makes good people leave.

trump, who has spent a lifetime stretching (and seemingly bursting) the legal limits on tax avoidance, money laundering, housing discrimination, deceptive consumer practices and sexual assault, ran a presidential campaign that represents the apotheosis of elites breaking laws to achieve massive gains. since taking office, trump has plausibly been implicated in a broad array of crimes, including breaking campaign finance rules, violating state and national tax laws, conspiring to violate the computer fraud and abuse act, and of course, obstructing justice.

for the eurozone, statistical analysis of income and consumption patterns suggests that €100 billion of newly created money distributed to citizens would lead to an increase in gdp of around €232 billion. using imf fiscal multipliers, our empirical analysis further suggests that using the money to fund a €100 billion increase in public investment would reduce unemployment by approximately one million, and could be between 2.5 to 12 times more effective at stimulating gdp than current qe.
the lesson, your company, and its leaders are open to every blog, from every employee that works for it, or used to work for it. sexual harassment is real in the workplace and the eeoc reports that 70% of incidents never get reported. leaders need to hold their managers accountable before issues arise and well before someone posts a blog about it.
these two questions stem from comments that bryan fischer made on his radio show last week. drawing on his background as a pastor, he proudly discussed how he fought a knucklehead member of the boise city council who wanted to remove a statue commemorating the ten commandments from a city park. although fischer failed and the statue was removed because of the establishment clause of the first amendment of the us constitution, now, years later, he's still angry.

cable was essentially anointed party leader after jo swinson, now deputy leader, decided not to run. what is the difference between farron's lib dems and cable's? well it's an evolution of the same, cable says. i think the change is not from the tim farron era, but pre-2015 and post-2015. we had taken a very bad hit in 2015. i think two thirds of our members have come in since 2015 and that process started under the last leader and its continued since. the membership has changed and the nature of the party has changed and of course brexit has become an all-consuming issue. cable, initially sceptical of committing the party to another referendum, has embraced the idea of giving the public a vote on the final brexit deal. it didn't happen in the 2017 election for sure, he says of the success of that strategy. but we haven't had any real tests of electoral support since then. we do have lots of local by-elections where we tend to do very well actually. i think if there were an election now, there isn't going to be, but if there was, i think our position is much more appealing.

under the byrd rule, every provision of a reconciliation bill must have a direct, nonincidental impact on government finances. and the bill as a whole may not result in higher deficits once the congressional budgeting window is over.

this isn't the first time congress has tried to modernize itself. the two major congressional reorganizations in the past century occurred in 1946 and 1970 in response to the revolutionary expansions of the executive branch for president franklin delano roosevelt's new deal and president lyndon baines johnson's great society. later modernization efforts undercut the authority of committee chairmen, made committee hearings open to the public, expanded subcommittee staff, streamlined committee jurisdiction and implemented new ethics rules.

as well as those counted among official figures, there are also large numbers of 'hidden homeless' people who are housed by family and friends in shifting circumstances. according to evidence gathered by the cross-party committee, the average rough sleeper dies before the age of 50, and children in long-term temporary accommodation miss far more schooling than their peers. homelessness has been steadily rising since 2010, with the number of households in temporary accommodation skyrocketing by more than 60%. since march 2011, the number of people who sleep rough has risen by 134%. the committee said the light touch approach to tackling the issue displayed b the department for communities and local government had clearly failed. hillier added: the government must do more to understand and measure the real-world costs and causes of homelessness and put in place the joined-up strategy that is so desperately needed. that means properly addressing the shortage of realistic housing options for those at risk of homelessness or already in temporary accommodation. more fundamentally, it means getting a grip on the market's failure to provide genuinely affordable homes, both to rent and to buy. delegating a problem is not a solution and we do not share the government's faith in the cure-all potential of the homelessness reduction act.

and then there is the question of where our aid money is going -- or, more importantly, where it's not going. few canadians know that less than 0.03 per cent of canada's aid budget goes to women at the grassroots. there is an excellent proposal by match international and nobel women's initiative to create a new funding mechanism for grassroots organizations led by women. women are the most important changemakers in their communities. if we really want to support women and really want to be known as a feminist nation, then we need to work hand-in-hand with women and fund their work.

big tech tyranny is playing out before our very eyes. — rep. matt gaetz (@repmattgaetz) january 9, 2021
well, the biggest thing and i think we need to combat is filter bubbles and echo chambers. so, as an example, during brexit, if you were to follow only boris johnson and nigel farage and all these other folks, you would only see tweets about reasons to leave. if we enabled you to do something like following a hashtag, like, #voteleave, 90 percent would be reasons to leave, but 10 percent would be reasons to stay. in the current mechanics of the system, we don't allow that reality. we don't even allow different perspectives because you have to do the work to find the other accounts. so you could say, well, people could just go the hashtag. people don't do that. it's not easy for them, and they're only going to do what's easy. but we don't make it easy. so, that is one simple thing that we could do to increase the amount and the variety perspective. where, it might be that they see that, they follow the #voteleave tag, and they see the reasons to stay and that further emboldens them into leaving. or it might be the case that they say, wait a minute, why are we doing this? we don't know. but we haven't even given people a chance to decide and have that experience.

'substituting manpower for energy' (walter stahel) doesn't mean giving up the washing machine, nor giving up technical progress. instead, it means giving direction to progress, using ingenuity and labor to extend the life of things, rather than reduce it. this is the very purpose of the product-life institute, created in 1982 in geneva by walter stahel and orio giarini, both university professors and consultants to companies, governments and international institutions.

it is clear we are coming together in the wake of a terrible tragedy, he said at a news conference, where he disclosed that intelligence indicates the plane was shot down by an iranian missile, possibly by accident.
political editor paul waugh writes on the need for speed to support britain's national health service (nhs) in the face of an expected spike in coronavirus cases: right now, it feels like we have just a few weeks to save the nhs from being overwhelmed by the sheer number of severe coronavirus cases in the uk. that's not political sloganeering, it's a hard fact on the mind of every single member of the government.
employers argue that they are providing a process that is as effective as, or better than, public courts. that arbitration is simpler. that employees don't lose rights, they just get vindication in another venue. but zoom into some of the details. in private arbitration, the company picks the providers who supply the arbitrators. those arbitrators rule, in closed offices, on whether the company violated the law. and many companies insist that the outcomes remain confidential ― preventing individuals with similar claims from knowing about others.
the election officials, my heart breaks for them because they're already under a very stressful situation and to have them get death threats or be followed to their cars or be harassed online or doxed on social media ― it's just unbelievable.
in his remarks, inslee talked about the washingtonians who were grateful for the coverage they'd gotten from the affordable care act over the last few years ― and those who were still struggling, even with the law fully in place.
the utah-based religion of 16-million members worldwide has tried in the last decade to create a more welcoming environment for lgbtq members, while adhering to its doctrinal opposition of gay marriage. the faith, widely known as the mormon church, teaches that while being gay is not a sin, engaging in same-sex relationships is against god's commandments.
sessions and justice department leadership, the report said, were operating under the belief that separation, prosecution, sentencing and reunification could take place within the span of an afternoon. justice department leadership did not consult the u.s. marshals service, federal defenders or federal courts before they made the decision. there is no evidence that rosenstein was aware of some of the early discussion around the policy, but he supported and enforced sessions' decision.
the existing industry was already inclusive of a lot black and brown faces, unsworth said. we knew that people were just going to run in here and buy up all the property and just take it over. if nothing else, we wanted to slow it down and make sure that these other considerations were on the table.
the rotation solution: instead of clearing the decks by having everyone work remotely, consider a rotating schedule. this way, a certain percentage of staffers are always under management's watchful eye. most employees will still relish the opportunity to work from home once or twice a week.
one factor bolstering hunt's insistence on staying in post was the fact that the nhs is currently in the middle of one of its most challenging ever winters.
the governor's commission is expected to deliver a final report to lawmakers by the end of the year, which would guide them on future legislation to establish a market for cannabis. under vermont's two-step process of legalization, it could be a while before the state sees its first legal marijuana sale, said matt simon, the new england political director for the marijuana policy project, a non-profit organization that advocates for cannabis reform around the country.
one l.a. times employee, who spoke to huffpost on the condition of anonymity, overheard upbin say they were creating a national newsroom outside of the union, to service all of tronc's markets. tronc, formerly tribune publishing, is the owner of the l.a. times, along with other newspapers in 10 markets across the country.
elsewhere, organizations representing actors, commercial advertisers, advertising agencies and independent film and television producers recommended a hold on in-person production in southern california.
the purveyors of this misguided resolution are engaged in all sorts of other phony arguments, including the claim that only the state of alaska can decide these issues. but they conveniently fail to mention that these are national wildlife refuges, and there are multiple court cases that establish that the federal government is the final decider on wildlife management decisions for federal lands.
despite the clear economic benefits of legal marijuana, the state-federal divide on cannabis laws has gotten deeper over the past month. lawmakers in the vermont house of representatives passed h. 511 just a day after u.s. attorney general jeff sessions released new justice department guidance giving federal prosecutors the go-ahead to crack down on state-legal marijuana operations. although the announcement led to some anxiety in the fledgling marijuana industry, its practical effect remains to be seen.
i believe this was the right decision for twitter to ban the president, ceo jack dorsey tweeted last week. we faced an extraordinary and untenable circumstance, forcing us to focus all of our actions on public safety. offline harm as a result of online speech is demonstrably real, and what drives our policy and enforcement above all.
foreign affairs minister françois-philippe champagne told reporters this week that the federal government will assume the entire cost of the flight from wuhan to the canadian forces base in trenton, ont., where those who have been repatriated will be quarantined for two weeks. individuals will have to pay for their own transportation out of trenton to wherever in canada, or elsewhere, they would like to go.
the policy would roll out slowly. at a press conference unveiling the state's $209 billion budget on thursday, newsom said that leave would be paid for mainly with existing funds.

researchers and doctors are still searching for answers regarding this new coronavirus, including what animal passed it on to a human. investigations into the disease's origins, range of effects and types of transmission are still in their beginning stages.
but warren wants congress to do more, now that the full scope of the crisis is coming into view.
to understand the latino-american experience, we ultimately have to acknowledge race plays an important role. historically, race has been a strong determinant of education, income and health. as we continue to undo the effects of past injustice and build policies to prevent further discrimination, we must make sure marginalized groups are not being forgotten. race and ethnicity are not just black and white. they're not even just black, white and latino. the answers lie at the intersections.
people who are living in this world of myths are secure from all refutation, sorel wrote.
the foley & lardner statement made it clear that the firm is not representing any parties seeking to contest the results of the presidential election. in november, the firm made a policy decision not to take on any representation of any party in connection with matters related to the presidential election results.

cambridge analytica was supposed to be the arsenal of weapons to fight that culture war, added wylie, who stopped working for the company in 2014.
it's incredibly encouraging that they went big, he said of biden and vice president-elect kamala harris. sometimes we democrats are really good at negotiating against ourselves before we invite republicans into the negotiation.
arlan meekhof, the senate majority leader, and a fellow republican, said snyder's plan was merely a good start. i think there's more we can do to put people's money back in their pockets, he told the detroit news. michigan's last big tax change was a cut in corporate taxes in 2011.
survivors of the bombs dropped over japan at the end of world war 2 speak of a bright sunlit day plunged into darkness as black oily rain fell. dead figures, charred black still standing. burned and terminally injured survivors, their skin hanging off; eyes and other internal organs hanging out of their bodies. cars and vehicles tossed like toys, strong structures reduced to piles of rubble. huge fires.
direct air capture is a nascent industry. but over the past two years, tech firms vowing to erase their legacy of climate pollution have stoked new interest, as have oil companies that invested in the technology as a means of extracting more oil and hedging against a future where demand for fossil fuels plummets. if that link to the industry most responsible for climate change weren't enough to make many environmentalists skeptical of direct air capture, the eye-popping projections for how much energy, water and land such facilities would require to suck co2 from the sky at scale certainly do.

the global health community may need a new security solution, klain said. while ryan argues that the united nations security force, known as monusco, has been protecting who workers and other responders on top of its peacekeeping mission in the area, klain is pushing for a separate force dedicated solely to protecting public health responders.
montana is interesting, particularly for those of us with a taste for politics of the personal sort. the people of montana had a full dose of corpocracy 100 years before the rest of us recognized it ... and they banned the miscreants from the political process. they sent the first woman to congress, years before women could vote. and, some can be a bit ornery. occasionally, stupid.
brazil is about to show the world how a modern democracy falls apart.
the state of our union is strong in oregon, where locals have demonstrated the capacity for calm, discerning leadership in crisis. the closest city to the siege is burns, with a population of 2,800, 30 miles away. at a burns town hall, citizens put aside their differences over land use (which are significant) and criticized the armed action. harney county sheriff dave ward has been a key communication link, even meeting with the militants and offering them an escorted departure. open deliberation and the unconditional rejection of violence is a sign of resilient democracy in action.
a month later, state law enforcement officials began meeting with researchers, medical examiners and public health leaders to develop better ways to detect the deadly illicit opioid in the drug supply, alert users and distribute more of the overdose rescue drug narcan — similar to san francisco's 2015 response.

five turning points that changed american history, jerimi suri, university of texas at austin
by signing, inslee is laying the groundwork for a historic, if long-shot, bid for the presidency on the single issue of scaling back planet-warming emissions and preparing for climate change. the move is bold but timely. record-breaking storms, droughts and wildfires wreaked havoc across the u.s. over the past three years as president donald trump attempted to boost the fossil fuel industry by gutting or delaying nearly every major federal climate regulation.
the case was closely watched along colorado's front range, where the fracking boom has put wells near playgrounds, parks and schools (extraction oil and gas infamously installed a fracking site just 1,360 feet from the largely minority bella romero academy in greeley.) concerns about worsening air quality and health effects, such as increased cancer risks, have led to lawsuits and community actions, including an unsuccessful ballot measure in november to increase well setbacks, requiring that they be located at least 2,500 feet from occupied buildings.
liberty counsel has not responded to a request for comment on why it believes lgbtq americans should not be treated as a protected class.

sessions and rosenstein refused to adjust their views, even when they were more informed about how the process would play out and knew it would mean ripping young children away from their families.
he also paid tribute to his predecessor, thomas monson, who died at the age of 90 on jan. 2. he had served as president since 2008.
democratic success will likely depend on driving a huge turnout of african americans, young voters, college-educated voters and women, all groups that helped biden become the first democratic presidential candidate since 1992 to win georgia. republicans, meanwhile, have been focused on energizing their own base of white men and voters beyond the core of metro atlanta.
masks might make you feel better, but they aren't particularly helpful, as most are more likely to protect the person wearing them from spreading the infection rather than catching it.
these recent events show that a change in our policy is necessary, he continued. this week, i signed an order directing faa safety inspectors and attorneys to pursue legal enforcement action against any passenger who assaults, threatens, intimidates or interferes with airline crew members. we will not address these cases through warning or counseling. this policy is effective immediately, and will remain in effect through march 30, 2021.
climate diplomats said they want to see an ambitious u.s. commitment to cut emissions this decade and a diplomatic push to convince others to follow suit. top of the list would be china, the world's biggest polluter, which plans to become carbon neutral by 2060 but has yet to unveil a short-term plan to reduce emissions.
where are they? where are the ventilators? cuomo said, after calling on health and human services secretary alex azar to release a federal stockpile of ventilators.
despite nabbing trump's endorsement, kobach was defeated by democratic state sen. laura kelly in the november midterm elections by 4.5 percentage points. kansas is traditionally republican and has voted for only one democratic presidential candidate since 1940.
of the change-up, vp of merchandizing at forever 21, linda chang, told refinery29 that the company is adapting to change and listening to customers' needs and wants.
the word likely is important because initial judgments on what violates the rules are left to the senate parliamentarian, a nonpartisan appointee who rules on the permissibility of individual elements as a judge might ― by looking at precedent and considering the nature of individual proposals. (that process is frequently called a byrd bath, because it's connected to the byrd rules.)
if you opted into your bank's overdraft program, which will carry a fee when you exceed your account balance, talk to customer service about opting out. then keep a close eye on your bank balance, and use a credit card or cash to avoid overdraft fees.
state-established retirement plans for workers who otherwise don't have access to a retirement savings account make sense for millions of individuals. in states like pennsylvania and nevada, where nearly 50 percent of latino workers don't have access to an employer-sponsored plan, these accounts could be a lifeline to an economically secure future. in california, secure choice, a state retirement program which was passed into law last year could give nearly four million latino workers access to a retirement account—but only if congress doesn't vote to jeopardize the implementation of the program by blocking the dol rule.

he tried e-mails, phone calls, suggestions that instead of money, united give him $1,200 in flight vouchers. united held firm. they said no.
crucially, the cra requires only a simple majority of senators to get a disapproval resolution through the senate. that's good for democrats, who will only control 50 seats in the senate and have to rely on vice president-elect kamala harris for tie-breaking votes.
but how is that going to help?
the communities hit hardest by covid can't be the last to get a vaccine, cuomo said after sending a letter to u.s. health and human services secretary alex azar. it would be unfair and discriminatory.

finnish people want consistent, long-term policy-making. there is a broad commitment to a vision of a knowledge-based society. this vision is widely shared and accepted by the employers and labor organizations, as well as the industry and their interest groups. we recognize the need for continuous improvement of learning environments and practices that take place at the local level. professional, highly-trained and highly respected teachers are a key factor in our success: teachers have pedagogical autonomy so they decide by themselves which teaching methods and materials they use.

public health experts are more alarmed, in part because they fear a surge in patients with covid-19 infections will overwhelm health care systems, creating shortages of intensive care beds, ventilators and personnel ― something that reportedly is already happening in italy and forcing harrowing choices over who gets treatment and who doesn't.
stephen miller spent his first day as a former white house adviser by attacking newly inaugurated president joe biden on twitter.
asked about the accusations on tuesday, inslee said the tacoma facility had already begun permitting and that his administration was going to follow the law and allow the process to play out, though he said he requested additional carbon dioxide analyses of the project.
this movement toward collective autonomy could have reverberations beyond individual schools. based on what teacher-powered teams are accomplishing policymakers should be willing to explore how collective autonomy for teachers could help resolve many of the current major issues in education policy (and in the process, help stem the tide of teacher attrition). today, teachers' collective energy often is defensive--fighting against being held accountable for the results of systems they do not design and run.
given democrats' existing hold on the house and the white house, the party will now have unified control of the federal government for the first time since the first two years of the obama administration, when obama enacted his most significant pieces of legislation.
take extra care to ensure that your mail is protected while you are away. if your mailbox locks, then you're safe. just lock it up and either take the key with you or stow it somewhere safe. however, if your mailbox doesn't lock, you may want to get a po box. your mail will be safer there. on the other hand, if you have neighbours who are trustworthy, you can get them to promise to collect your daily mail, though this tactic is not foolproof as they may forget on some days.
he admitted that he was wrong to argue, in a wall street journal op-ed published six weeks ago, that trump would concede gracefully. he said he really believed at the time that trump would leave in a presidential manner.
ron klain, biden's incoming chief of staff, said saturday that biden will send an immigration bill to congress on his first day in office. he didn't elaborate and biden's office declined to comment on specifics.
trump has signaled he has no plans to stop his attacks on warren's heritage. this week, he tweeted out a fake bumper sticker mocking the senator. for the most part, warren avoided direct attacks on the president – she never mentions him by name in her stump speech.
the trump administration is expected to swiftly appeal the tuesday ruling from u.s. district judge jesse furman of the southern district of new york.
unsworth, who has an mba and was a cannabis entrepreneur when the group began, said she wanted to advocate for those who were very present in the gray-market industry ― women and people of color ― but who were largely missing from conversations about the policies that would shape it.
prime minister scott morrison announced a $2.4 billion health package on wednesday that proposes setting up fever clinics and offering cost-free facilities for people to consult doctors over video calls, as it combats the spread of the coronavirus. australia has been struggling to contain the disease, which is expected to take a significant economic toll, with the treasury department warning the outbreak would cut at least half a percentage point from economic growth in the first quarter. australia has recorded 112 cases of the coronavirus as of wednesday morning, while three people have died from the disease. just under $1.2 billion of that will actually, we anticipate, be spent this financial year, particularly as the virus and its impacts ramp up in the months ahead, morrison told reporters in canberra.
since january, republican leaders have been pursuing an anti-regulatory agenda, saying that federal regulations are burdening business and a correction is warranted. but repealing this u.s. fish and wildlife service rule, developed by professional wildlife managers to stop despicable practices, won't save one job and won't bring one dime into alaska. h. j. res. 69 is a cruel, mean-spirited, and duplicitous legislative maneuver, and masking it as a pro-hunting measure or a regulatory reform effort is a joke.
the partial government shutdown, in its fourth week, is already the longest in history. housing policy experts say landlords can only hold on for so long before they run out of money too.
if i could put a photo or a picture in front of him or a map or a piece of paper that had two big bullet points on it, he would focus on that, and i could build on that, he added.
those two things i think stand as a remarkable achievement not just for me as an individual minister, but for our time in government.
dr. mark ghaly, secretary of the california health and human services agency, said the state assigns the number of doses that local health jurisdictions will receive after getting an allocation from the federal government. the vaccine is then shipped directly to entities like hospitals or local public health offices. pfizer distributes its vaccine directly, while moderna uses the pharmaceutical company mckesson as an intermediary, which initially led to slow communication, newsom said.
according to ekins, this is also due to governments' various interests. as with everything to do with government regulation, there is a tension between wanting to keep the cost down and wanting the regulation to be observed, he says, noting that governments are reluctant to insist on regulation that will push up cars' consumer prices. there is often an assumption that companies just want to maximize profits. but cornis van der lugt, a senior research fellow with the centre for corporate governance in africa at the university of stellenbosch business school, says that real financial decision-makers are quite often more sophisticated. many decent investors will tell you it's not just about short-term profit; more importantly, it's about the doability of longer-term cash flows.
despite civil rights groups' opposition, the bill passed 407-19 in the house in december, with the obama administration's support. it was later tacked onto the must-pass omnibus spending bill at the end of the year and then signed into law.

ideally, a trusted local institution or individual would organize and facilitate the effort, and those directly impacted by the law would be vital participants. in oregon this could include everyone from farmers and ranchers to birders and hikers. the bureau of land management and its scientists are also essential players, but outside expertise might also be important and bring with it new kinds of forecasting tools like data science. the challenge will be to find the balance so the process is inclusive but not unwieldy.
conservatives tend to respond to fear more strongly than liberals do, according to bobby azarian, a neuroscientist whose expertise in anxiety has led him to examine political behaviors. his research has found that the brains of conservative people are likely to display the same attention biases as the brains of people with anxiety.

one thing is certain, tax researchers say. the bill will need major repairs so that taxpayers can understand it, tax preparers can interpret it, and the legislation can have its intended effects. many of the needed fixes will require new legislation, of the sort house republicans unveiled in a 297-page bill on nov. 26. house democrats immediately signaled their unwillingness to cooperate without concessions, and the bill was unable to pass the senate where it needed 60 votes.
philosophers have identified over three hundred of these mischievous rhetorical habits.
what was seared in their mind was family separation. they took it out on the republican party in 2018 and they took it out on trump in 2020, noorani said. to put a really fine point on it, they want to end the cruelty of the trump administration.
i think this represents one of the most serious challenges to the islamic republic since its inception, she said, precisely because of the passion of those on the streets and the extent to which they appear to be ready to effectively jettison the entirety of the system rather than focus their ire on one particular individual or policy.
the virus has killed more than 16,000 people worldwide and continues to spread at a rapid pace. efforts to curb the outbreak have led to the global disruption of daily life and the economy, as schools and workplaces shutter in hopes of slowing transmission.

rescue workers said at least 40 people were killed during wednesday's heavy bombing of kafr batna, saqba, zamalka and arbin and other towns in the opposition enclave. in the town of haza, the bombing targeted a field hospital and a bakery, rescuers said.
a twitter spokesperson said of trump's latest video: as we shared yesterday, we're continuing to evaluate the situation in real time, including examining activity on the ground and statements made off twitter. we will keep the public informed, including if further escalation in our enforcement approach is necessary.
the las vegas resident said he and his co-workers learned about the agreements in december when they signed in to do routine computer training. the powerpoint-style sessions are usually devoted to matters like music equipment or workplace safety, he said. but in this case, the session was all about arbitration, and why it was good for the company and the worker.
what we're seeing here is the cost of not building a relationship with the democrats and their leaders, and now when it's absolutely essential because they're more powerful and he needs their votes, he's incapable of doing it, said thomas kochan, a professor at the massachusetts institute of technology's sloan school of management, who wrote about trump's effect on business negotiations. they don't trust him; he doesn't trust them.
richeson declined to elaborate further on how ice established the man was a member of a gang.
what is good for the goose is good for the gander, nicholas bagley, a university of michigan law professor and regulatory law expert, said, noting the cra will allow biden's team to act quickly without going through the often-cumbersome regulatory procedure. it's just a matter of clearing the political hurdles of getting consensus among the democrats in congress over their willingness to get rid of the rules in the book.
fighting ebola in a war zone is hard enough without the threat of electoral chaos.
upbin was a mystery to much of the newspaper's staff, which had just voted to unionize the week before. he was one of several similarly unannounced middle-manager types who had come aboard in recent weeks. although he and the others were listed in the times' human resources software as having editorial titles, they were reporting to rob angel, the times' chief business development officer. these new l.a. managers had also been working on the second floor, despite the newsroom being on the third. and, of course, there was the bizarre fact that they had yet to be introduced to any of the actual newsroom staff of about 400.

california's disclose act is great but limited, said former federal election commission chairwoman ann ravel, now with the pro-disclosure nonprofit maplight.
in 2018, then-attorney general jeff sessions announced the implementation of trump's zero-tolerance immigration policy. the order separated migrant children from their parents who were detained when they entered the u.s., causing a national uproar after photos of traumatized young children screaming and crying went public. after mounting pressure from lawmakers and advocates, trump signed an executive order ending the policy a year later.
according to the lawsuit, which was filed by harvard law school professor laurence tribe and other prominent attorneys, officers went to the home to arrest the man's father. court documents do not make clear why the father was taken into custody.
the moves came as rioters stormed the halls of congress, forcing capitol office buildings to evacuate and lawmakers to shelter in place as law enforcement worked to protect the seat of the u.s. government. as a bipartisan group of lawmakers released strong statements condemning the violence, trump released a terse missive that, while urging people to stay peaceful, told the rioters he loved them and that they were very special.
london mayor sadiq khan said: londoners should be avoiding social interaction unless absolutely necessary, and that means they should be avoiding using the transport network unless absolutely necessary. some 104 people in the u.k. have died after testing positive.
these changes would make a big difference. currently, as the chart shows, a childless worker with poverty-level wages filing their taxes now for 2015 would receive an eitc of $172, not nearly enough to offset the $1,188 he or she owes in income tax and the employee share of payroll taxes (to say nothing of the employer share, which economists generally agree ultimately falls on workers in the form of lower wages). the proposals from obama and ryan would give that worker an $841 eitc, a major step towards lifting the worker back to the poverty line.
but relief is not automatic under the new law. individuals who want their marijuana convictions reclassified or cleared must submit an application to a court. they may also need to hire an attorney to help them through the process. about 5,000 people have so far applied to have marijuana sentences reviewed for possible relief, according to data compiled by the judicial council of california. and while it's encouraging that some are taking advantage of the new process, it's an extremely small fraction of the number of people who have been arrested for marijuana offenses in the state.

#3 - listening vs. tuning out distractions. do you tune out distractions, like co-workers, client and partners, in your rush to get things done? how about your own gut instinct? don't! these distractions could contribute to your next big breakthrough. don't forget to listen to the market, either. like it or not, social media also plays a very important role in market trends. be receptive to the conversation about your company and its products and services. listen when people are telling you what they want. writer and columnist harvey mackay wrote, you learn when you listen. you earn when you listen--not just money, but respect.

assuming there were political consensus that everyone should have this protection from health care costs during the crisis, medicare is a natural vehicle since it already exists everywhere, said larry levitt, who oversees health policy work at the kaiser family foundation. while many insurers have voluntarily waived cost-sharing for covid-19 treatment, this goes quite a bit further in covering out-of-pocket costs for all health care. it's sort of a temporary medicare for all, grafted on top of our existing insurance system.

the logic here is that co-pays and deductibles inevitably fall hardest on the sick, because they have higher medical bills, and the poor, because they have less money at their disposal. research shows that these groups will frequently respond to high out-of-pocket costs by rationing their own treatments and, as a result, suffer.

and the wfp endorsement crystalized a residual sense from the 2016 election that sanders had not yet mollified critics in the activism community who considered him unduly articulate about and focused on questions of racial justice. his groan-inducing remarks at the she the people conference in houston for women of color in april and his absence at the netroots nation conference in philadelphia in july contributed to a sense that sanders had missed his moment. while those activists do not directly affect votes in the early primary and caucus states, they are influential in liberal organizations and websites that help shape perceptions of candidates.

office romances may be an hr nightmare, but they happen nonetheless.
in the real world: a small shipping store in a tiny community was noticing a steady decline in customer traffic and assumed that it was due to poor customer service. in order to remedy this, they went overboard by providing excessive attention, discounted rates for existing services and making it a policy to never say no to any reasonable request. although the customers were very pleased with the changes, business owners not only failed to see an increase in sales, but, in fact, only realized a rise in costs. in this case, the attempt to over-deliver outside the scope of the core business actually had a negative impact. by making assumptions and acting too quickly, the business did not first discover the root cause of the traffic decline. the reality had nothing to do with customer service, and everything to do with technological advances (like mobile apps) making some of their preexisting services obsolete. as peter drucker has pointed out, efficiency is doing the thing right. effectiveness is doing the right thing. our mission is to find the right thing.
the trump bill was created in secret, and many legislators never saw some of its provisions, much less debated them, until it was introduced. the measure contained multiple provisions that don't do what was intended and may take years to fix — if they can be fixed at all, experts say.
earlier this month, the house voted 418-12 to create the select committee on the modernization of congress to try to fix things. the select committee is charged with producing proposals related to staff pay, retention, benefits and diversity, technology and innovation, and house procedures, including the schedule, the way bills get to the floor and other assorted administrative issues. it will consist of six democrats and six republicans appointed by house speaker nancy pelosi (d-calif.) and minority leader kevin mccarthy (r-calif.) and will require bipartisan support to issue its final report of proposals that the full house could take up. rep. derek kilmer (d-wash.), the committee's chairman, is the only member named so far. the committee will have until the end of 2019 to issue a report of recommendations to the full house before it disbands. and if it works, it could change the way congress does business.

congress continues to make the problem worse. just last month, the house of representatives used a slick procedural maneuver to erase the few privacy protections that remain over our online data. the cybersecurity information sharing act passed largely unnoticed in a 2000 page, eleventh hour, omnibus spending bill. experts agree it will do nothing to improve internet security while rolling the dice with privacy. objections were voiced by privacy advocates, tech companies and security professionals. but house speaker paul ryan turned a deaf ear.

nobel economics laureate peter diamond — arguably the world's leading expert in public finance, according to krugman — has calculated the optimum top tax rate at 73 percent. several other experts back that up.
what i have are parents who believe in the value of working for a living and learning how to make money on my own, but also understand that today, compared to when they were enrolled, that's nearly impossible to do while in school. i'm in the privileged position to receive from my parents exactly what yang promised us in his running: $1000 a month, no matter what (as long as i'm in school).
a few hours ago, mishra tweeted that the same people who supported burhan wani and yakub memon were trying to brand him a terrorist. scroll down, and you'll find that mishra has retweeted several tweets praising him for taking on the anti-caa protesters. on monday, a day after he issued an open threat to the delhi police, there was a wink-wink-nudge-nudge appeal to the rioters for maintaining peace. on tuesday night, in a since-deleted tweet, he expressed happiness at the peaceful protesters at jafrabad being evicted.
in the u.s., trump's continued attacks have had negative effects on how americans view their elections, the press and other democratic institutions, and his rhetoric has emboldened racists and white nationalists and potentially contributed to rises in violent crime against racial, ethnic and religious minorities.
ford's government did introduce a climate plan in 2018, but ontario's auditor general says it'll likely fail to meet its targets. environment minister jeff yurek has since called the plan a draft.

in their 2016 report, sigar unveiled an elaborate scheme nicknamed ghost soldiers in which scores of non-existent soldier names were listed on official afghan government paper trails to collect higher funding. according to sigar, afghanistan, a country the size of texas, has more generals than the entire united states military, with over a thousand generals. most of whom bought their stripes through ethnic or family patronage ...an insidious combination of poor leadership and corruption is the reason for the afghan military's failure...

i bring the perspective of a person who has lived with the consequences of a liberal government for 15 years, the good and the bad, she told huffpost. i know what it's like to struggle to meet a payroll, i know what it's like to worry about paying rent.
and that's why he stood down, cable says of his predecessor. i don't think it was what he said, that did upset quite a lot of people, it was the fact that he basically went missing in the early part of the campaign because he was preoccupied with that problem. he's acknowledged that himself. i spoke out very strongly and made it clear that was absolutely not my view and absolutely not the party's view. but he is a party spokesman i am not proposing to change that.
if the pipes freeze, open the faucets to allow for expansion of frozen water. if you are a renter, contact your landlord. do not use a blowtorch or a kerosene or propane heater to unfreeze your pipes, due to risk of fire. if a pipe breaks, shut off the valve controlling the water to your home. if you don't know where the shutoff valve is, contact your utility provider.

spain's death toll from the coronavirus pandemic soared on saturday to 1,326, up from 1,002 on friday, according to the national health ministry's latest data.
neutrality between religion and non-religion is for scalia not only something that lacks constitutional warrant, but, disturbingly, he also maintains that such neutrality risks incurring the wrath of god or, at best, his indifference. apparently, the united states cannot expect to prevail in any future conflicts if we show equal respect to theist and atheist alike.
mishra, who joined the bjp last year, gets the credit for introducing the 'goli maaro saalon ko' slogan into the rioters' lexicon. he was rewarded with an assembly election ticket by the bjp last month, but lost to aap's akhilesh pati tripathi by over 11,000 votes.
with these fancy titles, there's a certain level of expertise and expectation that you will know what you're doing, that you know how to do it. but often these expectations are unrealistic, wagadia said.
at the time of the sars outbreak, cellphones and texting were still at a rudimentary phase. but now, social media has given people the ability to gather virtually — and it's helping to amplify existing prejudice.
the polling ― conducted between dec. 17 and dec. 27 by the left-leaning think tank data for progress and shared exclusively with huffpost ― shows particularly strong support for a green new deal among women in the suburban portions of the nassau county district abutting the new york city borough of queens.
if rebekah mercer was broke and wasn't a major donor in the republican party, says a cruz adviser, nobody would spend two seconds trying to know her… she's not fun. she's just like a series of amoeba cells. the two sides were also diverging ideologically. in the summer of 2015, according to two sources, rebekah reprimanded cruz for an april article he'd co-authored with house speaker paul ryan in the wall street journal in support of free trade. she and bannon told cruz that he should adopt the positions of jeff sessions, whose views on trade and immigration were more in line with the conservative base. by this time, cruz and his team were becoming increasingly concerned about bannon's relationship with rebekah. bannon (who declined to comment for this article) was now blatantly pro-trump. over the course of the primary, breitbart would publish around 60 pieces disputing that cruz was eligible to be president because he had been born in canada. cruz repeatedly called rebekah to complain, but she insisted that she had to be fair and impartial. one of his advisers says, we felt to some extent she was being manipulated by bannon. a person close to bannon counters: there's absolutely no way anyone could manipulate rebekah mercer. after the first debate in south carolina, rebekah gave cruz a dressing down on his performance, according to three sources. given what was going on around him—and what he must have truly felt—he behaved like an absolute gentleman, says a person close to cruz.
you could argue it is in itself a breach of human rights to not give someone permanent status.
another significant finding from the poll: those people are more likely to be male. this isn't true in every case, but overwhelmingly, the demographics most likely to minimize the crisis are men aged 35 and over.
just to be clear, king's rhetoric cannot be attributed to the rise of trumpism, it goes back to well before donald trump's entry into the 2016 presidential campaign. in august of 2013, king absurdly claimed that for every child of an illegal immigrant who is valedictorian, there's another 100 out there who weigh 130 pounds, and they've got calves the size of cantaloupes because they're hauling 75 pounds of marijuana across the desert.

in a facebook post, graham compared the 10 republican house members who voted for trump's impeachment on wednesday to judas iscariot, the apostle notorious for betraying jesus for 30 pieces of silver.
trump's administration was creative with its implementation of the cra, using it to undo agency rules that dated back to 2013. now some legal scholars are evaluating how biden's administration can stretch the law to undo some of the trump administration's more extreme policies, even if they don't fall into the traditional definitions of a regulation.
think of it like this: if you take home $1,000 in income, but spend half on a house, you only have about $33 a day to pay for all the rest of your expenses ― not to mention saving for upcoming purchases or investments. don't fall into this overspending trap. it will suck away money you could be investing elsewhere and leave you constantly scrambling to cover your expenses.
multiple staffers said that this investigation is what led to business editor kimi yoshino's removal from the building on wednesday. management hasn't explained why yoshino was escorted off the premises and suspended for two days. but a former employee and a current employee both pointed to the disney story that caused d'vorkin so much grief, which yoshino edited.

a lot would obviously depend on the details ― that is, precisely how low a medicare for all proposal would push prices and, critically, how long it would take for those reductions to take place. there's a vast difference between cutting hospital rates by 10 percent over three to four years and cutting them by the same margin over seven or eight.

during these hearings, each individual is addressed for about 40 seconds or maybe a minute, civil rights corps attorney elizabeth rossi told huffpost. the magistrate judge informs the person of the charge against them but not the factual allegations underlying the charge.
biden is rolling back trump's rules for establishing new regulations, tasking the office of management and budget to improve the regulatory review process and putting a freeze on regulations until his administration has time to review any that trump enacted during his last days in office.
hughes was pretty excited. she plans on buying extra groceries and stuff for her house; the money would also mean she could uber to doctor appointments instead of taking the bus.
when the common core wave passed, it had swept away the notion that actual teachers and administrators are experts in education. teaching, it turns out, is somehow too hard for mere teachers. instead, the standards-based school district now assumes that nobody in the school system actually knows what should be taught, and that the most they can be trusted with is to unpack the standards and create a checklist-certified list of education activities that will meet the standards' demands. that's the best-case scenario. in the worst-case scenario, the district doesn't believe that trained education professionals can be trusted with even that much, and should just be handed materials that dictate the teacher's every move, throwing aside their professional judgment and replacing it with the judgment of some bureaucrat or textbook publisher.

then, at the start of october, sanders had a heart attack. for a moment, it seemed like he might be down for the count. the incident kept sanders off the campaign trail for two weeks and raised fears among democratic voters about his age and health.
this action is also tasking the office of management and budget with analyzing whether federal money is equitably distributed across communities of color.

in an interview with abc news last month, trump said his administration was devising a policy on how to deal with people covered by daca, without indicating any concrete plans.
but on monday, she jumped into the waters, and the concerns raised by native americans that was headline news mere months ago went back to being a footnote. without taking responsibility for the harm her dna stunt caused, by her own standards of holding the powerful in washington accountable, she is not fit to represent all the diverse people that make up these united states.

each and every child must be empowered to find their place as an active member of society. the new national core curriculum includes transversal competences, which are embedded in every subject. these competences are thinking and learning to learn, cultural understanding, interaction and self-expression, taking care of oneself and life skills, multi literacy, ict skills, working life competence, entrepreneurship, participation and involvement in the society and building a sustainable future. these skills are important for young people in their future working life, and consequently, they are part of the new curriculum and integral to our new approach to learning.
but people like daves fare much worse. she was booked into jail on a misdemeanor theft charge on jan. 17. hours later, she went before a judge with about 10 other defendants. hearings in dallas county can include more than 20 people. the sessions are not recorded, and there are no defense attorneys, prosecutors or members of the public present, according to the lawsuit.
he went on to thank trump for working quickly to help the state set up emergency hospitals, and to allow federal emergency funding, including waiving the requirement that the state pays for 25% of it.
and i can tell you this, if you ask the folks in russia, i've been tougher on russia than anybody else, any other ― probably any other president period, he said. but certainly the last three or four presidents, modern day presidents, nobody's been as tough as i have from any standpoint.

just three entities — two small oil companies and an alaska state-owned economic development corporation ― bid on roughly half of the 1.09 million acres up for grabs. the sale generated a measly $14.4 million, less than 1% of the administration's total revenue estimates. that's an average of $27 per acre, only slightly above the $25 minimum bid price.

iranian foreign ministry spokesman bahram ghasemi told state tv that hashemi's arrest indicates the apartheid and racist policy of the trump administration.
north korea has been developing submarine-launched ballistic missile systems for years. acquiring an operational system would alarm its rivals and neighbors because missiles fired from under water are harder to detect in advance.
as for the ribbentrop meetings, ethics experts suggest ethics rules likely didn't prohibit those because it appears ribbentrop was no longer employed at freedom partners by the time jorjani met with him.
a request for a self-starter could mean that you'll be given little training and have to come up with ideas on your own, denny said. she said it's a popular listing in startups since leaders are likely still working out the specifics of business operations and procedures.
according to the national weather service, wind chill advisories and freeze warnings have been issued from south texas to canada and from montana to new england. it's below freezing in many locations, and states of emergency have been issued in georgia and north carolina. an estimated 47 million people live within the affected areas.
the most notable part of bill, however, is a small change in wording that will have a big impact. rather than requiring equal pay for equal work, as in most laws aimed at the gender wage gap, new jersey will require equal pay for substantially similar work.
for the first time in 30 years, teachers from the la unified school district are on strike, fighting for fair pay, smaller class sizes, and better resourced schools for our kids, schiff said in a statement to huffpost. when we fail to support our public school teachers, we fail our students too. i stand with our teachers every step of the way.

victor matheson, a sports economist at the college of the holy cross in worcester, massachusetts, said athletes are the most vulnerable. the olympics feature 33 sports, and many of the smaller ones have a limited following until games time.
he said stringer should consider giving more emphasis to express bus lanes, the only part of the public transit system that the city controls directly.
conventional wisdom tells us to drink eight eight-ounce of water per day. according to the mayo clinic, the directive is easy to remember, and it's a reasonable goal. some people may need less than eight glasses per day. as they say, most healthy people can stay hydrated by drinking water and other fluids whenever they feel thirsty. that extends to students — and means way more than one trip a week to the water fountain.
a photo journalist came to me and said 'madam, you have always the same suit on'. i said 'yes, that's not a problem for me, is it a problem for you?' and he answered that in fact it was … because it gave the impression that photographs were always the same one. i always wore a brooch, so i told him, 'ok, i will give you something new: i will change the brooches.'
the war has now killed nearly a quarter of a million people, the united nations reported in december. airstrikes by the saudi-led coalition have killed at least 18,000 civilians, according to the yemen data project, an independent monitoring group. the strikes have hit hospitals, markets, schools and other nonmilitary targets, prompting state department lawyers to worry that american involvement could implicate u.s. officials in war crimes.
visiting american officials typically avoid holding official meetings in parts of east jerusalem, which is contested between israelis and palestinians. trump, however, also toured the area in a previous visit.
the year before, he set up a vatican commission, including some victims, to advise local churches on how to prevent abuse. but some members have complained about the slow pace of change in the vatican.
he intends on hosting more hearings with tech ceos and technologists who analyze competition on digital platforms to develop a better understanding of how these tech trusts dominate markets and crush competition. this will result in legislation that could enable users to port their data from one social platform to another or mandate the platforms become interoperable with each other and future competitors.
the simplest definition of an atheist is a person who doesn't believe in the existence of gods. ten percent of americans say they fit that description, according to a 2018 pew survey. in the current political climate, however, the word atheist can be more controversial, often used to hint that someone lacks a moral center or is openly hostile to organized religion.

these six words shattered the little world that i created for myself during my freshman year at syracuse university. up until that point, i had considered myself to be pretty much nailing the whole college thing as i adjusted to life eight hours away from my maryland childhood home. i was getting good grades, keeping my homesickness mostly in check, convincing myself that i enjoyed cheap beer and making new friends. cool new friends. cool new bro friends, to be exact.
this is not to say that there's a simple one-to-one transition from oil and gas jobs to clean energy jobs. the bureau of labor statistics still doesn't collect data on solar and wind jobs, so the stats that exist are cobbled together, but there are indisputably fewer jobs in clean energy than currently exist in the fossil fuel industry. and while white-collar workers can hop around the energy sector, it's not as straightforward for the various blue-collar workers in oil and gas. welders can work just as easily on a wind farm as an oil rig, but the skills of other oil rig workers are pretty specific to drilling.

here is an example. three years ago, the borrower purchased a house for $200,000 with a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage of $190,000 at 4%, and a monthly mortgage insurance premium of $65. she expects to be in the house another 4 years. the house is now worth $225,000, requiring an investment of $11,098 to bring the loan balance down to $168,750, which is 75% of $225,000. the return on investment in dollars is the $65 a month insurance premium for 68 months, plus the $14,280 difference in the loan balance in month 84 when the owner expects to sell the house. the rate of return is 8.96%
singapore airlines said monday that it will slash capacity by 96% and ground nearly its entire fleet at least until the end of april as nations worldwide shutter their borders amidst the coronavirus pandemic.
the textbook does not mention that those controversial shootings were at the hands of police officers or explain the societal changes black lives matter is trying to achieve with its supposedly divisive rhetoric. the book does not lay out for its teen readers what those mixed messages from the obama administration were.
for suri, no events occur in a vacuum. a knowledge of history is essential, not only to understand the present, but to form a vision of the future. as he took us through the five turning points, it was clear how each of these set the stage for what was to follow.
the move would, as the nyt and several other outlets since have pointed out, be controversial. the met is a public institution, once mandated by a 1893 state law to offer free admission at least five days and two evenings per week. (since 2013, it adheres to an amendment to its lease with the city that allows it to renegotiate the pay-as-you-wish policy in the future.) it receives annual grants from nyc ― without paying taxes or rent ― now totaling $26 million. that amount, however, covers only approximately 8 percent of the museum's $332 million annual operating costs.
to wit, the 1986 bill took two years to create, with lawmakers holding dozens and dozens of hearings and taking testimony from thousands of witnesses. the process was a classic reminder, almost like those how a bill becomes law charts in school textbooks, of how congress, with fits, starts and seemingly endless deliberation, inches its way toward final legislation.

president-elect joe biden may cancel the permit for the controversial keystone xl oil pipeline during his first days in office, capping one of the most fraught environmental battles in recent political history, accordant to several media reports sunday.
as the urban institute policy brief illustrates, this financing mechanism wouldn't be adequate to cover current costs, let alone higher expenses associated with growth in the number of people using medicaid or the costs of covid-19 treatments. the centers for medicare and medicaid services projected last year that medicaid spending would increase 6% annually between 2019 and 2027. by contrast, medical inflation has risen less than 3% in recent years, according to the brief.
but then again, the candidates weren't giving any of their fellow competitors a free pass either. warren went after just about everyone on stage — twice over. buttigieg seemed to have it out for sanders and klobuchar. and biden and sanders took their turns punching at bloomberg, like the rest of them.
this seemingly small change in how states approach the gender wage gap comes with huge consequences. while women make less than men in basically any job they choose, nearly a third of the difference between what men and women make, on average, can be explained by the fact that they usually work in different jobs. traditionally female occupations, such as teaching and nursing, employ 40 percent of all women and just 5 percent of men; traditionally male occupations, like carpentry and computer engineering, employ 44 percent of all men but just 6 percent of women. in order for there to be an equal gender split in the country's many different occupations, half of all women or men would have to switch jobs.
allison mcgeer, director of the infectious diseases epidemiology research unit at mount sinai hospital and a professor at the university of toronto's dalla lana school of public health, says there are bigger issues to contend with than a virus' name.
states could also limit access to certain medications, or eliminate medicaid's retroactive eligibility standard that covers recent medical expenses accumulated by new enrollees prior to signing up, or impose asset tests that block benefits for people who own homes or cars or other property, regardless how low their incomes are. that would be especially burdensome on newly jobless people, who still possess their assets but no longer have incomes.
why prioritize paid leave? there's also vaccine rollout, state and local aid and extending unemployment.
the industry lost more than 100,000 jobs between march and august 2020, according to the bureau of labor statistics and consulting firm deloitte (so certainly not the worst-hit sector, but hard-hit nonetheless). even if oil demand and prices increase, not all of those jobs are likely to come back, said ken medlock, senior director of the center for energy studies at rice university's baker institute for public policy.

steel predicted biden and mcconnell, two former colleagues, can find common ground on infrastructure and immigration — policy areas that have stumped multiple administrations. steel noted a handful of republican senators, including marco rubio of florida and rob portman of ohio, could face tough reelection fights in 2022, potentially making them eager to cut deals they could tout in campaigns.

canadian officials were among those who expressed concern this week after several media outlets reported on biden's looming action. jason kenney, the premier of the province of alberta, said in a statement that repealing the project permit would kill jobs on both sides of the border, weaken the critically important canada-us relationship, and undermine us national security by making the united states more dependent on opec oil imports in the future.

the raises may be an intended outcome of the shutdown, as republicans in november were attempting to tie a pay increase for civilian federal employees to a lift on the pay freeze for top government executives.
justice scalia is certainly not unique among americans, and clearly not unique among humans in general, in holding that god responds with favor to those who show him deference -- and with disfavor to those who do not. of course, this is not to say that such a belief is rational or justified. to the contrary, it seems to me that any deity who demands worship and attention doesn't deserve to be worshiped. but if some people think that supplicating a deity will increase their chances of getting what they want -- fine. this doesn't particularly concern me.

trump won the presidency in 2016 largely by fabricating a border crisis and hawking a massive wall as the solution to the contrived problem. now, he's upped the ante, by portraying migrant children and families from latin america as a security threat so grave that the federal government shouldn't reopen without committing to building a symbolic wall to, in theory, keep them out.

in march, trump signed a republican bill rescinding the fair pay and safe workplaces act, an obama-era law that required federal contractors to disclose and then address violations of labor law and worker safety regulations. in august, the trump administration announced it was postponing implementation of the so-called fiduciary rule ― another obama-era legacy ― that requires investment managers to act in the best interests of their clients. it's widely understood that the administration is merely buying time for a more formal rewrite or outright repeal of the regulation.

so doing things the right way might just be the wrong way. some days we want to get married. other days we want things to stay the same as they are now. it's a constant battle of weighing every one of the risks we're facing ― risks that have intensified as we now have an infant daughter ― and trying to determine the best path forward. no matter what we do, one thing remains the same: the stress and uncertainty we are grappling with is wreaking havoc on our relationship. if i'm being totally honest, there are days when i just want to walk away from my life, but i won't and i know that javier won't either. even though we are unsure of what the future will bring ― even though we answer every phone call with apprehension and we greet every knock on the door with chills traveling up and down our spines, it's all worth it to us.
it's understandable why taxpayers may prioritize investment this way. ensuring that the gardiner expressway is in a good state of repair and public transit is growing are things that are critical to the functioning of torontonians' daily lives. physical infrastructure also has the benefit of its economic returns being familiar and immediately visible. and when it doesn't function the way it should, citizens feel the fallout immediately. there's also no doubt that infrastructure spending leads to jobs.

because the measure was passed on a purely partisan basis (not one democrat voted for the bill), it is unlikely that democrats will be inclined to repair it, policy experts say. and, because of its errors, the tax legislation likely will add far more to the u.s. deficit over ten years than the $1.5 trillion the bill was designed to cost, jeopardizing the nation's credit rating and fueling fears of cuts in social security and medicare. indeed, after spending more than a year insisting that the law must not run up the nation's debt, republicans added more to the debt with this legislation than any single tax bill in the past three decades, records show.

if we're serious about ensuring that women are paid fairly, however, we can't just stop at demanding equal pay for equal work, as important as that is. women usually don't end up in equal work in the first place. to actually close the gender wage gap and do away with annual equal pay day commemorations, we'll have to think bigger — and value the work women do wherever they are.
quantitative easing, as practised by the bank of england and the us federal reserve, merely flooded the financial sector with money to the benefit of bondholders. this did not create a so-called wealth affect, with a trickle-down to the real producing economy. . . . if the eu were bold enough, it could fund infrastructure or renewables projects directly through the electronic creation of money, without having to borrow. our government has that authority, but lacks the political will. the [confederation of british industry] has calculated that every £1 of such expenditure would increase gdp by £2.80 through the money multiplier. the bank of england's qe programme of £375bn was a wasted opportunity.

the circular economy is about more than recycling and managing landfill. we need to look at all four dimensions of waste as an opportunity. find value in wasted resources that could become renewable, such as biofuel. exploit the wasted capacity in property or assets that could find a market, such as the 60 percent of europe's truck capacity that remains empty most of the time. reduce the wasted lifecycles that currently see products discarded rather than refurbished, often because they are not built to last. finally, secure the wasted embedded values by finding uses for otherwise rejected materials.
in 2015, president barack obama rejected keystone xl, saying that u.s. leadership to combat climate change would be undercut if he allowed the pipeline to be built. trump, in turn, revived both keystone xl and the dakota access pipeline, signing a pair of executive orders in his first few days to move the pipelines forward. legal challenges followed and in november 2018 a federal judge halted construction on keystone xl and ordered the trump administration to conduct a thorough environmental review. trump subsequently sidestepped that court order, issuing a presidential permit in 2019 authorizing energy company transcanada to again proceed with construction.

it is normal and natural for the military to want overwhelming resources, overwhelming force, to be allowed to use that force in as unrestrained a manner as possible, because that is how you win battles with the fewest losses on your own side, lindsay cohn, a professor at the naval war college, said at last week's hearing. she contrasted that with political logic: looking beyond the tactical considerations of any one battle or mission to broader national strategies that rely on the military as well as other tools to achieve broader goals.

as of 2013, there are estimated to be about 100 uncontacted tribes left in the world, mostly in thick forested areas like new guinea and the amazon rainforest (uncontacted peoples). but most of these would be minimally contacted tribes. some of these tribes have at least seen airplanes and helicopters that have photographed them. some have learned about the rest of the world from encounters with neighboring tribes that have been contacted, and some have picked up a few western goods through trade or gifting. and some are tribes that have already fled their land and withdrawn deeper into the wilderness--these do know about the rest of the world, and they have good reason to fear it and avoid it.

israel's success starts with its national health system, in which every single citizen belongs to one of four large, nonprofit health maintenance organizations. these hmos, which are different from their american analogues in many respects, do not merely pay for care. they provide it directly. they also have cutting-edge data and communications systems in place.
a potential executive order came to light after the draft text of one was leaked to conservative lawyer and former federal election commission member hans van spokavsky in 2011. the order would have required all federal contractors to disclose all of their political donations, including those to nonprofits engaged in electoral campaigns that are not covered by disclosure laws, when submitting a bid. it was drafted after congress failed to pass disclosure legislation in its previous session, failing to clear a republican filibuster by a single vote.
it's about who you know, just like any other industry. whether it's telecom or cannabis. if you want to be a big player, you have to know folks and you have to commit capital. and when every male in your family has been in jail at one point in their life, it's very hard to build up capital, she said.
eu officials, who say they were exhausted by trump's unpredictability, are eager to build fresh ties with biden.
so justice scalia's remarks are troubling, on more than one level. perhaps the most disturbing aspect of his remarks is his dismissal of the efforts of those american sailors and soldiers who brought about victory for the united states at midway. i always thought that the victory of the united states in that battle was due principally to the dedication of those who worked long hours to break the japanese codes, the skill of the commanding officers, the heroism of bomber pilots who defied withering fire to reach their targets, and the bravery and commitment of the american forces in general -- some of whom undoubtedly were atheists and many of whom were inspired by the american ideal of freedom of conscience for all. scalia considers their efforts inconsequential compared to the whim of an insecure deity.
a former foreign-policy adviser to the canadian government says the government is right to be concerned.
although the democrats' better deal policy program mentioned consolidation in markets from oil and gas to eyeglasses, it notably left out the problem of big tech monopolies. cicilline, however, is one of silicon valley's biggest critics on capitol hill. he told facebook that it cannot be trusted to regulate itself and got google ceo sundar pichai to admit that google was considering launching a search engine in china.

i wouldn't be surprised if they get a standing ovation just by entering the room, former u.n. climate chief christiana figueres said, referring to a u.s. return to global climate talks. that doesn't mean that they will have a standing ovation forever. they have to prove that they are really determined to make the changes that are necessary.
for all that these stories, bravely shared by domestic box office stars and domestic workers alike, have done to lay bare injustice, they've also, inescapably, returned us to the old ways of talking about what it means to be a woman. the big public feminist victory of the past year has both advanced our discourse and banished us, clutching our torn bodices, back to a narrative of powerlessness it seemed we'd finally, well, trumped. all those pink hats from the women's march have been packed away as mementos; it's the talk of pussy that remains.

my identity journey is not over. on the contrary, it's just beginning. there's a lot that i still don't know, but here is what i do know: being honest is important. it doesn't mean you have to have all of the answers or have to be ready to take some dramatic action to prove a point. it just means that you have to be ready to be raw.
trump bragged tuesday of having shattered the mentality of american decline and took credit for the united states becoming the number one producer of oil and natural gas in the world, by far. in fact, it was in 2012, under obama, that the u.s. became the top producer, as cnn's daniel dale noted in a tweet ahead of trump's speech.

in são paulo, a young black writer who lives in a favela on the city's outskirts told me that he had been stopped by police five times in the first three weeks after the election, usually as he was returning to the neighborhood on the way home from work. in rio, videos circulated last month of two men lying in the street, shot to death, before the police officers who killed them threw their bodies into the back of a pickup truck. brazil's police already killed more than 4,200 people last year ― in rio, they were responsible for 1 in every 5 homicides across the state. bolsonaro will likely make police forces even more deadly.
the analysis comes on the heels of two gut-wrenching climate reports, one by the united nations and another authored by scientists from more than a dozen federal agencies in the u.s., that warn the world is running out of time to stave off catastrophic, and potentially irreversible, climate change.

we unequivocally condemn any rhetoric that promotes illegal or violent behavior, amy yohe, managing editor of abeka publishing, told huffpost. one of abeka's core goals is to teach constructive citizenship through textbooks that accurately represent the facts of history, enabling students to learn from the life lessons it teaches, both positive and negative.
praise from the centre or left of the spectrum has been rare through ford's unorthodox and colourful political career.
yet only some of the high-profile democrats hoping to challenge trump in 2020 have made the issue a top priority. sanders held a town hall on climate change in december and is preparing legislation on a green new deal. merkley was the first senator to back a green new deal last year. sen. cory booker (d-n.j.) followed soon after, explicitly tying his push for a federal job guarantee to the climate proposal.
stagnant pay and reduced staff are ethics and corruption problems. the lobbying, consulting and corporate-funded think tank industries boomed over the past three decades as congress gutted itself. corporations actually spend more money on lobbying in washington than congress spends total, according to a study by new america fellow lee drutman.
addressing the crowd, trump suggested several times that he would join in their march to the capitol and appealed at least six times to pence to do the right thing and refuse to certify biden's victory in the formal counting of the electoral vote in congress that day. trump and his surrogates had built up a false narrative that pence, whose role in the certification process was mostly ceremonial, could somehow throw the election to his boss.

as of february 9, taiwan has reported just 18 cases of coronavirus, with no fatalities, and is not flagged as an area to avoid by the foreign office. i ended up sleeping on a friend's floor for my first night in the country, louise said. i contacted airbnb and told them i felt i had been racially discriminated against, and the person i spoke to acknowledged this and said he was very sorry it had happened. since then, they have agreed to refund me and reimburse me for all the expenses incurred due to the cancellation, including an uber, hotel and a second airbnb reservation i had to make. they also offered a $500 coupon for future use. i think this makes sense and i do appreciate the gesture to compensate for my loss.

early in the arab spring of 2011, out of fear of losing its grip on the country's citizens, the saudi government allocated $35 billion in open giveaways and services to saudi citizens. although this monetary inducement succeeded in tamping down any thoughts of revolution at the time, the saudis only deferred the day of reckoning. the impulse to fight against the sense of injustice is strong among those who live in that police state, with no democracy, and obscene inequality (many saudi residents are working residents, with no rights at all).
the first people have begun arriving at an emergency field hospital set up in madrid to help local hospitals overwhelmed with coronavirus patients. the field hospital — in the ifema conference centre — can take over 100 patients with moderate virus complications. approximately 1,000 beds will be prepared in the next 48 hours and capacity is estimated at 5,500 patients.

we're not seeing, at this point, a big number of first-time caucusgoers, she told wnyc's politics with amy walter podcast. it's about what it was in 2016. selzer did note her poll didn't pick up on a surge of first-time caucusgoers backing then-illinois sen. barack obama in 2008 until the final survey, released the weekend before the caucuses.
the features together would bring her package to around $750 billion, a sum that would have seemed eye-popping to many just a few weeks ago. but interest rates have plummeted, which most economists would say make this the ideal time to borrow large sums of money, especially for the sake of addressing a public health and economic crisis.

the tire industry, however, has pushed back on suggestions that tire wear particles have health effects. the tire industry project ― an industry body chaired by the three biggest tire manufacturers, michelin, bridgestone and goodyear ― says it is working to develop a better understanding of the possible health and environmental effects of tire and road wear particles (trwp).
there are certain hot spots like new york, and the federal government has to work on those spots, but at the same time, at a certain point, we have to get open, and we have to get moving, trump said. he added that we can do two things at one time before again bringing up flu deaths and motor vehicle fatalities.
that kind of inability to deal with a woman like ocasio-cortez is, in many ways, emblematic of the broader crisis facing the republican party, which is moving backward in terms of gender diversity in congress even as democrats add more women and people of color to their ranks each year. in the 1990s, women were equally distributed across both parties in congress; today, there are 13 republican women and 89 democratic women. republicans have only ever had one black woman in the house of representatives, mia love of utah, and she just lost her bid for re-election.

it's not clear what kind of consequences these endorsements will have in the early states — especially in iowa, where sanders, warren and buttigieg have invested so much of their resources. people's action has an iowa affiliate, the iowa center for community improvement, but most of the other groups do not.
despite hundreds of internet shutdowns at this point in kashmir and other states, there have been no impact assessments or evaluations of its effectiveness by either the state or central governments, rydzak told huffpost india in september. so that begs the question of whether they are not publishing these impact assessments because they don't know the effects or because they know that internet shutdowns don't work.
the different growth paths are a symptom of a general problem that has haunted currency unions for centuries. competitiveness and productivity develop at a different pace in different countries. over time, this leads to large competitiveness differences among the members of a currency union. these differences do not usually pose a problem during economic booms, because strengthening aggregate demand supports ailing fields of production. however, when a currency union faces an economic downturn or a crisis, falling aggregate demand hits less competitive industries and countries hard and the financing costs of less competitive countries jump. this is an asymmetric shock.

the last time congress convened a committee to study how to make congress a better place was in 1993. the committee's proposals failed after house democratic party leadership balked at suggestions that would have undermined their power. then democrats lost control of congress. the new republican majority, led by speaker newt gingrich (r-ga.), implemented some of the commission's modernization reforms but, more important, slashed congress' budget, dramatically reduced staff levels, eliminated entire research support agencies and centralized power more than ever in party leadership offices.

still, it's possible that president donald trump's goal was never realistic, given the challenges of launching such a massive program in a country with such a notoriously underfunded public sector. the pace is picking up now and, in a few parts of the country, states are well on their way to vaccinating the highest priority groups.

how americans would feel about this is a big unknown. as employer insurance gets more expensive, employers are passing along some of those higher costs to their workers in the form of higher co-pays and deductibles, to the point where some of the employees struggle to pay bills. and employer coverage often requires dealing with limited networks of doctors and hospitals.

despite president obama's call for racial harmony, his eight-year term of office saw an intensification of racial discord. several controversial shootings of black men led to protests, some of which were violent and destructive with black communities bearing the brunt of most of the destruction. groups such as black lives matter sharpened the divide between police and citizens, and black and white, with divisive rhetoric. mixed messages from the obama administration, the department of justice in particular, seemed to increase the racial discord.

the shutdown, which began dec. 22, was technically the third to take place in 2018, although the first lasted a mere three days, and the second lasted just a few hours and did not result in any furloughs. there have been 21 similar funding lapses since 1976, but only a handful of major shutdowns in which workers went without pay. until now, the longest one had been a 21-day shutdown starting in december 1995, amid a deadlock between then-president bill clinton and congressional republicans.

sessions was heavily involved, as the inspector general's office found. when the five u.s. attorneys along the u.s.-mexico border raised concerns about children's welfare, sessions dismissed them, the new york times reported in october based on a draft of the report. we need to take away children, sessions told the prosecutors, according to participants' notes, the times reported. rosenstein later said that the children's ages didn't matter. after intense public outrage, trump signed an executive order in june 2018 to end the practice, and then took credit for doing so — even though his administration started it in the first place. neither sessions nor rosenstein is still serving in the trump administration. sessions was eventually forced out after the 2018 election because trump didn't like his handling of the special counsel investigation into russian interference in the 2016 election. rosenstein stepped down in may 2019, after the release of the the special counsel's report.
correct. now the bill can be authored in part by chuck schumer and patty murray, two people who deeply care about national paid leave. and the tiebreaker will be kamala harris, who equally is passionate about paid leave, as is president biden.

there have been very, very few military coups in latin america over the last 35 years, said steven levitsky, a harvard university political scientist and author of how democracies die. so i think that while increased public support for a military coup is troubling, it's much more likely brazilian democracy will die at the hands of an elected leader.
congressional makeup shapes any administration, but perhaps even more so for biden, who spent 36 years in the senate, plus eight as obama's vice president and top congressional liaison. biden leaned on that resume to pitch himself to the country as a consensus builder; he also criticized presidents' increased use of executive action to go around congress and insisted it would be different in his presidency.
you know, during that time, i reached out to a bunch of people. you want to get as many thoughts as possible.

steel said a fully bipartisan path would require biden and democrats quickly establishing warm relationships with the gop, working with them on the coronavirus package and likely delaying trump's impeachment trial.
southern baptist leader russell moore, a prominent voice within america's largest protestant denomination, is calling on president donald trump to resign after trump incited a violent mob of his supporters to descend on the u.s. capitol on wednesday.
it was fascinating to see the comparison of the beginning of trump's presidency to the end, the crazy contrast of people registering their reactions to losing an election. one, the women's march, was peaceful and joyous, while the other was a violent insurrection.
within days of losing the nov. 3 election, trump began capitalizing on that popularity to raise millions of dollars, first with the trumpeted aim of challenging the voters' decision and then under the guise of supporting gop candidates in two senate runoff elections. but, in fact, he can use the proceeds of the leadership pac he created for almost anything he wants, including paying himself an eight-figure salary. he wound up spending nothing at all on the georgia senate races. trump has also vowed to remain involved in republican politics by attacking incumbents who have not shown him sufficient loyalty and has hinted at another white house run himself in four years.
parks, who owns a delivery service in the city, introduced herself to nicole elliott, the first director of the city's office of cannabis. she also created a working group with other operators in the area.
but an analysis from unite here argues it was high democratic turnout ― not low gop turnout ― that determined the election. georgia has more high-propensity gop voters than democratic voters, but there are more more medium-propensity democratic voters. as turnout rises in the state, the memo argues, democrats become more and more likely to win.
at first, i was still hopeful. i was thinking, maybe not now, but she's going to come. not today, but she was going to come like next week. she even packed her stuff. she was ready. the moment that she would get the visa, she would just fly. and then she sort of started unpacking, i guess, after a while.

a bold plan to transition to a green economy will both put americans to work and reduce pollution that keeps millions of the working poor sick and trapped in poverty. kids will miss fewer days of school due to respiratory illness, parents will miss fewer days of work, and working a full-time job will pay a livable wage. and action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions is the only way to lower the probability that devastating fires, hurricanes and floods will become even more frequent occurrences. for the kinds of climate-related impacts that we have already endured ― and will continue to ― we need coordinated infrastructure and systems in place to ensure that americans are prepared and protected.

warnock is facing republican sen. kelly loeffler, a 50-year-old former businesswoman who was appointed to the senate less than a year ago by the state's republican governor. she is only the second woman to represent georgia in the senate, although race has emerged as a campaign focus far more than gender. loeffler and her allies have seized on some snippets of warnock's sermons at the historic black church to cast him as extreme. dozens of religious and civil rights leaders have pushed back.
every time a politician talks about climate policy or a newspaper runs a big story on the transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy, the question of jobs comes up. for those who are opposed to the transition, the common criticism is that moving away from coal, oil and gas would leave hundreds of thousands of americans out of work. for those in favor, the question is how to train hundreds of thousands of oil and gas workers for different sorts of jobs.
turkey's presidential spokesman called allegations that his country planned to attack the u.s.-allied kurds in syria irrational and said turkey was fighting terrorism for national security.
the plan also appears to omit a proposal favored by wyden and many democrats to tie benefits to the unemployment rate instead of setting an arbitrary cut-off deadline. biden supports the idea and it's mentioned as a possibility after the september cut-off, but a senior official said he is not prioritizing economic triggers for jobless benefits in the administration's first proposal.

under the trump administration's approach, the government has been holding back a supply of vaccines to guarantee that people can get a second shot, which provides maximum protection against covid-19. both the pfizer-biontech and moderna vaccines require a second shot about three weeks after the first vaccination. one-shot vaccines are still undergoing testing.

it's more conservative democrats like manchin who are most likely to balk at ambitious reconciliation bills, because they typically involve spending a lot of money, increasing the size of government or, as in the case of covid-19 checks, giving people money with no strings attached ― things that will run against the lawmakers' own policy instincts, raise suspicions in the eyes of more conservative constituents, or both.

lansing is a hub city with nearly half a million residents within its ring of suburbs and exurbs, but it has a small-town feel. nassar epitomized the pillar of the community cliche; he was involved in lots of local organizations and had a wide network of supporters and admirers. even with sexual assault charges pending, he ran for the school board and got 21 percent of the vote. that means 2,730 of our neighbors voted to put the most prolific child predator in known history on the school board. when the indy star first reported that rachael denhollander had accused nassar of abuse, the community closed ranks around him with breathtaking speed. as we saw last week, the full extent of nassar's depredation was revolting. his reputation and the army of supporters who enabled him and defended him made it possible for nassar to abuse so many girls for so long.
gov. phil murphy has indicated that he'll sign the diane b. allen equal pay act (named for a retired state senator who herself experienced pay discrimination). once he does, we will have the strongest legislation in the country, boasted assemblywoman pamela lampitt, one of the main sponsors of the bill. some of the new law's strength will stem from the fact that victims of discrimination will be able to seek payback for up to six years of underpayment (the current cap is two years), and monetary damages in court will be tripled.
by 2015, when he launched his bid for the democratic presidential nomination, sanders had fully changed his mind about the ability for progressive politics to flourish within the party.
rebecca o'connor, vice president for public policy at the rape, abuse and incest national network (rainn), says that she's not surprised by the lack of widespread attention to the nassar case. the institution of penn state football and the celebrity of bill cosby provided the spotlight necessary to make those cases front-page news.

let us be clear: trump did not act alone. at the pre-riot rally on the national mall, his lawyer, former new york city mayor rudolph giuliani, urged the mob to pursue trial by combat to overturn the election results. trump supporters who invaded the capitol chanted hang mike pence! for the vice president's refusing to throw out the electoral votes that made biden president-elect. one rioter was photographed wearing a camp auschwitz t-shirt; others brought zip-tie handcuffs for detaining hostages. still others brought a gallows to the capitol, scrawled murder the media on its walls and beat a capitol police officer to death with a fire extinguisher.
it comes as a major blow for a fossil fuel infrastructure project that has been plagued by setbacks and litigation over the last decade.
at a certain point, democrats agree, biden will have to decide whether to pursue a more aggressive strategy, both on coronavirus relief legislation and the rest of his agenda. the question is how long he can afford to put off that decision.

the citizens' climate lobby built a network of roughly 400 local groups in part by pushing an avowedly bipartisan message on climate change and appealing to a small cadre of republicans who back a moderate carbon fee-and-dividend policy. despite its ideological malleability, many say such a policy amounts to a half-measure in dealing with greenhouse gases.
the term circular economy, which shows up more and more at political agendas, is precise but does not express the deep mental change that it implies. we live in a time when machines and labor are used not only to produce jeans, but also to consume them before selling. actually, the idea of a circular economy is just the opposite. it's meant to extend the life of products and materials, thus making them 'circulate' longer in the economy and reducing the amount of raw materials and newly produced goods, as well as their environmental impact. 'the eu action plan for the circular economy' and the chinese policy for a circular economy are just two examples of the proliferating initiatives in this direction.

the further down-ballot you go, the uglier the picture of the republican party gets. in michigan alone, the gop state party chair, statehouse legislators and local election officials went to extraordinary lengths to discredit biden's victory in the state and twist the legal system into overturning his win. the rule of law defense fund, a dark money organization republican state attorneys general created in 2014, made robocalls encouraging people to attend the wednesday rally and stop the steal. a republican member of the west virginia house of delegates was even among those who stormed the capitol (he has since resigned his seat).

people often make the mistake in thinking that an engagement ring is automatically insured under a homeowners policy, says jerry ehrenwald, president and ceo of the international gemological institute. however, many policies only provide limited coverage, which could leave you footing the bill — or a big chunk of it — if you need to replace an expensive item. every couple should consider a insurance policy appropriate for their ring. read on for all the essential tips you need to know to get started.

the seats that democrats picked up across the country this fall were largely won by reassuring voters that they are willing to fight for workers young and old, and ensuring that they will have affordable health care and gainful employment. the green new deal, a bold proposal to put americans to work building green infrastructure, modeled after franklin d. roosevelt's new deal, was a central campaign issue for a progressive faction of the newly elected democrats. at first, establishment democrats scoffed at the green new deal as some ultraleft policy demand, but the more the idea of job creation through building renewable energy and climate-adapted infrastructure were floated with the american public, the more support they gained. not to mention, the notion of slowing rampant income inequality and leaving no american behind sits favorably with working people throughout the nation.

the only way to ensure that we are protected against trump's mass deportation efforts is to elect progressive leaders who are willing to stand up for immigrant communities. otherwise, we risk putting dreamers in the path of thomas homan, the acting director of ice, who did not mince any words when expressing his views on legislation protecting dreamers from deportation. if we get a clean daca bill, shame on all of us, homan told a crowd earlier this week.

in addition, the insidious legacy of the tuskegee syphilis experiment continues to wreak havoc on the overall health of african americans more than 40 years after the sadistic, decades-long program was finally exposed. an inherited culture of mistrust of the medical establishment and propensity for medical conspiracy theories may leave black msm wary of hiv prevention that comes in a pill and requires routine medical care. furthermore, many african americans are raised with a strong bias against going to the doctor for anything but serious illness.

probably the best known uncontacted tribes are the people of north sentinel island in the indian ocean. even they have had some contact with the outside world--they know we're out here, but most attempts at contact have been met with arrows and spears. between 1967 and 1996, there were a few attempts to make peaceful contact with them by leaving them gifts, so the sentinelese have at least accepted a few western goods, such as aluminum cookware, and we have a few close-up photos of them. several people attempting to make contact were hurt or killed, including the director of a national geographic documentary, who was speared in the leg during a 1974 contact attempt that ended badly. since 1996 the indian government policy has been to leave them alone. in 2006, the sentinelese killed two fishermen who were in their waters illegally--and then drove away the indian navy helicopter sent to retrieve them, with a volley of arrows.

fifty times stronger than heroin and 100 times stronger than morphine, the synthetic opioid was rarely detected in u.s. illicit drug markets or in the bodies of fatal overdose victims just a decade ago. last month, the centers for disease control and prevention confirmed that fentanyl has become the biggest killer in the nation's raging drug overdose epidemic. the rate of overdoses jumped 113 percent each year from 2013 through 2016.
after the change in the public charge rule, immigrants have become hesitant to utilize lifesaving services during the pandemic, such as medicaid, federal housing, and food aid, for fear of jeopardizing their chances for a green card and citizenship. simpson noted that some families are not seeking medical services or local assistance for fear of being deported or denied a chance at residency.
what i couldn't resist was the sybian. a sybian is a vibrator on steroids. it's a saddle-like device with an electric motor stronger than most lawnmowers. a wriggling, rotating dildo protrudes from the center of the device. vibrating pads at the base of the seat provide additional clitoral stimulation. the closest i'd been to one was watching women use it in porn.
just weeks before the severity of the novel coronavirus outbreak in the united states became unmistakable, president donald trump's administration offered states a way to make significant cuts to their medicaid programs, which provide health care coverage for just over 20% of the population.

almost every house committee will have the ability to dig into the widespread corruption that has characterized the trump administration across practically every agency. former interior secretary ryan zinke's conflict-ridden land deals with the oil-services company halliburton and the casino operator mgm can be investigated now. secretary of housing and urban development ben carson's nepotism and cronyism are also fair game, as is the elevation of matthew whitaker from a non-senate-confirmed aide who recently worked as a salesman for a company convicted of fraud and a pitchman for toilets designed for men with oversized genitals to the position of acting attorney general.

the above chart illustrates the game that is being played in china to keep things looking good, even while they are falling apart. then we have to take into account that 90% of the public companies in china are some form of quasi-state controlled entities. while a lot of investors take solace in that, believing the government will back up these companies if they begin to stumble – the consultant in me has to consider the internal bleeding of all these companies adding up to possibly trillions of dollars (certain trillions of yuan) in bailouts. how long can the pboc really keep this up?
the affordable care act ― biden's famous b.f.d. ― is 11 years old and, for all its success making health care coverage available and more affordable to millions of americans, it needs work. biden campaigned on beefing up the law rather than replacing it wholesale with a single-payer medicare for all system. a fully democratic congress would provide the new president with an opportunity to fulfill some of his promises.

mysterybrand.net, which is riddled with grammatical errors, quietly removed its top prizes ― including beach vacations, premium california real estate and luxury vehicles ― following a maelstrom of scam accusations on social media in the wake of paul and le's viral videos. its now-deleted photo of a $250 million most expensive los angeles realty mansion was actually an image of a $188 million bel air home, the daily beast and others reported. and until recently, mystery brand's prize list included a 2018 lamborghini centenarió ― only 40 of which have ever been produced (all prior to 2018). the same goes for its real car rolls-royce phantom 2018 ― no such car was made last year.
kratom is an herb derived from the leaves of a southeast asian tree related to coffee. it's sold in the u.s. as an unregulated herbal supplement and commonly taken in powder form in capsules or tea. kratom has opioid-like effects and is often used as a mood enhancer, or for its stimulant or sedative qualities, which can vary depending on the dose and strain. supporters regularly tout it as a natural treatment for conditions like chronic pain, anxiety and depression. others claim it's a safer alternative to traditional opioids, both legal and illegal, which has also contributed to kratom's increasing popularity as a step-down treatment off of painkillers or heroin.

it comes as dozens of evacuees from a coronavirus-hit cruise ship spent their first night quarantined at arrowe park hospital on the wirral. thirty-two people, who spent more than two weeks trapped on the diamond princess cruise ship off the coast of japan, arrived in merseyside on saturday evening. some of the group – reportedly made up of 30 britons and two irish nationals – made gestures from their coaches as they arrived at the merseyside facility on saturday evening – one forming a heart symbol with her hands and another an ok signal. all of those who arrived at arrowe park tested negative to having covid-19 before flying back to the uk. it is understood some british nationals who are part of the diamond princess crew opted to remain. since being kept on board the cruise liner in the port of yokohama, more than 600 passengers and crew have been infected. british couple david and sally abel, from northamptonshire, who were were on the cruise for their 50th wedding anniversary, have both been diagnosed with pneumonia and relatives complained they had been moved to a prison-like hospital in japan. in a bid to help stop the spread of the virus in the uk, the health service is piloting home testing where nhs staff, including nurses and paramedics, will visit people in their own homes. slight fall in new chinese coronavirus deaths

so you can imagine my surprise when fifty years later i receive a letter in the mail. my father had passed away a few months earlier and there had been an obituary in the local paper. upon hearing the news, mrs. gerlip thought to write a personal note which found its way to me via my mother, who still lives in my hometown. after months of correspondence, a reunion was planned at mrs. gerlip's home in western massachusetts. my 86-year-old mother was excited to join us and see the teacher she remembered so fondly. reconnecting with mrs. gerlip was a journey back in time. five decades had passed, but my teacher's memories revealed a remarkable connection to each and every student. pointing out faces from the class photo, mrs. gerlip recalled suzy's sweet nature, matt's studious reserve, and patty's chatty sociability. she hadn't forgotten the class bully who used to pelt me with ice balls (and anti-semitic slurs) on my way to school. in an era when bullying was considered a rite of passage, mrs. gerlip knew better and put a stop to it.
annual tax refunds are already one of the federal government's most important antipoverty programs. under bennet-brown, low-income parents would get about $300 per month in cash and would not need any earnings to qualify. switching to monthly support would make life easier for parents, and increasing the benefit would slash child poverty by 40%.

so what are these top three states doing right? there's no single answer and, as with the international data, it's possible some state reporting is incomplete or slow, making it hard to draw definitive conclusions. but a common factor seems to be their approach to nursing homes. most states in the u.s. are relying heavily on cvs and walgreens, which are the official partners of the trump administration's operation warp speed. but because cvs and walgreens don't always have a presence in rural areas, those three states are relying more heavily on other providers to reach nursing homes.

after president donald trump insisted at the last minute that a relief bill provide $2,000 checks, house democrats immediately passed an amendment increasing the stimulus payment by $1,400 that then-majority leader mitch mcconnell (r-ky.) blocked in the senate. the issue would end up becoming a critical political cudgel for warnock and ossoff, the victorious georgia senate democrats, to wield against their republican opponents.

the senate override was delayed after sen. bernie sanders, i-vt., objected to moving ahead until mcconnell allowed a vote on a trump-backed plan to increase covid-19 relief payments to $2,000. mcconnel did not allow that vote; instead he used his parliamentary power to set a vote limiting debate on the defense measure, overcoming a filibuster threat by sanders and senate democratic leader chuck schumer of new york.
while most new parents need to focus much of their time, energy and resources on the newborn, it's important to recognize that you need to nurture yourself and your relationship once the baby is a couple of months old. there are many parents who struggle to go out on a date after having children due to financial constraints. it's important for partners to engage with one another as adults with a variety of interests other than their kids in order to keep the erotic energy going. you can have sex while your kids are sleeping, but if all you've been doing night after night is reading stories and cleaning up after dinner, the routine can become old and exhausting. it leaves little time to connect romantically and sensually with your partner.― sari cooper, sex therapist and director of the center for love and sex nyc

biden said he needs a senate majority to pass legislation to combat the coronavirus, and he blasted perdue and loeffler as obstructionist trump loyalists. loeffler says she will join other republican lawmakers in objecting to the electoral college certification of biden's victory by congress on wednesday.
democrat joe biden will take the oath of office at noon that day, becoming president and commander-in-chief of the united states, and leaving trump suddenly vulnerable to both civil and criminal legal liabilities from which holding that office had shielded him for four years.
in ms. l v. ice, an aclu lawsuit that required the trump administration to reunite separated children with their parents, the organization also criticized the government for failing to properly keep track of separated families, which forced immigration advocates to find the locations of hundreds of deported parents themselves.

my guy, your wife is a woman in america. she's probably fully aware she's gained weight, no matter how depressed she is (not to mention that depression and weight gain often go hand-in-hand). i'm curious as to whether you're more concerned about her physical health or mental health. you describe yourselves as a normally fit and healthy couple, so my guess is her weight gain has become an issue for your relationship. i get it: sex and attraction are extremely important in a marriage. but i'll be honest: it sounds like this might be more about you than her.

biden will be forced to navigate a similar legislative playing field, except another decade into a rapidly worsening global crisis. unless democrats can somehow flip a pair of republican-held senate seats in the georgia runoff election on jan. 5, the gop will maintain control of the senate while democrats hold a slim majority in the house.

in short, unlike other donors, the mercers are not merely angling to influence the republican establishment—they want to obliterate it. one source told me that, in a meeting with sheldon adelson and robert mercer a few years ago, the casino mogul asked robert if he was familiar with certain big republican players. according to the source, robert shut him down. i don't know any of your fancy friends, he replied, and i haven't got any interest in knowing them. and so it seemed almost inevitable that their paths converged with bannon's when he took over breitbart in 2012. the mercers recognized bannon as an ideological ally. they also appreciated how quickly he improved the website's finances. unlike many people in their orbit, bannon wasn't obsequious: according to one person who often spends time with them, he made zero effort to dress up around his benefactors, often appearing in sweatpants and looking almost like a homeless person. bannon was respectful around robert, says this person, but with rebekah he was more apt to say precisely what he thought: he worked for bob; he worked with rebekah. although the mercers had initially been persuaded to back texas senator ted cruz in the republican primary, bannon preferred trump, and by the time of the republican national convention the mercers were with him. rebekah made her move last august, at a fundraiser at the east hampton estate of woody johnson, the owner of the new york jets.

trump ― through his incessant false claims of voter fraud ― for weeks sowed defiance and distrust of the election results among his base. on jan. 6, he addressed thousands of his supporters in washington, d.c., and called on them to march on the u.s. capitol. many of them heeded his orders, forcing their way into the building. the violence resulted in at least five deaths, including a police officer who died after a pro-trump rioter bludgeoned him in the head with a fire extinguisher.
this strategy, deliberately or not, has the effect of making bolsonaro look more moderate than he is while shifting the very grounds on which he is being evaluated. now, a bolsonaro who does everything short of closing congress, rewriting the constitution or re-establishing military rule starts to resemble a committed democrat.

we have bolsonaro because we have trump, stuenkel said. we would not have seen the same dynamic here without what happened in the u.s. in 2016. i think that inspired a lot of people who basically learned from trump.
republicans argue that medicaid was created to serve the most vulnerable and has become bloated under obamacare. verma and other republicans said implementing work and community engagement requirements could help improve health outcomes by connecting people with jobs and training.
the biden administration is ending trump's policy of prioritizing the deportation of all undocumented immigrants in the u.s. and strictly enforcing that through immigration and customs enforcement. biden's team said it instead will set civil immigration enforcement policies that best protect the american people and are in line with our values and priorities.
the governor criticized president donald trump's response, which has involved encouraging the private sector to produce more supplies, as insufficient, saying it can't be ad-hoc.
in other words, the united states has made a practice of locking up victims. the blame for that practice can be laid at the feet of the burgeoning opioid crisis; the war on drugs, which has a disparate effect on women; and our widespread insistence on ignoring girls when they report sexual abuse.
in europe and elsewhere, there are some good initial policies on new building standards that make new constructions more environmentally friendly, and some eu states – the united kingdom, france and the netherlands among them – are also beginning to mandate that older buildings be retrofitted.
this ruling is a forceful rebuke of the trump administration's attempt to weaponize the census for an attack on immigrant communities, he said in a statement. the evidence at trial, including from the government's own witness, exposed how adding a citizenship question would wreck the once-in-a-decade count of the nation's population. the inevitable result would have been — and the administration's clear intent was — to strip federal resources and political representation from those needing it most.

as president, trump has frequently showcased his golf resorts in scotland and ireland, which have struggled financially. he took an entourage to doonbeg after a state visit with queen elizabeth ii last year. vice president mike pence went three hours out of his way to stay at trump's resort in doonbeg last year, even though he had traveled to ireland to meet with the nation's prime minister in dublin. the u.s. air force spent nearly $200,000 at trump's turnberry resort for lodging during refueling stops at a small airport near the resort.

there is some possibility of compromise on issues such as nuclear power, carbon capture technology and research funding for renewables, all things included in the bipartisan spending bill passed last month. but a legal mandate to rapidly phase out fossil fuels and intervene radically in the economy is difficult to envision, given the makeup of the 117th congress.

democrats and their candidates should resolve now to end the cycle of injustice that allows the powerful to shield themselves from the consequences of their actions. it should be a litmus test for any aspiring trump opponent to commit to governing under the principle of equal justice for all and to empowering prosecutors to go where the evidence takes them.

if you loved your former career and have an established area of expertise, it's possible to use that experience to build a part-time consulting gig. the best part about consulting is that you can usually work on your own time, do your work in whatever way suits your talents and skills, and charge as much money as the market will bear.

the center for migration studies (cms) has released its latest report on the u.s. undocumented population, authored by robert warren, the former director of the immigration and naturalization service's statistics division. the report derives its estimates of the undocumented from 2014 statistics on the foreign-born from the us census bureau's american community survey (acs). it does not draw policy conclusions, but provides findings on the undocumented by country of origin and u.s. state. on a national level, it reports that:

what's unclear is how those politically close to her will handle what will be an internecine battle. gabbard has developed deep roots in the party's left wing, working with the sanders institute, founded by the senator's wife, jane sanders, and frequently posturing as the democrats' leading antiwar voice when more mainstream members of the party succumb to militarism the party's base dislikes, as when they endorsed trump's strike against assad in 2017.
even veteran congressional aides disagree a bit over what can and can't happen during challenges, because that involves so many different rules about how budgeting works ― and, potentially, breaking traditional understandings of how congress operates. but it's at least possible that a simple majority could get its way on what ends up in a reconciliation bill, regardless of the parliamentarian's judgment, if the will to do so exists.

not all of these extremists, of course, think of themselves as murderous neo-nazis. early news reports were filled with stories and images of people who infiltrated the capitol gawking at its opulence like tourists, or patiently explaining various conspiracy theories to reporters rather than assaulting them (though other members of the mob did attack journalists).

in illinois, billionaire gov. j.b. pritzker (d) bankrolled a constitutional amendment ballot initiative that would have allowed the adoption of a progressive income tax, replacing the current system, which only permits a single, flat income tax rate. by its very nature, levying the same tax rate ― currently 4.95% ― on all state residents disproportionately affects low- and middle-income people, for whom the sum is more onerous. and the system has forced illinois to rely more heavily on property taxes, which wealthy residents have often evaded by hiring politically connected property tax appeals lawyers.

in other places, such as germany, an egalitarian philosophy and deeply held beliefs about the value of a public education preclude the government from shifting costs to the students. in germany, for example, there was a short-lived effort from 2005-2014 to charge minimal tuition, which was rolled back after a major public outcry. germans strongly believe that higher education is a public good to be totally subsidized the government.

it's not that the jct couldn't do the work, known as a macroeconomic analysis. but the house bill was moving so fast that the jct couldn't get an analysis out in time for the vote. (jct finished its report on the house bill 25 days after that chamber voted on it.) so, the jct focused on assessing the senate version, which came later. that report made it to senators dec. 1, 2017 — just one day before they voted on their bill. the report concluded that even with the economic growth the tax cuts would generate, the senate bill would still cost the nation more than $1 trillion over 10 years.

unlike the first episode, the second episode lands much better by poking fun at the photo ops and ribbon cuttings that fill bremer's days as mayor. his staff advises him not to do anything that could turn him into an embarrassing meme.
it turns out that, in these fields, it has taken only a few players to set in motion the kind of transformations that will be necessary to meet the paris agreement's target of keeping the global temperature increase to well below 2˚c, ideally to 1.5˚c, over its pre-industrial level.
our sympathy for sexual abuse victims, while we're in the throes of punishing their abusers, is righteous. but it seems to fade away when they self-medicate because the pain of their victimization is too much to bear. it disappears when victims respond to their pain in ways that are less socially acceptable than testifying at their abuser's sentencing. all victims of sexual abuse deserve our compassion ― and they need help, not punishment.
but that script got sent to rewrite. instead of the new twist on the old story — frigid harpy schoolmarm wields power over homestead/boarding school — we expected, we got a different one. in this one, women were objects, not subjects. young and desirable bodies to conquer, firm flesh to be despoiled by modern day caligulas. (i'll never forget the image of brett ratner with his penis in one hand and a bowl of shrimp cocktail in another, an image that was lost among the tales of weinstein's many gilded hotel rooms.)
the supreme court will hear oral argument on what evidence the courts can consider in the case in february. but in his opinion, furman made it clear that the evidence the justice department had volunteered on its own was sufficient to show ross broke the law.
president donald trump spoke for about an hour and 20 minutes before the u.s. congress on tuesday and largely stuck to the script, successfully avoiding any tirades about the ongoing senate impeachment trial.

kansas city, kan. ― in mid-october, on the last day he could register to vote ahead of the nov. 4, 2014, midterm elections, charles stricker went to the dmv in wichita. when he checked in, stricker, who had just moved to kansas, was told he didn't have all the documents he needed to get a driver's license. so he went home, put all the documents together and rushed back to the dmv. he wanted to make sure he got there in time because at the dmv he could do both: get his license and register to vote in time.
just one of the fda's cases appears to involve the presence of kratom alone, though the report includes no information on the death apart from the subject's age and ethnicity. the report shows the individual tested positive for high levels of mitragynine, but as in the rest of the cases, says nothing about how the substance was determined to have contributed to his death. the fda denied huffpost's request for additional information on that case.
i asked what is going to happen in 30 days if i quickly open things up, are you going to approve border security which includes a wall or steel barrier? nancy said, no, the president tweeted.
former rep. dan burton (r-ind.) famously used his control of the oversight committee in the 1990s to follow every rumor and conspiracy theory about president bill clinton, whom he declared a scumbag. burton believed that clinton had ordered the assassination of white house lawyer vince foster (foster committed suicide in 1993) and even re-enacted the invented murder by shooting a cantaloupe (or maybe a pumpkin or a watermelon) in his backyard.
but there is good news: since i last spoke with the committee in 2015, and thanks in no small part to a letter chairman goodlatte sent to 161 colleges and universities across the country, (and many additional lawsuits), the number of speech codes on campus has decreased significantly.

looking beyond academia to consider broader social impact, indicators of unequal participation are worrisome. as women enter the workforce, we see even more differentiation by field, with women comprising 34% of environmental engineers but only 8% of mechanical engineers. gender imbalances in the technology industry and financial sector are widely recognized. three recent studies illuminate attitudes and practices limiting women's advancement in science and technology.
law professor timothy canova plans to reintroduce this funding model if elected to represent florida's 23rd congressional district, where he is now running against the controversial debbie wasserman schultz, current chair of the democratic national convention. prof. canova wrote in a december 2012 article:
biden's administration could condition federal funding for state plans to build electric vehicle infrastructure and clean energy, or pay states to prepare climate action plans and stipulate that they be subject to federal enforcement or forced to return the money if they don't meet those goals. such a program would need to be voluntary, and could be expanded to include funding for states that agree to conserve additional land under their control, but it's a possibility, said michael gerrard, director of columbia law school's sabin center for climate change law.
miller, a former aide to then-alabama sen. jeff sessions who joined the trump transition team in 2016, has long held hardline views on immigration. he helped craft the white house's first executive order to bar entry into the united states for residents of seven predominantly muslim nations and has been a vocal proponent for the construction of a wall along america's southern border.

if our american neighbour's longest military engagement has taught anyone anything -- it is that until the afghan regime and those in position of power in afghanistan are not held accountable and meticulously monitored, not only will there not be any gains, but both the afghan people and the international community will suffer great losses, hekmatyar being one of those incomprehensible failures.

the chinese launched their first satellite in 1970. following this, an early human spaceflight program was put on hold to focus on commercial satellite applications. in 1978, deng xiaoping articulated china's space policy noting that, as a developing country, china would not take part in a space race. instead, china's space efforts have focused on both launch vehicles and satellites — including communications, remote sensing and meteorology.
the free tuition trend began in 2005 in kalamazoo, michigan, which launched a privately funded effort to combat its economic decline. the movement has quickly spread: today roughly 200 localities offer young residents free tuition to local community colleges and technical schools.
in every pr situation, says snapp conner, the characteristics of patience, listening, consideration for another point of view and a sincere desire to serve will go very far, even if someone in your employment has made a mistake. respect their intent and effort to uphold the company policy and also respect the customer's right to disagree. look to further understanding and progressive improvement as opposed to who is wrong or right in a fight. in other words, a little more eq and emotional maturity can go a very long ways in pr.

current and former white house officials say they were aghast at how trump treated pence, who has been a steady and loyal lieutenant. they were stung by the president's criticism and false insistence that the vice president could intervene to overturn the electoral college results. trump also never called pence to check on him during his ordeal, an aide said.

when discussing protests against the iraq war and president george w. bush's low approval rating at the time, the abeka 11th-grade u.s. history book points the finger at the media in part, saying that much of the war opposition in america was the media, supported by a large number of hollywood entertainers, and that spurred on by the media, many americans wanted a change from the policies of the previous eight years.

reports in 2013 noted that six in 10 visitors shirked the full $25 fee, many of whom were locals familiar with the then-recommended nature of the fee. (after the aforementioned lawsuits, the met settled upon slightly clearer language for its fee signage: suggested.) it's the unwitting out-of-towners who get yoked into chucking up the full price, the atlantic wrote, noting that third-party ticket websites ― like groupon ― didn't always communicate that fees were not mandatory.
6. your partner makes fun of your sex drive, or lack thereof.
this week, senator mitt romney (r-utah) called on king to step aside and for congress to make it very clear he has no place there. this was eight years after king ignorantly proclaimed that former president barack obama had a default mechanism in him that breaks down the side of race – on the side that favors the black person. mind you, in 2012, romney told an iowa crowd that king needs to be your congressman again. i want him as my partner in washington!
for the last two years, the president has had no oversight, no accountability from congress, rep. jerry nadler (d-n.y.), the new chairman of the house judiciary committee, said on cbs this morning on wednesday. we're going to provide that oversight. we're going to use the subpoena power if we have to.
labour's david lammy has accused theresa may of making the cruel and inhumane mistake of ending protections for longstanding residents that would have prevented windrush generation children being deported. the tottenham mp said may must take responsibility for the crisis, in which children who came to britain from the commonwealth decades ago have suddenly had their residency revoked. he said the removal of legal protections for those affected, passed under a labour government, was evidently a serious mistake with far-reaching consequences for thousands of people. the changes happened while may was home secretary.

i did not want a border wall and i was very, very upset that something that's so terribly discriminatory and racist, something i didn't even want or support, cost me my job. and the people who were making these decisions did not care that their squabbling with each other was having real-life consequences to working people like myself.

you can protect yourself by purchasing long-term disability insurance, which will help cover your income while you are incapacitated, so you can focus on getting better. to insure about 60 percent of your gross income, expect to pay around 2-3 percent of your gross income in annual premiums. think of this as protection against needing to pull out your investments early or dipping into savings you worked so hard to accumulate.

yet buildings account for about 70 percent of the city's emissions, creating a steep political challenge for a mayor who, to the chagrin of the progressive activists who helped elect him, spent much of his first term wooing real estate developers. in september, de blasio's rollout of a new set of mandates to cut emissions from big buildings faced blunt criticism from the new york city council, which accused the mayor of acting unilaterally and failing to go far enough with the proposed rules.
in its complaint, the adf maintains that doe was injured, aggressive and inebriated when she arrived at the center. the adf says doe was turned away for violating the center's policy requiring overnight guests to be sober, not because of her gender identity. the hope center reportedly paid for a cab that transported doe to the hospital for the night.
the idea of using proceeds from business wealth to secure the well-being of society at large is, however, a good one. instead of tying wealth to the speculative whims of the stock market, we might bind it directly to the productive activities of business. instead of having individuals save for retirement by purchasing stock, we could have companies that are turning a profit pay a special dividend into a public fund. we could even call it a tax.
deeply concerning are recent revelations about foreign influence in our democracy and political system, including suspicions around political donations from people with chinese backgrounds and allegations of a state-sponsored attempt to infiltrate the federal parliament using an australian citizen of chinese heritage to contest the 2019 federal election. though questions need to be asked and allegations assessed, not all chinese-australians should be painted with the same brush, and these cases should not be used as a catalyst to discourage chinese-australians participating in our democratic and public institutions.

while insisting the spread of the coronavirus in the u.s. wasn't his fault, trump turned to a common scapegoat: china. the president repeatedly referred to the coronavirus as china virus, kung flu and wuhan virus.
trump posted about the meeting on twitter, calling it a total waste of time. the democratic leaders had begun by stressing the need to reopen the government.
meeting someone new is always scary and exciting, but being unable to communicate as well as or in the ways you normally would makes it so much more intense. you soon begin to realize that every word has more meaning, every touch has more purpose. i gave javier my number and i left the bar wondering if we would ever speak again. our understanding of each other seemed too small or too difficult, but i couldn't shake the feeling that i had met someone who was meant to be in my life. and, sure enough, the next day he called and asked me out on a date. i hadn't stopped thinking about him from the moment i met him, so, of course, i agreed immediately.
but despite the above rules, which were enacted without public consultations and notified without public access to the published draft, the frequency of internet shutdowns have increased in the country mostly owing to lax oversight and few safeguards.

the concept behind block grants and similar proposals for medicaid is simple: instead of open-ended federal funding to cover whatever costs the state's medicaid beneficiaries require, the state gets a flat amount of money it must stretch over the year. and that amount is less than states get now.
federal law allows judges to order witnesses to be arrested and detained if the government can prove their testimony has extraordinary value for a criminal case and that they would be a flight risk and unlikely to respond to a subpoena. the statute generally requires those witnesses to be promptly released once they are deposed.

against this backdrop, add the delicate and often confusing issue of policy. in ontario, for example, the provincial government is facing hard lobbying from multiple sources -- chief among them the ontario home builders' association, ontario real estate association, and the building industry and land development association -- to, in short, make more land available on which to build lowrise homes. and to speed up the approvals process.

in addition to its usual base of elites, the counter-revolution in brazil could now count on winning at least some support from the pt's natural constituency. bolsonaro drew support from across the political and social spectrum, even from poor and black voters whom some of his most repressive policy goals will surely target. polls ahead of the election showed that bolsonaro led haddad among black and mixed-race voters and women ― and that he also earned a surprisingly large share of the vote from lgbtq brazilians ― despite his racism, sexism and homophobia.

giving big tax breaks for the wealthy
two runoffs tuesday in georgia will decide which party controls the senate and, thus, how far the new president can reach legislatively on issues such as the pandemic, health care, taxation, energy, and the environment. for a politician who sold himself to americans as an uniter and a seasoned legislative broker, the georgia elections will help determine whether he's able to live up to his billing.
the representative did not respond to further requests to elaborate on details of the interactions or what staff may have observed. the spokesperson said the do-not-disturb policy had not changed.
the political benefit of this simplicity is that it's easy to explain. the main policy benefit is that it would simplify billing, which means that hospitals, clinics and other providers wouldn't have to hire so many administrative staff. that would make health care less expensive.

in terms of military applications, china has also demonstrated significant skills. in 2007, it undertook an anti-satellite test, launching a ground-based missile to destroy a failed weather satellite. while successful, the test created a cloud of orbital debris that continues to threaten other satellites. the movie gravity illustrated the dangers space debris poses to both satellites and humans. in its 2018 report on the chinese military, the u.s. department of defense reported that china's military space program continues to mature rapidly.
the u.s. department of agriculture, which administers snap, did not respond to requests for comment. the agency has been mostly silent about what will happen to food assistance during a prolonged shutdown, except for a late december press release that only indicated it had funds for january's benefits. it's not clear what would happen in february if the government remains closed.
strategic communication laboratories and the company's political data analytics firm, cambridge analytica, were barred from the social media platform because the operation violated company policies by obtaining personal data from its customers, facebook said. the data was initially obtained by the developer of an app that promised to provide users with personality predictions.
historically, a key sign of democratic decline is when a country's armed forces become increasingly powerful and independent of its civilian leaders. the people elect those leaders to reflect society as a whole, not just soldiers; they are supposed to run the show. and a common feature in most failed states is that large numbers of military personnel are guided by personal ambition or extremist ideologies rather than the national interest and constitutionally enshrined values.
more likely is that he will govern in a manner similar to trump, targeting the press, political opponents and democratic institutions with a constant barrage of criticism that further erodes their credibility among his supporters and the public writ large, and has a chilling effect on legitimate opposition. bolsonaro refers to nearly everything to his political left as communism, and has said his movement is meant to keep foreign ideologies from making their way to brazil. rather than outright dictatorship, bolsonaro's reign could come to resemble the ugliest anti-left purge in american history.
noorani said the separation of more than 5,000 children from the parents at the border, which peaked in 2018, alienated voters from trump's policies, particularly conservatives and evangelicals. he believes a constantly shifting outlook for daca recipients also hurt trump among people who felt he was using them as political pawns.
while it's too soon for reliable nationwide data, the spike in domestic violence reports in a number of cities in the u.s. is concerning, said deborah vagins, president and ceo of the national network to end domestic violence. in new york state, the epicenter of the pandemic in the u.s., domestic violence calls to the police have risen by as much as 15 to 20% in recent weeks, according to state officials.

republicans made extensive use of the cra in the early days of the trump administration, after learning of a convenient loophole that let them review regulations and guidance that had been on the books for decades — as long as they hadn't technically been submitted to congress yet. they nixed 16 regulations, including one that had been finalized in 2013.
that, said longtime florida republican consultant mac stipanovich, was perhaps the most useful piece of trump's legacy: ruining the reputations of people who might otherwise have continued in public life with the extent of their moral bankruptcy still unknown, stipanovich said, offering as examples: bill barr, mike pompeo, lindsey graham.
that demoralizing message could be delivered by design. some legal experts suggest the rule may be borne of an extreme fear of misclassifying contractors as employees.
brady, who by then chaired ways and means, told cnbc in april 2016 that camp made tax reform inevitable, in the sense that he showed you could broaden the base and lower the rates and simplify the code and be competitive around the world. when an interviewer pointed out that camp's own party killed his legislation, brady replied, i don't think it got the oxygen it deserved at the time.
one example is the case of economic standstill in terms of growth. i have come to the realization that serious and deep innovative thinking in economic policy is needed to overcome the period of slow growth, as coined by willem buiter, chief economist of citigroup global. i believe the traditional ways of handling economic policy need to be revised. simply because, the known developed-world has been saturated and new ideas do not easily reach the decision-making top, thus there is greater rigidity to change. this is a rather oxymoron phenomenon, as the developed world gives the impression of being open and welcoming to new ideas...
bolton said the u.s. is insisting that its kurdish allies in syria are protected from any planned turkish offensive — a warning he was expected to deliver to turkey's president, recep tayyip erdogan, this week.
even with republicans out of legislative power, biden faces a potential crisis in the supreme court, which is due to rule later this year on a lawsuit challenging the aca's constitutionality. the republican officials who brought the suit base their argument on the fact that congress repealed the fines associated with the law's individual mandate in 2017 without repealing the mandate itself. biden and a democratic congress could fix that problem in multiple, simple ways by amending the aca and rendering the lawsuit moot.
sanders, who has served as an independent in congress — first in the house and now in the senate — since 1991, is now among the leading democratic candidates for president, second behind former vice president joe biden in national polls, and tied for first in iowa. he's raised more money than any other candidate in the democratic primary, with more individual contributions. his platform — which includes medicare for all, tuition-free college, and wealth redistribution through aggressive taxes on the richest americans — defines the party's progressive wing.
excellent teachers in most schools work to know and serve all students well. but even these teachers lack time and opportunities to share information about challenges (not to mention insights on how best to address them!). the system doesn't incent and support school employees to collaborate as a team in order to build a supportive culture around students' needs.
the draft plan, released monday by the u.n. convention on biological diversity, outlines a path for combating the biodiversity crisis that many scientists say is the start of earth's sixth mass extinction. the 2030 goals include safeguarding 30% of all land and sea, with at least 10% put under strict protection; combating the spread and introduction of invasive species; and cutting nutrient and plastic pollution by at least 50%.

but when i ventured out last monday, the first official day of lockdown, the city looked like a very different place. there's something very odd about seeing a bright blue sky and a completely empty city beach but it was the ghost-like streets that were even weirder. a few people were out running errands but the majority were wearing masks and gloves. at the big supermarket, i was met with a security guard monitoring the queue with a 'one in, one out' policy you're more used to seeing at some exclusive nightclub. i passed a pharmacy where medicine was handed to customers through a small hole in a screen.
all of the pro-democracy candidates in the unofficial primaries were arrested, according to tallies of the arrests being reported by the south china morning post, online platform now news and political groups.

forever 21 has long been synonymous with fast fashion. its affordable, trendy clothing is easily snatched up by the armload, making it ripe for impulse buying.
but what could happen if--instead of focusing on their individual autonomy in the classroom--teachers embraced and advocated for collective autonomy? what if teachers asked policymakers, district school boards, charter authorizers, and their unions to create laws and practices that encourage teams of teachers to collaboratively design and run schools?

that was it for hearings. after the house bill was introduced nov. 2, 2017, that chamber scheduled no hearings. in 1986, even after its tax reform bill was passed, the house scheduled two more hearings with 131 witnesses. in 2017 the senate didn't hold one hearing on the tax cuts and jobs act after it was introduced. in 1986, after the tax reform act went to the senate, that chamber held 12 hearings with 197 witnesses.
this boy band isn't your typical pop sensation.
and it connects seamlessly to another trump-style view: a deep skepticism of foreigners, particularly muslims. gabbard has voted to make it harder for refugees from iraq and syria to enter the u.s., courted indian prime minister narendra modi, despite his links to anti-muslim violence that killed hundreds, and spent years as a fox news darling for her willingness to claim president barack obama was making americans less safe by supporting arab rebels in syria and not using the phrase radical islam. (obama aides and many experts warn that language risks implying a problem inherent in a religion followed by 1.6 billion people; gabbard and trump argue the language is essential to explain the rise of groups like the islamic state.)
throughout all of these episodes, congressional republican leaders did nothing and continued to allow king to serve on the house judiciary committee, the committee that's responsible for immigration policy in america. so it's been interesting watching republicans, after all this time, pile on the anti-king bandwagon this week.
when they don't, the bottom line suffers.
in the last year, there's been a palpable shift as trump's behavior on social media has escalated. twitter's earliest action to curb his rhetoric came in the form of warning labels beneath certain tweets, which alerted followers if a tweet was factually inaccurate or violated rules against glorifying violence. facebook and instagram would later follow suit.
the public option would reimburse doctors, hospitals and other providers of health care at the rate that the federal medicare program uses, inslee said.
austin is not considered to have that kind of anti-democratic view of the military's role and is widely respected across party lines and the various branches of the u.s. armed forces. still, after four years under a president who treated soldiers as a personal base of political support, it's imperative for decision-makers and regular americans to seriously consider how to maintain a healthy balance for one of the country's most powerful institutions.
png can't send them back, but they don't have to give them a status that allows them to stay. when you're recognized as a refugee, you're allowed certain rights to education, work, social security and more. it's a big issue in refugee law worldwide, you won't get sent back but you don't have any status.
while devos' free lunch statement was a joke meant to make her right-wing audience chuckle and to highlight the price tag on government programs, her choice of words was very troubling to many parents, educators and child welfare advocates.

ottawa — u.s. president donald trump's decision to slap visa restrictions on six new countries could affect immigration flows to canada, if history is any indication, as those caught up in the changes find new reasons to come here.
but many of those same companies are laying off workers. and, in any event, the test of the tax cut's impact will be what it mean over the long term. in a survey of 42 top economists by the university of chicago's booth school of business, just one ― one! ― thought republican tax cuts would significantly improve growth.
the order says nothing about a 100-day moratorium on deportations that biden promised during the campaign. susan rice, who is tapped to run the white house domestic policy council, says any decision on moratoriums would come from homeland security.
automatic voter registration also went into effect in california last year, where it added 727,924 new voters to the rolls since its launch in april and updated the addresses of 269,365 people. (there were around 5.5 million eligible but unregistered voters in the state as of october.) the program also attracted scrutiny when it emerged the dmv made errors on thousands of voter registrations, including registering people who were ineligible to vote. the head of the dmv resigned and the agency imposed an additional level of review on the voter registrations it received.

but the policy wasn't just about prosecuting crime; it was about taking away kids as a way to prevent parents from coming to the u.s. the administration began considering it a means of deterring families from coming to the border as early as march 2017. the same month, then-homeland security secretary john kelly confirmed publicly that such a plan was under consideration, also noting the need for deterrence.
ken maley, a local historian, says that the repeal, though symbolic, was necessary. it is especially so for the students who would have been affected by it at one point.
reports of new ebola cases have been lower in the last couple of days, but ryan said that was most likely due to the absence of medical personnel, rather than any real turn in the outbreak. the last time there was an extended interruption to the ebola response ― this september in beni ― the number of cases surged dramatically afterward.
trump said thursday that he exempted the u.k. from the travel ban because he believes conservative prime minister boris johnson is doing a good job battling coronavirus. but several health experts disagree with trump's assessment.

surveys have also found that black msm lag behind whites in their awareness of prep and, at least by some accounts, their willingness to take it. in various real-world studies of prep among msm, adherence to the daily truvada regimen has been poorer among blacks than whites. by the end of one yearlong study of very high-risk 18- to 22-year-old msm, african-american participants had all but abandoned taking truvada.
but teachers shouldn't wait on policymakers to grant permission. instead, they should lead the way, and present the alternative. first order of business: publicly embracing collective autonomy (not just autonomy in my classroom) as a means to improved student learning as well as an attractive and robust teaching profession.
to that end, oakland launched the nation's first equity permit program earlier this year. it sets aside half of all medical and recreational marijuana business licenses for applications by individuals hit hardest by marijuana criminalization. in their research during the development of the program, oakland city council found that over the past two decades, the black community has been extraordinarily over-represented in marijuana-related arrests in the region. in 1998, up to 90 percent of marijuana arrests involved a black suspect. by comparison, just 3.9 percent of those arrested were white.
a significant number of aapi fraud victims do not tell anyone about the fraud, the researchers wrote. by not telling anyone, victims are left to suffer alone and likely without gaining any wisdom about what steps to take next to protect themselves in the future.

in a question-and-answer sheet on the new policy, guitar center says that going to an arbitrator is less costly, less formal, friendlier and faster than going through the courts. the document assures a fair and impartial process, and notes that guitar center will pick up the tab for the arbitration (though not for the employee's lawyer, if he or she chooses one). the company is clear that the agreement is mandatory:

there is no european-wide polling data on a political union, but it appears that the support for the eu is diminishing in its core. in a recent survey, 40 percent of finns wanted to leave the eu. also, only 53 percent of dutch are against a new referendum on the eu, which means that 47 percent are either for it or do not know their stand. for permanent income transfers, you would need to change the maastricht treaty and ratify it in each member country or to negotiate several bilateral agreements. there is only a very small likelihood that these would go through, for example, in finland and in the netherlands.
this isn't just an idle fixation on fashion, a legislative who-wore-it-best. these outfits were selected with evident attention to historical detail, cultural resonance and symbolism. ocasio-cortez and others have used historical detail as inspiration for sartorial choices to intentionally echo women who came before them, women who strove for power and attained it. it's a concrete manifestation of the way representation in the halls of power inspires future generations of leaders. women in power provide visible, compelling encouragement to other women. they are the evidence, our well-dressed and symbolically accessorized proof, that achieving power is possible.
i guess what i'm asking is more ... do you feel like you have more of a responsibility now, because of who you are, to bring up these topics because you have this huge platform and influence?

canada will need to win the support of at least 128 countries in the secret ballot at the un general assembly. champagne cited canada's contributions to the lima group on the venezuela crisis, its leadership of a dozen countries on an initiative to strengthen the world trade organization, its efforts to rid the world's oceans of plastic pollution and its leadership on championing media freedom.
after trump signed his order, thousands of people went to airports across the country to protest the ban, calling it discriminatory. the original ban was challenged repeatedly in federal court, but the supreme court ultimately upheld a tweaked version of the order in 2018.
in his opinion, furman wrote the way the trump administration added the question violated the federal statute, the administrative procedure act (apa). the law, furman wrote, requires agencies to carefully study an issue before it implements or changes a policy. the trump administration failed to do that in adding the citizenship question and the public rationale given by commerce secretary wilbur ross, who oversees the census bureau, furman said, was pretextual.
you may hear that your child must take the test because otherwise it will hurt the school or the classroom teacher. this is simply hostage taking. and it's important to remember that every year this continues, schools and teachers continue to pay a price― in time, in money, in the growth of a pervasive toxic test-driven atmosphere. this argument is a bully who says, if you don't let me beat this kid up, i will beat him up even more. in any bullying situation, the person to blame is not the victim the person that the bully uses as an excuse to bully. the problem is not that your child isn't taking the test― the problem is the state that is threatening to punish the school and teachers. deal with the real problem; don't enable it.
kelly laco, a justice department spokeswoman, said the trump administration acted within its legal authority.
even democratic national committee chairman tom perez, a former secretary of labor, released a statement saying he stands with the striking teachers fighting for the children they teach to have the resources they need to achieve and flourish.
i'm not afraid. i was not afraid last week for my own safety, but i have deep concerns that we will be attacked again. and i have voiced those concerns. our national security team is far more prepared for the next set of protests and possible violence and riots than they were on the sixth. so i'm grateful for that work and effort.
biden advisers had made it clear ahead of the inauguration that the incoming president intended to issue such an order immediately. the order covers the vast majority of federal student loans, but excludes some federally guaranteed loans that are held by a private lender.
trump's move, which led to the resignation of u.s. defense secretary jim mattis, has raised fears over clearing the way for a turkish assault on the kurdish fighters. turkey considers the syrian kurdish people's protection units, or ypg, a terrorist group linked to an insurgency within its own borders.

the other man beshear highlighted previously ran as a libertarian candidate for the state house and has in the past posted that any politician who supports the patriot act, a controversial federal law passed after the sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, is a traitor and a tyrant, and should be hanged.

ramirez filed a challenge to his detention in seattle federal court on monday, arguing that the government violated his constitutional rights because he had work authorization under the daca program, his lawsuit said.
part of why the procedures are expedited … is because the reconciliation bill was originally imagined to come between the adoption of the second budget resolution, on sept. 15 and the start of the new fiscal year, on oct. 1, molly reynolds, a senior fellow at the brookings institution, explained to huffpost.
on da silva's watch, expanded social welfare programs helped some 30 million brazilians rise out of poverty, and broader affirmative action policies increased educational, health and employment access for black brazilians, women, the poor and the indigenous. violent crime fell to its lowest levels in decades. when da silva left office in 2010, his approval ratings neared 90 percent. brazil, it seemed, was finally working.
that hasn't been enough for many of his critics, who accuse him of only half-heartedly campaigning for former secretary of state hillary clinton in 2016 after dragging out the primary, and question whether he would be willing to support down-ballot democratic candidates who don't share his progressive ideology.
while we recognize the inherent complexities around a postponement, nothing is more important than the health and safety of our athletes and the world community, the canadian committees said.
when the minister in charge of t-levels has said she wouldn't want her own children taking one up in their first year and the department's permanent secretary has publicly called for their delay, it is probably time for the government to take stock, she said.
farewell spit is a curved, narrow sand landform on the northwestern coast of the south island of new zealand: experts have described it as a whale trap. nearly 200 pilot whales beached themselves in the area two years ago, and many died.
the newsroom has basically become a large-scale intelligence operation to figure out what the fuck our managers are up to, one current employee explained. and though the newsroom did discover bits and pieces, upbin helped tie the whole thing together. staffers fear that tronc is building a shadow national newsroom — non-union, of course — that would duplicate not only parts of the l.a. times union staff but that of other tronc properties as well, making the union employees expendable. and, although tronc and l.a. times senior management — which includes d'vorkin, times president mickie rosen and ceo and publisher ross levinsohn, who is currently on a leave of absence following allegations of sexual harassment — have refused to offer any clarity about what this might mean, much less acknowledge the existence of a new national operation, you can only stonewall a roomful of reporters for so long before they start digging on their own.

rep. lucille roybal-allard, another democratic representative of the nation's second-largest city, encouraged the two sides in the strike to find common ground that accommodates students, their families and teachers.
the novel coronavirus pandemic tanked the stock market and sent jobless claims soaring to unprecedented levels this week, but did little to slow the white house's efforts to boost fossil fuel production and roll back environmental safeguards.
for generations, the federal government has invested more directly in the white middle class than in the black middle class. the mid-19th century homestead acts gave white americans access to western lands, many of which were expropriated from native american tribes, for minimal or no cost. the social security act of 1935 provided unemployment insurance and old-age pensions. and the servicemen's readjustment act of 1944 (commonly known as the gi bill) offered returning world war ii soldiers education benefits and low-interest mortgages. in each of these cases, the federal government either explicitly excluded black people or failed to intervene when racist state or private industry practices were carried out.

the perception of terrorist threats to the united states evolved as middle east conflicts intensified, and the movement for privacy reforms stalled. intelligence officials and prosecutors assailed companies that sought to satisfy consumer demand for encryption to secure their private communications and data. by enhancing privacy protection, the companies were accused of aiding criminals and terrorists with little evidence forthcoming from the government that encryption is frustrating criminal or terrorist investigations in any meaningful way.
being with javier has cost me more than i can explain. i have lost the respect of people i love because of his legal status. i have lost friendships simply because he is undocumented. i have had people i once considered friends threaten to get him deported after they'd had one too many drinks. my relationship with my father has been severely strained because he doubts javier's intentions and constantly questions his motives. we must keep many parts of our lives ― and our life together ― hidden for fear of what might happen if the wrong people learned about javier. in fact, our real names and any identifying characteristics had to be omitted from this article to protect us. we can't share photos of our family ― not even a single picture of our beautiful daughter ― because the risk of what could happen to us is too great.

buttigieg brought up the subject again later in the debate, focusing on the cost of medicare for all.
one can't forget that the majority of victims on that airline were iranian citizens and this is something that binds us together in our grief and i think the desire for answers from families who lost loved ones is fairly universal.

this is not exclusively a brazilian phenomenon. countries around the world, from hungary to turkey to the philippines, have turned to noisy leaders who promise instant renewals and silver-bullet solutions under the banner of a right-wing, nativist populism ― the preferred term of news outlets, even though the key constituencies backing these candidates tend to comprise the nations' elite.

sen. bernie sanders (i-vt.), who sponsored what some saw as an early version of the green new deal in 2012, backs the policy and is planning to introduce legislation on it this year. sen. jeff merkley (d-ore.) was among the first in the senate to endorse ocasio-cortez's select committee push. long shot richard ojeda, a populist democrat from west virginia's coal country who was the first to announce a bid for president, shortly after losing a house race in november, gave the green new deal his full-throated support.
for about a year, for example, utah lawmakers have discussed how to change state taxes, which have not been changed significantly since 2008. greg hughes, the republican speaker of the utah house, estimated the state stands to gain between $75 million and $150 million this year due to the federal tax changes, which has given the state's comprehensive overhaul effort new impetus.

in america, the differences between states have little to do with intrinsic factors like population density, weather or demographics and more to do with the political ideology driving their leaders' actions. the virus hit northeastern states early and unexpectedly, causing a steep wave of cases and deaths. since then, as the virus has settled into america's existing divides, it has spread most rapidly in states where governors were reluctant to impose mandatory controls or reopened their economies before suppressing the virus. of the 10 states with the highest current caseloads, seven have republican governors.

with regard to vaccine roll out, it seems like it's a mess.
there are far too many variables still in play to answer any of these questions. but while the push for free college in the u.s. may be a sexy political move, we need to think through intended and unintended consequences.
the egalitarian nature of newsom's scheme could avoid one of the pitfalls of paid leave: putting women at a disadvantage in the workplace. mothers wind up taking long workforce leaves, and fathers don't. under his plan, if parents want their child to have six months of care provided by a family member, fathers would theoretically have to step up. mothers still take the majority of leave in the state.
this past weekend, after 20 years of banishment, hekmatyar reappeared in eastern afghanistan in the province of laghman. early images and videos show a lineup of afghan men in military uniform and turban kissing hekmatyar's hands. whether it is a sign of allegiance to the returned warlord or a sign of respect to the so-called warrior of god, remains to be determined.
before being sworn in at the interior department on aug. 1, 2017, bernhardt, a colorado native, worked for eight years at the law firm brownstein hyatt farber schreck, where he lobbied on behalf of oil, gas, mining and agricultural interests. he also previously served as a top interior official under former president george w. bush, leading an attempt to open alaska's pristine arctic national wildlife refuge to oil and gas development. (last month the trump administration took a significant step toward its goal of allowing drilling in the refuge, which zinke said stands out among the most impactful interior accomplishments in terms of bolstering america's economic strength and security.)
she rationalized that if she left she would no longer be able to observe trump's actions. she hemmed and hawed for months before deciding to pay her dues for another year, leamer wrote in mar-a-lago: inside the gates of power at donald trump's presidential palace, a sneering portrait of palm beach culture.

shutdowns can also hurt the broader economy, as workers tighten their budgets due to missed paychecks and consumer confidence dampens. the bureau of economic analysis estimated that the 2013 shutdown of 16 days reduced gdp for the fourth quarter of that year by 0.3 percentage points.
there was never a policy vision for a trump administration, but he promised that his election would bring a glorious future for conservatives. but that's because he was not promising a presidential administration in any real sense. he promised a future in which he alone would make america great again by smashing the left, siccing security forces on latin american immigrants, black people and muslims, and protecting and glorifying his supporters.
o'rourke had won plaudits for taking the no fossil fuel money pledge administered by the watchdog group oil change usa, which bars politicians from accepting contributions over $200 from pacs, executives, or front groups of fossil fuel companies. in december the investigative news site sludge found that he accepted $430,000 from individuals working in the oil and gas industry, 75 percent of which came in the form of donations over $200. fossil fuel executives made at least 29 large donations.

couched once more in the prefatory mention of respect for all points of view, our prime minister proclaims, but there is no consensus, there is no sense of how to do this. and, quite frankly, a divisive referendum, an augmentation of extremist voices in this house is not what is in the best interests of canada.
however, with a massive number of her own mps against her, may's 'plan b' can't really be 'plan a-plus'. she has a nightmare balancing act now: offer labour mps too much and she risks further bleeding tory support; offer tory mps too much and the eu will never accept it.
the trump initiative would allow states to choose between receiving a block grant ― a flat dollar amount per year ― that increases slightly faster than medical price inflation or a per-capita cap based on the number of current medicaid enrollees that rises at the same rate as medical inflation. the per-capita cap option is less problematic than the block grants and offers states more financial leeway, but both would result in benefit and enrollment cuts, holahan said.
the politics have drastically changed since then, r.l. miller, the president of the political action committee climate hawks vote, said by email. sunrise is a grassroots-driven group, unlike some of the top-down green groups pushing waxman-markey, and they have both energy and moral clarity on their side.

in some cases, the pandemic appeared to be a factor in the killing. on march 30, a 38-year-old pennsylvania man who was upset over losing his job due to the crisis ambushed his girlfriend on the porch. i already talked to god and i have to do this, he allegedly told her, before shooting at her four times and then killing himself. one bullet hit her but she survived the homicide attempt.

3. remember that communication is a two-way street. many managers think that they're great communicators, not realizing that they're only communicating in one direction. some pride themselves on being approachable and easily accessible, yet they don't really hear the ideas that people share with them. some managers don't set goals or provide context for the things they ask people to do, and others never offer feedback, leaving people wondering if they're more likely to get promoted or fired.
the detrimental effects of asymmetric shocks can be mitigated by transferring funds from prosperous to declining member states. when the dollar union of the us threatened to fall apart during the great depression, federal government enacted federal income transfers from prosperous states to aid ailing ones. the federal budget also increased rapidly and, in practice, income transfers became permanent. the no bailout policy of crisis-hit states had already been enacted earlier.

anyone with the slightest understanding of the impasse in washington knows that what's going on is not a strike. a strike is a work stoppage initiated by workers. but in this case, some 380,000 federal employees are furloughed and another 420,000 are working without pay because congress and the white house have not funded their agencies.
the catastrophic make america great again myth came to fruition, and it played out on capitol hill. what it ultimately amounted to is not clear, but that is beside the point, as sorel argued when he defended the myth of the general strike and its utility for socialism.
now, there are others looking to bolsonaro. in uruguay, an upstart presidential candidate is already modeling himself as his country's version of bolsonaro; in argentina, which faces many of the same economic and corruption issues that have plagued brazil, similar candidates could soon emerge.

nor is barr the only ghost of fancy republicanism past to make his way into the trump administration. trump's supreme court nominees have all been members of the ultra-elite conservative federalist society. his labor secretary, eugene scalia, is the son of the late supreme court justice antonin scalia. his treasury secretary, steve mnuchin, is a goldman sachs alum. his former securities and exchange commission chairman, jay clayton, was a goldman lawyer. his commerce secretary, wilbur ross, was a private equity kingpin. his cia director turned secretary of state, mike pompeo, is a former businessman whose enterprise was backed by an investment from the koch brothers. his education secretary, betsy devos, is the billionaire ex-chair of the michigan republican party, and his vice president, mike pence, is a career conservative movement man who eventually became governor of indiana before joining the trump administration.

policymakers found common ground last year to make permanent critical improvements to the eitc and low-income part of the child tax credit that were scheduled to expire in 2017. this year, they should take up president obama and speaker ryan's proposals and fix the glaring hole in the eitc for childless workers.
that amounts to roughly half the previous lease sale, which took place last august, and marked the first time since region-wide sales began in 2017 that total bidding failed to surpass $100 million. it's a sign that oil prices are too low for anyone but industry behemoths to make offers, said an analyst for energy consultancy wood mackenzie.

similarly, the fall in the cost of cross-border transportation and international cost of telecommunications, which had contributed so much to trade, would also have met its limit. and they probably contribute modestly to the decline of global trade.
but there are a few things going on: because of systemic racism, black and hispanic women are concentrated in different occupations than white women, shierholz explained. and those occupations are the ones that got hit harder by shutdown measures — the restaurant industry, for example.
the reality is that nearly all hyperinflations stem from a collapse of foreign exchange as a result of having to pay debt service. that was what caused germany's hyperinflation in the 1920s, not domestic german spending. it is what caused the argentinean and other latin american hyperinflations in the 1980s, and chile's hyperinflation earlier.
then, one night, i found out that this mascot — and therefore the whole bushroot joke — was supposed to be a caricature of me. a guy from a different dorm was hanging out in brewster hall. when he saw me face to face, he blurted out those six fateful words: hey! it's bushroot! in the flesh!

while you are busy socking away funds in your retirement accounts, don't forget to set aside money for other big, upcoming expenses. someday you'd like to own a house, buy a new car, take a trip around the world or help put your kids through college. these major goals come with big price tags that may seem insurmountable, and they could put you in serious debt.
each group has its own concerns where disagreement could emerge — particularly on updating the budget process and the enactment of reforms solely in pursuit of the always-elusive bipartisanship. but there is strong agreement among these groups of varying ideology on many of the big issues, such as staff pay and retention, updating congressional technology, increasing congress' independent research capacity, devolving some power from congressional leadership to committees and individual members, and changing procedure to make it easier to bring legislation to the floor. that is where these groups believe the committee could make the quickest progress.
there is some psychology involved in insurance. most people don't want to feel they are wasting money, and there is no tangible reward for carrying insurance unless you use it. so it really comes down to this: is your peace of mind worth 50 cents a day? that's about what a policy will cost.

sure, much is riding on test-driven policies these days. but at some point administrators and leaders and parents and classroom teachers have to step up and stand for the needs of the students before all else. because if we aren't going to stand up for our students, what are we going to stand up for?
thiel attempted to spin taking trump seriously as meaning that his supporters heard his bombastic lies and racist jibes and thought about them in concrete policy terms. that was also wrong. trump's supporters were not taking his words either literally or seriously, they were taking them mythically. when trump entered the political fray in 2015, he gave the supporters of the conservative movement that came to dominate the republican party since the end of world war ii a political myth they could die for. and myths, for the believer, cannot be refuted.
that suggests she may have to rely on labour mps to get any deal through parliament.

sanders got to take the first swing at bloomberg: he went after bloomberg's record on police policy when he was new york mayor. namely, the stop-and-frisk policy, the directive to police to stop, question and search suspicious people that disproportionately targeted black and brown teenagers. it increased sevenfold under bloomberg's tenure from 2002 to 2013.

in california, public-sector labor unions joined with the chan-zuckerberg initiative in an effort to pass proposition 15, which would have closed a massive property tax loophole for big businesses. the ballot measure was a response to the unusual property tax system california adopted in 1978 tying property taxes to the property's value at the time of the sale, rather than a rolling system of tax assessment of the kind used in other states. as a result, many homeowners and big businesses like disneyland pay property taxes based on values assessed decades in the past, leading to major shortfalls for local services like schools and county hospitals. despite its progressive reputation, california ranks 42nd in the country in per-pupil education spending when adjusted for cost of living, according to the california budget and policy center, a liberal think tank.
the agony of male survivors stalks the halls of the schools we attended as children. it lurks in the locker rooms where we went to football camp. it haunts classrooms where after-school tutorials turned to abuse. it infests the margins of our memories, crowding out the boyhood joys of scouting, of learning or of sports with private pain. that old poison, sexual abuse, leads men and women to despair, depression, drinking and even early death.
as the list of arrestees grows, so does the evidence of how much firepower the mob brought with it. authorities had charged only about 50 of the hundreds who stormed the capitol on monday — but even that was enough to uncover incendiaries, half a dozen guns and the hoard of ammunition. other smuggled knives, tasers and brass knuckles, according to law enforcement, and countless rioters were photographed wielding clubs and batons.

much of the coverage of gabbard's announcement has focused on the number of foreign policy actions she's taken that have confounded or enraged members of her own party. she secretly met with syrian dictator bashar assad, courted india's right-wing prime minister narendra modi, voted with the gop to make it harder for syrian and iraqi refugees to come to the u.s., and met with president-elect donald trump shortly after the 2016 election amid rumors she was being considered for a job in his administration, which she denied. the news of her presidential run also brought renewed scrutiny to gabbard's early-career opposition to lgbtq equality, a position she now says she regrets.

the first is a global nuclear war involving the us and russia. in this scenario at least 1800 large warheads, or more likely over 3000, would be fired at nuclear weapon launch sites, command centres, ports, major industry, power stations and major centres of population. this is a large number of warheads and most cities, particularly state or regional capitals, would be struck by several nuclear weapons.
over the course of my life i can see how what i was taught in christian schooling has impacted me, and the riots on jan. 6 played into it. that whole belief system revolves around the idea that you want the rest of the world to think like you, said garman, who is now a social worker. it's a 'the ends justify the means' type of thing.

now that the phrase #metoo comes trippingly off the tongue, it could be easy to forget what those words actually signify. the hashtag is about not being alone. time and again, after an allegation of sexual harassment has been made against a powerful person or institution, others have stood up to say they have had similar experiences. publicity and numbers serve to protect individuals from retaliation.
jane sanders, who did not recall the exact circumstances of her husband's letter to jezer, said this shift came about when he was elected to the house as an independent. he knew that if democrats didn't let him into their caucus, he wouldn't be assigned to any committees and would be left out of the process altogether.

the dignity act insists that incarcerated women be viewed through a lens of trauma; for example, it bans cross-gender strip searches and other re-traumatizing security measures and mandates that inmates who menstruate receive sufficient feminine hygiene products. even though it hasn't been scheduled for a hearing, the dignity act has already had demonstrable impact: within a month of its introduction, the federal bureau of prisons issued a memo promising to provide adequate and free menstrual supplies. while the dignity act and all of its state-level progeny are revolutionary legislation and deserve a hearing and a yea vote, these laws do little to prevent the fact that the women it's trying to dignify probably shouldn't be incarcerated in the first place.

my analysis, however, is that my highest contribution — in these extraordinary times and circumstances where president trump is himself breaking all established precedents to serve very narrow and self-serving interests — is to stand up to declare that i profoundly disagree with his approach and his unacceptable behavior. his path is dangerous. his path is destructive. his path cannot be normalized. i will not normalize it. this is our own form of nonviolent resistance, a path advocated for by dr. martin luther king jr., whose birthday we just celebrated yesterday but whose lessons we must continue to incorporate.

congressman young, who's been in office for nearly a half century, is badly out of touch with the mood in his state. most alaskans favor the rule and object to these barbaric practices. a 2016 poll conducted by remington research group showed that alaska voters strongly support eliminating these cruel and unsporting practices used to kill bears and wolves on national wildlife refuges in their state. driving down grizzly bear and wolf numbers on refuges is a prescription for tamping down tourism and hurting gateway communities to national wildlife refuges that benefit immensely from visits from people throughout the world who hope to catch a glimpse of a wolf family or a mama bear with her cubs. wildlife watchers contribute over $2 billion to alaska's economy.

one of the country's most powerful labor unions is urging the incoming biden administration to quickly fire the general counsel of the national labor relations board, a potentially precedent-setting move that labor groups argue is necessary to protect worker rights.
brandon magner, a union-side attorney, recently wrote on his substack labor law lite that a president's ability to fire the nlrb general counsel appears clear. appointees to the five-member board can only be hooked for malfeasance or neglect of duty under the law, but no such stricture applies to the general counsel. saying the labor movement was in a crisis, magner concluded that biden shouldn't be able to stand having peter robb serve a second longer than necessary.

i don't see how showing the personal facebook page of an individual during a press conference doesn't raise the temperature. that is sowing violence, cooperrider said. when you take the d.c. riots ― when the media is completely disregarding these people's concerns, and not at least trying to address their concerns, and instead of calling them 'deplorables' and things like that, they're going to respond in that way.

so here i am, in all of my vulnerable glory. i am sharing the bushroot story to belatedly call out racism and cruelty but also to illustrate just how powerful white favoritism and, let's be honest, white supremacy can be in this society. by hiding the pain that i felt at syracuse and, more generally, by focusing so much time and energy throughout my life into trying to convince others and myself that i am just as white as they are, i have undoubtedly caused pain to myself and to those who look like me. i don't want to do that anymore. especially not to my son.

intense city-wide fires loft extensive high-altitude smoke clouds similar to a large volcanic eruption. these clouds block sunlight causing cooling. the latest climate models predict that the use of a few tens to a hundred of the smaller nuclear weapons in the regional india-pakistan scenario would cause severe frosts, reduced growing seasons, drought and famine lasting up to ten years across the entire northern hemisphere. a 1,800 us - russian warhead scenario would cause a long-lasting cold period with a peak average global cooling of 4°c, whilst a larger scale nuclear war with over 3000 warheads would cause average cooling of 8°c. this is greater than the average cooling of 5°c experienced during the last ice age, so this would be a severe nuclear winter lasting a decade.

these, it said, would be used to tailor the most persuasive possible message, acting on that voter's personality traits, hopes or fears. the firm has worked on campaigns in argentina, kenya, ghana, indonesia and thailand; the pentagon has used it to conduct surveys in iran and afghanistan. best of all, from the mercers' perspective, scl operated entirely outside the gop apparatus. (a source close to rebekah said she wanted a results-oriented consultant.) as rebekah saw it, scl would allow the mercers to control the data operation of any campaign they supported, giving the family enormous influence over messaging and strategy. for more stories that stay with you, subscribe to our newsletter. sign up and it would be rebekah who would actually carry out this plan. robert preferred to focus on his work at renaissance, often operating from his long island mansion, owl's nest. he wouldn't look under the hood, because that's not what he does, says bob perkins, one of caddell's associates who worked on the smith project. besides, rebekah was the political animal in the family. (her older sister jenji has practiced law; her younger sister heather sue is, like robert, a competitive poker player). this was a relatively new phenomenon. rebekah isn't known to have been particularly political earlier in adulthood, while gaining a master's degree in management science and engineering from stanford, or in early motherhood. (she has four children with her french-born husband, who became an investment banker at morgan stanley.)

the fact that prep is largely used by men older than 25 further limits truvada's power to prevent new infections among black msm, since 45 percent of new cases among black msm are in 13- to 24-year-olds, compared with just 16 percent among their white counterparts. prep is not even approved for those younger than 18, and recent research suggests that teen msm have trouble adhering to prep unless they are seen for monthly clinic visits, a considerable undertaking.

because, quite simply, you are liable and you don't want to be on the hook for legal or medical bills if someone injures themselves in your apartment. basic liability and medical payment coverage is standard in most renters insurance policies, which means when your cat leaves a gash on your soon-to-be-ex's face, you are covered. you are also covered when your friend slips and falls on your rug.

if the former chief steward of america's natural resources joining a blockchain investment firm wasn't odd enough, zinke ― the loyal soldier of trump's pro-fossil fuel energy dominance agenda for the last two years ― appears to have sold himself to cannon as a someone who understands the immediate threat of climate change and is anxious to see the world transition to clean energy.

but others argue republicans were going to do what they were going to do, no matter what official studies showed. i think, generally, the interest of the members of congress pushing for the bill was a tax cut that was fairly regressive, said lily batchelder, a former senate finance committee chief tax counsel and now a tax law professor at new york university. that's what they put forth, and i think that aligned with their views of what's best for the economy.

magerman, robert's former colleague at renaissance, recalls him saying, in front of coworkers, words to the effect that your value as a human being is equivalent to what you are paid. ... he said that, by definition, teachers are not worth much because they aren't paid much. his beliefs were well-known at the firm, according to magerman. but since robert was so averse to publicity, his ideology wasn't seen as a cause for concern. none of us ever thought he would get his views out, because he only talked to his cats, magerman told me. robert's middle daughter rebekah shares similar political beliefs, but she is also very articulate and, therefore, able to act as her father's mouthpiece.

in the test-centered school, there are remediation courses, but these are not remedial courses in the classic sense of trying to help students who are behind in their comprehension of content. these are test prep courses, in which students' time and attention is devoted to practicing the skills of test-taking. perhaps the school uses a program package so that students can work independently on computers, drilling multiple choice responses to test-style questions, over and over and over and over and over, day after day after day after day after mind-numbing day, until the students have been taught that english and/or math (because these remedial courses are never required in non-tested departments) are miserable disciplines filled with nothing but drudgery and boredom.

for example, the civil war wasn't about slavery. it was, instead, a war over three economic systems that were not able to function together. the south: labor-surplice economy, in which people were the currency. the north: an industrializing economy, in which money was the currency. the west:a natural resources economy, in which land was the currency. and the victory of north over south (i.e. the victory of industrialization over labor-surplice) put in motion all of the events that occurred for decades after.

that's very astonishing news because we worked hard to get to what we wanted to get, he said. i don't even feel like eating after that news.
according to two sources, one who strategized with the mercers and another who worked closely with trump, rebekah insisted on a 30-minute face-to-face meeting with trump, in which she informed him that his campaign was a disaster. (her family had pledged $2 million to the effort about a month earlier, so she felt comfortable being frank.) trump, who knew her slightly, was willing to listen. he had been disturbed by recent stories detailing disorganization in his campaign and alleging ties between trump's campaign manager, paul manafort, and pro-russia officials in ukraine. rebekah knew of this and arrived at her meeting with props, says the source who strategized with the mercers: printouts of news articles about manafort and russia that she brandished as evidence that he had to go. and she also had a solution in mind: trump should put bannon in charge of the campaign and hire the pollster kellyanne conway. [3] 3. conway had worked for the mercers' super pac. by the following morning, rebekah was breakfasting at trump's golf club in bedminster, new jersey, with the two people he trusts most, ivanka trump and jared kushner, to talk through the proposal in more detail. within four days, trump did exactly as rebekah had advised. manafort was out. bannon was in charge. trump also brought on david bossie, the president of citizens united, with whom the mercers and bannon had been close for years. less than four months later, mercer's handpicked team had pulled off one of the greatest upsets in american politics.
there is even interest in stronger antitrust oversight from republicans on the judiciary committee. rep. doug collins (r-ga.), the next ranking member on the committee, has taken umbrage at consolidation in the pharmacy benefit manager market. he introduced legislation to shine a light on the anti-competitive practices in the industry to uncover how they are driving up consumer costs for drugs.
in just the past year, inslee kiboshed two major fossil fuel projects and added new regulations on existing infrastructure. last january, he personally intervened to reject permits to build what would have been the nation's largest oil-by-rail facility at the port of vancouver. he signed a bill in march putting a new tax on pipelines, forcing the operators to fund a state program to protect against oil spills. in may, he blocked construction of a $680 million coal-export terminal on the columbia river.

indexing to remove the effects of inflation before capital gains are calculated would be an important reform if the government goes ahead with an increase in the capital gains inclusion rate. otherwise, it would lead to an unfair situation where people who have held property for a long time are taxed on illusory capital gains due to inflation. this is particularly significant when a person dies. at that time, the tax code deems all his property to have been sold, and capital gains tax has to be paid on it. this is a hazard for the middle class. the wealthy have access to tax planning tools such as trusts and estate freezes that help them avoid tax when they die.
early humans believed in gods that could become angry and that bestowed or withheld favors based on the deference they were shown by humans. humans needed to propitiate these gods, usually by sacrificing something valuable: depending on the culture, a prized heifer, a prisoner of war or one's own child.

there were the christian flags, like the ones she used to pledge allegiance to in school, waving alongside american flags. the rioters' rhetoric, focused around saving the country, defeating enemies and promoting the will of god, could have come straight out of one of her childhood classrooms, where she said she was taught a distorted version of history with nods to white christian supremacy. last week's insurrectionists could have been her classmates, her teachers, her pastors. she felt a wave of recognition as she watched the pictures on social media.
this doesn't necessarily tell us anything about the real world, so more cautious economic analysts like neil irwin at the new york times urge their readers to focus not on stock price swings, but on economic fundamentals ― things like employment, wages and interest rates ― in assessing the country's economic prospects. and if the stock market were, in fact, nothing more than a lightly regulated casino, this would be the end of the story.

the problem with pitching bolsonaro's rise to power as a purely populist revolt, though, is that the main source of his support was not the poor and working classes that had once fervently backed the workers' party, but the same elites bolsonaro constantly railed against, who have taken almost no responsibility for their role in creating the circumstances that made his ascent possible.
this is different from going to some sort of large public gathering with tens of thousands of people when there's a cluster of cases in an area, he pointed out. in that case, the potential for transmission would be higher due to the large number of people.
as a condition of applying for or accepting a job, many employers require employees to sign documents cutting off their rights to file lawsuits in court. these documents don't merit being called contracts because they are neither negotiated nor negotiable. rather, the forms state that the only route for any redress when problems arise is a closed arbitration through a private dispute resolution company picked by the employer. these documents specifically ban class-action lawsuits, turning all claimants into single-file applicants rather than allowing them to join with other similarly aggrieved individuals.

there are a few exceptions to the filibuster, including bills that go through the budget reconciliation process ― a special procedure that makes it possible to pass bills with a simple majority. but there are rules about what can and can't be in a reconciliation bill and democrats over the next two years will be limited to three such bills, at most.
instead they seek to crack down on the sort of nonviolent civil disobedience that has shaped much of our nation's greatest political and social victories. the legislation's similarities were no coincidence. as climate change projections grew more dire and the bloody 2016 fight to stop the dakota access pipeline became a new alamo cry for environmentalists, the fossil fuel industry's political allies began promoting state legislation to restrict protests. oklahoma passed the first legislation protecting pipelines as critical infrastructure in 2017. shortly after, the american legislative exchange council, the conservative policy shop funded by big business and right-wing billionaires, drafted a generic bill it called the critical infrastructure protection act.

most experts agree, however, that once a constitutional convention is called, the actions of the convention could not be limited in advance to any particular issue and the delegates would be able to consider any other constitutional amendments they wish to adopt. (amendments adopted by the convention would then go to the states for ratification.)

president-elect joe biden's advisers may simply be setting low expectations ― which, after four years of an administration that chronically overpromised, might not be the worst thing in the world. but the reality remains the same: getting back to normalcy in 2021 will require doing much, much more than the u.s. is doing now.
there are also societal attitudes that actively discourage men from seeking help or appearing vulnerable. sarosi links it to research that's found many men don't fight against climate change, or even adjust behaviour like eating plant-based diets, recycling, or using reusable bags, because they're worried that will come across as feminine.
graham on sunday pointed to the meddling of white house aides, saying trump initially wanted a cheaper proposal for the border wall following estimates that requested $18 billion for its construction.
trump's threat that the shutdown could go on for years rattled many workers unsure of how they'll cover their mortgage and car payments. the shutdown is a particularly raw deal for employees working under federal contracts, as they are not directly employed by the government and typically don't get backpay.
gov. phil murphy on thursday night signed legislation that would expedite the licensure procedures for out-of-state medical professionals applying for medical licenses to expand the medical workforce in the state. the legislation also expands residents' access to telemedical services in an effort to stop the spread of covid-19. at least 742 people in new jersey have tested positive for the virus, which includes nine deaths.
it's also well established that children who participate in early childhood education are almost three times more likely to go on to higher education. but without providing the six to 10 diapers they need each day, babies cannot participate in early childhood education programs. in most cases, parents who can't provide diapers are shut out of daycare options altogether, not only making it extremely difficult to provide a good start for their child early in life, but making it even harder to rejoin the workforce.
in the 2000s, rep. tom davis (r-va.) and rep. henry waxman (d-calif.) separately helmed the oversight committee and undertook serious investigations of the george w. bush administration ― often with bipartisan support. davis helped investigate the jack abramoff lobbying scandals, while waxman investigated the 2008 market crash and the lies that led the u.s. to invade iraq.

in order to offset the cost of those new subsidies, newsom wants to reinstate the financial penalty for people who do not have insurance ― a penalty that was part of the affordable care act until congressional republicans and trump eliminated it, effective this year. this would make california the fourth state to adopt an individual mandate with a penalty; massachusetts, new jersey and vermont already have such a policy in law.
democrats may be more readily willing to spike a new rule from the trump administration that allows religious institutions that take federal contracts to make hiring decisions based on faith. the labor department finalized that regulation in december. while the administration claimed the rule encourages the full and equal participation of religious organizations as federal contractors, groups like the american civil liberties union said it amounts to a license for employers to discriminate.
reward sharif general sharif is indeed very popular in pakistan. his decision to unleash a military operation against the pakistani taliban is probably the main reason for his popularity among the masses. the tipping point for the pakistani army came on december 16, 2014 when the tehrik-i-taliban pakistan (ttp) killed 148 people, mostly school children, in an unprecedented attack on peshawar's army public school. the mass killing of children galvanized public support for a decisive action against the taliban. it has not been a flawless operation but it did inflict serious damages on the taliban infrastructure. whatever shortcomings the army experienced during this time were immediately compensated with a sophisticated media campaign. general sharif has had master publicists and media strategists who have helped popularize his brand. his has been a brand of a general who had said good-bye to the pakistani army's old policy of supporting the jihadis. thus, the pakistanis who are convinced that general sharif has actually defeated the taliban believe he should be rewarded with an extension so that the country benefits from his leadership and the successes achieved under his leadership are preserved and furthered.

in a press release tuesday, fda commissioner scott gottlieb sought to reinforce a november public health advisory in which he claimed there was clear data on the increasing harms associated with kratom. at the time, the fda said it was aware of 36 deaths involving kratom, which it held up as evidence of the gravest of the drug's potential harms. the fda has found eight additional cases since then, gottlieb said tuesday, bringing the total number of kratom-associated deaths to 44. he also announced the agency had conducted a novel scientific analysis of kratom that further supports the fda's characterization of the substance as an opioid.

the wave of legislation came as the united states became the epicenter of covid-19, the rapidly spreading respiratory disease caused by the novel coronavirus. by friday, the u.s. death toll topped 1,000, with more than 100,000 confirmed cases, overwhelming hospitals and forcing doctors to publicly beg for basic medical supplies. the economic fallout exceeded even the worst expectations: 3.3 million americans filed jobless claims this week ― topping both goldman sachs' 2.25 million forecast from last week and smashing the previous one-week record of 695,000 reported job losses. yet, as experts blamed the white house's back-footed response for inflaming the crisis, the trump administration appeared to ramp up its environmental agenda, ordering the environmental protection agency's enforcement division to temporarily stop policing polluters, approving a slate of mining projects, auctioning off new drilling leases and reviving a dormant fight over auto emission standards. the efforts on both the state and federal level offered jarring real-time examples of what the author naomi klein dubbed the shock doctrine: the phenomenon wherein polluters and their government allies push through unpopular policy changes under the smokescreen of a public emergency. while we are all paying attention to covid-19 and the congressional stimulus packages, state legislatures are quietly passing fossil-fuel-backed anti-protest laws, connor gibson, the researcher at greenpeace usa who tipped huffpost off to the bills' passage, said by email friday. these laws do nothing new to protect communities.

states, cities and tribal nations across the country are facing massive budget shortfalls due to the economic fallout of the covid-19 pandemic, which has emptied public coffers through a combination of depleted tax revenues and surges in emergency spending.
some of these came to visible fruition 10 years later during desert storm, which reversed saddam hussein's occupation of kuwait, he wrote. the carter administration initiated and developed these programs, the reagan administration paid for their acquisition in many cases, and the george h.w. bush administration employed them.
last month the nation watched, transfixed, as more than a hundred women stood before a michigan courtroom to describe how larry nassar altered their lives with his abuse. they were heard and heeded. the judge listened, the media listened, the world listened, and those girls and women were told that their suffering mattered. many women who are sexually abused get their day in court, but on a different side of the judge ― when they're defendants in a criminal case. and their abuse, it seems, counts for little.
the feistiest debate of the 2020 presidential election cycle came three days before the nevada caucuses, and it's understandable why. the first two contests of the primary race, in iowa and new hampshire, were a wash. and in two weeks, a third of all the delegates in the democratic primary will be decided in one day, likely sealing the fate of most of the candidates in the race.
the department of corrections responded monday afternoon by lifting the ban on the book at all state institutions, and said it would review the department's policy on prohibiting books. the department noted in a statement that the new jim crow has been used a teaching tool in a college-level course for inmates.

i don't think there will be another opportunity to work with republicans if he doesn't get this right. michael steel, former spokesperson for former house speaker john boehner
my eyes are rolling so far back in my head i can see the guy at the table behind me pretending to write a script at starbucks, and all i can think is why the hell didn't i come up with this first? (the same thought i had upon glancing for the first time at the cover of chicken soup for the soul, a favorite of my dear aunt grace who also collected wizard of oz franklin mint plates and shirley temple memorabilia.)
the euro crisis quickly developed into a european political crisis. today, debtor countries lament their loss of sovereignty and, in healthier nations, support for european solutions has rapidly diminished.
the ex-adviser concedes that in her desire to replace rutnam, seen by some in whitehall as a nightmare who unnecessarily blocks stuff, patel was probably on the right side of the argument but was going about it the wrong way with her briefing campaign. in her defence i have not heard a single good thing about rutnam from a variety of people – from other ministers who worked at the department who are measured individuals. spads [special advisers] think he's a complete arsehole and quite vindictive, they say. but with rutnam now out of the picture, patel's former chief of staff james starkie believes boris johnson, who launched a full-throated public defence of the home secretary at prime minister's questions on wednesday, and his aide dominic cummings will not want to lose her.
lyons alleges that her position as the title ix coordinator left her incredibly vulnerable on campus, and she left at the behest of the baylor police department, who believed she was no longer safe on campus given her involvement in investigating the instances of sexual violence. lyons has also filed a complaint against the university.
i personally felt insulted and unheard, as none of those who had sent me the link had taken time to ask me what my experience had been like as a queer mormon, carlston said. admittedly, the experience at the time was a bit humiliating. i had never found myself to be a lightning rod for folks to unleash their evangelizing before. it showed me a bit of what would lie ahead for me in the church: people who were uninformed or unconcerned about the realities and direness of the queer mormon experience.
calling garcia a good friend and progressive champion, the alderman invited his supporters to endorse garcia as well.
because my faith is an integral part of my lifestyle, it has to reflect in most things i do, which in turn is manifesting in hijarbie, adam wrote.
the rule had been put into effect in 1906, during an era of growing anti-asian sentiment. and though it's survived through the years, the rule hasn't been observed for some time. the board, whose district is made up of more than 40 percent asian students, claims the vote was more of a symbolic one.
biden will have a much, much easier time getting his judicial nominees confirmed with sen. dick durbin (d-ill.) leading the senate judiciary committee than he would have with sen. lindsey graham (r-s.c.) at the helm. since trump and mcconnell filled almost every open judicial seat that republicans had prevented obama from filling, biden will have to rely on older judges to retire quickly if he is to put his stamp on the federal judiciary.
in an interview with huffpost, inslee, 67, said he added his name to the list of more than 1,300 politicians across the united states who took the no fossil fuel money pledge.
in the last 25 years, the government accountability office has shed 2,000 employees. the congressional research service is down 100. the office of technology assessment and its 150 experts were entirely eliminated in 1995 — two years after the invention of the world wide web. house congressional committees have shed around 700 staff over the same period of time, while the house overall has seen a slight decline in staff. this underfunding has also left congress to deal with an antiquated technology system and no team of experts to update and innovate. this capacity decline occurred as the u.s. population rose by 80 million.
the total number of cases in italy also rose to 41,035 from a previous 35,713, up 14.9%, a faster rate of growth than seen over the last three days, huffpost italy reported (in italian). of those originally infected, 4,440 had fully recovered compared to 4,025 the day before. there were 2,498 people in intensive care against a previous 2,257.
we continue to hear the same rhetoric for his entire presidency -- that he detests the citizens united decision, that it's incredibly harmful to the country, and yet he's done nothing, rootstrikers campaign manager kurt walters said. if he does not issue the executive order and continues to give the same empty rhetoric it will be a slap in the face to the millions of americans he made promises to.

we're bringing the fight against climate change straight to the fossil fuel companies that knew about its effects and intentionally misled the public to protect their profits, de blasio said in a statement ahead of wednesday's press conference. as climate change continues to worsen, it's up to the fossil fuel companies whose greed put us in this position to shoulder the cost of making new york safer and more resilient.

in response, city lawyers have asked gleason to refrain from making a decision about the case until the equal rights commission concludes its investigation of the hope center. the charity has reportedly refused to provide information about its public funding, which would help determine whether it is a place of public accommodation that could be required to follow the anti-discrimination law, the city stated in court documents.

political violence is already shockingly common in brazil: in 2018, rio de janeiro city councilwoman marielle franco was assassinated while leaving an event, and 28 candidates were killed during 2016 election cycle alone. bolsonaro's insistence that his supporters take aim at workers' party politicians could have deadly consequences.
biden's plan to change the vaccine distribution plan was first reported by cnn.
it's clear the games can't be held in july. our athletes have been magnificent in their positive attitude to training and preparing, but the stress and uncertainty has been extremely challenging for them, ian chesterman, australia's chef de mission for tokyo, said in a statement. the timing will allow athletes from around the world to properly prepare with the hope the coronavirus crisis will be under control.

other speech codes comprise broad and vague restrictions on expression that practically anyone could be found guilty of violating. take the university of west alabama's prohibition on harsh text messages or emails, which is in force, or both the university of connecticut and drexel university's now-defunct prohibitions on inappropriately directed laughter.

it's just so critically important to keep everybody in mind, simpson said. this is not a time to be distinguishing between individuals who are documented and undocumented. this is a health emergency, which immigration status should play be no factor in this at all.
do you like white women? because we have a lot of them at baylor and they love football players, coach briles' son, assistant coach kendal briles, is reported to have said on a high school recruiting trip in dallas. (his coaching career has continued to flourish. it was announced in december 2016 that he'd taken a coaching position at florida atlantic university.)
bolsonaro and his choice to head the education ministry, ricardo vélez rodríguez, are supporters of the escolas sem partido (schools without party) movement, a previously fringe effort to prevent public schools and universities from indoctrinating students with leftist political ideologies. there were reports in the days after the election that some universities had been raided to rid them of books on fascism, and that professors and other academics who opposed the new president and had described him as a fascist were targeted and harassed.
although americans would not necessarily agree on the cause of congress' dysfunction, they are united in their loathing for the institution. in the latest round of gallup polling, approval for congress was just 15%. a whopping 82% of americans disapprove of the body's job performance.
andrew cooperrider, a bar and restaurant owner who was among the petition filers, noted that other beshear orders had been struck down in court. it is not actually up for debate over whether or not he has made unconstitutional mandates, cooperrider said wednesday. what's up for debate is whether or not he should be impeached for doing that.

outside of their demands for bigger unemployment benefits in coronavirus relief legislation, democrats have not said much lately about expanding or improving programs for poor people. they've mostly played defense against trump and congressional republicans' attempts to cut food and disability benefits, policies that will be relatively easy for them to reverse.
california's existing program, started more than a decade ago, is relatively cheap. workers in the state pay a 1 percent payroll tax on wages of up $115,000 to fund the program. and the fund is currently running a surplus, newsom said thursday. one way to pay for an expansion would be to tap into that surplus. he also mentioned raising the payroll tax as an option or raising the income limit so those earning more than the current taxable ceiling would contribute more.
you can see the difference in how students experience these schools--and in the meetings where teachers determine their collective strategy for improving teaching and learning. you can hear it too. teachers on these teams don't talk about my classroom. they talk about our school and our students and changing our profession. they make a point to communicate about students' individual needs and to implement solutions together. the work of teaching isn't contained to their individual classrooms but extends across the learning experience.
what is general sharif going to do with so much popularity after he retires? there are speculations that he might join politics after retirement. that's not a smart choice. if the general's advisers are thinking that he has a bright future in politics, they are grossly mistaken. generals and judges are powerful as long as they are in office. when they retire and jump in politics, they do not become overnight revolutionaries. general sharif should take a leaf out of general musharraf's book who founded his own party soon after retirement hoping that he would become a political game changer but his one-man party could not even get him elected in the parliament. musharraf was followed by the former chief justice iftikhar muhammad chaudhry, also once a popular public figure. chaudhry has launched his own party but nobody even knows what his party is called because he does not have enough followers.
salaries for hundreds of top government executives have been frozen since 2013, when congress enacted a pay freeze amid debate surrounding the fiscal cliff bill.
the alliance between these cufflinkers and the catastrophists has proved overwhelmingly successful for the conservative elite. mcconnell has reshaped the federal judiciary, with three supreme court justices and well over 200 other lifetime appointments. ryan was so satisfied with the trump tax bill's offerings for the rich that he retired in glory, his life's work at last accomplished. former trump chief of staff mick mulvaney resigned as special envoy to northern ireland in ostensible protest wednesday night, having taken advantage of his previous post to gut the consumer financial protection bureau. cotton has been correctly denouncing republicans who bought into trump's conspiracy theories about the 2020 election, but only after he got trump to rip up president barack obama's diplomatic detente with iran and move the u.s. embassy in israel from tel aviv to jerusalem, a longstanding goal of both the ultranationalist right in israel and the apocalyptic evangelical christian fringe in the united states.

the impact of the ban has been chilling. for years, thousands of families have been separated. married couples were unable to reunite and parents missed the births of their children. students could not attend college and people could not receive medical treatment in the u.s. one study found that women from travel ban countries were more likely to give birth prematurely.
another woman, who was not identified, told the broadcaster that she too had been at the club that night and had been groped by giske. the woman claimed the then-minister had grabbed her buttocks while she danced with her husband.
refusing to serve a woman and forcing her to travel to an alternate pharmacy for her medication is discrimination, no matter how conveniently located the alternate pharmacy may be. in addition to the significant inconvenience of having to travel to another location, m.s.

ice officers took mr ramirez into custody based on his admitted gang affiliation and risk to public safety.
if i go back to canada, where would i go? he asked. going back to china at this time is impractical, since there are heavy restrictions in place.
it would definitely become harder. the americans are approaching india with the attitude that if you are not going to do this deal now then wait till president trump gets re-elected. the americans are saying that then you will be forced to deal with us again and you may not get the terms that we are offering you currently. you can expect trump to get a little harsher and unconstrained on trade because he is not going to have the pressures of re-election.

the devastating impact of homelessness has been laid bare by members of a house of commons committee. mps on parliament's public accounts committee have accused the government of being unacceptably complacent after an investigation revealed as many as 9,100 people are sleeping rough on the streets of the uk every night. more than 78,000 households, including over 120,000 children, are classed as homeless and housed in often substandard temporary accommodation. labour mp and committee chair meg hillier said: the latest official figures hammer home the shameful state of homelessness in england and the abject failure of the government's approach to addressing the misery suffered by many thousands of families and individuals. as we approach christmas there are thousands of children in temporary accommodation – a salutary reminder of the human cost of policy failure. the evidence we heard from organisations that work with homeless people should serve as a wake-up call;government decisions are not made in a vacuum and the consequences can be severe.
that's a more modest increase than top congressional democrats are currently demanding. sen. ron wyden (d-ore.), who will be the chairman of the senate finance committee once democrats take control of the senate, and was instrumental in writing the original $600 unemployment insurance program in march, said he intends on pushing a return to that original benefit.
8 ways to boost your income in retirement
the indian government announced on monday that no domestic passenger flight will operate in the country starting wednesday. international flights have already been banned for a week, and the indian railways, often described as the country's lifeline, have also stopped all train services until march 31. many states have also announced strict measures to limit movement within and between their borders. the central government has asked states to strictly enforce the lockdown and take legal action against violations. as of monday, india has 415 active cases of covid-19, and eight people have died so far.
it shows all of us that she understands iowa is a lot more than just des moines, he said. and he anticipated voters would be ready for warren's message. after a couple of years of trump, we're ready to just say what we believe.
these christians instead choose to play god vying for the position of arbiter of whose life is worthy of protecting. this is antithetical to christian values of grace, love, kindness, gentleness and caring for those on the margins. in this political environment, it has become clear over and over again that a few lives of people considered unworthy are worth sacrificing for the moral control and power that oppressing them brings to powerful christians.
with the start of the new year and the thoughts of the money you'll spend making it memorable, you may find yourself thinking of ways to earn extra cash or income. possibly another part time job, perhaps a freelancing stunt. you might even be thinking about renting your home out on a short-term basis using airbnb, especially if you'll be away for the holidays. that seems like an easy way to get quick cash without really doing so much work, especially with the rising popularity of holiday rentals.
he continued, bizarrely: all of a sudden, 'well, maybe i'm going to hang on to that old clunker for another five years because i can't afford another new home because the government's taking a bigger portion of my income every year.'
she said it would take a while to convince both young people and their parents and added: parents are naturally and understandably cautious.
the challenge is how to scale it and make it sustainable, anthony leiserowitz, the director of the yale program on climate change communication, said of the upcoming sunrise movement tour. one-off rallies in a few cities, for example, might generate a little press and get some temporary action, but the effects are unlikely to last or build sustained support for the policy or, i would argue, build the deeper political power of the climate movement.

the canadian broadcasting corporation first reported sunday night that the biden transition team may move to cancel the permit for the oil project via executive action, potentially on his first day in office. sources told the outlet the biden team had drafted an internal planning document with a slate of early executive actions meant to reverse environmental policies from the trump era. canada's ctv and reuters later confirmed the cbc's reporting.
one reason is that the pfizer and moderna shots, which are the two currently available in the u.s., require two doses. state and federal officials were holding back half the supply in order to make sure that everybody who got a first dose would also get a second one on the prescribed schedule. (that's three weeks later for pfizer's, four weeks later for moderna's.)

kardashian's move is important in helping spread a culture of body positivity. in 2015 women around the globe campaigned against the plus-size label with the hashtag #droptheplus, encouraging brands and magazines to get rid of the term they say separates rather than unifies women.
that makes the prospects for passing democracy reforms, another top progressive priority, seem bleak. democracy reform refers to political process changes ranging from the adoption of public campaign financing and an end to partisan gerrymandering, which house democrats have already approved, to more ambitious goals like bestowing statehood on the district of columbia and puerto rico.
the sight of aussies and tourists defying the strict advice on social distancing jolted fury from many online, with some comparing the sydney images to empty pictures of new york city and los angeles, which are in lockdown.
soon, congress — where the gop controlled the senate and the democrats owned the house — was abuzz with hearings on taxation. seventy-one hearings were held in 1985, by 13 different committees, including house banking, small business, public works, and senate energy, and labor. some went on for three, four or five days, and some were held far from the capitol — in oklahoma city, cincinnati, or south bend, indiana, for example. the witness lists were exhaustive: two or three dozen witnesses per hearing were not unusual.
cbs news fired political director steve chaggaris on wednesday after allegations of what the network called inappropriate behavior.
the first week was really difficult. the situation escalated very fast and as all upcoming plans fell through – including a visit from my parents and an upcoming holiday to colombia – i struggled to look forward to a completely clear diary. i read the news obsessively in an attempt to understand what the hell was going on and when on earth it would end. the thought of staying in my flat for the foreseeable felt incredibly claustrophobic. and while drinking wine in my pyjamas was fun at first, the novelty of christmas in march quickly wore off.
robert e. roush, a professor of geriatrics at baylor college of medicine, told huffpost in an email that he didn't know why the majority of aapi individuals felt confident about identifying fraud when only a minority passed the test ― but he did warn that other factors, including dementia or head injuries, could have affected some of the participants' answers. roush was not involved in aarp's study.
it is impossible what is happening over here, navalny said in video from the improvised court room, posted on his page in the messaging app telegram. it is lawlessness of the highest degree.
the wins for raphael warnock and jon ossoff unlock much more hope that the biden administration might not just undo some of the worst actions taken in the trump era, but actually push progressive reforms over the finish line.
so what does that mean for your taxes? as you might have guessed, it's not great news.
in response, trudeau launched into a passionate defense of canada's extraordinary diversity, saying that its welcoming stance towards refugees is one of the things that has made canada great.
navalny has been a thorn in the kremlin's side for a decade, unusually durable in an opposition movement often demoralized by repression. russian authorities have launched multiple criminal investigations against him, and he has been tried and convicted in two separate criminal cases widely seen as politically motivated.
we are in a similar situation today with more modern technology. under current supreme court doctrine, formulated in 1979, there is no fourth amendment protection for private communications data, such as email, because users expose that information to third-party service providers like gmail or microsoft. and some courts have applied this logic to cell phone location data, which users must reveal to phone companies. nonetheless, that doctrine is nearing its 40th birthday, and it is possible that the court will have another telephone moment in the not-too-distant future.

her announcement on monday that she is launching an exploratory committee for a presidential bid confirmed she is at least hopeful, if not confident, that the outcry from native americans will be buried, be ignored or simply go away. it's an ugly political calculation. at a press conference in front of her boston home, when challenged on the dna test decision, she shrugged it off.
a pipeline at the centre of a conflict between hereditary chiefs and a natural gas company in northern british columbia is creating jobs for indigenous people and lifting communities from poverty, says an elected chief of a band that supports the project.
she has had ample opportunity to make her mistake of falsely claiming to be cherokee ― both as a law professor and, more awkwardly, as a cookbook plagiarist ― a minor issue in 2020. yet her hardheadedness has only worsened the initial offense.
curtis smith, a shell spokesman, told the associated press that the company believes climate change is a complex societal challenge that should be addressed through sound government policy and cultural change to drive low-carbon choices for businesses and consumers, not by the courts.
the economic setbacks have left kim with nothing to show for his ambitious diplomacy with president donald trump, which derailed over disagreements about sanctions relief in exchange for north korean denuclearization steps, and pushed kim to what is clearly the toughest moment of his nine-year rule.
when your partner is starting to feel like a 'best friend' that you want to gossip on the couch with after a long day at work instead of connecting in a sensual and intimate way, it's time to create some space for being lovers and bring erotic energy into your connection together. flirt, make eye contact, use body language to feel sexy and sensual. move your body and be intentional about turning your partner on. instead of turning to your partner and saying, 'do you want to have sex?' at the end of the night, work on creating anticipation, hints outside of the bedroom, texting and communication that show you are interested in being connected and intimate together. ― chavez
as members of the hollywood elite rose in solidarity at the golden globes on sunday in protest of sexual harassment, the other side of the pond was also feeling the effects of the #metoo movement.
besides now getting to use the excellent pun of referring to these mps as the buffalo wing of the conservative party — and developing a hankering for blue cheese dressing along the way — this document reignited debate about western alienation, conversations that followed last fall's election after the ruling liberals didn't win a single seat in alberta or saskatchewan.

shoes, vinyl records, stuffed animals, carhartt overalls and novelty pint glasses are all items that i've seen picked up for next to nothing at garage sales, and sold at a profit on ebay, says minnesota financial advisor jamie pomeroy of financial gusto. after a while, you'll get a better feel for the hot selling items on ebay, and will be able to spot those at garage sales a mile away.
the automation trend has continued, medlock said. so when production grew again from 2017 to 2019, that growth didn't require a lot of additional labor input.

the speech outlined champagne's priorities on foreign policy in an increasingly volatile world. champagne also elaborated on canada's campaign to win a two-year seat on the powerful united nations security council, citing the need to strengthen the international institutions that were born out of the second world war as one the main reasons for running.
and after 21 minutes, the meeting was adjourned, with little or no comment from the other board members.

ben packer, a lawyer at linklaters who has advised technology companies, said the proposals showed britain was committed to implementing one of the most ambitious regulatory frameworks yet, which would have a significant impact on tech giants.
reducing food waste offers a significant opportunity to impact the economy and environment. we spend $218 billion to produce, process, transport, and then dispose of 62.5 million tons of food each year. wasted food eats up 20% of our nation's freshwater, cropland, and fertilizer before ending up in the landfill, where it adds 113 million tons of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere annually. at the same time, one in seven americans are food insecure. much of the food we currently waste is still safe, edible, and nutritious, and redistributing just 30% of this food could feed every food insecure american.
this could indeed be evidence for the beginning of globalisation going in reverse. the globalisation of trade means that countries trade more and more with each other, and that trade between them increases faster than their national production.

the idea of creating a single national health insurance program for all americans has been a big topic of political conversation since 2016, when sen. bernie sanders (i-vt.) touted it during his democratic presidential campaign. but medicare for all couldn't be anything more than a rallying cry as long as republicans controlled the levers of power in washington.
look, the whole world has this, except for the united states, said ruth milkman, a sociology professor at the graduate center of the city university of new york and a co-author of a book analyzing california's leave policy. this is not some utopian proposal. in the u.s. it would be a breakthrough.

stricker, who is 37 and works as a hotel manager, went to vote with his wife when the polls opened on nov. 4. by that time he had gotten his permanent driver's license, but when he went to sign in at the polls, they told him his name wasn't on the list. he thought it was a mistake, maybe because he had registered at the last minute, and he asked to speak with the person in charge to try and figure out what the problem was. eventually he was given a provisional ballot, but instead of getting a private booth to fill out his ballot like everyone else, he was sent to a white plastic table, where everyone could see how he was marking his votes. he could see who the person next to him was voting for, and he was pretty sure she could see who he was voting for. he said he felt humiliated.

the trump administration has also accorded india with the strategic trade authorization - 1 status. india is now the only third asian country after japan and south korea to have that designation for arms export. there is a commitment not only to continue on that legacy but also build on it by making it easier for future administrations to sell more and engage in indian capacity building.

first, he misrepresented the way u.s. allies are addressing washington's frustrations with their failure to meet expectations on defense spending for members of the nato alliance, a top issue for him but also a priority for predecessors like obama. other countries have raised more than $400 billion already, he claimed ― a lie dale called out by noting that, per nato secretary general jens stoltenberg, those countries will be paying that amount by 2024.
and while it might not be noticed at first glance, proper arguing has a moral component to it: one shouldn't convince people with tricks of language.

sanders' consistency on medicare for all ― he would introduce it right away rather than three years into his presidency ― as well as his support for a moratorium on the deportation of undocumented immigrants were key to getting cpd action's blessing, according to salgado.
the state's marijuana industry already has a projected value of $7 billion, and, as more marijuana retailers obtain permits, state and local governments are expected to collect $1 billion annually in tax revenue. with such an enormous marketplace, california should prioritize access for those who had been targeted by anti-marijuana laws, erik altieri, executive director of marijuana policy reform group norml, told huffpost.
rebekah mercer was impressed by nix's command of data and artistry on the polo field. joshua bright/the washington post/getty images according to perkins and caddell, rebekah and nix met with them a few times to discuss how ca could use the smith project. rebekah was clearly impressed by nix. in one meeting, according to perkins, she gushed about his polo prowess and asked him to show off cellphone photos of himself on horseback. (nix says he doesn't recall this meeting or others with the three. he also doesn't remember displaying such a picture and can think of no good reason why bob or pat would be interested in horses.) the political veterans were skeptical. i didn't understand what nix was talking about, perkins told me bluntly. caddell says he was perplexed when nix wouldn't show him the instruments ca used to predict voter behavior. he also thought the firm didn't grasp the seismic shift underway in american politics. and yet to his great surprise, bannon vouched for ca, telling caddell its scientists were geniuses. caddell knew that bannon was beholden to the mercers—they were, after all, breitbart's part-owners. according to the new york times, however, bannon was also vice president of ca's board. even if he did not have a financial investment, he intellectually owned it, which was invaluable, says a fellow political strategist. after he learned of bannon's involvement, caddell stopped asking bannon questions about ca. in the end, bannon helped seal the deal between the mercers and cruz, with ca as the glue.
david frederick is the most capable, pro-consumer supreme court litigator in the country, and has demonstrated his ability over more than 50 supreme court arguments, todd webster, a former chief of staff to sen. chris coons (d-del.), told politico last month. he is literally the guy progressives turn to when their cases reach the supreme court, so that we win at that level.
with the senate likely to remain in republican hands this year, biden seems to be preparing to resurrect the obama administration's approach after democrats lost the house in the 2010 midterms: a combination of aggressive regulation, executive orders and close collaboration with states.

inslee faces some critics on climate change. in february, 13 young people in washington, ages seven to 17, sued the state, alleging inslee and the agencies under his control violated the constitutional rights of a generation by failing to curb greenhouse gas emissions. one plaintiff ― jamie margolin, a 17-year-old activist in seattle who founded the youth climate group zero hour ― railed against inslee in a series of tweets last week accusing the governor of fighting tooth & nail against the lawsuit, which a state judge tossed in august.
at the beginning, the democrats were very angry with him, jane sanders, sanders' wife, said in an interview with huffpost. burlington's board of aldermen — a part-time, 13-seat city council — resisted sanders' efforts. they wouldn't let him appoint any of the mayoral appointments. they stopped him from hiring the city attorney, city clerk, city treasure ... [the democrats] were outright enemies in the beginning.
a critical problem facing prep promotion among african americans is their overall disenfranchisement from the health care system. frequently a by-product of poverty and unemployment, this alienation from what many progressives argue is a basic american right is often compounded by an accident of geography. those with very low incomes who live in the 19 states with governments that have refused to expand medicaid under the affordable care act (aca, or obamacare)—including almost all the states in the republican-dominated south—have been summarily excluded from the recent mass expansion of the health care rolls.

trump's presidency was thus bookended by two very different groups registering their reactions to losing an election. to women's march organizers, the end came as no surprise.
that's not actually how it works. there's no set definition for a sanctuary city ― some referenced under the term, like california, aren't actually cities at all ― but it broadly means one with policies that allow people to be released from police custody whenever they otherwise would be, even if ice has requested they be held longer. dangerous people remain locked up if they're convicted or denied bail or bond. some federal judges have ruled it unconstitutional to keep people longer than they would be on only an ice request.

secure choice would provide the opportunity for younger people to start thinking now about the future and how to better plan for their retirement. currently, we don't have that opportunity. while she would like to offer retirement accounts to her own employees, their budget is currently only able to support allocating funds to programming expenses. secure choice was the perfect solution for our organization to provide access to a low-cost retirement savings plan that would help employees save for their future. it would also secure my own retirement.
the california government has enacted two disclosure bills since the citizens united decision. the first was passed in 2014 to require any group spending more than $50,000 on elections to disclose its donors. the second, enacted in 2017, mostly focuses on requiring independent spenders to post disclaimers detailing their top three donors on their advertising and campaign materials. ravel believes that the $50,000 threshold for disclosure could be lower ― which is something the house democrats' bill does.
the inescapable conclusion is that the lunatic fringe of the republican party is no longer a fringe. it's the party. for decades, members of the gop elite have believed that leaders committed to tax cuts and deregulation could maintain control over their coalition by indulging its crank elements on what they saw as minor points and deceiving them on others. trump's election made clear, however, that the popular constituency for free trade and free markets in today's america is vanishingly small. and so the party's elite has become increasingly beholden to violent extremists, culminating ― so far ― in wednesday's outrage.

in a country where student debt and the rising cost of the college degree grab national headlines on a weekly basis, efforts to make college free can also get attention. in truth, however, a large part of tuition costs are already subsidized in the u.s. through a combination of grants, tax breaks and loans. what causes waves is the ever-increasing sticker price, rather than what students actually pay.
this is tough for something as new as 2019-ncov, whose exceedingly clinical moniker was derived from the few irrefutable facts at hand: it emerged in 2019, it is novel or new, and it is part of a family of coronaviruses that can cause a variety of conditions.

i've had three years to mull over the 2016 primaries, a subject i never particularly wanted to revisit, but which has a habit of recurring in political conversation like a stench. questions of centrist versus leftist policies remain complex, and fraught with real consequence for the lives and livelihoods of americans. but this time, i can't be talked out of my desire for a woman president. i can't be gaslit out of it, or told it's trivial, unnecessary, too much to ask, unimportant. i know in my soul that it is important. looking down the pale, male corridors of past power, i reflect on centuries of stymied hopes with sorrow, but i look to the future with a terrible and frightening hope in my chest.
city supervisor malia cohen fiercely advocated for an equity program in san francisco. when serving as acting mayor last september, cohen halted approvals for new cannabis permits until steps were taken to ensure a more equitable process. she fought for and won continuances to set the city's cannabis policy, urging her colleagues to consider the consequences of letting a privileged minority sail ahead.

meanwhile, sanders is undergoing scrutiny for complaints that senior figures in his 2016 campaign did not appropriately deal with sexual harassment among campaign staff. earlier this month, the new york times reported that some former staffers wanted an opportunity to confront sanders about the lack of attentiveness to harassment issues, as well as alleged gender pay disparities among the staff. on thursday, politico also revealed that robert becker, a former top sanders field staffer, was accused of forcibly kissing a subordinate.
the cpc has eschewed emulating the far-right house freedom caucus, whose smaller but more ideologically coherent membership has allowed it to operate as a bloc capable of exercising veto power over any legislation gop leaders introduce. the caucus instead welcomes all members, including some who belong to the business-friendly new democrat coalition, while permitting smaller groups to take stands of their choosing.

there is a reason that equal justice under law is carved into the physical architecture of the supreme court above its primary west entrance. far, far too often, america has not been a society where we are all actually subject to law equally. and yet the notion that politicians and billionaires are supposed to be the same under the law as the poor and the oppressed is a powerful principle. this aspiration is necessary for the development of a sense of community and has served as a powerful impetus for america becoming generally less unfair over time.

of course, we must take test security seriously and ensure the legitimacy of scores. but the current process of how scores are flagged and investigated needs to be more transparent. kuhnell said the whole process made her feel like the act were not only questioning her scores, but also her character and integrity. it makes you feel bad about yourself, she said. when you're being questioned on something this big, it makes you feel like crap.
all of this is true, but the verdict of success is misplaced. congress badly misjudged the nature and scope of the coronavirus crisis with the cares act, and then took six months to assemble a fiscal band-aid for its mistakes. by the time congress finally passed an eleventh-hour re-up on some of the law's provisions, 1 out of every 6 american families with children were going hungry. and what they passed was a paltry influx of cash ― far short of the $2,000 per person that democrats, and even trump, called for.
the way they've talked about some of the new women in the 116th congress, and the way they've tried to belittle or mock [ocasio-cortez], this just makes women feel like, 'oh, this party is not welcoming of women,' elder said.

this is a time for crystal clarity and courage. we cannot send mixed messages — to him or to the millions of people he demeans. that is why i will not attend the official state of the union, and instead will join activists from across the country, women of color and others in holding our own state of our union, where we resist this racism and put forward our own progressive vision for our beloved country.
many christians, often concerned about compromising their sense of what they believe that jesus would want, have doubled down on their fragile self-image of being holy, pure and sanctified. in their fear of compromising their beliefs about sexuality and gender, they have almost fully compromised one of the core teachings of jesus: to love god and your neighbor as you love yourself.
some experts have said there's no reason for usda to suspend food benefits just because congress hasn't appropriated funds, arguing that the government ought to treat snap as an entitlement like social security or medicare. those programs continue on autopilot even in a government shutdown.

the centralization of decision-making in leadership offices receives criticism from the left, right and center. the left and the right argue that making leadership the sole arbiter of what gets a vote on the floor makes it impossible for their ideas to get heard. centrists, meanwhile, argue that it suppresses the existing bipartisan agreements that could succeed if only members could vote on them. it also drives a wedge between members and their constituents as a lot of their work will simply be to vote on leadership's priorities.
look, let's get something straight here. it's easy. all the mayor has to do is say, you are released from the nondisclosure agreement, period, biden said. you think the women, in fact, were ready to say i don't want anybody to know about what you did to me? that's not how it works. the way it works is they say, look, this is what you did to me, and the mayor comes along and his attorneys said, i will give you this amount of money if you promise you will never say anything. that's how it works.
more recently, unbreakable kimmy schmidt featured a slew of racist stereotypes in its portrayals of asian and native american characters. in the show's second season, fey appeared to respond to criticism by writing an episode mocking internet criticism. titus (tituss burgess) becomes embroiled in controversy when he takes a role as a geisha wearing yellowface. he gets called out online by an activist group called respectable asian portrayals in entertainment (rape). the activists are portrayed as too fervent, overly sensitive and rushing to judgment. (perhaps the first episode of mr. mayor is a similar attempt at meta-commentary.)

china has long censored violence or sexual content in film releases, with a growing focus on socialist core values. films with gay themes have met with a mixed reaction with some banned, though others have been given the go-ahead.
this is all the evidence you need to see how things are likely to go whenever the trump administration meets its demise.
for the first time in a decade, a democratic congress will be able to pass laws that a democratic president can sign. and although senate republicans can still wield the filibuster, which requires 60 votes to overcome, democrats can approve bills through reconciliation, under which legislation can pass the senate with a simple majority vote.
it appears the institute archives its debates, but that hasn't happened yet. so i'm relying on excerpted quotes.
dr. sundararaman, the public health expert, surmised that the indian government was quietly aware that india lacked the facilities to cope with a sudden influx of infected indians.
the issue: lack of in-person communication and collaboration. many businesses rely on face-to-face meetings to troubleshoot, provide feedback, and discuss policy changes. telecommuting has the potential to disrupt this process.

other pompeo actions over the past week have included returning communist-ruled cuba to the u.s. list of state sponsors of terrorism, and designating yemen's iran-aligned houthi movement a terrorist organization.
but lawmakers can also embed climate provisions in broader spending packages. last month, congress passed a stimulus bill that included billions for clean energy research, extended tax credits for solar and wind power, and ratified a global deal to phase out hydrofluorocarbons, a superheating refrigerant gas. the federal government's annual budget offers a similar opportunity, as the budget reconciliation process allows lawmakers pushing polarizing provisions to circumvent the filibuster.

but the attacks on people of color, both abroad and home, look less and less like an effort to protect his supporters and more and more like a smokescreen for policies that will leave them ― along with most poor and middle-class americans ― worse off than they were before. in a presidency that already has a reputation for dishonesty and graft, what trump policies are doing to america's workers may be the biggest con of all.
like 70% of the american public, i trust my children's teachers in their classrooms. i trust them to keep my children safe and to foster educational attainment. i trust them to individualize my children's education as best they can (despite the pressure to teach to the middle and to the test). i trust them to work with me as a partner. by my own measures (and no doubt many others'), my children's teachers are top-notch.
the plan differs from earlier proposals in that it creates temporary, emergency funding specifically to deal with the coronavirus. it also includes a permanent mandate that employers provide sick leave in the future.
the bill's announcement comes nearly two weeks after an equipment malfunction at a consolidated edison substation next door to the astoria generating station released an electric arc flash that illuminated the city sky with an eerie neon blue. the accident, the result of a broken voltage monitoring system, had no direct connection to the neighboring power plant.
hooray! your dear friend just got engaged! however… now that she's asked you be a bridesmaid, you're feeling a little less celebratory. if you're not entirely sure you're ready to commit to the bridal party obligations, you can, in fact, politely decline. while it will probably be a bit awkward no matter the situation, here are some guidelines for declining without ruining your friendship forever.

cowen's tenants are beneficiaries of a little-known u.s. department of agriculture housing initiative that is essentially a rural counterpart to the department of housing and urban development's much larger programs. and those programs could be severely affected if the shutdown goes on for months or years, as president donald trump has said it might.
if manchin and similarly thinking senators can keep that in mind ― and if democratic leaders, starting with biden, can figure out the right way to package major legislation ― then there is real hope for major legislation in the next two years, and certainly more than seemed possible just a few days ago.
in his opinion, furman found that while the citizenship question had been tested for the american community survey (acs), which goes out to a few million households each year, it had not been tested on the decennial census, which goes out to every household. the trump administration argued the acs question testing was adequate for the decennial, but furman said it was not. the acs questions, he wrote, were last tested in 2006 and the macroenvironment has changed considerably since then.
rhode island sen. jack reed, the top democrat on the senate armed services committee, called trump's dec. 23 veto a parting gift to russian president vladimir putin and a lump of coal for our troops. donald trump is showing more devotion to confederate base names than to the men and women who defend our nation.″
trudeau told the town hall attendee that because of canada's aging population, it needs new immigrants to help build its future. he refuted the idea that the country has an open border policy, stating that its immigration system does a very good job of performing security and screening checks on new arrivals.

mary anne grady flores is in jail today and american citizens everywhere can surely breathe a sigh of relief that we are safe from her criminal behavior at least for the next six months.
since then, robb has gone after so-called neutrality agreements between unions and employers that make it easier for workers to organize. and he has recently taken on scabby the rat, the labor-dispute protest icon beloved by unions and progressives. robb apparently hates the rat and wants to ban its use as unlawfully coercive. the board has asked the public to submit briefs on the issue and could hand down a decision that takes the air out of scabby.
a potential problem for prosecuting trump's actions is that the person soliciting the crime must know that they are requesting election fraud to be committed. if trump legitimately believes the falsehoods that he won georgia by hundreds of thousands of votes, that thousands of dead people voted and that electronic voting machines invented votes for biden, among other outlandish conspiracies, then it may not be possible to criminally prosecute him.
but how do you qualify conversational health?
there are also contrary pictures of whether or not a surge of young voters could happen. a circle/suffolk university poll found 35% of iowans under the age of 35 planned to participate in the caucuses, which would amount to a massive surge from 2016, when just 11% of the same age group caucused.
another major thrust of trump's agenda is protecting businesses from lawsuits, even when they act in ways that exploit or harm consumers ― helping to foster what mike konczal, a fellow at the roosevelt institute, has called a grifter economy.

sanders' willingness to criticize the democratic party speaks to the progressive bona fides highlighted by his supporters. his campaign often relies on decades-old videos of sanders warning against the iraq war, multinational trade deals and the climate crisis using the same rhetoric he still uses today.
as the first week came to a close, the government extended the lockdown for a further two weeks and tightened the rules – including asking citizens to carry a slip of paper or digital form detailing why they weren't at home. it felt like things had just got even more serious but i kept reminding myself that the stricter the measures, the sooner the situation would get better. police presence was visibly upped, and only one person should now only leave the house at once – something a friendly policeman told my housemate and i as we made our way to the supermarket on a joint trip. dogs, however, must have felt like they struck gold. going for a walk is only allowed if you have a canine companion – and photos of exhausted dogs and adverts pimping out pets circulated widely on social media. one man was even caught walking a goat.

speaking of debt, this is an area of your budget where you may be able to find temporary relief in light of the coronavirus pandemic. many local governments and individual financial institutions have placed moratoriums on late fees, interest and other penalties for missing payments. in some cases, you may also be able to put your loan into forbearance.
but over the past half-century, we have instead imbued the stock market with an almost cosmic significance. we use stock prices to evaluate the performance of corporate executives. business schools teach aspiring young men and women that shareholder value is the only appropriate pursuit for corporate leaders.
despite this, there have been some sound adjustments to social and economic policies over the past 20 years. there are still some fairly significant issues that that must be addressed, such as fair pay and appropriate taxing, but we cannot ignore the interwoven complexities posed by environmental issues. and, as we design or redesign environmental policy, we would do very well to include the needs of communities traditionally marginalized by dominant society. as participants in democracy, we are endowed with certain rights and liberties with which faulty environmental policies may infringe. we often see this happen in neighborhoods, communities, and municipalities where its residents live in poverty.
the centers for disease control and prevention (cdc) says the risk of contracting covid-19 on a plane is low because the air circulation prevents germs and viruses from spreading easily. cruises, on the other hand, include conditions that can make respiratory viruses such as covid-19 spread.

but the attack on the capitol made clear that once-disparate elements of the conservative coalition have fused into a common culture with a violent hostility to the american government at its core. the proud boys knelt in prayer before storming the barricades as confederate flags intermingled with a jesus 2020 banner. militant fascists, devout white evangelicals, disaffected working people and ultrarich small business owners recited qanon lies to each other.

the gop tax law passed by congress in late 2017 included a provision, introduced by sen. lisa murkowski (r-alaska), requiring the interior department to approve at least two lease sales for drilling — each covering no less than 400,000 acres. since then, the trump administration has been in a race to approve leases, at times ignoring and altering career scientists' work in an effort to downplay the potential environmental impacts, as politico reported in 2019.

the new law — 878 pages long — was designed to simplify the tax code, make it fairer, and incentivize growth. but its main thrust was true reform – cleaning out many of the special loopholes and breaks that had crept into the code over the years. it raised the tax on capital gains, but also cut the top individual rate from 50 percent to 28 percent. it pulled in $24 billion from corporations by adjusting tax shelters, while cutting corporate taxes from 46 percent to 34 percent. (the rate later crept up to 35 percent). and it shrank the number of individual tax brackets from 15 to five.

unlike many of the teacher strikes that gripped red states in 2018, the la strike pits the massive united teachers los angeles union against the los angeles unified school district, which runs public schools in the city of los angeles and many surrounding communities. the labor dispute reflects a bitter democratic party rift on education policy that splits unions and their allies from proponents of charter schools, whose influence on the la school board has helped precipitate the strike.

the officer berated javier in front of me and i did my best to translate what he was saying. thankfully ― and shockingly ― he let us go with a warning. he must have pitied us, his eyes flickering back and forth between us as i tried to communicate what he was saying to javier. i couldn't believe he was just letting us go, and i wanted to get out of there as quickly as possible before he changed his mind. as we drove away (i was now behind the wheel since i had a valid license), i asked: does this happen to you a lot? you must be constantly living in fear.

public health research has documented racial disparities in health and health care for decades. when looking at the 10 leading causes of death in the u.s. ― including cancer, stroke and heart disease ― mortality rates among black americans are higher than among white americans, even after controlling for socioeconomic status factors. compelling evidence suggests both individual- and institutional-level discrimination cause this disparity. for example, black americans experience high levels of residential segregation, which limits their access to health resources and exposes them to poor housing quality and environmental toxins.
trump's make america great again myth arrived for this weakened conservatism beset by its failure to reverse the advance of a multiracial democracy as a new vision of a future where all conservatives will win and all liberals would not only be defeated but imprisoned. lock them all up, trump said on the campaign trail in 2020. the present order of both parties would be swept away, and the old order would be restored. just as sorel described.

the pakistani voters are not known for electing generals when they are not in the uniform or carrying a gun. they get public support when staging a coup mostly because voters are fed up with corrupt and selfish politicians and they fear the incoming man in the uniform. every time a general was 'elected' through an election or a referendum, it was entirely based on fear and intimidation. can general sharif change that trend? he still has a few months to think about it.

but what of obama's of weakness and appeasement of assad? otto von bismarck, the iron chancellor of germany in the late 1800s and a master of international machiavellian diplomacy, would have been appalled at these characterizations. so likely would have napoleon bonaparte, one of the greatest military commanders of all time. obama's threat eventually led to russia's pressure on assad, its ally, to get rid of his chemical weapons entirely. happy ending, right? not according to the republican candidates. in 2016, the republican candidates, and occasionally hillary -- to show how tough they are -- would have the united states behave like a dim-witted body builder at the beach who goes around punching people for no reason. apparently, according to republican thinking on the assad matter, the world thought obama was a wimp for not following through on his threat to use force, no matter how good the outcome attained without it. obviously, the russians took obama's threat to use force seriously, because they pushed their ally assad to get rid of his chemical weapons. so the choice was between punitive, purely symbolic, and likely ineffectual u.s. military retaliation and an even better outcome -- an assad stripped of his chemical weapons.

it's worked before. in the late 1980s, state governments took up the cause of paying women equally for basically the same work, even if it was done in different positions than men. they dubbed it comparable worth. between 1983 and 1992, those governments spent more than $527 million to lift women's pay so that it was level with men in other jobs doing similar work, and in turn they eliminated 20 percent of the gender wage gap. at the time, a paper found that a national comparable worth policy would erase 28 percent of the gap.

many democrats do not support medicare for all. but at this point even democrats unwilling to endorse it are frequently calling to expand public insurance programs in some fashion ― if not by creating a new government plan that enrolls everybody, then by opening one of the two big existing programs, medicare or medicaid, to more people.

as minister, she is in charge of national education policy and leads all improvement efforts including national legislation, guidelines and strategies. decision making in the finnish system, she says, is characterized by a broad consensus rather than dictating things from above. while the government determines how much time is spent on individual subjects, the national core curriculum (developed by the finnish national board of education in close cooperation with all stakeholders in education, especially teachers) sets subject-specific guidelines. the bottom line, she notes, is that it's up to teachers to determine what activities take place in classrooms. finland is renowned for teacher autonomy. they are the ones that are doing the valuable work; we must value and respect their opinions.

at the time, i thought it was just my 12-year-old, but it turns out it was my 12-year-old and my 8-year-old. he was upset and i just felt really helpless. i had to get home to my son. he's scared. there's people outside our door and i don't know what's going on. … i just can't believe where we've come to as a community and as a country, really. it's just ― it's sad.

that unexpected extra money has given states the flexibility to rewrite their tax codes without creating as many losers — and the accompanying political hardship — as most tax revamps entail.
it's media fodder. it's sensationalism. that's what it is, he said. all it takes is for one person to say they're offended, and then everybody does a dog pile. but to me, it's 'wait a second. let's get to some of the facts here.' sen. warren has always been a friend to tribes. and we need all the allies we can get.
earlier this year, inslee visited the scorched remains of paradise, california, a town decimated by the state's deadliest wildfire in history. he said that visit made clear to him that the 2020 election needed to be singularly focused on the crisis at hand.

trump acknowledged afterward in his press conference at the white house that he does not like the term government shutdown, as no one blamed for one would. i don't call it a shutdown, trump said, before offering a less-than-concise alternative: i call it doing what you have to do for the benefit and the safety of our country.
while i cannot see him and he is of course cut off from all visitors, our daughter abigail and i are constantly calling and texting and emailing, she said. we love him very much and pray for his recovery. he is exhausted and sick but a very strong and resilient person.
park has steadfastly denied any wrongdoing.
just look at the white house press photos that keep coming out. if we saw these going into election day, people may have instead voted for an earth-ending asteroid.
here's the problem: when the time comes and you show up for your vacation, that's not your condo. it's not just a matter of bait and switch, where the gorgeous property on the website doesn't exactly live up to the reality. in this case, the property is very real and even very beautiful … but you didn't rent it. there may even be another family inside. you now find yourself on vacation with nowhere to sleep, and your scammer is nowhere to be found.
the refuge, often described as america's serengeti, covers more than 19 million acres in northeastern alaska. it is home to polar bears, caribou, moose and hundreds of species of migratory birds. for decades, republicans and energy companies have been trying to gain access to the oil beneath the refuge's coastal plain, known as the 1002 area.

scientists and theorists continue to debate whether equilibrium theory is useful, as many claim that equilibrium hasn't ever been observed. one could argue that equilibrium theory appears to lie on the same foundation as its predecessor providence -- a mixture of faith and reason. arguments can be gathered and apparent evidence highlighted, but in the end a leap is required. but when it comes to market behavior, many argue that the evidence for equilibrium is scanty.
twitter cracked down on the same day as its historic permanent ban on trump's personal account due to the risk of further incitement of violence from the president's tweets.
most of those executed were sunni, and the executions were designed to frighten the overwhelmingly sunni population of saudi arabia into silence. at the same time, the inclusion of shiite cleric sheikh nimr baqir al-nimr sent a similar warning to the shiite minority. it also served to divert the attention of the world from the cruel executions to the conflict between shia and sunni and to drag in iran as the guilty party. sheikh nimr's crime was to actively oppose the saudi regime and call for better treatment of the 20% of shiites in eastern saudi arabia.
the other high-profile use of reconciliation in recent history came in 2010, when democrats used it to finish up their work on the affordable care act. the main legislation passed the senate through regular order, with 60 votes. but the house agreed to pass the bill, as written, only on the condition that the senate pass an extra set of changes. that supplementary bill, which also nationalized the student loan industry, passed through reconciliation.
an earlier cms report, based on 2013 acs statistics, found that the growth in the undocumented population began to slow in the mid-2000s and that by 2008 roughly as many people were leaving this population as joining it. in each year between 2008 and 2014, more us residents left the undocumented population than joined it, which explains the overall decline in this population.
tip: whenever you're booking a rental property — for any reason, not just a beach getaway — there's a sneaky little trick you can use to verify the authenticity of the listing and the property. instead of emailing, call the person, but first do an online search for other businesses in the area surrounding the property, then ask the contact some specific questions to which you've already figured out the answers. how far is it to the nearest beach access? where is the nearest restaurant with a kids' menu? how far are we from an emergency room in case someone in our group gets hurt?
in october, united nations scientists issued a dire warning, giving world governments a 2030 deadline to halve emissions or face a cataclysmic temperature spike. yet emissions hit an all-time high last year and look set to continue soaring as new estimates released tuesday showed a 3.4 percent surge in the united states alone.

when lawmakers draw their own lines, they lose all of their philosophical ideals and they become ugly monsters that are willing to cut out competitors, punish people from the other party and try to draw the most protective district for themselves so they don't have to face serious competition for the next 10 years, said kathay feng, national redistricting director at the good government group common cause, which championed the creation of california's commission.

during last week's senate discussion of austin, sen. jeanne shaheen (d-n.h.) highlighted one of the most alarming aspects of the jan. 6 attack: the fact that a striking number of the perpetrators had military and law enforcement backgrounds. to her, that seemed like evidence that intense partisanship is already growing to an alarming degree within the armed forces.
unified control of the government is extremely rare in american politics and the next nine months could be the last time they have unified control for another 10 years, said waleed shahid, a spokesperson for justice democrats, a left-wing group that has hired a political director to advance its agenda on capitol hill. delivering results is much more important than bipartisan branding or anything like that.

warren's travels continued with an event saturday night in the state capital of des moines that drew more than 1,000 people. on sunday, she'll meet with a group of female leaders in the rapidly growing suburb of ankeny. the trip is her first to iowa since 2014, when she campaigned for former rep. bruce braley in iowa's senate race.
for the whole of history, as hannah arendt wrote, totalitarians have depended on a coalition between the elite and the mob. in brazil, as elsewhere, the rise of a new authoritarian required the acquiescence of a patrician class unwilling to accept any of the blame for the systemic ills the country was facing. and while so much media attention was lavished on the ordinary folks who supported bolsonaro, it was more significant that his levels of support rose with each step up the income ladder, thanks to elites who shared his disdain for the left and were happy to empower a fascist to thwart it.
notably, the tweets were punctuated by a variety of creative hashtags, including #leadingfromthefront, #endendlesswars and #fireandfury.
special counsel robert mueller's investigation into whether the president conspired with foreign countries including russia to influence the 2016 election to his benefit has already netted numerous high-profile guilty pleas of trump's national security adviser, foreign policy aide and his personal lawyer and fixer. it has also led to the revelation that trump lied during his campaign that he had nothing to do with russia when he actually pursued a deal with the russian government to build a trump tower in moscow up until june 2016.

before this point, rebekah's resume had consisted of a brief run trading stocks and bonds (including at her father's hedge fund), a longer stint running her family's foundation and, along with her two sisters, the management of an online gourmet cookie shop called ruby et violette. now, she was compiling lists of potential candidates for a host of official positions, the foot soldiers who would remake (or unmake) the united states government in trump's image. rebekah wasn't a regular presence at trump tower. she preferred working from her apartment in trump place, which was in fact six separate apartments that she and her husband had combined into an opulent property more than twice the size of gracie mansion. still, it quickly became clear to her new colleagues that she wasn't content just to chip in with ideas. she wanted decision-making power. to her peers on the executive committee, she supported alabama senator jeff sessions for attorney general and general michael flynn for national security adviser, but argued against naming mitt romney secretary of state. her views on these matters were heard, according to several people on and close to the transition leadership. rebekah was less successful when she lobbied hard for john bolton, the famously hawkish former u.s. ambassador to the united nations, to be deputy secretary of state. and when bolton was not named to any position, she made her displeasure known. i know it sounds sexist, but she was whiny as hell, says one person who watched her operate.

there is no clear policy on this issue, so we are always confused, said xin ying, executive director of the beijing lgbt centre, adding that following the recent reshuffle of the media regulators it was getting even harder to get clear direction.
the morning after the georgia runoffs, trump's labor department announced a new federal rule regarding the use of independent contractors by companies like uber and doordash. the new industry-friendly regulation would make it difficult for workers to prove through lawsuits that they are actually employees entitled to basic labor protections. it's slated to go into effect in march. democrats could undo it through the cra if they choose to, though not without provoking a fight from the gig companies and other businesses that use contractors.
i think it's about both sides failing to progress the issue beyond a top heavy approach. for the longest time in the post cold war-era, the relationship has largely been dependent on the political chemistry between the two heads of state, whether it is a bush and manmohan, who enjoyed working together, or obama and manmohan, where obama revered manmohan singh's advice on macroeconomics even when it came to the eurozone crisis. there is a lot of personality driven partnership and camaraderie there. the same for modi and obama and modi and trump as it was for clinton and vajpayee.
we need to be able to talk for ourselves, she said, and not be used as an ax to grind because of elizabeth warren's aspirations to run for president.

political analyst sajjan kumar pointed out that the bjp's history shows that it has always fielded a relatively liberal (within its ecosystem) face along with a hardcore leader on the hindutva plank, giving the examples of atal bihari vajpayee and l.k. advani and more recently, narendra modi and amit shah. so it was unsurprising that mishra was going unpunished even as voices such as tiwari and gambhir made an attempt to criticise him.

environmental monitoring is meant to be tool that determines whether an environment is fit to live in and detects when problems occur. but there are many conflicts between different interest groups, ranging from citizens and consumers to businesses and governments, that undermine environmental monitoring efforts. increased transparency on all levels, the right mix of incentives and regulations and participatory processes in setting standards are key to overcoming these conflicts. in the end, it's a question of finding the right mix of rewards and punishments.

former president lyndon johnson, for example, was known for his hard-driving, persistent, negotiation tactics. and, of course, johnson was able to push through civil rights legislation at a time when his own party was dominated by segregationists. this was a case of someone staking out a position and forcing everyone to his side.
this matters for the wage gap because men's work simply pays better. high-skilled, predominantly male occupations pay nearly $10 more an hour, at the median, than high-skill occupations crowded by women. jobs where workers are more than half female pay 15 percent less than those that are more than half male.

during the partial government shutdown that started in december 2018 and became the longest in u.s. history, the fossil fuel-friendly trump administration plowed ahead with its energy dominance agenda. as about 800,000 federal workers went without paychecks, the interior department worked to boost oil and gas development in the alaskan arctic, processed fossil fuel drilling applications and permits, and even brought back dozens of furloughed employees to ensure offshore drilling activities continued.

paramount among these is the john lewis voting rights act, which would reform and reauthorize the 1965 voting rights law. the proposed legislation, named after the civil rights hero and former democratic congressman who died in 2019, would update the vra in compliance with the supreme court's 2014 decision in shelby county v. holder, which gutted key parts of the historic law. that decision freed state-level republicans to enact a raft of voter suppression measures aimed at lowering minority voter turnout. former president barack obama called on the senate to waive the filibuster in order to pass the revised law in his eulogy for lewis.
since reports of larry nassar's misconduct to michigan state faculty began in 1997, two years before i was even born, i can't help but wonder, mccaul continued. how many little girls could have been spared from this lifelong battle if someone at the university had just done the bare minimum and listened?
it was also a day of dire warnings. women warned that trump's racist, misogynistic and violent rhetoric would have real consequences. in the years after, those fears were borne out in his policies and practices.
aides who would enjoy dropping by the oval office to check on trump found themselves avoiding him lest he give them an assignment related to voter fraud that they knew was impossible, three sources said.
the only conclusion you can draw when he walks away is he has no argument to be made. he has no justification for his objection to having a small nation be part of nato that is under assault from the russians. so, i repeat again: the senator from kentucky is now working for vladimir putin.

he did not name any member of the family at the press conference, which took place in spanish, but said his team notified u.s. officials of the situation.
his political future could now be in jeopardy as a result of the capitol violence. if convicted by the senate in a trial that would occur after he has left the white house, trump could be banned from holding federal office again.
rogen responded later monday night with his own video from his bunker.
newsom's proposal counts as groundbreaking and radical for the u.s., the only developed country in the world that doesn't guarantee paid time off to new mothers; just two of 34 oecd countries do not guarantee paid leave to new fathers. and it comes at a time when democratic state and local politicians around the country are proposing new liberal social programs ― beefing up obamacare protections and provisions and passing greater labor protections. these guys are just catching up with others around the world, however.

maybe she could get another job, outside the home after school, if she had child care. but hughes is a single mother with no one to fall back on if she contracts covid-19. if i get sick, if anything happens to me, forget it. who's going to take care of my child? she asked. for now, the two of them are at home — only leaving to take the bus to the grocery store or walk over to the school, which provides free grab n' go lunches.
michael, who is on prep, doesn't mince words when addressing the larger societal context into which prep has arrived. there is something very imperialistic about the way that prep has been rolled out, he says, because you can't get a young man of color to care about whether or not he contracts hiv when he doesn't feel good enough about himself to care about whether or not he lives or dies.
the canadian olympic committee and the canadian paralympic committee released a statement sunday on their decision to pull their athletes out of the games as currently scheduled. the committees also called on the international olympic committee, the international paralympic committee and the world health organization to delay the games for one year.
but an argument for accountability is not principally about politics. if pence or a democratic successor follows in the footsteps of presidents ford or obama, they will be continuing a cycle of nonaccountability for the powerful. they will be helping cynicism flower anew.
for instance, kentucky last year proposed work requirements for able-bodied adults to get insurance and establishing new fees for all members based on income. a study found the proposal would reduce the number of residents on medicaid by nearly 86,000 within five years, saving more than $330 million.

plus, the trump administration is stacked at every level with officials who reject the very reality that burning fossil fuels is the primary cause of global warming, making it hard to envision green new deal legislation passing until 2021 at the earliest.
trump may well be right, in a sense. wednesday's naked violence will make it still more difficult for his coalition to reach anything like a national majority. trump lost the popular vote by more than 3 million in 2016. in 2020 he lost by 7 million. it is not hard to imagine a near-future in which the trump coalition won't need to believe a demagogue's lies to be motivated into action against democracy, but will instead reason their way to it out of political self-interest.
these economic costs take a severe toll on everyday people. today, some 380,000 american families have a member sitting at home without a paycheck. at a time when around 80 percent of americans live paycheck to paycheck, in large part because the cost of living continues to rise at rates outstripping increases in worker pay, that's hundreds of thousands of family crises waiting to happen. it means families may not have sufficient money for rent or mortgages, groceries, transportation or school supplies, among other needs.
ahead of the georgia senate runoffs, justice democrats and sunrise teamed up once again in december to argue that biden and democrats should turn the jan. 5 senate contests into a referendum on the inclusion of $1,200 checks in a covid-19 relief bill. around the same time, sens. bernie sanders (i-vt.) and josh hawley (r-mo.) mounted a public push for a second round of $1,200 payments ― americans received $1,200 checks from the cares act in march ― along with an additional $500 for every child. their pressure campaign, backed by the congressional progressive caucus, helped ensure the addition of a $600 stimulus in the bill that congress passed shortly before christmas.

it was announced on saturday that two elderly people had died from the virus in italy, and on sunday the total number of cases in the country surpassed 100. italy's government have passed a series of emergency measures in a bid to limit the spread of the outbreak in what is now europe's worst-affected country. the governor of italy's northern lombardy region attilio fontana said certified cases of the illness in his area had risen to 89 from 54 a day earlier, bringing the total number in the country to more than 100. in an emergency decree approved late on saturday, the government adopted special powers to be able to stop people leaving or entering the worst impacted zones. a spokesman for the governor of the northern region veneto said on sunday the number of cases there had risen to 19, seven more than on saturday. lombardy is home to italy's financial capital milan which has a population of 1.4m. the city's mayor giuseppe sala has announced that all milan schools will be closed from monday, while universities in both lombardy and veneto have also been shuttered until early march. sporting events have also been cancelled in the affected regions, including three serie a football matches. fashion designer giorgio armani has said his fashion show scheduled to take place in milan on sunday would go ahead in an empty theatre without any press or buyers present.

only half the value of capital gains is currently taxed. this costs $5 billion in annual tax revenue just for the federal government (and more for the provinces). about 50 per cent of the tax saving goes to the top one per cent of income earners, who earn the bulk of capital gains.

bismarck probably would have thought the latter outcome to be very satisfactory. in fact, back in the old days when bismarck was tromping around, appeasing enemies by paying them off instead of fighting them -- as general david petraeus adroitly did in iraq, disguised as a macho american troop surge -- was considered smart. similarly, to get better press, maybe obama should have made a deal with russia to bomb a few empty buildings in the syrian desert to make the whole thing look macho. bismarck might have even gone further and advised that when a nation's enemies are fighting -- as u.s. adversaries are in syria -- it should stay out of a bloody war and conserve resources, while the adversaries expend theirs beating each other to a pulp. then-president ronald reagan was largely able to carry out such a restrained strategy during the long and bloody iran-iraq war in the 1980s. george h. w. bush, reagan's successor, was then able to handily defeat a weakened iraq in the subsequent and brief desert storm campaign in 1991.

this is certainly not the only mechanism being deployed to capture, collect and monetize data about your child. in fact, many folks who position themselves as opponents of bs tests are actually doing so to build a case for other data collecting methods (but we'll talk about competency based education another day). but opting out is certainly one clear and immediate way that you can keep some of your child's data out of the hands of the big data miners.

additionally, the supreme court's third-party doctrine, fashioned in the 1970s to excuse warrantless searches of business records, is an anachronism. the doctrine holds that information voluntarily shared with private entities, like deposits with banks or dialed phone numbers with phone companies, is denuded of fourth amendment protection. but in today's electronically-enhanced world, all of our most sensitive information - including our location, our associations, our communications, and our internet searches -are stored on third-party servers. under the third party doctrine, this information becomes easily available to the government. personal papers once zealously protected by the law while sitting on our desks are no longer adequately protected from the prying eyes of government.

it is for this reason that comparisons of gay people to simply single people who have not married yet are so woefully lacking in nuance. i once heard the difference between these groups stated this way and it's always stuck with me: single mormons go to bed every night pleading with the lord that they will fall in love with someone tomorrow; gay mormons go to bed every night pleading with the lord that they will never fall in love with someone.
angry after the raffensperger call, trump floated the idea of pulling out of the rally but was persuaded to go ahead with it so he would have a chance to reiterate his claims of election fraud. republicans were wary as to whether trump would focus only on himself and fail to promote the two gop candidates.

los angeles ― california is now the largest state in the nation to have legal and regulated recreational marijuana. and while that alone is a blow to the prohibitionist policies of the failed war on drugs, a lesser-known provision in the state's new law, along with efforts in a few local jurisdictions, aims to repair some of the damage that the criminalization of marijuana has done to so many communities.

until then, we were looking to the 2017 federal budget, tabled on march 22 to see what, if anything, ottawa would include to begin tackling some of these challenges. at the very least, it would have been reasonable to expect some modernization of the existing home buyers' plan to allow canadians impacted by sudden and significant life changes to buy a house without tax penalty. many thought such changes would be included in budget 2016, but none were forthcoming.

why is the met in debt? there are several potential contributing factors: namely, financial mismanagement amid previously rising salaries, staff increases and expansion and rebranding plans. plus, visitors ― particularly young ones ― are indeed paying less at the door, which, according to daniel h. weiss, the met's president, matters. a decline of 30 to 40 cents per person is material, he told the times.

while this could be true of many couples in this day and age — when work can call upon you wherever you happen to be via email or text — the couples that leave some time for fun, pleasure and intimacy are the ones who have a better chance of committing to creating time for sex. there are also hints that one or both partners are unconsciously avoiding intimacy through the overloading of their schedule. ― cooper

the groups that signed onto the letter said frederick's willingness to defend shell against the communities they harmed raises questions about what cases he'd champion as solicitor general.
many workers recognize that pensions, which used to be a common employee benefit in supporting a robust retirement, are not a guarantee in today's labor market. and increasingly, neither are employer-sponsored retirement plans like a 401k. currently, more than 45 percent of working-age households in the united states do not have access to a retirement savings plan through their employer. for latinos, 60 percent do not have access to an employer-sponsored retirement plan. the city and state plans proposed would provide auto-enrollment individual retirement accounts (iras) for private sector workers who tend to be lower-income, and don't have access to such benefits through their employers. this would also benefit employees of small businesses, where 50 percent of employers don't offer retirement plans. workers who participate are automatically opted into a retirement savings account that takes out a predetermined amount from their monthly paychecks and saves it in an ira. workers also have the option to opt out at any time.

in addition to the green new deal, candidates must stress that their opponents' inaction on environmental issues hurts american workers and their communities. florida's former gov. rick scott won a senate seat this fall even though his gutting of florida's water management budget by hundreds of millions of dollars likely created the conditions for the unprecedented red tide event that cost florida's tourism economy over $90 million in one summer. his opponent, then-sen. bill nelson, hardly mentioned that scott's recklessness and complete disregard for florida's environment and waterways was a direct blow to small businesses, fisherman and millions of floridians whose livelihoods depend on the health of the ocean. meanwhile, evidence shows that 30-year congressman dana rohrabacher's notorious denial of climate issues potentially cost him his seat in california's 48th congressional district this fall after he routinely ignored the issues plaguing his constituents ― including rampant flooding in orange county's balboa island that has resulted from sea-level rise.
ottawa — the federal government is warning canadians abroad who aren't able to get home that they may be forced to hunker down for a while.
then there's the fact that black people who are struggling to afford a government shutdown are more likely to live around other people who are struggling financially. fifty years after major efforts toward integration, our communities remain stubbornly racially segregated. the post-civil rights era integration achievements of the 1970s and 1980s have stagnated, and in many metropolitan areas eroded, even as black americans have become a majority suburban population. today more than half of the black population would need to move to attain full integration. this means the furlough will not only disproportionately affect black families, but it will also be concentrated in black communities. racial segregation, itself the consequence of racist policies and practices, will only compound the negative effects black americans will likely experience.
when it comes to alcohol use, we know that impairment begins well before a person's bac reaches 0.08 percent, the current limit in the united states at which a driver is presumed to be impaired, the agency writes in a list of recommendations for improving transportation safety. in fact, by the time bac reaches that level, the risk of a fatal crash has more than doubled.
naming a new virus in this day and age is no easy task, he agrees.
those are the easy cases. but from there accountability gets tricky. the list of elected republicans who voted with the mob is frighteningly long: eight senators and 139 house members voted against certifying the election results. these votes were cast after the insurrection, when it was abundantly clear to the entire country exactly what kind of reaction those votes would encourage. on monday night, capitol police briefed democrats on three more conspiracies to overthrow the government ahead of biden's inauguration on jan. 20, potentially involving tens of thousands of armed terrorists, including one plot aimed explicitly at murdering democrats to give republicans control of the government.

ottawa — foreign affairs minister francois-philippe champagne says the safety of canadians in the middle east is the government's paramount concern after an american airstrike killed a top iranian general.
her bid makes sense on its face: democrats swept the 2018 midterm elections with a crop of young candidates like gabbard, many of them with public service backgrounds and from historically underrepresented communities. (she is a military veteran and was the first hindu member of congress.) much of the party also associates her with the ongoing revolt against its establishment. in 2016, she surrendered a plum democratic national committee post so she could endorse sen. bernie sanders (i-vt.) and argue top democrats were unfairly helping former secretary of state hillary clinton secure the party's presidential nomination.
then the president gave himself a pat on the back for killing abu bakr al-baghdadi, the leader of the so-called islamic state, ignoring the role obama's administration played in crafting the anti-isis strategy he followed, and for last month ordering the assassination of iranian gen. qassem soleimani, a dramatic escalation in the confrontation between washington and tehran and a move that past presidents considered but decided would be too risky. the move prompted retaliatory strikes by iran that injured 50 american troops and worsened u.s. relations with iraq, where the u.s. targeted soleimani.
i believe you can absolutely complete our work on this covid package. at the same time, we can start a trial to convict president trump of inciting violence, of inciting a riot, inciting sedition, as well as the efforts he made to undermine the electoral results in georgia.

taken together, the fda case reports provide no clear picture of the deadly risks the agency claims kratom poses. there's also a certain irony in the fact that so many of the deaths the fda associates with kratom also appear to have involved prescription drugs, which it argues must be safer than kratom.

when sanders introduced his bill last year, the list of 16 democratic co-sponsors included several prospective presidential contenders ― among them, sen. elizabeth warren of massachusetts, who last week launched her exploratory committee for a white house bid. that announcement came one day after sen. kamala harris of california, another likely presidential candidate, reaffirmed her support for medicare for all in a new york times op-ed. and, of course, sanders himself is widely expected to run again.
having state legislatures set policy will ensure greater clarity for both residents and police. courts often confront privacy claims in the context of criminal cases when defendants invoke the fourth amendment. but the current constitutional test -- whether there is a reasonable expectation of privacy in the data acquired by law enforcement -- can be vague and difficult to administer. under this standard, for example, courts have concluded that individuals have little privacy in some of their most cherished activities, even placing inordinate weight on the availability of a specific technology or the wording of a cellphone agreement. privacy-protective state law can forestall this process by requiring a warrant or other process up front, and by adding more muscle to the constitutional argument that drivers, cell phone owners, and others do not abandon their privacy the moment they step outside.
7. take a genuine interest in employees' work-life balance. nothing burns good employees out quite like overworking them. it's so tempting to work your best people hard that managers frequently fall into this trap. overworking good employees is perplexing to them; it makes them feel as if they're being punished for their great performance. overworking employees is also counterproductive. new research from stanford shows that productivity per hour declines sharply when the workweek exceeds 50 hours, and productivity drops off so much after 55 hours that you don't get anything out of the extra work.
on the campaign trail, left-wing candidate jean luc mélenchon and his supporters were also quite lukewarm towards the single currency even if they seemed at least willing to renegotiate in favour a different europe.

trump also had little desire to pressure beijing or criticize its president, xi jinping, with whom he wanted to secure cooperation on ending a yearlong trade war before the reelection campaign kicked into high gear. when trump fielded his first question about the virus in davos, he enthusiastically praised xi's response, going well beyond the calibrated risk-reward messaging his aides were encouraging.

when i am an old woman i shall wear purple by jenny joseph when i am an old woman i shall wear purple with a red hat which doesn't go, and doesn't suit me. and i shall spend my pension on brandy and summer gloves and satin sandals, and say we've no money for butter. i shall sit down on the pavement when i'm tired and gobble up samples in shops and press alarm bells and run my stick along the public railings and make up for the sobriety of my youth. i shall go out in my slippers in the rain and pick flowers in other people's gardens and learn to spit. you can wear terrible shirts and grow more fat and eat three pounds of sausages at a go or only bread and pickle for a week and hoard pens and pencils and beermats and things in boxes. but now we must have clothes that keep us dry and pay our rent and not swear in the street and set a good example for the children. we must have friends to dinner and read the papers. but maybe i ought to practice a little now? so people who know me are not too shocked and surprised when suddenly i am old, and start to wear purple.

trump announced in a series of tweets that he planned to ban transgender people from serving in the military in any capacity. the controversial policy, implemented on april 12, 2019, stated that trans people are only allowed to enlist in the military under the sex they were assigned at birth. the policy effectively banned transgender people from enlisting in the military, while forcing current trans service members who had already transitioned back into the closet.
at the moment, a lot of people believe that the stock market is overvalued ― although this idea itself wrongly assumes there is some real stock market value that the market has pulled away from. years of low interest rates from the federal reserve have discouraged people from buying interest-bearing bonds and spurred purchases of stock instead. when the gop cut corporate taxes, it created the prospect of companies paying out dividends to shareholders or buying back stock to drive up the price. the fed is now steadily raising interest rates, and plenty of stock experts think traders have gotten a little carried away with tax-cut enthusiasm. and so, while the economic data is pretty good, there is a consensus in some quarters that the market is due for dip.

democrats increasingly see antitrust policy in the same vein that they have come to view campaign finance reform ― a fundamental structural problem underlying the many issues of skyrocketing health care costs, lower wages, lack of labor mobility, rising prices, fewer local businesses and less political power. a 2018 poll by the anti-monopoly group open markets institute found 76 percent of respondents believed big corporations have too much power over your family and your community.
another of ramirez's lawyers, mark rosenbaum of the legal advocacy group public counsel, characterized the daca program as a promise from the federal government's executive branch that daca recipients would not be targeted for deportation and said he hoped that promise would not be broken.
white house press secretary sarah huckabee sanders said friday that the administration was aware of the issue and was exploring options to prevent this from being implemented while some federal workers are furloughed.
cicilline may be a lawyer, but he didn't come to congress with expertise in antitrust. after he became ranking member of the antitrust subcommittee, he noticed how the consolidation problems that he was investigating in his oversight role overlapped with the broader inequality issues that democrats were trying to tackle.
sen. bernie sanders (i-vt.) called climate change the biggest crisis of all in a fiery rebuke of president donald trump's televised address tuesday night meant to drum up support for funding a u.s.-mexico border wall to reopen the federal government.
assessing the u.s. performance internationally depends on the context you choose ― or, more precisely, which countries are part of the comparison.
but trump did lose reelection. as this complicated the maga myth, it could not possibly be true. trump, through his symbiotic relationship with his base of supporters, both fueled their wildest fantasies by rejecting his loss with a steady stream of lies and amplified his supporters' conspiracies on social media. these lies had to be true because america had to be made great again, his supporters believed.

the majority-democratic new york assembly passed single-payer health care bills several times in recent years, but the state senate ― then controlled by republicans ― didn't take up the measure. democrats now have a majority in both chambers of the legislature and are set to reconsider single-payer, although gov. andrew cuomo (d) has expressed skepticism.
most of my experiences are exactly what the research on ubi predicts. some opponents of basic income say that people won't use their money for what's good for them, so we should give it to them in the form of food stamps or other forms of welfare. this is, for one, somewhat patronizing, and secondly, not backed by the research.
if the health and the well-being of the people that you hurt is at the forefront of your mind, i think that that will create an environment and create a mindset for actual progress, she said.
this disparity is multifactorial and complex. even at a young age, there exists a confidence gap between boys and girls that has direct consequences on early educational paths. often unintentionally, girls are herded away from hard-science fields. although severe discrimination seems all but eliminated in the united states, there still likely exists subconscious gender bias and stereotyping that may limit opportunities for women in these fields. for instance, the american association of university of women published a report exploring some of the concepts surrounding why women are lacking in these fields. according to their findings, there remain difficult and unwelcoming climates in science and engineering departments at colleges and universities that may present obstacles for women entering those arenas.
it's no shock that more americans are waiting longer to get married. and more people are living together before marriage, testing out the waters for long-term cohabitation and companionship. it all sounds wonderful ― until you have to decide how to divvy up the bills.
food pantries and nonprofits in other parts of the country are also working to help federal employees who are either furloughed or working without pay throughout the shutdown. a food pantry in lawrence, kansas, decided to waive its poverty guidelines so that struggling federal employees could get a week of free groceries.
the new york times reported on the monkey study last week, citing a lawsuit volkswagen owners filed against the automaker. on monday, german media described that study and another involving human subjects. volkswagen, bmw and daimler, the owner of mercedes, financed the group that commissioned the studies, according to the reports.

it was here, in july, that people in são paulo joined the largest women-led protest in brazilian history, as women and lgbtq people who feared bolsonaro's history of racist, sexist and homophobic statements urged brazilians to vote for anyone else. ele nāo, they yelled ― not him.
the teacher said she wrote her facebook post to expose the reality of what's happening in american classrooms so that people like mulvaney can't comfortably make those kinds of assertions. prior to sharing her post, she'd never discussed the fact that she feeds her students with anyone because it is such a common practice among teachers.

the house is scheduled to vote on the bill on thursday, which will likely pass with mostly democratic support. house minority leader kevin mccarthy (r-calif.) called the legislation completely partisan and unworkable.
the dramatic qanon housecleaning comes amid mounting criticism that various internet platforms were complicit in the lethal storming of the u.s. capitol on wednesday by trump supporters, including many who follow qanon. the attack left five people dead, including capitol police officer brian sicknick. critics say the social media platforms have allowed the rampant spread of dangerous lies and have provided users a means to conspire to commit violence.

his spokesman pointed to the 1970s when it took six confidence votes to unseat the sitting government: there have been situations in the past where there have been no confidence votes which haven't succeeded on the first occasion.
gov. laura kelly's executive order was her first official action since taking office monday and fulfilled a promise she made repeatedly during her successful campaign last year. it bars state agencies from discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity when hiring workers or deciding whether to promote, discipline or fire them.
the benefits would be administered and paid directly to workers by the social security administration, and capped at two-thirds of a person's monthly earnings, not to exceed $4,000. if a worker already receives sick leave benefits from their job or state government, they would still be eligible for the new federal benefit minus what they're already receiving.

the language of serene trust in the market has an even longer history. it's deeply tied to religion -- and particularly to the language of faith.
of the bunch, though, bolsonaro might be the most pressing threat to a major democracy. brazil's is the fourth-largest in the world, and the largest by population in latin america. if it dies, this time, it won't be at the hands of the armed forces. it will be self-inflicted.
the other argument for exempting capital gains is inflation. some of the increase in the price of assets is due to general inflation, and it would be unfair to tax it. that is true, but the current regime is not a good way to deal with it. a capital gain earned from a thirty day speculation gets the same treatment as a long-term investment that has been held for thirty years. that is not fair to the long-term investor, who may in fact have no real capital gain at all once inflation is taken into account.
watching ocasio-cortez being sworn in, i couldn't help but think of a similar outfit ― an all-white pantsuit ― worn by hillary clinton, when she officially became the democratic nominee for president in 2016. like ocasio-cortez, clinton intentionally set out to echo the suffragettes' struggle for the vote, and to imbue her clothing choice with an appropriate nod to the historical significance of her achievement.
he called the crash that killed all 176 people on board, including 57 canadians, a tragedy that illustrates once again the importance of diplomacy and necessity to adapt quickly to circumstances. while iran has been co-operative in helping repatriate the remains of canadian crash victims, the regime needs to more, he said.
seiu supported biden's candidacy and campaigned for him on the ground in crucial swing states like michigan. bloomberg law reported in november that worker advocacy groups were hatching a pressure campaign aimed at getting biden to fire robb. since then, seiu has circulated memos not just to transition officials but to other allies in the labor movement arguing for robb's removal.
an even better approach to justice reform laws is to treat women in the justice system with a filter of trauma — rather than a lens. this means pulling out female arrestees who have been abused before they reach a correctional facility and referring them to appropriate treatment. in addition to respecting victims' experiences, such a shift in practice would slow the out-of-control rate of growth of the female incarcerated population.
navalny fell into a coma while aboard a domestic flight from siberia to moscow on aug. 20. he was transferred from a hospital in siberia to a berlin hospital two days later.

a wide array of advocacy organizations have been working to combat disinformation with answers about the trump rule.
denying iowans the right to vote does nothing to keep our communities safer or make our democracy stronger. in fact, it does the opposite. it prevents thousands of iowans from successfully reintegrating into society and becoming active, invested participants in our communities and our state, stringer said in a statement.

finally, if you're carrying credit card debt but have a decent credit score, look for a balance transfer deal. in order to attract new customers, credit card companies will offer 0% interest for around 12 to 18 months if you transfer your balance over from a competitor. though there is usually a fee involved ― around 3% to 5% of the balance ― it's usually worth it to avoid accruing interest for a year or more. during this time, your payments will go 100% toward the principal, allowing you to pay it off faster.

doctors, nurses and specialists have been questioning the government's management of coronavirus, including a decision not to postpone local editions last sunday. doctors have also called for a policy of total containment and raised doubts over resourcing in hospitals.
that's different from what you said.
throughout u.s. history, black america has experienced combinations of discrimination, exploitation and federal government neglect. with the current furlough, black people are experiencing collateral damage from president trump's willingness to close swaths of the government unless he receives funding for a wall along the u.s. southern border. his decision affects all americans who rely on government's regular order, but black people are particularly vulnerable. these hardships represent a continuation of centuries-long trends. and for many black families and the communities they call home, these effects could be devastating.
#1 - assumptions vs. fresh facts. isaac asimov once said, your assumptions are your windows on the world. scrub them off every once in a while, or the light won't come in. as a leader, you are no doubt used to gathering data, swiftly digesting it and then quickly making day-to-day decisions based on preconceived notions and assumptions.

the sunrise movement is working with electoral groups such as justice democrats and climate hawks vote to identify progressive primary challengers to moderate incumbents who oppose a green new deal. early polling already shows the group could make a difference. democratic voters in new york's 4th congressional district, a densely populated swath of suburban long island, said they would support a primary challenger to popular rep. kathleen rice (d-n.y.) if she voted against a green new deal, according to survey data released last week.

but claiming the senate majority does offer democrats some reasonable grounds for optimism, should the clear electoral indications from tuesday hold. for the next two years, at least, president-elect joe biden's party will be able to control what bills receive votes and when. most importantly, democrats will have much greater influence over the federal response to the coronavirus pandemic and the economic support that must go hand-in-hand with national public health efforts.
ahead of confederation, the area now covered by saskatchewan and alberta was proposed by the then-northwest territories premier as a possible large province called buffalo.
ever since trump descended the escalator in trump tower in 2015 to announce his presidential campaign with vicious, racist rhetoric and the tagline make america great again, pundits and journalists have struggled to understand his appeal and the unthinking passion he inspired in the conservative base of the republican party and whether there was any true meaning or substance to what has been called trumpism. the routine error in this effort has been to treat trumpism as a fact to be understood intellectually or to be disputed. (not to say that refuting his lies is pointless.)

but saturday's show of force, arranged by organizing for bernie ― an upstart group founded by sanders campaign alumni and grassroots activists ― demonstrated one of the senator's biggest advantages if he decides to return to the ring: a network of supporters already familiar with his message and skilled in do-it-yourself internet organizing.

multiple irregularities undercut the integrity of the vote, the opposition and observers say. the ballots from the northeastern cities of beni and butembo, both hot spots of the ebola outbreak as well as opposition strongholds in the northeastern province of north kivu, will not even be counted until march ― months after the new president is expected to take office. the threat of ebola was the reason given for officially delaying the vote there, although the citizens then organized their own vote.
in the fall of 2014, toby neugebauer, a garrulous oil-and-gas billionaire from texas, took cruz and his campaign manager, jeff roe, to the breitbart embassy, the website's washington headquarters near the capitol. bannon flitted in and out. nix, as usual, did most of the talking. after neugebauer and roe visited scl's london headquarters, the cruz team agreed that ca could play a key role in their operation, running models and helping with research. however, it was made clear to rebekah and nix that the entire data analytics operation would be supervised by chris wilson, ceo of the research firm wpa. a source close to cruz told me that wilson's operation had played a crucial role when cruz ran for the senate with only 2 percent name recognition in texas and defeated a far better-known opponent. why, then, was ca necessary at all? no one ever said directly that the quid pro quo for hiring ca was that the mercers would support cruz, says someone close to roe. nevertheless, after ca was engaged, neugebauer took a private jet to the bahamas to meet robert mercer on the sea owl. when neugebauer asked him to donate to cruz's bid, robert was matter-of-fact. the family would start with $11 million.

several black candidates could be in a position to benefit from that early cash in 2022: abrams is all but certain to make a second bid for governor in georgia. former education secretary john king is expected to run for governor in maryland. wisconsin lt. gov. mandela barnes is seen as a likely senate candidate against gop sen. ron johnson. democrats could try to sway former charlotte mayor anthony foxx into joining the north carolina senate race, and kentucky rep. charles booker could challenge state sen. rand paul. the democratic governors association and the democratic senatorial campaign committee are both likely to recruit rep. val demings, a former orlando police chief, to run statewide in florida.
augmenting the banking union with a fiscal backstop will be a major task in the coming years, but it may be feasible provided europe's economic recovery continues and the banking sector undertakes sufficient restructuring measures.
even as the two agencies fought, there was no influential voice in trump's orbit pushing him to act swiftly on the pandemic. trump had surrounded himself with loyalists and few in the administration, including national security adviser robert o'brien, were able to redirect the president's attention. in mid-january, meetings were being held at the white house, but the focus was on getting u.s. government employees back from china, which was still playing down how contagious the virus was.
in michigan, gov. rick snyder, a republican, jan. 8 called for an increase in the state's personal exemption to offset the potential $1.5 billion in increased taxes that michigan taxpayers would have to pay without action. that proposal opened the door to more comprehensive tax change proposals by both republicans and democrats.

less than a month after the women's march inc. announced plans for the 2019 event, a white supremacist attacked a pittsburgh synagogue, killing 11 worshipers. the rise in hate crimes against jews — which the fbi says accounted for more than half of all hate crimes in 2017 — and the resurgence of neo-nazism meant that the issue would continue to plague women's march leaders, despite their statements of support for jewish victims, op-eds denouncing anti-semitism and participation in rallies against hate crime.
meanwhile, in new york, political will for higher taxes on the state's wealthiest residents is materializing among some key players. new york's state senate, which was effectively controlled by republicans until 2018, now has a democratic supermajority fueled by progressive and even socialist victories across two election cycles. and the state assembly, where democrats already had a veto-proof majority, has seen some of its more moderate members ousted by younger left-wing challengers.
these textbooks made this brand of nationalism more mainstream, said kathleen wellman, a southern methodist university history professor who is working on a book about the two christian publishers. i'm struck by how coherent of a worldview [the textbooks] promote and how thoroughly it resonates in current culture.
that bolsonaro had adopted an anti-corruption posture merely as a campaign tactic ― much like trump's promise to drain the swamp ― was evident even before he took office. bolsonaro's son, flávio, is already facing questions about potential corruption, and despite pledging that his government ministries would not include anyone convicted of corruption, bolsonaro has appointed at least seven people who have been or currently are involved in such scandals, according to the intercept. they include his chief of staff and his finance minister, paulo guedes ― the university of chicago–educated economist and free marketeer whose close ties to bolsonaro during the campaign gave brazil's business elite the assurances they needed to cozy up to the supposed populist.
president donald trump announced he's invoking the defense production act to ramp up production of medical supplies, such as ventilators and masks, needed to treat patients infected with the coronavirus.
after people called the website out on twitter, it took down a section of its terms and conditions that stipulated it could refuse to issue prizes to users who don't claim them within one hour. angry reviews on reddit and mystery brand's facebook page claim some users received fake merchandise or never got their prize items at all. critics, including controversial swedish youtube influencer pewdiepie, who has stoked outrage over his anti-semitic videos in the past, have raised another issue: in their promotional posts, paul and le curiously won items of far higher value than unsponsored users did in their mystery brand videos. le quickly won an $11,000 chanel purse which, according to odds listed on mysterybrand.net, he had a less than 0.17 percent chance of doing.

(clockwise, starting top right) jeff roe, ted cruz, alexander nix all modern political campaigns have to balance their need for exorbitant sums of money with the obsessions of the people who want to give them that money. roe, the straight-talking manager of the cruz operation, has observed that running a campaign is like trying to solve a rubik's cube of complicated personalities and uncomfortable dependencies. he has also told people that he is careful not to get too close to the donors who make his campaigns possible, because they can be so easily annoyed by the most trivial of things—his laugh, for instance, or the way he eats a bread roll. in the case of the cruz campaign, the donor obsession in question was cambridge analytica. and it wasn't long before roe and his team suspected that nix had promised them a more impressive product than he could deliver. on march 4, 2015, cruz, roe, wilson and others gathered in the hyatt in washington d.c. for an all-day meeting with nix and a group of ca senior executives. wilson took notes on his computer. according to multiple members of the cruz team, wilson was dismayed to learn that ca's models weren't fully ready for his focus groups the following week. as far as the team could tell, the only data ca possessed that the campaign didn't already have appeared to be culled from facebook. in addition, they recalled, ca hadn't set itself up with data trust, the republican national committee's repository of voter information.

if my life were following the kind of story arc you might see on tv, here's where i ― the black girl who wanted to be white ― would have finally been forced to admit that racism exists. i would have known it all along, of course, in part because of the very fact that i wanted so badly to be white in the first place. post-bushroot, i would have taken a hard look at all the other times i had experienced both covert and overt racism. i would have spoken out against the hurtful mascot joke of which i was the butt at syracuse. i would have sought solace from other people of color ― maybe even my own family members ― who might have understood and helped me deal with my pain.
and while the leaders of republican-run states like texas and georgia have sometimes been more eager to respond to their budget woes with spending cuts, leaders of democratic-run states are at odds over how best to proceed. in several deep blue states, liberal lawmakers and advocates are struggling to persuade centrist executives ― and voters ― of the need for the wealthiest residents to shoulder their share of the budget gap in the form of higher taxes.
the modern workplace also requires skills in sustainable ways of life, safety, understanding different cultures, multi-literacy and technology. the student body has a very important role when it comes to the school culture and the learning community. the law requires decision-makers at the local level to hear the students' voices prior to making important decisions. this is one way to encourage students to take responsibility, learn to take part in the decision-making process in society, and, in the big picture, to become responsible members of society.
mathews said that the government should seriously consider a cost-benefit analysis of this policy and called for more investment in better intelligence gathering by upgrading security infrastructure in relatively poorer states. he also asked the government to minimise the impact of internet shutdowns on common people by making its execution more granular in nature.

it's unclear how long democrats can remain united in blocking legislation from coming to the floor. whereas nearly a dozen democratic senators have pledged to filibuster all unrelated bills ― following the urging of sen. chris van hollen (d-md.) ― from coming to the floor, others are reserving judgment on future legislation.
it would be naive to think working from home doesn't come with its share of obstacles. fortunately, steps can be taken to smooth out the process:

the 1st of january 2017 marked the 18th anniversary of the european common currency, the euro. despite its success from 1999 to 2007, after 2008 the euro has become a burden for many of its members. for example, living standards in italy and greece are below the levels when they joined the euro. finland is the only nordic country using the euro and it is also the only nordic country which has not yet recovered from the financial crash of 2008.

at that hearing, jorjani, by then interior's principal deputy solicitor, told lawmakers that i myself don't review foias or make determinations. it was a baffling statement from the person who oversaw the department's freedom of information act program as the designated chief foia officer, per a 2018 order from then-interior secretary ryan zinke.
a recent profile of d'vorkin in the columbia journalism review, titled la journalism's 'prince of darkness,' noted that even those who speak positively about him acknowledge he can be difficult, threatening, and, in the words of one writer who worked with d'vorkin for more than four years and actually likes him, 'without journalistic ethic.' though d'vorkin has been in his position for only a few months, he's made sure to leave a mark, with one employee noting that he's at war with the entire staff. it's incredible.
the first women's march, in 2017, was a reaction to the election and inauguration of president trump. the following year, it was a push for the polls for the 2018 midterm election. this year, with no upcoming national election, the movement has had to rethink its purpose — amid ongoing controversy over connections between some of its leaders and the anti-semitic, anti-gay nation of islam leader louis farrakhan. some women who have marched before are sitting it out or attending separate rallies unaffiliated with the national organization. thousands of others, though, will be in washington, d.c., on saturday.

alexandria presents a challenge, because conservative men or men in general who are encouraged to objectify women are attracted to her, but she's also 'unmanageable' in that she doesn't exist for them, heldman said. she is a woman who not only has now formal power, but a lot of informal power, in that she doesn't give a damn what they think of her. i think it's a disconcerting place for men who may be used to attractive women seeking their validation.

those who will be pardoned will not return to jail ... almost half of those security-related prisoners will be pardoned as well, government spokesman gholamhossein esmaili said wednesday.
jayapal has said she hopes a version will get a floor vote, although that seems a long ways off. the committees taking up the proposal initially aren't actually the ones that would write a health care bill. even so, the hearings could represent the most serious attention the concept has received on capitol hill since the late 1940s, when committees took up then-president harry truman's similarly designed, but ill-fated national health insurance proposal.

there's a mass feeling across the public… that trump has walked away from what are perceived as american values, and that's gotten a huge reception both from people who were organized and active in politics and people who weren't, hurlburt said. she sees sanders and warren seeking to wed that concern to the issue they are best known for highlighting domestically, economic inequality.

this deserves nothing but derision and contempt. he interpreted a popular vote loss and an ec fluke win as a mandate for the most extreme anti-immigrant agenda of modern times. he kept it up after a drubbing in midterms that he himself made all about trump's policies. https://t.co/bujanpuydl — greg sargent (@theplumlinegs) january 20, 2021

professor gary mortimer from qut business school suggested coronavirus is the nail in the coffin for an already fragile sector and sephora's move to shut down beauty services will have a knock-on effect. when we start to see beauty salons and cosmetic houses cancel services or lay off staff then the next category of effected retail will be apparel, footwear, clothing and accessory retailers who are already doing it tough, mortimer told huffpost australia. we've just seen colette go into voluntary administration and bardot. some sydney nail salons have requested that clients wear face masks to avoid the spread of the virus. local sydney woman emmalee fagerstrom, 27, said she noticed her local salon in redfern was taking precautionary measures when she visited last friday. as soon as i walked in i saw everyone was wearing face masks which i thought was interesting because that is not always the case at the salon, she told huffpost australia. the manicurist asked me to wash my hands and then gave me a mask to wear for the entirety of the appointment. everyone was wearing masks.
the taxes and premiums would be in lieu of what private individuals and employers pay for insurance today, so that, advocates say, a majority would come out ahead. but exactly how many would depend on the budget arithmetic in the rest of the program. if the cuts in payments to doctors and hospitals aren't deep enough, for example, the whole program would end up more expensive, requiring bigger taxes and swelling the ranks of people who would feel worse off financially.
hughes did get a little bit of money from a member of her activist group, so she and her son took the bus to cvs to buy a few treats for themselves, like new gloves, a toy piano you can play with your feet and santa hats for him and her 18-year-old daughter who lives nearby.
in any event, we have not finished paying for the consequences of the financial crisis. if history is any indication, trade deals, which are always better in the multilateral format (such as under the wto), are the world's best hope for avoiding another global recession.
we know diaper need is a serious, widespread problem, but while our existing government support programs work around the edges to define the problem, we still don't actually address it. california alone is home to about 2.5 million children under age five. one third live in single parent households, and the number of low income working families with children is more than one-in-five and rising. medicaid currently covers over 1/3 of all births in the u.s. each year, and perhaps not surprisingly 1 in 3 u.s. moms report suffering from diaper need.
there was little agreement among members of his own party on capitol hill if he could or should bypass congress with an emergency declaration, however.
regardless, china's abilities in space are growing to the extent that is reflected in popular culture. in andy weir's 2011 novel the martian and its later film version, nasa turns to china to help rescue its stranded astronaut. while competition can lead to advances in technology, as the first space race demonstrated, a greater global capacity for space exploration can also be beneficial not only for saving stranded astronauts but increasing knowledge about the universe where we all live. even if china's rise heralds a new space race, not all consequences will be negative.
we are moving forward, but we are not moving forward in a detrimental impact to our economy as what the paris climate accord would have called for, wheeler said. we are reducing our co2 emissions faster than most other developed countries. we have our own plan. we're moving forward. we're addressing the issue.

week by week, many christians in political power seem to try to one-up the bigotry and oppression of their colleagues. it's the now-proverbial hold-my-beer ideology, with those christians vying to be the most powerful and, by consequence, the most oppressive and violent. the sad reality is that significant elements of christianity in the united states are entrenched in political power, on sundays teaching that jesus loves everybody but then moralizing people out of the gospel that they say is free.

the general counsel serves a 4-year term and is not normally fired when a new president takes office, even from a different political party. robb's term is scheduled to end in november 2021. firing him instead would allow biden to install a new general counsel more friendly to workers and unions right away.
although the supreme court has issued some important privacy-protective decisions in recent years, such as requiring a warrant to attach a gps tracker or search a cell phone, it has yet to address the privacy of modern electronic communications like email or cell phone location information. it can take the court decades to fully appreciate new technology. in the early 20th century, for example, the court allowed police to listen in on phone calls without a warrant because they were only using their sense of hearing, not intruding into a home. it was not until 1967 -- some 40 years later -- that the court reversed itself and required a warrant for phone taps.

imagine living in a part of louisiana or texas that's prone to devastating hurricanes and flooding, karlan said. what would you think if you lived there and your governor asked for a meeting with the president to discuss getting disaster aid that congress has provided for? what would you think if that president said, 'i would like you to do us a favor? i'll meet with you, and send the disaster relief, once you brand my opponent a criminal.'

i think there's a number of alternatives and decision points throughout a process like this, and it doesn't have to be all like h.r. 1 or all like other proposals that have been discussed in the past, camp said. obviously, the kinds of assumptions i made in putting together h.r. 1 aren't necessarily the same assumptions you might make today.

the general counsel of the nlrb may be an obscure official to most americans, but what biden chooses to do about robb could be a bellwether for how he governs ― as a consensus-making moderate who wants to play nice with republicans, or as a hard-nosed progressive who wants to deliver for labor unions and other allies.
the next big challenge will come when supply ramps up, in late winter or early spring, and vaccines become available to a much larger swath of the public. at that point, the upper limit on vaccines will depend less on the amount of vaccine available and more on the ability to deliver it. the current plan is to use existing providers ― not just pharmacies, but also clinics, independent medical practices, and sometimes schools and employers ― and to supplement them with government-managed mass vaccination centers.

while the goals of the u.n. proposal are clear, the draft offers few details about how nations can implement actions necessary to halt current declines. among other things, it urges parties to integrate biodiversity values into national and local planning and notes that governments and societies need to determine priorities and allocate financial and other resources, internalize the value of nature and recognize the cost of inaction.

clearly we're seeing a lot of momentum right now, said dustin weeden, senior policy analyst with the state higher education executive officers association, an advocacy group based in boulder, colorado.
it's not clear if the extension would include caregiving leave; about 13 percent of californians who seek paid leave need it to look after sick spouses, partners, children or parents, according to the state's data.
density can't even explain how the pandemic erupted within cities. in new york, the boroughs of bronx and queens have up to three times more deaths than manhattan despite having half the population density. the same pattern has appeared everywhere from chicago to seattle to nashville: coronavirus outbreaks infect front-line workers, minorities, the poor and mask-deniers, regardless of how high their apartments are stacked on top of each other.
gamestop, the video game chain that operates 5,800 stores across the country, has been instructing its employees to keep stores open. executives consider the chain essential retail alongside grocery stores and pharmacies, which have been allowed to remain open even in areas hit hardest by the outbreak.
fortifying the border is just going to lead to more deaths, said elissa steglich, a law professor at the university of texas at austin who teaches a clinic for immigrant families. [it's] giving business to sophisticated smugglers who are going to be taking migrants through more perilous and life-threatening circumstances.
though he has so far refused to answer any questions, d'vorkin has been plenty busy asking them. according to multiple current and former employees, d'vorkin is still livid about an article that appeared in the new york times in november. that paper had obtained a recording of a meeting in which d'vorkin forbade los angeles times staffers from recirculating their own recent investigation into disney's business ties with the city of anaheim. a couple of months later, npr obtained a recording of a second meeting, in which d'vorkin berated his staff for the first leak: at its core, it was unethical. and frankly, i think it showed a degree that whoever was involved was morally bankrupt.
president obama and the pentagon insist that using drones in pursuit of terrorists causes minimal civilian casualties and protects american troops, but grady flores takes issue with that justification. she told us she had been moved, in particular, by reports of the staggering numbers of civilians killed by us drones, and she says her fears were confirmed by documents recently leaked to journalists at the intercept revealing that during one five-month stretch, 90 percent of those killed in one part of northeastern afghanistan were not the intended target.
prime minister hwang kyo-ahn was appointed acting president and will remain in that post until the election. he called on park's supporters and opponents to put their differences aside to prevent deeper division.
we are confident president obama is as appalled by the citizens united decision today as indicated in his first state of the union, perhaps more so given the grotesque displays of influence buying we've seen since, said common cause communications director scott swenson. in many ways democracy/political reform makes sense for the white house to lead on as voters start to turn their attention to choosing his successor.
reached by email, frederick directed huffpost to his law firm. the firm declined to comment.
biden kicked off his presidential run on the wrong side of a climate movement. young activists were leading the push for a more ambitious federal approach, against the backdrop of dire united nations projections on global warming. in may 2019, reuters reported that biden was carving out a middle ground climate policy that would likely face heavy resistance from green activists.
that was painful. i never thought they'd take him from me. if i'd have known, i would have stayed and faced the violence in my country, rather than have them take my son. when they took him, the first thing the officer told me was that they were going to put him up for adoption for a family here in the united states. that was painful. if i'd have known that they would take away my kid like that, i wouldn't have come.
more than 113,000 people have been infected worldwide from the virus, far more than those sickened by sars, mers or ebola in recent years. more than 4,000 have died.
but press him for a clear, unambiguous example of nearly anything, and dorsey shuts down. at one point, for instance, dorsey explained that twitter was working toward using machine learning to spot harassment before it's even reported. when asked how twitter is handling the problem in the meantime, dorsey had this to say:
aapi victims' reluctance to talk about or report fraud could be due to cultural barriers. according to nacpa, they may not report fraud because of immigration status, cultural behavior (such as a tendency to stay silent) or a belief that endurance and suffering is a virtue.
from an employee's perspective, you feel bad about taking vacation, wagadia said. most people thrive in knowing what they have, and how much they have, and how they can utilize it. there could also be a cultural expectation that you don't take long vacations. an employee taking a month off at a time in their first year could be considered a red flag by managers, she noted.
a similar trend is beginning to transform the transportation sector. in 2016, more than one million electric vehicles were sold, and new sales continue to exceed projections.
we have to give people the right to vote for the leaders they want directly, tedjo said. it's an antiquated system.
others who wore black to the baftas included:
debbie berkowitz, a worker safety expert at the national employment law project, told huffpost in an email that the implications of the guidance are larger than they seem. she said it would lead employers outside of health care to not consider any of these [infections] work-related and therefore something they can prevent.
one of the conference's scheduled speakers is mohammad javad zarif, iran's minister of foreign affairs.
this was the catastrophic and prophetic culmination of the make america great again myth.
but a large share of new york city's locally produced electricity is generated by two power plants in the densely populated northwestern corner of queens that constantinides represents. the plants, located in the councilman's native astoria and neighboring long island city, each burn a mix of gas and fuel oil. the stations annually burn a combined 6.3 million gallons of no. 6 fuel oil ― a thick, viscous blend considered one of the most polluting energy sources in the world. the long island city plant, called ravenswood generating station, was ranked the state's largest carbon polluter in 2014.
intelligence agencies have been warning on this since january, a u.s. official told the post of the intelligence reporting, which was sent to trump administration officials as well as members of congress. donald trump may not have been expecting this, but a lot of other people in the government were — they just couldn't get him to do anything about it.
alaska airlines also announced that passengers will not be allowed to leave their seats in the 60 minutes before landing and after takeoff from washington-area airports.
donald trump's administration has faced sharp bipartisan criticism for its new policy of separating children from parents who bring them into the country without authorization. as he deals with a hefty political fallout, he has falsely put the onus on democrats.
the house voted 232-197 on wednesday to impeach trump for his role in inciting last week's deadly insurrection at the capitol, making him the first u.s. officeholder to be impeached twice. the 10 politicians who crossed the aisle for the vote included reps. liz cheney of wyoming, the third-ranking house republican.
in reality, an extension to article 50 – the two-year legal timetable for brexit – would be needed to allow more time for negotiations with the new government.
house democrats impeached the president because they hate him and want to do as much damage as they can, graham said. the evangelist accused the 10 republicans who sided with the democrats of joining in the feeding frenzy.
i can't overstate as an operative how hard it is to scale up a field program of this size in such a condensed time period, roberts said.
ueslei marcelino / reuters tiririca, a brazilian comedian and member of the lower house of congress, is congratulated after voting in favor of the impeachment of president dilma rousseff in brasilia, on april 17, 2016.

the 34-page proposal stringer laid out sunday would transform the five boroughs, glazing the rooftops with solar panels and battery units, prioritizing bike lanes and pedestrian walkways over highways, and providing new programs to make electricity cheaper and green jobs more plentiful for the city's squeezed working class.
gabbard's language is that of the old left, holding up the u.s. government as obsessed with unwisely projecting its influence, often for the sake of monied interests ― and, she asserts, in secretive risky ways ― while neglecting its own people at home. it's a mode that echoes the kind of anti-elite talk that trump built his campaign around while he lied about his past position on the invasion of iraq. (why have politicians of both parties gotten americans trapped in these far-away places?)
the federal government typically follows a cost-recovery model but in 2006, under stephen harper's conservative government, that policy was also set aside for a massive evacuation effort.
if international attention is not enough to force institutional leaders to change their behavior, what is? morgan mccaul, university of michigan student and nassar survivor

there will be a whole bunch of new riders who come into the system if they leave their car at home, which is really good news for climate change.
the revelation of jorjani's exchange with hooks reaffirms that the trump administration was dead set on politicizing a board that should have been solely focused on supporting america's national parks, jayson o'neill, deputy director of the western values project, said in a statement earlier this month, before the ribbentrop news.

i think it is just realistic to know that there are some of them who will not be coming home in the coming weeks, trudeau said.
be sure your horses have access to a barn or a three-sided run-in, so they can escape the wind and cold. while not all horses will need to be blanketed, blankets will help horses keep warm and dry, especially if there is any rain or snow. if you've body-clipped your horses, keep them blanketed throughout the winter. also, be sure to feed your horses more forage ― unlimited amounts, if possible ― during extreme cold. this will help your horses create heat and regulate their body temperatures.
it is possible bolsonaro will govern as a true autocrat ― that he could take advantage of any small crisis to consolidate power and sweep aside democracy in a single act. he could close congress; he could criminalize the workers' party and other leftist opposition parties and movements; he could criminalize dissent, protest and the free press.
the example described above applied to a relatively low-risk transaction that carried a very modest mortgage insurance premium. the transaction assumed a single-family home, a purchase for occupancy, and a credit score of 800.
the staff at the mandalay bay resort and casino in las vegas either interacted with mass shooter stephen paddock or entered his room at least 10 times before the night he killed 58 people at a music festival from his suite, a hotel representative has reportedly revealed. the day of the october attack, paddock had a room service delivery and a housekeeping call, the hotel said.

correction: a previous version of this story indicated that rep. nita lowey (d-n.y.) is the ranking democrat on the house committee responsible for drafting annual spending bills. in fact, she chairs the committee.
meteorologists blame the region's extreme temperatures on a high-pressure system known as a heat dome that's covering the indian ocean. per noaa, a heat dome occurs when hot air is trapped underneath a high-pressure system that acts as a lid and forces the hot air back down toward the earth's surface, where it becomes even warmer.
a spokesman for jackson lee's office initially referred questions to rushing, who did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
when an editorial staffer raised an objection to someone from the business side running accounts that were supposed to represent the news outlet, according to an employee, strauss said simply: we're all on the same team. we all work for the l.a. times. when the employee noted again that the two sides were supposed to be separate, strauss said that they would take the conversation offline and discuss it later. they did not discuss it later.

just like the three bears' porridge, mr. trudeau's modus operandi goes like this: well, the ndp have one suggestion that's too cold. as for the conservatives, theirs is too hot! mercy me, what to do?! i guess we have no choice but to chose the one that's just right. mine.
entering into a mixed-orientation marriage or remaining celibate were held up as the only acceptable goal to achieve throughout my youth and young adult life, and continue to be held up as the standard, carlston told huffpost.
but jeremy corbyn had already beaten her to the punch, tabling his own emergency motion to demand a general election.
i don't act on all of his comments. i listen, and i think that's the most important thing. i was introduced to him by a friend, and you know, he's got interesting points. i don't obviously agree with most. but, i think the perspective is interesting.
for better or worse (usually worse for the animals), adorable pet babies are a gift idea associated with easter. in addition to the question as to whether unexpected livestock or woodland creatures are a good idea, if you're going to go pet shopping for the holiday, beware that scammers are lying in wait to grab your money and disappear into thin air. whenever buying a pet, do it in person.
chris, these are policy differences, mulvaney said. these are things that you think the country should look one way, we think it should look another. these are differences of style, the way the president speaks, he added. did he misspeak at charlottesville? yes. should he have corrected it? yes. did he handle it poorly? yes. it's not something people resign over. watch the full interview on fox news below:

one of the undesired results of the lava jato case ― this confrontation of corruption ― is a very extreme polarization of the public debate in brazil, said bruno brandão, the brazil director of transparency international. it also discredited the political system and the political class. and more worrisome, it discredited the democratic system itself.
to add to the multiple impacts, most locations in western europe are ringed by nuclear targets such as power stations or cities, so whatever the weather or wind condition, radioactive fallout is likely. you may receive a lethal dose inside a few hours but may not experience any symptoms until days possibly up to a week later. radiation sickness causes vomiting, diarrhoea and internal bleeding. children and the elderly are more vulnerable and more likely to suffer or die.

after registering online for an individual annual membership (which was $10 for single women and $75 for single men or couples), we read the lifestyle rules while waiting for our e-passes. the club was byob with a strict no-drug policy. you left your bottle of choice with the bartender, and the club supplied the mixers.
under the affordable care act, tax credits are available to people whose incomes are up to four times the poverty line, or $48,500 for an individual and $100,400 a year for a family of four. people with higher incomes can find coverage difficult, if not impossible, to afford ― even in california, where the marketplace is considered among the most successful in the country.
the main concern for me is that, because china is very big, and places outside big cities are quite conservative, there are lots of gay people who only learn about their sexuality online, hao told reuters.
but pompeo's final visit schedule in brussels was not going to involve any meetings with the eu or any public events at nato. a third diplomatic source said allies were embarrassed by pompeo after the violence in washington last wednesday.

and now, trump's focus on the wall and several policy changes have led to humanitarian problems of his own making.
the declaration's site urges people to contribute their own ideas on how to move forward.
india also passed the protection of children from sexual offenses act in 2012, an unprecedented law in the country that outlines specific punishments for different types of sexual abuse against minors. but humanitarian activists say crimes like the 2014 rape of a 6-year-old girl in bangalore highlight the need for stricter implementation.

conservatives' bizarre, escalating obsession with rep. alexandria ocasio-cortez (d-n.y.) reached a new level this week when the daily caller published fake revenge porn of the new congresswoman.
fresh moves to create more female labour mps were also set to be adopted, with more all-women shortlists for parliamentary selections ahead of any snap general election. a new plan to crack down on anti-semitic and racist abuse was also approved. expanding the nec to include 39 members is a key move in ensuring it reflects the corbyn-supporting membership. at present, just six seats are reserved for constituency labour party (clp) representatives, while 12 go to trade unions. under the changes, there will be nine clp reps, and an extra union seat, to reflect shopworkers' union usdaw's large membership. key ally and momentum founder jon lansman told the indepdendent this week: out of 35 members, half a million members have just six representatives. it's absurd.
my two daughters aren't even close to dating age yet, but when they are, i plan to tell them they can bring anyone to our house (boy or girl), and i'll do my part to make them feel comfortable and welcomed. of course, if these guests engage in behavior that make my daughters unhappy or uncomfortable, i'll address it accordingly, just like any well-adjusted grownup should. and it won't entail waving a gun around like yosemite sam.
and canada's top public health official said what the science shows at the moment is that closing borders didn't work for other countries, and what's more important is how the society works together.
he's been an outlier for years, there's a deal to be had, he added.
while there are examples of people being released and going on to commit other crimes ― as trump noted ― multiple researchers have found there is no link between sanctuary policies and crime.
gymnastics is not football. devoted though gymnastics fans are, they are far fewer in number than football fans, and no sport in america compares to football's monetary value. the nfl is a $7 billion-a-year industry, and football is a fixture of sunday afternoons ― and friday nights, and saturday afternoons and some monday nights. also some thursdays.
everybody's got cheap dirt — but do you have skilled workers? winograd said. that's the question states face as they recruit new industry.
fallacies, i explained to students, all attempt to divert the argument away from sound reasoning to some unconnected and irrelevant side-issue. i was always sure to add that we should avoid their use, not exploit their power.

the ultimate goal of the buy canadian promotion campaign is to get canadians to seek and identify more canadian-made products to a domestic audience. the notice states the campaign should tell the story of canada's agri-food sector and reach audiences on an emotional level.

on this flight, i was left literally speechless, pavelka told the standard. one single banana arrived.
but extending the anti-discrimination policy to government contactors could prompt a backlash in the republican-controlled legislature. house speaker ron ryckman jr., a conservative kansas city-area republican, said lawmakers will probably review the order because it applies to private businesses.
they're supposed to be educational programs, right. that's what they're supposed to do, they're supposed to help kids who can't ― who don't get fed at home, get fed so they do better at school. guess what? there's no demonstrable evidence they're actually doing that.
in this they would be imitating republican leaders, who got in bed with trump back in 2016 knowing he was their best bet for achieving long-standing conservative economic and foreign policy goals.
still, the findings raise important policy questions as american higher education continues to evolve and re-invent itself. for example:
voridis has been quoted as saying he supports gay people despite voting against the 2015 law.
mystery brand is like gambling. it was very addictive, yael said. but it's just a scam. in messages viewed by huffpost, he contacted the website several times to request an update or refund. a representative who goes by the name tim perk repeatedly assured yael, month after month, everything regarding your order is fine, and [it] should be coming soon!
was warren wrong to release dna test results showing that she had a native ancestor? are tribal leaders and native people mad? it depends on whom you talk to. in the group that huffpost surveyed, the answer to both those questions was overwhelmingly no.
although no other state appears to have publicly suggested it will consider legal status in its immunization campaign, nebraska's plan has heightened fears among undocumented communities across the country.
the legislative election that would have followed the unofficial primaries was postponed by a year by hong kong chief executive carrie lam, who cited the public health risks during the coronavirus pandemic. mass resignations and disqualifications of pro-democracy lawmakers have left the legislature largely a pro-beijing body.
the stakes of the caucus results are especially high for buttigieg, who had hoped a strong performance in the state would prove his appeal beyond the predominantly white states of iowa and new hampshire.
there's been a growing recognition that many of the central concerns of the democratic party, namely on inequality and regional inequality, are being driven by concentration and a lack of antitrust enforcement, zach freed, a researcher at the institute for local self-reliance, an anti-monopoly nonprofit, said.
as with so many things in this presidency and president, the question is whether trump is drinking his own kool-aid, election law expert rick hasen wrote on slate monday. reading the entire one-hour rambling call transcript, it is hard to know if trump actually believes the fever swamp of debunked conspiracy theories about the election or whether he's just using the false claims as a cover to get the political results he wants.
the global health response will have cost an estimated $129 million by the end of january, and with the outbreak expected to last months after that, they will need tens of millions more.
volkswagen, also in an emailed statement, issued an apology for the inappropriate behavior and for the poor judgment of individuals who were involved. the carmaker has also pledged to never test with animals again, reuters reported.

like at every democratic debate, the health care fight wednesday was about medicare for all, and, drum roll please, how the country can pay for it.
assembly bill 717 would exempt diapers from sales tax like in seven other states, a simple bit of financial relief for new parents that can add up to the cost of a full month of diapers annually. while the policy isn't explicitly need-based in the same way as the calworks voucher in assembly bill 492 that i have also authored, we all agree sales tax is an extremely regressive tax that impacts working families the hardest, costing them upwards of $100 annually on diapers alone.
durbin also called for homeland security secretary kirstjen nielsen to resign.
poor scott walker. all he wanted to do was lie to children and brag about it without consequences. — choz (@chozraham) january 15, 2019
first, as with most industries, there's automation, which has reduced the number of jobs available in the energy sector over the last several years. when oil prices crashed in 2014, the houston area shed some 86,000 oil and gas jobs and by 2019 had regained only 24,400 of those jobs. why? in large part because in the wake of the crash, oil companies became more efficient and began to embrace automation in a big way.
the threatening phone call to raffensperger in many ways mirrors the phone call trump made to ukraine president volodymyr zelensky in july 2019 that led to his impeachment. on the call with zelensky, trump pressured the foreign president to publicly announce a corruption investigation into biden by threatening to withhold congressionally approved military aid from the country.
they also praised how teck went about engaging with indigenous communities during the project development and review period.
the u.k. is struggling with a sharp spike in new cases as a result of a new virus variant that officials said could be up to 70% more infectious.
illinois and michigan are introducing legislation that would require a warrant for police to use cell phone trackers -- often called stingrays -- that mimic cell phone towers and trick nearby phones into revealing private data. nebraska's measure would ban their use entirely. michigan and nebraska are also introducing bills to set more stringent rules for automated license plate readers, or alprs, which can sweep up location information on millions of innocent drivers and send it to a database for long-term retention and data-mining.
one piece of advice i've been repeating on a regular basis to people who are concerned is, 'what are you doing right now to manage your risk from regular flu?' said don schaffner, extension specialist in food science and distinguished professor at rutgers university. many of the current recommendations for avoiding transmission of covid-19 are similar.
luisa was supposed to be a skater, like her two older siblings. but she sought an escape from hours spent shivering in the bleachers at the summit sports & ice complex, and she found one on the other side of the facility: twistars. as a toddler, she'd watch the big girls (the oldest of whom were only 17 or 18) flip, twist and soar. i want to do that, she'd say, and by age 4 she was out there with them, bouncing around in the little kids' area and making googly eyes at the big girls, some of whom were gymnastics celebrities.
viruses and other pathogens evolving is one of the challenges when it comes to managing and curing them, but it happens often.
i'm not going to talk about particulars. we've established protocol, it's transparent. it's out there for everyone to read. we have, independent of the u.s. president, we have conversations with all governments. it's not just limited to this one.
the stakes have drawn hundreds of millions of dollars in campaign spending to a once solidly republican state that now finds itself as the nation's premier battleground. biden won georgia's 16 electoral votes by about 12,000 votes out of 5 million cast in november, though trump continues pushing false assertions of widespread fraud that even his now-former attorney general and georgia's republican secretary of state — along with a litany of state and federal judges — have said did not happen.
both sides saw relatively little hope of persuading voters after tens of millions of dollars had already been spent on television advertising in the general election. ossoff's campaign tested more than a dozen negative messages about perdue, and a dozen negative messages they thought the republican would deploy against ossoff. none had a significant impact on the electorate.
frederick's defenders say the progressive victories under his belt should outweigh his work for shell. he won decisions in favor of tyson foods workers after the meatpacking giant didn't pay them their proper wages, and against tobacco companies advertising light cigarettes as safer.
this post originally appeared on off the charts, the center on budget and policy priorities' blog.
the fact is, however, that george washington never said what fischer claimed he said. in his farewell address, washington made a far more generic point. he said, of all the dispositions and habits which lead to political prosperity, religion and morality are indispensable supports. in vain would that man claim the tribute of patriotism, who should labour to subvert these great pillars of human happiness, these firmest props of the duties of men & citizens. hardly the rousing defense of jesus christ fischer claims.
a leader should be bringing people together, he continually tries to divide people.
our nation's founders understood that protection from government snooping on our person, our papers, our beliefs, and our associations was a cornerstone of liberty. but that bedrock understanding has been eclipsed. congress has allowed inflated fears of terrorism to justify unprecedented encroachments on americans' privacy, from the 2001 usa patriot act right up to the cybersecurity legislation the u.s. house of representatives shoe-horned into the must-pass budget bill last month.
on a separate note: how scared are you about members of congress being attacked ― or worse ― at the inauguration? what's your level of fear? what was it last week? and what is it now?
wilde reportedly then exited the project and replied, i'm out, after labeouf's response. her name no longer appears on the credits for the video.

as we continue to address and mitigate various economic and social issues afflicting our fellow american citizens, we need to think more holistically. because we have an economic system based on our natural resources, many economic policies should have an environmental component. our social institutions exist in relation to one another and to both our economic system and the ecosystem, so the natural environment should be a consideration in the development of social policy as well. including the environment into social and economic policies and understanding these intricacies will help us to build healthier communities, respect diverse cultures and peoples, and promote meaningful economic development.

one problem with the idea that democrats need to put more pressure on trump is that trump has already been under pressure to release his tax returns for two and a half years. in 2016, he flouted decades of precedent by keeping secret the kind of tax information that presidential candidates traditionally disclose, to reveal personal details such as their sources of income, how much tax they pay and how much they give to charity.

leading up to bushroot, i had spent nearly two decades as a girl who was half-black but hellbent on being seen as fully white. from as early as i can remember, i harbored the belief that in white america, there was a minimum threshold that a human had to meet before the rest of society even considered whether that person could be cute, beautiful, sexy, professional and successful. and that threshold was ... whiteness. the way i saw it (and the way the world had made me see it), if you didn't look white, well then you better hope to be super talented at something that white america valued.

one native politician irked by warren said the situation was just embarrassing.
that's not surprising, said sharry aiken, an expert on immigration and refugee law at queen's university.
when people ask me why we're not married (which they do constantly), my usual response is, we would be if we could be. unfortunately, it's just not that easy. we are currently working with an immigration attorney, but javier's case is complicated and having a lawyer is expensive. because javier entered this country without documentation, he would need to reenter the united states with documentation in order for us to get married. however, if the government finds out he's lived in america without documentation, he could be barred from the united states for 10 years before he could attempt to legally enter. that would mean he'd be forced to live in mexico for at least a decade without me or his daughter. it would also mean losing the income he's currently bringing in, which is roughly triple what he would make working outside the united states.

i feel the sunrise movement and their proposed green new deal is a genuinely exciting new development, ed maibach, a climate communications researcher at george mason university, said by email. if the folks in the sunrise movement get out there and sell their idea to americans before their opponents attempt to shoot it down, 2019 may prove to be an unexpectedly auspicious moment for climate solutions in america.
civil rights leaders like dr. martin luther king jr. and rep. john lewis fought hard to move our nation forward on civil rights. courageous women like sojourner truth, susan b. anthony and ida b. wells fought for women to have the rights we have today. and throughout the course of history, here and abroad, men and women have died to stand up against despots, dictators and those who sought to pursue paths of ethnic cleansing. our job today is to honor those who came before us by refusing to go backward. our job today is to stand clearly for a moral center that this president has shunned.

my wife had a really rough 2018. her best friend died in a drunk driving accident, and her mom was diagnosed with cancer. she and i have always lived a fit and healthy lifestyle, but her depression has gotten really bad. she's distant with our kids, has stopped exercising and has (and i really don't mean to sound like a jerk) gained a worrying amount of weight. my wife is normally a superwoman kind of mom ― she goes to work every day, cooks and cleans, reads stories to our daughters every night, and is at every ballet and soccer practice. i'm helping out as much as i can, but it's been challenging. i love my wife and want to help her start off the new year on the right foot and get her mental and physical health back. i'm not even sure she realizes how bad it's gotten. what can i do?

each month, after bills (wifi, electricity, car insurance, credit cards), i have a couple of hundred dollars to spare, which often goes toward eating out and doing college student things. i'm not perfect with money, but i'm learning, and i do my job because it means i can afford to learn and still live a comfortable life. learning how to be good at money is a process, and your life shouldn't be at risk if you don't get it right the first time.

but i recognized too a fierce longing in myself, a nearly wild desire to see the highest, hardest glass ceiling shattered at last. in clinton's general election platform, the lack of ambitious, visionary policies that could measurably better the lives of americans was palpable. but at the moment she took to the podium at the democratic national convention, swathed in white, standing before the nation with the force of centuries of history and longing behind her, i was struck by the undeniable power of the moment. i felt a shiver to my core.

times of rising unemployment and shrinking incomes tend to lead to large increases in medicaid enrollment as people find themselves with less or no earnings and become eligible for the program. that leads to higher medicaid spending. and a nationwide outbreak of a highly contagious virus that can lead to tens of thousands of dollars in medical costs will drive spending even higher this time. during the recession that began at the end of the last decade, millions of americans enrolled in medicaid.

some parts of that agenda clearly wouldn't fit under any close reading of the rules. the most obvious example would be a voting rights bill that, however worthy, would have only the most tenuous connection to government finances. proposals that would fit more clearly under reconciliation guidelines include large swaths of biden's climate and health care agendas. key elements of proposed covid-19 relief measures, including the $2,000 relief checks, aid to state and local government and new vaccine funding, would likely fit easily into reconciliation as well.

this week we commemorated the work of dr. martin luther king, jr., who strove for equity of law and equal opportunities for african american men and women across the united states. the principles for which he advocated may be applied across to women and to members of other ethnic, racial, and sexual minority groups. dreaming of peace and security within the institutional framework under which we exist -- the law -- should not be unrealistic. for members of more privileged populations this has been less of an issue, but there still are important populations of american democracy who struggle with access to equal opportunities and protection under the law.

to be sure, the political climate was different in the mid-1980s. tax reform had been percolating in congress for years, and in 1982 democratic sen. bill bradley of new jersey and rep. richard gephardt of missouri sponsored a bill that proposed to close loopholes for the rich and cut marginal tax rates for all income brackets. though that measure never made it to a vote, president ronald reagan, in his state of the union address in january 1984, pledged to reform the tax code. the following year, reagan reiterated his pledge and democrats thought it wise to join in.

in a practical sense, then, the ultimate limit on what democrats can do through reconciliation isn't so much process as it is politics ― specifically, the ability of democratic leaders like house speaker nancy pelosi (calif.) and incoming senate majority leader charles schumer (n.y.) to keep their caucuses united.

initially, the disease wasn't readily transmitted from person to person and all patients had visited the market believed to be the source of the outbreak. but the virus appears to have mutated, giving it the ability to transmit more easily between people and having infected some health-care workers. however, all transmissions are still first and secondary. that means so far, people who got sick either went to the market or were in contact with someone who was at the market, which has been closed for disinfection since jan. 1. no one has gotten it from third or fourth degree transmission, hoffman said.

one can understand why early humans held such beliefs. they were ignorant of the causes of natural disasters or of disease outbreaks. if an earthquake or epidemic occurred, someone, some agent, had to be responsible, and as these events were beyond human powers, the gods had to be responsible. and just as we can sometimes soothe the anger of a fellow human by offering a gift and asking for forgiveness, so too one could placate an angry god by the appropriate show of deference and submission.
ready your tractors and plows—the farm bill is upon us. this omnibus package of legislation, reauthorized every 5 to 7 years, shapes virtually every aspect of our food and agricultural system. yet this wide-ranging, $500 billion piece of legislation, which aims to ensure a safe and sufficient food supply for our nation, fails to take steps to guarantee that the food we produce actually makes it to our plates. congressional agriculture committees recently commenced hearings to begin preparation for the 2018 farm bill, which makes this the perfect time to discuss how the next farm bill can invest in solutions to reduce the nearly 40% of food that goes to waste in the u.s.

the odd thing, in all of this, is that i started this essay saying i would be voting for any democrat candidate, yet what i've laid out here, in my argument for why ubi is good, draws from both sides of the party line. controversial as it sounds, i think people should be allowed to do what they want if it doesn't harm others. and if there's a particularly large barrier, keeping them from that life they desire or deserve, i think the government should step in.
the cbo is probably wrong; paul and hersh are probably right. and in a $21-plus trillion economy, a gap of a couple trillion isn't really that big. it's only big in the minds of members of congress, who feel uncomfortable about spending money, even when every economic indicator says they should spend much, much more.

realistically, after a large scale nuclear war, one must picture small groups of brutalised, traumatised people, violently thrown back into a pre-industrial age. assuming that some people somewhere furthest from the bombs could initially survive this global catastrophe, any 'recovery' would surely be measured in hundreds of years. it has to be regarded a shocking indictment of our modern civilisation that current stockpiles of nuclear weapons are sufficient to cause such a global catastrophe.

because the business world believes stock prices reflect deep metaphysical truths about the state of commerce, big movements in the stock market do, in fact, affect real-world decisions about trade. even if its revenues are strong, a company might pull back on major investments in the face of a declining stock market, worried about pessimism over corporate prospects in general. bankers looking at a stock slump might decide to withhold loans from perfectly responsible businesses. even if it's an ideal time to upgrade its equipment or expand its operations, a company might decide to be tight-fisted about expenses to prove its fiscal discipline to shareholders when the stock price is low.
a super pac founded and funded by billionaire charles koch reported $34,000 in spending to support rep. henry cuellar's (d-texas) primary campaign, according to a friday filing with the federal election commission.
that phrase, 'there's no demonstrable evidence' just stuck with me, howton said. it really bothered me that an adult would say that children have to perform some trick to be fed. but mostly i felt that mulvaney really doesn't know what is happening in the nation's schools.
personally, do i think that some institutions probably incentivized or didn't at least do their part to stop this? absolutely. … on the opposite side, seeing us go back to work right afterward and say, you know, we're not going to let this affect our timeline for making sure democracy runs its course was equally as heartening.
a former adviser to the trump campaign was paid $50,000 to seek a pardon for former cia officer john kiriakou, who was convicted of illegally leaking classified information, the newspaper reported. the adviser was to collect an additional $50,000 bonus if the president came through with the pardon, according to a copy of an agreement obtained by the times.
the citizens of the united states of america have a right to applaud themselves for having given to mankind examples of an enlarged and liberal policy: a policy worthy of imitation. all possess alike liberty of conscience and immunities of citizenship. it is now no more that toleration is spoken of, as if it was by the indulgence of one class of people, that another enjoyed the exercise of their inherent natural rights. for happily the government of the united states, which gives to bigotry no sanction, to persecution no assistance requires only that they who live under its protection should demean themselves as good citizens, in giving it on all occasions their effectual support.
to all of those who have asked, i will not be going to the inauguration on january 20th, he announced in his last tweet.
what's most important is that we're monitoring, keeping up to date on what's happening, trying to learn as much as possible and sharing that information with everyone who needs that. what we're seeing is a lot of communication between the federal governments and provincial and territorial governments, as well as between canada and other countries and the world health organization, hoffman noted.
bolton was expected to explain that some u.s. troops based in syria to fight is will shift to iraq with the same mission and that the al-tanf base would remain.
the current situation is informed by what happened to the eurozone as a result of its 2010 crisis. to deal with the sovereign debt crises of greece and several other member countries, the eu arranged financial rescue packages conditioned on austerity measures and policy reforms.
common core was pitched against a definite enemy― the teachers who insisted in teaching things in their own classroom just because they thought those things were worth teaching, the teacher who insisted on using her own professional judgment, the teacher who wanted to function as an autonomous individual. ironically, even though the common core did not conquer the nation's school districts as it had hoped, it did manage to deliver a serious defeat to its chosen enemy. we now understand in (too many) districts that we must adhere to the standards, which have descended manna-like from some mysterious, magical higher power. they are not to be argued with or contradicted, nor will there be any discussion of the educational wisdom (or lack thereof) behind them. they are to be treated as our compass, our grail, our north star. teachers should sit down, shut up, and start aligning.
amber senter, an entrepreneur and consultant in the business, was also the only woman of color on any of the conference's panels, which delivered industry insight to an audience that seemed to have little personal or political investment in the plant and a lot more money to spend than those who did.
still, the fact remains that the msm study populations of the global iprex study of prep and its open-label extension (ole) phase, as well as the subsequent u.s.-based prep demonstration project, were all made up of less than 10 percent african americans.
in order to bridge the gender gap for women in science fields moving forward, we must continue to bolster a culture that supports women scientists. we need to build strong networks and communities so girls might find mentors and role models. additionally, we must advocate for policy changes to promote female education and participation in the workforce.
as the covid-19 pandemic wreaked havoc across the city, other groups authored a 40-page plan for a green recovery, urging the city to spend $16 billion over the next three years retrofitting buildings for energy efficiency, expanding bike lanes, and boosting green manufacturing on brooklyn's industrial waterfront.
this is a way to slip it in under a so-called anti-lynching bill, and to then to sort of circle the wagon and then go for the juggler [sic] at some time in the future, he said.

in a statement, cruz was diplomatic: we were delighted to work with cambridge analytica, they were a valuable asset to my campaign, and any rumors to the contrary are completely unfounded. (the source close to rebekah added, i was with rebekah the other day and ted cruz was falling all over her. it's not fair to blame ca's methodology for cruz's loss.) others from cruz's team, however, remain bitter about the whole experience. if rebekah mercer was broke and wasn't a major donor in the republican party, says one, nobody would spend two seconds trying to know her. … she's not fun. she's just like a series of amoeba cells.

new delhi — at least 800 indian nationals, 252 of whom have tested positive for covid-19 commonly known as the novel coronavirus, are stranded in iran with no clear path back home huffpost india has learnt.
however, by week two, things got – whisper it – a little easier. unfortunately, when everything was in chaos, i found the boring things like routine and exercise made the most difference. i set my alarm for 8am each weekday morning, do a hiit or yoga video before work and try and take a proper hour-long lunch break. i'm a big advocate of the loungewear life but when you might not get dressed for months, i've found it's worth switching into normal clothes for at least some part of each day. evenings we began to fill with virtual plans: a phone call with family, a houseparty catch-up with friends, a pub quiz over zoom. i've never been so in touch with my wider circle since moving abroad - a much-needed silver lining to this whole debacle.
general sharif's announcement has gained significant attention because rumors about the extension of his term were abundantly circulating in the local media. i would classify the pakistanis who wanted an extension for sharif in three categories.

according to one study, abusers with firearms are five times more likely to kill their victims. firearm purchases are also associated with an increased risk of suicide for at least six years following the sale, sorenson said.
determine the type of coverage you actually need: most homeowners policy will only cover a maximum of $1,000 to $2,500 for personal jewelry, which might work if your ring cost was on the lower end of the spectrum. however, if your ring had a much higher value than that, the smart thing to do is to get an extension — also known as a rider — that specifically provides coverage for your ring. give your home insurance provider a call to figure out the personal property limit, and the type of rider available to you.

there must be comprehensive and convincing plans completed in these areas before i will begin to consider the wisdom of implementing a commercial 'tax-and-regulate' system for an adult marijuana market, scott said on monday. it is important for the general assembly to know that – until we have a workable plan to address each of these concerns – i will veto any additional effort along these lines, which manages to reach my desk.
as a women's march leader, i remember during the [brett] kavanaugh hearing i was the first protester in that senate chamber, and all i did was get up and say, this is a travesty of justice. this is a mockery of justice. that's all i did. and i was dragged over chairs and arrested brutally by the capitol police for doing nothing more than standing up and using my voice. i did not engage in violence. i did not have any weapons. i was an unarmed woman just saying that i was outraged at what was happening before my eyes, and i was brutalized by the capitol police.
in principle, democrats can enact a significant portion of their agenda that way. one reason is that reconciliation is tied to the budget process, and congress never actually passed a budget last year. the new congress could take advantage of that by quickly passing a reconciliation bill for the current fiscal year, still leaving opportunities to pass reconciliation bills for fiscal 2022 and 2023.
and so trump summoned his supporters to washington on wednesday to a rally meant to stop congress from certifying president-elect joe biden's victory. it would be a day to save america, according to trump, and stop the steal!
the loud criticism from indian country was quoted, shared and repeated by non-native media and, for the first time since the controversy began in 2012, it felt as though native voices were shaping the story. (for a full collection of essays about why the dna test undermined native rights ― points this essay is not rehashing ― check out this reading list.)
paris climate accord: biden will sign an executive order to rejoin the paris climate accord, fulfilling a campaign pledge to get back into the global climate pact on day one. trump, a supporter of oil, gas and coal, had made a first priority of pulling out of global efforts to cut climate-damaging fossil fuel emissions.
we have too much good work to do, ossoff said, to be mired in gridlock and obstruction for the next few years.
mallory, who had been attending the saviour's day event for 30 years, responded to the criticism by reiterating her commitment to vulnerable communities including her lgbtqai siblings, jewish friends and black women, and the women's march released statements in the same vein.
older voters, whites and asians made up the strongest base of support for a pro-green new deal democrat. such a hypothetical candidate garnered 57 percent support from voters over 65 and 55 percent among voters aged 55 to 64.
biden is creating an official covid-19 response coordinator, who will report to the president on vaccines, testing and other responses to the pandemic. the president has appointed jeff zients, who was overseeing the presidential transition team's coronavirus plans, for the role. biden is also reestablishing an obama-era position called the directorate for global health security and biodefense, which was first created in the wake of the 2014 ebola epidemic. trump had divided the duties of that role among other positions.
another goal, to expand opportunities for free college, would involve more complex legislation and votes from republicans, making it less likely. how much action biden can take on student loan forgiveness is also up for debate, including whether he could do so through executive action. expanding access to preschool is another area where advocates are hopeful for new, ambitious legislation resembling what biden proposed as a candidate.

but a catastrophic epidemic is unlikely to dissuade republicans who have been clamoring to substantially curtail medicaid. the gop's failed obamacare replacement bill in 2017 included a similar block grants proposal and the party has been trying to impose one since the 1980s, when president ronald reagan backed a version of the policy.

at an average of $661/month in net profit per driver and with hundreds of thousands of drivers in the u.s. alone, the standard mileage deduction facilitates billions of dollars of untaxed income, and hundreds of millions of unrealized tax revenue, the paper notes. this untaxed profit represents a social subsidy for the ride-hailing business model.
the biggest concentration of intentional fentanyl users is in the tenderloin, said kristen marshall, who runs a drug testing program for the harm reduction coalition, a national organization that provides training and supplies to harm reduction groups.
the death toll from coronavirus in italy has surged in the last 24 hours by 475 to 2,978, an increase of 19%, the biggest jump since the contagion came to light there last month. the total number of cases in italy, the european country hardest hit by the virus, rose to 35,713 from a previous 31,506, up 13.35%, the civil protection agency said.
fentanyl is involved in more than half of overdose deaths nationwide, and its geographic reach is extending beyond the east coast and appalachia, where its death toll has been rising since 2011, to california, where the synthetic drug is involved in about 20 percent of deaths.
whoa. may not agree with harassment but 6 month fly ban seems excessive.
the problem is it's (2019-ncov) a little clunky to use and people aren't really going to adopt it. and the longer the who wait before they come up with a conventional name that people use, the greater the risk that they'll lose control over naming it, says steven taylor, a clinical psychologist and author of the psychology of pandemics: preparing for the next global outbreak of infectious disease.
pfeifer agrees that better prevention and access to treatment is the solution to the epidemic, suggesting that part of the reason california has one of the lowest overdose death rates in the country is that the state expanded medicaid to low-income adults in 2010, four years earlier than most other states, and has since built substantial treatment infrastructure in many parts of the state.
there's debate among democrats over how much biden actually believes republicans are willing to work with him ― especially considering his experiences as barack obama's vice president ― and how attached he remains to the senate he joined in 1972. at that point, the filibuster was a privileged tool for senators to rarely deploy rather than an everyday partisan weapon.

still, many of the executive orders are aimed primarily at reversing president donald trump's actions: ending the ban on travel from muslim-majority countries; returning the u.s. to the world health organization and the paris agreement; ending trump's attempts to eliminate undocumented immigrants from the census count. others are extensions of coronavirus relief measures, including lengthening a pause on student loan payments and a moratorium on evictions. biden also plans on revoking the permit granted to the keystone xl pipeline.
no proposed plan for ubi has been perfect, but that doesn't mean we shouldn't try.
syrian president bashar al-assad has won back control of nearly all of eastern ghouta in a russian-backed military campaign that began in february, leaving just douma in rebel hands.
luther, the author of unsportsmanlike conduct, a book about sexual assault and college football, says that the sandusky case may have garnered more attention because the victims were boys, and the male editors and reporters might have more empathy for the victims. they can see themselves as someone who could be abused, she said. most [sports journalists] won't see themselves that way with gymnastics.
the remarks came hours after the white house's daily coronavirus briefing, in which trump claimed that the u.s. will see more deaths by keeping the restrictions in place than by covid-19 itself.
some employees may have concerns about working from home. they may question whether they can properly adapt to such an unfamiliar set-up. turns out, there's little to worry about:
the period leading up to biden's inauguration on jan. 20 is going to be volatile, moore predicted, pointing to how sen. lindsey graham (r-s.c.) was accosted by angry trump supporters at an airport on friday.
at a rally in northwest georgia on the eve of tuesday's runoffs, trump repeatedly declared that the november elections were plagued by fraud that republican officials, including his former attorney general and georgia's elections chief, say did not occur. at the same time, trump encouraged his supporters to show up in force for georgia's tuesday contests.
in other places, teachers in public schools that don't rely on christian textbooks are struggling to explain to their students the dynamics that allowed such violence to occur. in chicago, high school teacher raven althimer discussed the harsh realities of the insurrection with her students, who are black.
no matter what, don't discount your skill as something no one wants to learn. many talents that you learned are now lost arts — things like canning, quilting, or carpentry, for example. if you're able to parlay old skills into a new course or class — either online or in-person — you could earn some serious side income.
this interview has been condensed and edited for clarity.
trump's last days in the white house have been marked by rage and turmoil, multiple sources said. he watched some of the impeachment debate on tv and grew angry at the republican defections, a source familiar with the situation said.

in the spirit of the hippocratic oath first, do no harm, experts agree the name of a new disease should not single out ethnic or racial groups, geographic locales, trade and industry groups, or negatively impact animal welfare.
biden's order does not include the type of mass debt cancellation that some democrats asked him to orchestrate through executive action. he has said that action should come from congress.
what steps are being taken to update and improve teaching skills and methods to accommodate a rapidly changing world?
understanding the level of threats, nato has been preparing for any response through numerous joint military exercises in europe. during the wales summit in september 2014, heads of state and heads of government of nato member countries agreed on a guideline to spend a minimum of 2% of their gross domestic product (gdp) on defense. meeting this goal will further strengthen the allies and it will seriously challenge russia, which has been suffering from lower oil prices, the cost of operations in syria and economic sanctions.
since the answer is probably not forever, we can expect, at some point, a bit of a correction. it's not likely the us, europe and certainly not the rest of asia will be able to avoid the fallout of a chinese correction so we're going to be watching china very carefully this summer and reading between the lines of their policy announcements – especially when the premier talks about letting the markets work, which is code for no longer bailing out failing businesses.

it seems, then, that the only diagnosis is that the global economy is slowing down and the risks to recovery are picking up. challenges range from brexit to the slowdown in emerging markets, from the collapse of commodity prices to rising geopolitical tensions.
the canadian home builders' association (chba) is also growing more vocal. in early march, it released an in-depth analysis of key factors underlying housing market conditions. the housing supply deficit - not enough homes for families with young children, points to a significant and growing mismatch between housing demand and what the residential construction industry is able to supply, given planning and zoning patterns and lack of available serviced land. the report notes that if current trends continue, canada will see a shortfall of 300,000 family-oriented homes over the next decade.

the state of the union is strong in oregon. the threat of violence has been met with a counter force of civility. in today's world of governing crises, the reputation of democracy is at stake. harney county's adherence to civic rules of engagement despite deep differences is a bright light on a murky horizon. the oregon standoff is not over yet, but let us look to the citizens there with hope for an auspicious outcome. harney county can stand as an example for americans and the world of a more resilient form of democracy. one that rejects violence and grandstanding in favor of communication and compromise to solve a difficult problem.
russian military buildup on the borders of nato, president putin's ambitions of prolonging his power, expanding his territory and projection of power through an aggressive military strategy require a balance of power in the region. so, the intention and capabilities of russain military pose a direct to some nato allies and this could rapidly change public opinion across the europe and it may end many debates and skepticism about the importance, strength and survival of nato over the years and even for the decades to come.

we should also take note of the appointment of the deputy secretary of the central commission for discipline inspection, which is considered ministerial rank. xi's long-time speechwriter li shulei was promoted to deputy chief of the discipline commission during the commission's recent plenary session. the appointment shows that the chinese president is seeking to train li to be secretary wang qishan's successor.

with the pivotal caucuses still more than a year away, warren is the first major candidate to travel to the hawkeye state. dozens of candidates, including many of warren's fellow senators, are likely to enter the contest. early opinion polls of iowa place warren in the mix, but position biden and vermont sen. bernie sanders as the democratic front-runners. warren is expected to draw support from both former backers of sanders and voters who backed eventual nominee hillary clinton in 2016.
from today, people in the u.k. must stay at home, with few exceptions. tens of thousands of non-essential shops are to close. other premises being shuttered are libraries, playgrounds, outdoor gyms and places of worship. hotels and campsites will now join pubs, cafes and restaurants in being closed to slow the disease's spread.

bernie has started very much — has a good start. but instead of expanding and bringing in more people to help, instead his campaign relentlessly attacks everyone who asks a question or tries to fill in details about how to actually make this work. and then his own advisers say, eh, probably won't happen anyway.

in light of recent highly publicized harassment cases, cbs and other big media companies told staffers how important it is to report instances of all types of improper behavior to human resources or managers, the network said in its report.
as markets tumble again in china, with ripple effects across the globe, concerns about the role of fear and anxiety in market behavior have reemerged. is the sharp decline based on real changes in value or the result of speculation and a herd mentality? are emotions and anxieties the actual source of the problem? calls for calm are being issued. after the previous crash last august, chinese authorities even cracked down on the spread of rumors about market activity! analysts around the world hasten to explain the economic forces at work, with many calling for renewed trust in the market.
but having the power is one thing, and using it is another ― especially in new york's lopsided system of state government. in the empire state, the governor has uniquely centralized power relative to other state executives, because he or she alone can introduce the state's budget.
the public and political outcry against trump's zero tolerance policy was so strong that the president signed an executive order to stop family separation in june. and this new report has re-stoked anger over a cruel practice that dehumanizes immigrants.
other obligations are dodged. airbnb hosts commercialize their units and, as such, should pay higher mortgage rates, condo fees, and property taxes. (in new york, longer-term tenants must be approved and are assessed at least 25% more in condo fees for wear and tear to the building caused by their rentals. insurance and mortgages are more expensive for rental units too.)

one white house official, speaking on condition of anonymity, suggested trump's final act as president could be a preemptive pardon for family members and for himself just before biden is sworn in. presidential pardons apply only to federal crimes, not violations of state law.

given the failed federal response to covid-19 so far, that can only mean improvement. on public health, the record is one of unmitigated disaster. where south korea, taiwan, new zealand, singapore and other places swiftly implemented effective measures to avert both mass death and economic calamity, the united states has been an uncoordinated and morally callous disgrace.

the school immediately drew criticism for the harsh policy — not only does it have the potential to leave students dehydrated, but it also punishes them for needing a drink. parents raised the alarm about the sign and made it clear that the policy was unreasonable. you're not going to fail my kid because he's thirsty and he wants a drink, one concerned parent said to a local news channel. if my kid's playing in the gym room and he's hot and sweaty and he asks for a drink and he goes to get a drink, are they going to deduct a point from him? asked another. a mother put it simply, i thought it was not right that they were depriving the children of having water.

nonetheless, a town justice, david gideon, issued the order to protect the colonel from the activists. that's right -- the commander of a major military operation, piloting drones on lethal missions half-way around the world, requested a court order of protection against a group of mostly gray-haired demonstrators whom he had never met. in stepping briefly on the roadway at the base, grady flores violated that order, despite the fact that, as she says, we weren't at the security gate. we were out at the roadway.

surely exposing widespread abuse and harassment of women is a revolutionary act, especially when done en masse. but it has also lent a new primacy to an old definition of what women are. that definition, that story of abused objects, cannot be the story that defines, once again, what it means to be a woman ― a woman who can police her own body, in regards to power, policy and pleasure alike. victimhood and leadership are not mutually exclusive; indeed, many of our greatest leaders have known great victimhood. but tales of women victimized by powerful men cannot be the only stories that have, and allow us to wield, power.

i can empathize with the many parents who have kept themselves up at night with this question: who will believe my son if he's accused? yet if we ignore the crisis of sexual abuse and assault in our schools, we must be prepared to ask ourselves the more tragic question: who will believe my son if he's the one who gets hurt?
a democratic senate still would clear an easier path for biden's nominees to key posts, especially on the federal judiciary, and give democrats control of committees and much of the floor action. conversely, a senate led by mcconnell almost certainly would deny biden major legislative victories, as it did late in president barack obama's tenure, by keeping his agenda from even getting up-or-down votes.

even the best teacher's autonomy in her classroom doesn't mean much when the supervisor on the playground doesn't know my daughter's name, or when her choir teacher isn't aware she is learning to master her social anxiety. beyond grades and test score, no record of my children's strengths and areas for development is passed from one grade-level teacher to the next (especially in the social realm), or to the principal who makes the final decisions about class placement. that job is left to me, as their parent.

australia's hard-line policy of mandatory detention for unauthorized boat arrivals saw thousands of men, women and children who were seeking asylum shunted to offshore processing facilities on manus island and the pacific island nation of nauru in recent years. the papua new guinea (png) supreme court ruled in 2016 that the arrangement breached the country's constitution and ordered the detention center to close. in 2017 the australian government agreed to pay $70 million in compensation to about 1,900 asylum seekers detained on manus over the years but simply moved the detainees ― all men ― to new facilities after the old center was shut down.

paradoxically, i developed this hurtful white favoritism mindset while growing up in a multiracial family of transracial adoptees. i was adopted at birth by my white parents, who went on to adopt my white sister and four black brothers. my parents espoused diversity, african american heritage, anti-racism and tolerance. we had open conversations about race and prejudice. i grew up surrounded by family friends and family members of all races, ethnicities and backgrounds.

according to the national science board, women make up half of the total college-educated workforce in the united states, but they only comprise 29 percent of the science and engineering workforce. most of these women are concentrated in fields of biological, agricultural, and life sciences. they are especially underrepresented as engineers and computer and mathematical scientists, accounting for only 15 percent and 25 percent of those workforces, respectively.
the problem is that scalia interprets the supposed desire of god for worship as requiring the united states to favor religious belief as its official policy. it's not enough for individual believers to worship god as they see fit -- a right which i and most americans are happy to acknowledge and protect. according to scalia, the government must place its thumb on the scale and promote and advance religion over non-religion. so scalia's god is not only a god who craves worship, he's also a god who doesn't respect freedom of conscience and he wants the government to nudge, if not compel, atheists and agnostics into becoming believers.

by the end of 2015, likely well over 80,000 u.s. residents had filled at least one prescription for the daily tablet. and given the steadily increasing rate of new prescriptions registered each quarter, the population of hiv-negative people who have at least tried prep has probably swelled considerably by now. this is fantastic news for the effort to stem the tide of hiv infections among men who have sex with men (msm), whom data suggest make up the vast majority of prep users. while it's still too early to determine truvada's initial impact on infection trends—prep started gaining popularity only in late 2013—clinics with large populations of high-risk msm on prep have reported very low hiv rates among them.

twenty states and the district of columbia have approved some form of same-day registration. it's seen as a reform that can greatly drive up voter participation rates because people start paying more attention to an election the closer it gets. federal law currently lets states cut off voter registration 30 days before an election. activists also embrace early voting because it gives people more time to go to the polls at their convenience.

various people who have worked with the mercers on campaigns told me they didn't pressure their candidates to adopt policies that would benefit the family's financial interests, such as favorable regulations for hedge funds. instead, their mission was a systemic one. steve hantler, a friend of rebekah's, says she was determined to disrupt the consultant class, which she saw as wasteful and self-serving. she wanted to disrupt the conservative movement, too. rebekah saw the koch network as hopelessly soft on trade and immigration and was hungry for a mechanism to promote a more hard-line ideology. according to politico and other sources, she was frustrated at the time that no one was taking her seriously. as it happened, however, the family owned what seemed to be an ideal vehicle for achieving her goals. around 2012, robert mercer reportedly invested $5 million in a british data science company named scl group. most political campaigns run highly sophisticated micro-targeting efforts to locate voters. scl promised much more, claiming to be able to manipulate voter behavior through something called psychographic modeling. this was precisely the kind of work robert valued. there's no data like more data, he likes to say. robert had made his money by accumulating piles of data on human behavior (markets might move in a certain direction when it rains in paris, for instance), in order to make extremely precise and lucrative financial bets. similarly, scl claimed to be able to formulate complex psychological profiles of voters.
even the vatican's recently issued sex education materials go this route, much to the disadvantage of the pre-teen girls who may be exposed to it. indeed the materials go so far as to critique the quest for equality that has girls and boys vying with each other to see who can get farther and be better.

the trigger for the violence lay 1,400 km away in ayodhya, where then up chief minister mulayam singh yadav had ordered the police to fire on the karsevaks who had gathered near the babri masjid. a year later, the 16th century mosque would be demolished by the karsevaks, and 27 years later, the supreme court of india ruled in favour of building a temple at the site.
last month, as the coronavirus pandemic overwhelmed hospitals across the country, the environmental protection agency opted to maintain rather than strengthen air quality standards for particulate matter and ozone, two toxic air pollutants emitted from power plants and vehicles. it also finalized a rule requiring the agency to give greater consideration to economic factors when crafting new public health safeguards under the clean air act.

however, scholars who study religion in america say that many of the ideas present in the publishers' textbooks overlap with rhetoric heard from the rioters last week. christian nationalists argue that the united states was founded as a christian nation and has a special covenant with god, meaning that its citizens must implement a particular vision for this country or they will fall out of favor with god. the textbooks parrot these ideas, said andrew whitehead, associate professor of sociology and director of the association of religion data archives at indiana university-purdue university indianapolis.

while finnish students already have good subject knowledge skills for further studies, there is room for improvement in generic skills and knowledge of the modern workplace. this is one of the goals in the new national core curriculum for general upper secondary education (high school) to be used from 2016. in these guidelines, the cross-curricular themes - which are transversal competences crossing the boundaries of individual subjects - have been updated.
the working families party also has high hopes of pressuring lawmakers in connecticut and rhode island, where democrats enjoy control of the legislature and governorships, to enact a similarly progressive course of action. president-elect joe biden has tapped rhode island gov. gina raimondo (d), a centrist fiscal hawk, to serve as his commerce secretary. her departure and a series of progressive primary wins in the state legislature in september are already generating more momentum to address the state's $513 million budget shortfall through tax increases that target the state's wealthiest residents, rather than spending cuts.

young athletes draw on all sorts of motivations: dreams of olympic glory or millions of dollars, love of the sport, desire to win, the need for team camaraderie, the search for an identity, fear of letting down the adults in their lives. the same is true for parents: there are myriad reasons parents push their kids toward, or let their kids pull them into, the world of gymnastics. for me and my wife, it's the joy on luisa's face when she does her best, and her almost insatiable drive to make her best better.

companies issue stock to raise money for personnel, equipment, research and everything else that goes into providing goods and services. but after the stock is issued, its price is no longer directly involved in corporate finance. a company doesn't see any additional revenue when its stock price increases, or lose cash when it falls. stock prices are determined by bidders in the stock market ― whatever a willing buyer and seller agree on ― and the profits and losses on stock accrue to those speculators.
no one understood better how those forces could be used as a private army than donald trump, horwitz said. he's such a narcissist that we forget that he does have innate political abilities. he realized he could capture this group of people who could give him a lot of power.

bolton's comments were the first public confirmation that the drawdown has been slowed. trump had faced widespread criticism from allies about his decision, announced in mid-december, that he was pulling all 2,000 u.s. troops from syria. officials said at the time that although many details of the withdrawal had not yet been finalized, they expected american forces to be out by mid-january.

brazil was already one of the world's most unequal countries in terms of income distribution, and while the poor unquestionably benefited from the workers' party's policies ― including a hike in the minimum wage ― the vast majority of the economic gains achieved under da silva went to the richest 1 percent of brazil's population. so even as a new lower-middle class earned more than it ever had, brazil's obscene levels of income inequality likely expanded during the good years. violent crime had been reduced, but not to levels befitting a developed democracy: even before the economic collapse, brazil was home to more than a dozen of the planet's 50 most violent cities.

it seems wrong for hundreds of new doctors to sit idly by due to inconsistent hospital policies while the crisis surges in new york city, especially as these same hospitals call back retired nurses and physicians in their 60s and 70s to battle covid-19. the peak of the virus is predicted within the next two weeks. new york city needs manpower in the same time frame in which we will be graduating. we learned medicine here, we know our health systems' layouts, workflows, and electronic medical record programs. and while we are certainly not invincible, we are better suited due to our age to have favorable outcomes if we do contract the virus.
panic and confusion over a given program's status are the essential byproducts of a government shutdown.
witnessing and seeing firsthand how deeply dysfunctional attempts at bipartisan action have been over the last four years have really taken the shine off any notion that there might be some grand 'kumbaya,' coming-together moment, and that the biden administration should waste any amount of time whatsoever at the beginning of their administration seeking such a moment, she said.

the study of conflict resolution really took off during the cold war when the stakes of failed negotiation and zero-sum gamesmanship were truly apocalyptic: nuclear annihilation. the stakes today seem increasingly high, as well, with brexit threatening to destabilize the u.k. and trump's sketchy diplomacy skills threatening to upend so much else.
president donald trump had touted the keystone xl project as a major tenet of his administration, reversing an obama-era ban on the project in 2017 over the outcry of environmental groups who said it would only stymie efforts to rein in climate change. then-president barack obama had banned the pipeline in 2015.

biden and his aides regularly discuss what they call the four crises afflicting the u.s.: the coronavirus pandemic, the associated economic slowdown, racial injustice and climate change. at least for now, biden is placing his presidency, and his ability to resolve those crises, in the broadly distrusted hands of congress. he has insisted, again and again, that he'll be able to work with republicans on major issues. while he plans a blitz of executive action to reverse trump administration policies, he throws cold water on bold executive actions pushed by progressives.

this isn't to say i think all welfare programs are patronizing, or that they should all be replaced with ubi. but a main critique from the right is that ubi would cost too much, and would just be even more big government. reducing the less effective forms of welfare would create a middle ground that actually helps people, while giving them the authority over their own bodies and lives, just like i have been granted.

the solutions with the greatest promise tend to share a theme familiar from hiv care strategies for african americans: taking care of the whole person. this means seeking to address the many life challenges, or so-called structural barriers, standing in the way of black msm using prep successfully, including accessing food, housing and employment, coping with racism and homophobia, and obtaining health insurance.
like trump, bolsonaro is a creature of the rot in his country's democratic institutions that had set in years before he'd entered the picture, or that had been there all along.
accept responsibility for your staff, not the incident. most people run for the hills and go with the deny everything attitude fearing financial repercussions. what they miss is that you can accept that your staff made a mistake and get on the right side of the catastrophe. apologize publicly. never underestimate the general public to use emotion over logic. when we apologize publicly we enlist the sympathy of the mob. release a plan. most people just want to know that you have a plan and that you are on it. detailing direct action will limit public upheaval and reduce your exposure.

diane yentel, the director of the national low income housing coalition, called it appalling that a landlord has already threatened to evict tenants because of the shutdown. but she said it's ultimately on congress and president donald trump, who said he won't sign a government funding bill that doesn't include $5.7 billion for his proposed border wall.

this guaranteed a large round of unnecessary layoffs for teachers, firefighters and other public servants. but it also encouraged disastrous pandemic policies. in order to boost tax revenue to balance state budgets, governors encouraged reckless reopening strategies, hoping to get money to local businesses that would make their way to state coffers. the results for state budgets were disappointing, but more importantly, they encouraged the spread of a deadly virus.
glottlieb specifically referenced prior fda warnings about kratom's side effects, including seizures and respiratory depression. but these potentially deadly symptoms don't appear in any sort of discernible pattern in the cases the fda cites, and they're not well-documented elsewhere. while scientific studies on the effects of mitragynine on humans are still lacking ― largely because it's difficult to get funding for research on a plant that can't be patented ― most of the emerging science on kratom has found it to be largely benign, especially when taken in low or moderate doses.
also, don't be afraid to charge a premium price for you experience and expertise, says arizona financial planner charles c. scott. since you're not on anyone's payroll, companies don't have to include all the employee benefits, so you could still look like a bargain to them.

i don't know if dead people really want to tell us our pets are as crazy there as they were here, but it's a lovely thought--delgado and thelma stealing hamburgers and ripping skunks in two. i'm just not 100% convinced the deceased are dying to tell us anything now that they're gone. given my experience, people are plenty happy to do it while they're alive and can literally text, yell, email or phone in their advice, critiques, comments, arguments, opinions and #fakenews. sure, you can't talk back to someone who's met her maker, but the dead also can't keep arguing with you until you bang your head on the table and ask the waiter for an order of cyanide pancakes so you can be dead and not have to be told anything further by anyone, including other dead people.
that deal marked a rare foreign policy win for the trump administration, but didn't do enough to convince the world he really is a statesman.

(from left to right) patrick caddell, stephen bannon, lee and alice hanley on july fourth weekend in 2014, members of the mercer clan (robert, rebekah and her husband, sylvain mirochnikoff) went to visit some new friends. they traveled on robert's 203-foot luxury superyacht, the sea owl, and anchored just off the wasp enclave of fishers island in new york's long island sound. their destination, a medieval-style granite castle called white caps, towered over the shoreline. this was the summer home of lee and alice hanley, reagan conservatives who'd made their fortune in texas oil and gas but lived mostly between greenwich, connecticut, and palm beach, florida. like the mercers, the hanleys were convinced that the american political establishment was rotten to its foundations. unlike the mercers, though, they were popular and vigorous socialites. they loved to entertain and to act as connectors between politicians and donors in their assorted properties, even on their private jet. that holiday weekend, lee hanley revisited the subject of a poll he'd commissioned in 2013 from pat caddell, a longtime friend. hanley had wanted to truly understand the mood of the country and caddell had returned with something called the smith project. the nickname alluded to the jimmy stewart movie mr. smith goes to washington, because its results were so clear: americans were hungry for an outsider. it didn't matter whether the candidate came from the left or the right; voters just wanted somebody different. they had lost all faith in the ruling class—the government, the media, wall street.

sadly, iranians fell for the saudi trap and set fire to the saudi embassy in tehran. although president hassan rouhani and many of the political and military leaders in iran -- with the exception of supreme leader ali khamenei -- condemned the setting of fire of the saudi embassy, saudi arabia went ahead and closed their embassy in tehran. their strong allies bahrain, sudan, and the united arab emirates closed their embassies as well to show support for the saudi regime.

although she is the first major candidate to announce a likely bid, warren's visit ― complete with a throng of reporters following her, a full complement of staff assisting her, and vendors hawking political merchandise outside the rallies ― seemed to also mark the kickoff to a caucus season that will consume the party for the next year and could see dozens of candidates enter the democratic fray. former housing secretary julian castro is expected to formally announce a bid soon, and other candidates ― including everyone from former vice president joe biden to california sen. kamala harris to south bend, ind. mayor pete buttigeg ― could launch campaigns in the coming months.

ms. alt is the executive director of environment america. she oversees all aspects of the organization, from policy and strategy development for major campaigns to building the organization's visibility and field power, to recruiting and training hundreds of staff and activists. prior to the launch of environment america, ms. alt spent 25 years building u.s. pirg and the state pirgs (public interest research groups). while at pirg she helped oversee the passage and implementation of renewable energy standards in 20+ states, passage of vehicle emissions standards in 12 states, restoration of protections to national forests, passage of state and federal ethics reform, defense of the public's right to know about chemical exposures and protections for local parks and beaches. since 1989, ms. alt served as the executive director of the center for public interest research, leading efforts to build effective and self-sufficient state pirg organizations and run successful public interest programs across the country. in 2004, ms. alt oversaw the student pirgs' new voters project, which registered 524,000 young (18- to 24-year-old) voters in 22 states and made 500,000 contacts with students and other young people reminding them to vote, including 48,000 contacts on election day alone. under ms. alt's guidance, the 2004 new voters project hired more than 150 organizers who worked to recruit, train, and develop more than 10,000 young volunteers to spearhead the effort—the nation's largest non-partisan grassroots youth voter mobilization and student activist training project of the 2004 election.

congress seems unwilling or unable to address these issues. the federal laws governing online privacy date to 1986, five years before the world wide web existed. legislation to update the privacy laws for email and other electronic communications has won strong bipartisan support but has repeatedly stalled.
the 1986 and 2017 tax acts also differ in more substantive ways. the main thrust of the 1986 legislation was to end the tax breaks that had tilted the playing field toward corporations and the rich, while cutting tax rates for all. and the 1986 bill did all this in a way that did not create more federal debt.
wisconsin gov. tony evers (d) said his state would hold primary elections as scheduled for april 7 despite pressure to postpone due to coronavirus concerns. he pointed out that there were also local races on the ballot for offices that would go unfilled for weeks or months, such as mayoral and county seats who would be crucial decision-makers as the crisis continues.

with the law books filled with a great assortment of crimes, a prosecutor stands a fair chance of finding at least a technical violation of some act on the part of almost anyone. in such a case, it is not a question of discovering the commission of a crime and then looking for the man who has committed it, it is a question of picking the man and then searching the law books, or putting investigators to work, to pin some offense on him.

so i'd like to talk about who we're running against: a billionaire who calls women 'fat broads' and 'horse-faced lesbians' — and, no, i'm not talking about donald trump. i'm talking about mayor bloomberg, warren said in her first remark of the night.
instead, trump's responded with the posts that earned him the temporary social media bans.
in a full political union, there would be concentration of economic policy decision making and it would require major structural changes in the eurozone and its member countries. tax and social policies would be unified, labor unions would be dismantled or unified as a european-wide system, a european debt relief system and banking union would be set up. these would ensure the flexibility of wages, prices and labor agreements and guarantee convergence of competitiveness and living standards. this could work, in theory. but, the likelihood of getting all the member states to agree that their wages, debt and living conditions would be negotiated at the european level is extremely small.

like any leader of the opposition, jeremy corbyn sees a general election as his number one priority.
more than 100,000 people turned out for a 'people's vote' march in london in june and the idea is gaining support in local labour parties. deputy leader tom watson repeated last week corbyn's line that labour was not calling for a new plebiscite, but could not rule one out. thornberry, whose own seat neighbours islington north, made a speech rounding on the idea that the country needed either a cross-party 'government of national unity' or a referendum to sort out the uk's exit from the eu. what we need is not a government of national unity, what we need is not a second referendum - we need a general election. that's what we need, she said. we need to have a labour government that will be pragmatic. that will turn up in brussels and say 'the grown-ups have arrived'. let's work out what we are going to do. we have to leave, we don't want to leave, we weren't the liars, we weren't the manipulators, we didn't have any lies on the side of buses, we weren't pushing to leave the european union, we were campaigning to remain in the european union. we are internationalists and we believe that we are european. the trouble is we went ahead and had a referendum and we lost it and overwhelmingly, above everything else, we are democrats, so we have to do as instructed - as much as it breaks our heart.

as things stand in iran today, mass discontent remains clear, but protesters have been less coordinated. they currently lack a discernible organizational network. no shared ideology has emerged beyond general disdain for the government. and the protests have thus far been devoid of any leadership. the government has temporarily restricted access to certain social media channels, including instagram and telegram, a messaging app. unlike in 2009, social media platforms and smartphones have reportedly been critical tools to organize protests, in the absence of actual leaders. by contrast, the protest leaders in 2009 played a really important role, according to iran expert suzanne maloney of the brookings institution. they effectively legitimized the protests as something that was politically sanctioned. we haven't seen an episode like that, where someone who's part of the system called upon their followers to go to the streets.

in theory, it allows you to narrow in on who might have this, but in practice in the past, that approach was not shown to be helpful during sars, for example, there were cases where people were in canadian airports. we did screen millions of people for temperatures and didn't find a single case of sars. that way so very expensive, disruptive and doesn't always work.
after the sweeping reagan-era federal tax overhaul in 1986, many states that tied their state income taxes to the federal code changed their laws in 1987, in some cases due to a similar windfall or to align their tax brackets with the federal code. and just like federal tax laws, state codes have changed incrementally over the past three decades, so that neither resemble what they looked like in 1986. but sweeping tax overhauls in the states have been rare since then.

however, if you truly aim to effect organizational change and are in the right mindset to begin this process, your next step may feel counterintuitive. you must be willing to scrub the windows and throw away all knee-jerk, preconceived notions that affect your decisions. stop yourself from jumping to quick conclusions, simply because it is easy.
in june, trump implemented a new sponsor vetting policy that has forced children to languish for up to six months in long-term shelters.

sex scenes in movies or on tv may inspire couples to get it on. they may see something they want to try, or they may get aroused just watching. if watching erotic scenes makes you uncomfortable, this may be indicative of a problem in your own sex life or trigger some aspect of your own sexuality that is shameful or confusing. being able to enjoy a sexy scene with you partner is a sign of sexual health. if shame or embarrassment is getting in the way, it may be a sign of a problem. if you struggle to maintain sexual attraction to your partner, watching a sexy movie may serve as a painful reminder that you 'lost that lovin' feeling.' it may also spark a conversation that you do not want to have. honesty is the best policy. communicating directly about your sexual satisfaction, expectations and preferences is the best way to avoid a sexless relationship. ― kimberly resnick anderson, sex therapist and associate professor of psychiatry at ucla school of medicine

you needed to start doing it during the summertime, especially in places where they're not used to always being engaged and given a reason to go vote because they've been living in the not-best conditions politically for years before, said chris scott, the national political director of the collective pac, which supports black candidates. so you have to give them extra reasons to go vote, and you can only do that if you have the money to reach out to them early on.
it's actually kind of sad kushner even thinks this is impressive. this might make someone knowledgeable on a hobby level, but for actually policy is extremely amateurish. this doesn't even get into the reality of which books may matter more than quantity. https://t.co/i2cv9uy5pj — marxist soccer (@marxistsoccer) january 30, 2020
the move comes against the backdrop of prop 22. in 2019, california passed a law known as assembly bill 5 making it harder for gig companies to classify workers as independent contractors rather than employees. prop 22, which voters passed in november, excluded app-based drivers from the earlier law, protecting the contractor system at companies like uber, lyft and doordash.

still, it's worth taking a closer look at gabbard's positions on lgbtq rights, an issue she claims she has evolved on in quite an extraordinary way. in the 2020 election, every candidate's record on lgbtq rights will be critical — and that includes both statements in their past and how they're presenting themselves in the media right now.
a number of high-profile democratic elected officials have nonetheless come out on the side of los angeles teachers, including sen. elizabeth warren (mass.), who announced her 2020 presidential campaign on dec. 31, and sens. kamala harris (calif.) and bernie sanders (i-vt.), who are expected to announce presidential bids soon.

but the senator's view of the party — and the role of progressive politics within it — has evolved. he's since refined his critiques to focus on the corporate wing of the democratic party, which is composed of the same centrists, including organizations like third way, that pushed the party to the right during the 1980s and '90s.
compromise, common sense and listening to all sides of an issue don't seem like countercultural values, skykes wrote in the post. but in my state's republican party, such values have become increasingly difficult to find. ... to many in the republican party, 'bipartisan' had become a dirty word.

i have no doubt that you were led to believe you'd be covered, and that's a problem. in fact, the sample contract on the at&t site is clear that you can't make more than two claims within a 12-month period. that's something you would have seen -- and had to sign -- before upgrading.
the trump administration has weakened workforce safety standards, gutted pollution rules, promoted junk health insurance, and rolled back rules on everything from drilling in the arctic to protections for transgender persons in homeless shelters. on the campaign trail, president-elect joe biden promised to reverse at least 100 trump-era rules.
biden's proposal resembles the american family act, proposed in 2019 by bennet and sen. sherrod brown (d-ohio), which would have boosted the maximum credit to $3,600 ― and instead of paying out after you file your taxes, the internal revenue service would distribute refunds in advance, on a monthly basis.
adam green, co-founder of the progressive change campaign committee, sounded a similar note. the ceiling of possibility is higher for everything we want to do, he said.
anchorage residents … should not be fooled by misleading tactics by anti-transgender activists that paint transgender women as predators or criminals, davis told huffpost. transgender women aren't men ― they are women who value safety and privacy like everyone else.

grady flores was arrested in 2012, when she and 16 others blocked the entrance to the base, prompting the request from the military for the order of protection. when she was arrested again a year later -- not for protesting herself but for stepping on the road outside the base and taking pictures of others who were protesting -- she was found to be in violation of that protection order. and the protestors she was photographing? they were acquitted.

in short, it is time for a big, multitrillion-dollar economic relief package ― for the sake of american families and public health. the results of the georgia runoff make that kind of legislation much more plausible.
the first course of the antidote to this poison is belief — belief in the victims of sexual violence, the acknowledgment of their bravery, and the understanding that they risk so much, and often stand to gain so little, by telling what has happened to them.
he defended white nationalist protesters as very fine people after they descended on charlottesville, virginia. he called haiti and african nations shithole countries, a view he would have followed up with action to decrease immigration had he won support from congress. he insulted the women who accused him of sexual assault. he encouraged supporters to overturn the election in statements that led to an insurrection at the capitol last week, a move that led to him being impeached for a second time on wednesday.

a recurring and intractable thread tying together railroad history is that when the choice has been between economic liberty and government intrusion, selecting the latter has repetitively discouraged capital investment, diminished service quality, adversely affected safety, and sooner than later caused hand-wringing among those most dependent on rail transportation.
south korea is one of the most plugged-in countries on the globe, with the majority of its people having access to broadband internet and smartphones. surveys suggest an estimated 10 percent of teens in the region are addicted to the internet, according to the washington post.
every woman commented on the need to address gender bias in early childhood education. one congresswoman who suggested working with young boys and girls to raise awareness of gender stereotypes also commented that teachers at preschools and schools must be trained in equality as well. and indeed, some scandanavian nations are, controversially, already mandating gender-neutral reading (goodbye, snow white)).

if parents received tax credits in advance ― as house speaker nancy pelosi (d-calif.) and ways and means chair richard neal (d-mass.) proposed last year ― the policy would resemble the kind of child benefit that is standard in other advanced countries, and it would probably put a huge dent in child poverty.

they don't have to do this to claim that kratom is an opioid, because it is, said kruegel. but the question is whether it's an atypical opioid, which is my preferred terminology. does it have a better side-effect profile than the classical opioid drugs like morphine that we use every day? that's the key question here.

want americans to feel like the country is fair? think the rule of law is important? prosecute powerful people when they commit crimes. even people who worked for a president. even a former president.
when his campaign denied my claims, it was frustrating yet expected ― i knew that was their method. when he was doing a new hampshire radio interview and said: one [woman] said, 'he grabbed me on the arm.' and she's a porn star… oh, i'm sure she's never been grabbed before. that infuriated me. his dismissal of my claims being based on my occupation was unfair.
the biden team has said that its goal is 100 million vaccine doses within the first 100 days. that's not as audacious a goal as it seems, even though press reports suggest that members of the transition are worried about reaching it. the figure works out to a million a day, which isn't that far from where the vaccination effort is now. to reach herd immunity by summer, the pace probably needs to be twice as fast ― at least.

such a scheme could also preserve a role for private insurers, providing the same kind of alternative, tightly regulated coverage they do for seniors on medicare today. hybrid systems with both public and private insurance are actually pretty common around the world ― and succeed in establishing health care as a right, just as single government programs do.
huffpost talked to a dozen tribal chiefs, native politicians, researchers and influencers to get a sense of why this narrative that has taken off in the media ― that warren, who has been a strong ally to tribes, is suddenly on the ropes with them because of her dna test ― seems off. some spoke on record; others spoke only anonymously, given their close work with tribes whose privacy they wanted to respect.

ontario is reviewing its condominium act and should insist that condo boards have tools to deal with this problem. a board should be forced to have a policy on short-term rents, stipulate conditions, and levy higher fees, but only if 80% of owners approve. conversely, they should be allowed to ban airbnb and their competitors and enforce that.
republican leaders are not, in fact, asking the country to move on from the insurrection in any meaningful way. they are asking everyone to politely pretend that nothing happened, so that the conservative movement and elected gop officials can avoid unpleasant consequences for their actions and rhetoric. kilmeade's point that people are ready to explode is, in this light, better understood as a threat than a plea for calm.

depending on who you speak to, priti patel is either not very bright and doomed for the sack, or a force of nature who will survive, having shrugged off political storms and risen to a great office of state essentially on willpower. one thing is for certain – the home secretary's ability to attract controversy hasn't stopped her meteoric rise since being elected as mp for witham in 2010. from being taken on as employment minister after co-authoring a book which described britons as among the worst idlers in the world, to landing cabinet jobs at the international development department she wanted to abolish and heading the home office despite once supporting the death penalty, patel's career has raised eyebrows. and while the bullying allegations mounting against her could be genuinely career-ending, many would still be reluctant to bet against a woman dubbed a piranha by her own husband (because she is small and combative). patel, 47, has of course been here before – forced to quit as development secretary in 2017 after freelance meetings with senior israeli government figures including pm benjamin netanyahu while on a summer holiday in the country. she attempted to ride out that storm but was rumbled when failing to disclose the full extent of the meetings to theresa may. despite the rolling brexit chaos that characterised may's slow motion car-crash of a premiership, it was this incident that made the then-pm snap.
if you don't pay your cards off every month or, worse, if you only make the minimum payment, you will end up paying for those items several times over. credit cards are infamous for their fees, interest rates and hidden rules in their fine print, and it will be difficult for you to catch up once you fall behind.

huffpost confirmed that youtube's algorithm has promoted mystery brand videos, giving them traction and potentially increasing ad revenue for both google and the content creators. as the hosts of marco and alvin explained in a recent post, mystery box content helped them go viral and earn money: we were nothing before mystery brand. we were at 1,700 subscribers before we actually did our first mystery brand video, they said. through mystery brand's name we have been able to grow ... and actually start doing youtube for a living. they now have nearly 70,000 subscribers, and recently apologized for pushing a scam.

perdue said the u.s. department of agriculture would still have a $3 billion contingency fund that it might be able to use for benefits in march, but he didn't offer any details about the agency's plans for that month.
slowly but surely, i stopped thinking so much about the parallel reality of what i should have been doing...
in sanctuary cities, local officials order police to release dangerous criminal aliens to prey upon the public, instead of handing them over to ice to be safely removed, trump said.
on june 24, 1986 — 189 days after the house passed its bill — the senate approved its version. it took three more months of work in conference to create a bill the two houses could agree on. reagan signed the bill on october 22, 1986 – 11 months after the bill was first introduced.
avoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth if your hands are not clean.
all but three of the justices are over the age of 65, a key factor that health experts have said makes individuals at higher risk of getting very sick if they contract covid-19.
the third reason for the brake on trade is the decline in the growth of global value chains, which is the idea that the process of production consists of many stages and occurs across borders. but this phenomenon, which developed at a very high rate after china's accession to the wto in 2001 as the country emerged as a global supplier, has now reached cruising pace.
so all you infected bus drivers, grocery store clerks, poultry processors ― you didn't get it at work, tweeted jordan barab, a former osha official now with the house committee on education and labor.
kuhnell had taken the test twice as a sophomore, scoring a 16 and 17 composite score, respectively, out of 36 possible points. after participating in an intensive act boot camp offered to all juniors at her high school, kuhnell improved her scores on two subsequent sittings to 28 and 26. in its letter, the act said its decision was based on unusual response similarities with another examinee, seating proximity, mathematics computation and an unusual score increase.
there is an actual art (and science) to deal making. and after three-plus weeks of government shutdown, it should be clear by now ― if it wasn't already― that president donald trump is uniquely terrible at the practice.
we have over 10.6 million people on twitter, and 99.9% of them are decent human beings, are working people, are people who believe in justice, compassion and love, sanders said. and if there are a few people who make ugly remarks, who attack trade union leaders, i disown those people. they are not part of our movement.
the former head of the justice department's civil rights division, responsible for enforcing the voting rights act, also said in a deposition that he was unsure whether citizenship data potentially collected in the census would be more accurate than the data it currently has access to. the statement supported the plaintiffs' argument that the doj did not really need a citizenship question on the census and its request for one was driven by other motivations.
reconciliation bills must comply with some other rules congress has set for itself, including pay-go requirements that require offsetting new spending with cuts or revenue, and they are subject to narrower rules like a prohibition on changes to social security. historically, reconciliation has only changed mandatory spending, which refers to entitlements like medicare and other programs that don't depend on time-limited appropriations.
this misbegotten premise shaped an economy that aims at continuously doubling both the production and destruction of things, rather than optimizing their lifecycle. abandoning this concept of linear economy promises to instigate an actual counter-revolution. in the present terminal phase of our consumption-centred civilization, the ancient precept of caring for and preserving both nature and manufactured goods would subvert the present established disorder, while alleviating job loss and protecting the planet.
a key reason for the activist left's emphasis on economic recovery funding is its experience with the first two years of the obama administration. progressives blame deficit hawks in the obama white house for blocking economist christina romer from presenting obama with an option for a stimulus package that exceeded $1 trillion ― a figure closer to the size of the hole in the economy than the roughly $800 billion bill obama ultimately settled on.
the earlier you start putting money away, the more time you will have to take advantage of the wonder of compounding: it's the most powerful way to make your money work for you. consider this: if you invest $1,000 a year between the ages of 25 and 35, at approximately 7 percent interest a year, this $10,000 investment will earn you nearly $113,000 by the time you are 65 years old. not bad, right?

political circumstances are different now. democrats hold the house majority and, as speaker nancy pelosi's office confirmed to the washington post on thursday, at least two committees will hold hearings on medicare for all this year. exactly what those hearings will entail isn't clear ― democratic leaders aren't saying ― but one focus will be a bill that rep. pramila jayapal (d-wash.) plans to introduce in the next few weeks.

when people are storming the capitol, you walk to the press room and do a press conference and call on them to stop, instead of cutting a video eight hours later, said a long-time trump adviser.
although other states have legalized cannabis through ballot initiatives that have left the decision up to voters, vermont does not allow for such a process. over the past few years, lawmakers in the state have instead been working to address marijuana reform through legislation. a similar legalization bill made it to scott's desk in 2017, but the governor vetoed it, citing concerns with weak language on punishment for the sale of marijuana to minors and its establishment of a commission to study how a regulated cannabis market would work in vermont.
trump has a thing about buying american. the buy american plan is to make it easier for defence companies to sell to foreign nations. there are two tracks of arms procurement from the us. there is the dcs (direct commercial sales) track and the other is the fms (foreign military sales) track.
but one of the many joys of that campaign was getting to spend time with gabby, whom i had known since she was a newly elected state senator, as well as her new husband mark, a former naval aviator who flew combat missions in the persian gulf war and nasa astronaut who had flown four missions to space.
the washington post estimated in may that, at the time, trump had spent 9 days, 16 hours and 30 minutes of his time in office writing tweets, once topping out at 200 tweets in a single day.
i'm not sure exactly what happens to him when he is in a room surrounded by the people he had made a career advocating for, but something does click and there is a certain humanity that comes into play that isn't seen on the broader stages, salgado said.

atlanta, ga. (ap) — president-elect joe biden on monday told georgia democrats they had the power to chart the course for a generation as president donald trump urged republican voters to swamp the polls ahead of runoff elections that will determine control of the u.s. senate.
atlanta (ap) — georgia voters are deciding the balance of power in congress in a pair of high-stakes senate runoff elections that will help determine president-elect joe biden's ability to enact what could be the most progressive governing agenda in generations.
six were arrested for subverting state power by organizing the unofficial primaries, while the rest were arrested for allegedly participating in the event, li said. he said more arrests could be made and investigations were ongoing.
the requirement to make schools test-centic, to put bad tests at the center of school's existence is foolish, on the order of demanding that all students wear silly hats. at this stage of the game, there can be no doubt― there are no benefits to the test and many unnecessary costs. it will not go away easily, because test manufacturers are making a ton of money on this giant time suck. it's time to make your life a source of friction in the machine.

donald trump's friends and allies are profiting from wealthy felons who are paying them to lobby the president for pardons, the new york times revealed in a bombshell report sunday.
the circular economy is a digital revolution as much as a sustainable one. it is at the heart of the fourth industrial revolution. the beauty of the circular economy is that it delivers clear benefits for the environment while simultaneously driving entirely new revenues and business models. that is the circular advantage.
mark stringer, the executive director of the aclu of iowa, praised reynolds' comments on tuesday.
the green new deal is a unifying political message that gets back to the basics of creating an economy that works for all people and protects the planet as a result. in fact, a recent poll by the yale program on climate change communication and george mason university showed that a staggering 93 percent of democrats and 64 percent of republicans agree with the basic components of the green new deal (our own poll data from earlier this year echoed those findings, showing the american public's overwhelming preference for renewables over fossil fuels). the only other thing that gets such a high level of bipartisan agreement is that democrats and republicans can't agree on basic facts.

major studios are already on a production hiatus until the middle of this month.
in pakistan's case, general sharif has spoken with a sense of entitlement indicating that if he wants to continue his job, he can easily do so but he will not emulate several of his predecessors. former dictator, general musharraf, has already suggested that general sharif should be granted an extension in order to successfully complete the military operation against the pakistani taliban. if general sharif means what he has stated in his statement, this would have long-term positive implications on pakistan's democracy. he would deservedly be credited for helping in creating a pakistan where the supremacy of institutions is given preference over ambitious individuals.
in march and april, the sunrise movement will host events in florida, california, pennsylvania, new york, kentucky, michigan and elsewhere. the tour builds off an intensive new online training program, where volunteers are coached via webinars on how to confront politicians and frame an issue as overwhelming as global warming in terms of clear, effective action. each event will include in-person training sessions, and conclude with organizing meetings for new converts.

decatur's been described as a speck of blue in a sea of red, and that is true — up to a point. there have always been specks of blue in georgia, and the state is increasingly trending purple. in november, democrat stacey abrams narrowly lost to republican brian kemp in the race for governor.

the u.s. state department, in a statement, attributed the cancellation to transition work before biden takes office onjan. 20, even if until recently pompeo had been reluctant to unequivocally recognize biden's win. the state department declined further comment on european officials' rejection ofmeetings with pompeo.

rachel gilmer, a co-executive director of dream defenders, which emerged after the killing of trayvon martin in 2013 and endorsed sanders on wednesday, pointed to sanders' transformational vision for the political system.
the curricula are based on the idea that the world is becoming more and more interconnected. the challenges of today's world are often simultaneously both local and global. their understanding requires broad competences and authentic learning, both of which are contained within the new curriculum. comprehensive global challenges require cultural know-how, communication, interaction and cooperation skills. in my opinion, global learning is a question of learning to be at the same time a finn, a european and a world citizen.
as a condition of new or continued employment, all new and current associates are required to electronically acknowledge and agree to be bound by the arbitration program and related agreement.
forty-nine percent of suburban voters in the district supported a green new deal candidate, compared to just 31 percent of urban voters. by contrast, 14 percent of suburban voters said they'd support an anti-green new deal primary candidate, while 43 percent of urban voters said they'd do the same.

depuis l'année 2014, ce blog traite principalement de deux sujets spécifiques, organisé autour de deux rubriques :
new york adopted a small-donor matching system to publicly finance its elections in 1988 in response to a series of corruption scandals throughout city government. at the time, the system provided a 1-to-1 match for donations of $1,000 or less. a candidate received $1 in public funds for every $1 of a contribution up to $1,000. but the system has changed to boost the power of small donors over the years.

but the new announcements have also included measures that depart radically from his government's usual agenda, such as boosting income for some poor residents and jettisoning the party's oft-stated goal of balancing the province's books.
#metoo has spread far beyond its origins in the u.s. in recent months. ripples of the movement have been felt in the u.k., europe and beyond.
outside of the women's marches, i reflect on the direct action that was led by women over the last four years. i remember in 2018, during the zero-tolerance policy of separating children from their mothers and fathers, we organized the largest women-led civil disobedience in history. and the capitol police figured out how to arrest over 640 women that day who were engaged in non-violent direct action inside of the senate hart building in the atrium.
someone had burnt a woman constable's scooter in the violence and she took her revenge on sadaf, she told me. someone said, 'bahut angrezi bolti hai.' they find english speaking women particularly irksome, she said.
in a series of interviews with heroin users in rhode island in 2017, brown university researchers reported that users described fentanyl as unpleasant, potentially deadly, and to be avoided. they concluded that demand for the deadly contaminant was low and that its presence in the drug supply was generating user interest in effective risk mitigation strategies, including treatment.
corbyn narrowly secured the 35 mp nominations he needed in 2015, before he went on to win a landslide in the leadership election.

elise has made public assertions about voter fraud in november's presidential election that have no basis in evidence, and she has made public statements about court actions related to the election that are incorrect, reads an open letter to committee members by doug elmendorf, dean of the harvard kennedy school. moreover, these assertions and statements do not reflect policy disagreements but bear on the foundations of the electoral process through which this country's leaders are chosen.
according to the mayor, 600,000 new yorkers who currently are uninsured would be eligible for existing programs he wants to expand and for a new medical care program. based on that figure, the uninsured rate in new york city is about 7 percent, the same as new york state and lower than the national rate of 10 percent as of 2017, according to census data.

lewis and steve- i wanted to raise some concerns i had based on my meeting this morning with dan strauss and the entertainment editors. dan informed us that he has hired christina schoellkopf as a senior social media manager, and that she would be assuming responsibility for all entertainment editorial social media accounts. i have serious concerns about an employee who was vetted, hired by and reports to the business side of the los angeles times making editorial decisions and assuming publishing control of our brand on social media. such an arrangement is unprecedented in this newsroom ― and is not the standard practice in most newsrooms. our audience has an expectation that these accounts are independent from the business side in the same way print readers expect that editors choose the stories on the front page. what we post on social media and how it is framed is an extension of the journalism that we do here at the times, and it should come from our editorial side. over the past few years, my team has guided best practices and style across all social media channels, including entertainment. when we trained the webent producers to do this, we went over things like photo permissions (which photos we legally can and can't tweet, for instance), the l.a. times voice on social media, our policy for corrections on social media, and general best practices. furthermore, journalists in the newsroom adhere to certain guidelines and standards.

on monday morning, the court will issue previously scheduled orders and potentially some rulings. however, the justices will not take the bench. everything will be posted directly on the court's website.
while there is no need to be fatalistic about speech codes, much work still has to be done, particularly as the department of education has championed a definition of sexual harassment that is so vague and broad that it seriously threatens campus speech. the department of education hailed this as a blueprint for all universities to follow, but it specifically eliminated the requirement that speech be both subjectively and objectively offensive, and it reduced the definition of harassment to any unwelcome verbal conduct (also known as speech) of a sexual nature.
early voting in particular has been at the center of many recent fights between republicans and democrats over voting laws. the conventional wisdom is that early voting benefits democrats, so republicans in several states have moved to limit its availability. but one 2017 paper published by four political scientists at the university of wisconsin-madison suggests that reality may be more complicated. the authors analyzed early voting in the 2004, 2008 and 2012 presidential elections and found that while election day registration tends to benefit democrats, early voting on its own is more likely to benefit republicans.

new york gov. andrew cuomo (d) said that he expects between 40% and 80% of the state's population to eventually get the coronavirus, with the big question being whether the cases will be staggered enough so the health system is not overwhelmed.
the political nature of the capitol attack demands that accountability take political form. while the judiciary should handle criminal charges against individual insurrectionists, those who empowered and encouraged an assault on the legislative branch of the u.s. government should face consequences in the legislative branch. for trump, there is no alternative to impeachment by the house and a conviction by the senate.

government policy in most of the countries that still have uncontacted tribes is generally to try and leave them alone, although missionaries and tourists sometimes violate the policy. this is in part because uncontacted tribes may have no immunity to civilized world diseases--when the nukak people of colombia were contacted in 1981, about half the tribe died of respiratory disease. narco-traffickers and land grabbers moved in, and the surviving nukak were forced to move to a town where they're stuck in wretched conditions. other tribes have been wiped out or severely reduced by having their land seized for mining, agriculture, timber, etc., or by slaving, or by military or guerrilla actions. this article tells some of the story: the lost tribes of the amazon.

in the weeks leading up to congress's certification of president-elect joe biden's win, graham joined many of trump's close evangelical allies in publicly expressing doubt about the election results. he continued to do so on jan. 6, a few hours before the riot, which led to the deaths of five people.
though it's unlikely that your side gig will replace your full income in the beginning, it's a great way to beef up your emergency fund. and over time, it might be able to replace your current income or even surpass it. it is very risky to depend on a single source of income, as it can vanish any day, morrison said. for that reason, i believe working on a side gig to develop a second source of income is the best way to prepare for potentially losing your job. it will give you some peace of mind knowing you have options.

in michigan and oregon, attempts to take over state capitols served as precursors to last week's riot in washington, d.c., and though the temperature hasn't risen quite that high in kentucky, the impeachment effort is marked by a similar refusal to accept election results or the legitimacy of political power when a democratic lawmaker attempts to wield it.

a democratic majority in the senate could put in play the first minimum wage hike in more than a decade. the federal wage floor of $7.25 per hour has not budged since 2009. with democrats holding the house, the senate and the white house, they would have a much stronger hand to pursue an increase as high as $15, though only if they prove willing to nuke the filibuster.

of course there is. rubio, like nearly all of his colleagues, got in bed with trump because he recognized, correctly, that trump was the best way to achieve his near-term political goals. now that the alliance has blown up in his face, rubio hopes to concoct some weird formula in which the whole thing is really the fault of the radical left ― cuban marxists and american anarchists.
trump, presumably, could declare a national security emergency, reprogram money already appropriated, and order the pentagon or the dhs to build the wall. of course, it's wildly far-fetched to characterize mexican immigration as a national emergency warranting this sort of extraordinary authority. illegal cross-border immigration has been declining. the real crisis is trump's failure to have of any sort of reasonable refugee policy.

the policy wants them to voluntarily return home. the government is giving them one choice, staying in png in this uncertain status, she said.
the post-9/11 encroachments on privacy have not yielded more security. president obama selected a review group to examine the nsa programs and to recommend reforms. it found that bulk telephone metadata collection was not essential to preventing attacks, and concluded that enhancing privacy protections were indispensable to strengthening security. continuing breaches of government servers by foreign hackers have further exposed the government as an unreliable steward of sensitive information.
as a space policy researcher, i can say the answer is yes and no. some u.s. officials, including scott pace, the executive secretary for the national space council, are cautiously optimistic about the potential for cooperation and do not see the beginning of a new space race. nasa administrator jim brindenstine recently met with the head of the chinese space program, zhang kejian, at the international astronautical conference in germany and discussed areas where china and the u.s. can work together. however, increased military presence in space might spark increased competition. the trump administration has used the threat posed by china and russia to support its argument for a new independent military branch, a space force.

during dozens of interviews with stakeholders in the prep field, including clinicians, social service workers, nonprofit leaders and researchers, many expressed concern that an unexpected downside of prep's recent burst onto the scene is that the hiv prevention method is apparently on a path to widen already tragic racial disparities in infection rates among msm.
by the time the midterm elections began, the sunrise movement had started carving out a place for itself, helping to elevate candidates who took climate change more seriously than just declaring a belief in the basic science. the group helped run a ground campaign for left-wing candidates like rep. alexandria ocasio-cortez (d-n.y.) and michigan gubernatorial hopeful abdul el-sayed. the sunrise movement also bird-dogged powerful incumbents like new york gov. andrew cuomo, who was forced to make an embarrassing public reversal after a teenage activist got him to promise to stop taking fossil fuel money on camera.
perdue said that the last government funding bill congress passed, which expired on dec. 21, gave him 30 days to issue the following month's benefits, which will amount to nearly $5 billion overall. perdue didn't make any promises about what would happen in march.

in the final days of the race, warnock did little to directly acknowledge the seismic event his victory would represent. but win or lose, warnock helped create a new political era for the democratic party, one where the party is unafraid and even eager to nominate black candidates for statewide offices after decades of often confining ambitious black politicians to safe house seats and big city mayorships.
the international day of women and girls in science was created on december 22, 2015, at the 70th session of the u.n. general assembly. it solidified the commitment of member states to achieve gender parity in all areas and aims to meet new demands set forth by the united nations' sustainable development goals.
curiously, seconds after the government's defeat was announced, european council president donald tusk took to twitter to suggest the uk should stay in the eu, arguing the prime minister's historic loss in parliament left a deal looking impossible. he kept open the idea of brexit being reversed.
[we have] to point out to them that we would much more appreciate their openness about their deeply held convictions, versus hiding them or lying about them, he said. their integrity and their alliance on issues matters to voters much more than whether they happen to believe in god or not.
the ratios and percentages of mass incarceration play out in terms of human lives, sinha said in a statement. keeping a book that examines a national tragedy out of the hands of the people mired within it adds insult to injury.
the law firm told the thomson reuters foundation it was hopeful for a positive outcome, but expected it would be weeks before a decision was made.
here's what you need to consider before sending job hoppers to the 'no' pile again:
in 1976, walter stahel and genevieve reday published a report for the european commission whose title seems a misprint: the potential for substituting manpower for energy. hold on there. for thousands of years progress meant substituting machines for manpower, the exact opposite. this much is true. but the success of two centuries of industrial society brought about a problem of scale; human population and its material throughput reached such proportions as to turn what was real progress for billions of individuals into a collective boomerang. today, consuming and wasting far too much material and energy compromises long-term planetary equilibrium and leads us into a new era that earth scientists call the 'anthropocene'; a geological epoch in which human activities began to have a significant global impact on earth's geology and ecosystems.
under the eu withdrawal act 2018, the default position is that the uk will leave the eu on march 29, 2019 – with or without any agreement.
the man directly to my left asked if he could play with my breasts. i said yes. it felt good, but like the sybian, it wasn't going to get me off.
so why does the gender makeup of economists really matter? would we have more information on the global social impacts of climate change, the root causes of income inequality, and solutions to the gender wage gap if economics were more gender balanced? might policy questions have been asked or answered differently if more women were economists?
hud has suggested that the rental contract expirations likely won't lead landlords to start evicting residents anytime soon. the department has asked landlords not to evict tenants and to dip into reserve funds to meet expenses, if necessary.
2016 found me in auto-recovery mode after leaving behind 2015 which was a momentous year of change and first-hand experiences - including dealing with newly involved political players in my homeland greece, spearheading change in a public space that is known to be challenging and rather inflexible (greece and the eu), and negotiating on the side of the greek government vis-à-vis the country's lenders. in so many ways, this was a tough and taxing experience.
regular exclusion from meetings and off-site events fosters resentment and a sense of division for many contractors. jaime called her experience as a contractor morale crushing.
the real question is how that land should be managed and how grazing and natural resource extraction will remain viable and part of the multiple use doctrine that historically governed public lands, the east oregonian writes. government policy once fostered the timber, livestock and mining industries that became the economic lifeblood of rural western communities. current policy -- the result of environmental lawsuits and regulatory and legislative changes -- is largely responsible for draining that lifeblood.
this was never going to be easy, jennifer kates, senior vice president at the henry j. kaiser family foundation, told huffpost. but the federal government basically punted the hard stuff to states who, left reeling from the ongoing impact of covid-19, weren't able to mount a robust effort in most cases. in addition, many states in turn punted the hard stuff to counties. at the end of the day, everyone is playing catch up and the stakes are very high.
there was also another incident a few months ago in india where you got in some trouble for holding a poster that said smash brahmanical patriarchy. a lot of people see these as a sort of institutional ignorance, or that twitter doesn't really understand the responsibility of its role in the world. how how would you respond to that?
tuition at four-year public colleges has risen 35 percent since the 2008 school year, according to an analysis by the center on budget and policy priorities, a left-leaning think tank based in washington. in tennessee, per-student state funding at public colleges and universities declined 18 percent from 2008 to 2016, and the average annual tuition at public colleges and universities rose by more than $3,000 during that period.
both amazon and ebay, however, still feature several other racist costumes, including a different chinese boy fancy dress costume and a geisha girl costume. in the photos for both products, the models are holding their hands together in prayer, a stereotypical gesture often employed to mock asians.

the company is all but nonexistent online. in october, it hosted a blockchain innovators summit in pebble beach, california, which it described as the preeminent event in the history of blockchain. it is slated to host another blockchain conference in march in palm beach, florida. the price tag for attendees is $2,000 apiece.
and even if the conviction vote fails, the former white house official said, trump likely will never recover from americans' searing memory of the insurrection itself, particularly as more details emerge and more prosecutions are filed in court. it'll be next to impossible because he'll be saddled with it, the official said. he'll be saddled with jan. 6 forever.
president-elect joe biden this week proposed a covid-19 relief package that would deliver one-time $1,400 checks to most americans.
fighting climate change isn't about politics, it's about protecting our homes and jobs and preserving our communities for future generations, she said. in my view, there is no plan too bold or too ambitious.
the program, which began a year ago and is called the migrant protection protocols (mpp), is one of the most dramatic immigration policy changes enacted by the trump administration.

of course, in northern europe as in the rest of the world, stereotypes and double-standards still influence media coverage of women. women said journalists made numerous comments about their hair or clothing, or about looking exhausted after a late-night session (men were celebrated for their stamina).
it seems like every policy you were banging the drum about before covid, covid has made it clear just how necessary they are.
you can now understand this is a trend, perez-escamilla said. the truth of the matter is the [companies] have plenty of opportunity to self-police and self-regulate, and over and over again we're seeing it just doesn't work.

there are several other cringey moments in the first episode of mr. mayor. bremer has landed in hot water because he proposed a ban on plastic straws, which sparks criticism from a political rival, progressive councilwoman arpi meskimen (holly hunter). meskimen teams up with a group of local disability rights activists, who hold a protest against the ban. the show weirdly mocks the activists, via a line of dialogue that does not serve any narrative purpose. in another scene, bremer's communications director, jayden kwapis (bobby moynihan), tells the mayor that meskimen supports referring to coyotes as mini-wolves because she believes using the word coyote is cultural appropriation. the joke doesn't really land and comes off as if it's dismissing actual forms of cultural appropriation.
at the start of his career in politics, sanders viewed the democratic party as hopeless. by 1985, he had already made several failed bids for elected office in vermont as a member of the progressive liberty union party. he finally succeeded in 1981, becoming mayor of burlington, the state's largest city, and toppling a five-term democratic mayor.

the bestselling economics textbook ever written ― paul samuelson's adventurously titled economics ― devotes just five of its 608 pages to the stock market, drawing the unhelpful conclusion: anyone who can accurately predict the future course of business will prosper, but there is no such person.
i want to be honest about my racial identity for me, for my kids and for my country. i want us to make some profound progress in making america a more accepting place where people can feel more and, ultimately, hurt less. i want to be exactly who i am, and i want my sons — and, really, everyone — to feel confident to do the same.
suri is mesmerizing. he covered 1. the presidency of george washington, 2. the civil war, 3. american progressive reforms of domestic and foreign policy the early 20th century, 4.the great depression/ ww ii/ the early cold war, and 5. 9/11 and the subsequent war on terror. all were powerful turning points in american history.
of course, nassar isn't the first beloved and much revered sports figure to have intimate access to young people and take advantage of them. penn state assistant football coach jerry sandusky spent years sexually abusing boys in a charitable program.
the takeaway, as supported from experts across the ideological spectrum, from brookings to cei, from labor to ups, is that deregulation worked - profoundly - and that forced access should be avoided.
in one of the tweets, you said part of the meditation technique was to answer the question, how do i stop suffering? i'm assuming that means in terms of the individual?
fire uses a simple red, yellow, and green traffic light system to rate colleges' written policies on expression. when we first published our findings in 2007, 75% of colleges maintained red light—or laughably unconstitutional—speech codes. in 2015, after years of fighting both inside and outside of court, the percentage of red light codes had dropped to around 55%. and since chairman goodlatte's letter was sent, that number has now dropped below 35% at public colleges. at the same time, the number of green light schools (colleges whose codes do not threaten protected speech) has nearly doubled.
parents will be able to select the new version as an option that will exist alongside youtube kids' algorithm-based app. in theory, the whitelisted mode would mean the app will no longer suggest disturbing or sexually-explicit content featuring favorite kids characters like peppa pig or the paw patrol, or even conspiracy theory videos making claims that the earth is flat ― a problem revealed by a business insider investigation last month, buzzfeed news reported.
and even the parliamentarian's word is not final. in practice, the way reconciliation debates work is that senators can raise objections to specific provisions, requiring rulings from the presiding officer, who typically follows the parliamentarian's counsel. rulings of the presiding officer are, in turn, subject to votes from the full senate.
our governance system has been managing poverty. it's a similar situation in every first nation in this province, in this country, of managing limited funds to be able to assist our people, smith said.
but sure enough, in one of the many gaffes he commits that day, bremer visits a school and eats a slice of pizza (on camera, of course) by rolling it up and holding it like a burrito. earlier in the day, he cuts the ribbon at the grand opening of a weed dispensary and then eats too many weed gummies.
and because the tax credits are available on a sliding scale, relative to income, even some people eligible for assistance struggle with either premiums, high out-of-pocket costs or both.
this means that the value of a company's stock, while based on an enormous amount of information, is inherently unstable and essentially arbitrary.
the country currently at the epicenter of the pandemic faces a critical moment this week that could prove to be a global turning point in stemming coronavirus.
more than any other place i've seen, he said, san francisco's harm reduction community systematically talks to drug users about their preferences and experiences and continuously feeds that information to the san francisco department of health, which uses that intelligence to inform its message and overdose prevention strategies.
some unscrupulous owners have rented space out short-term to prostitutes, for orgies and noisy parties. in toronto, about three years ago, a meth lab blew up in a condo building in liberty village due to the activities of someone who shared an apartment. other egregious examples of damages or bad behavior have occurred.
normally, congress also relies on the nonpartisan joint committee on taxation to assess how much money its tax proposals will either add to or take away from the treasury. in 2017 the jct issued 27 reports, but republicans eschewed the panel's advice on the big question of whether the proposed tax cuts would generate any economic growth to partially offset the trillions of dollars in lost revenue.
sweden does not grant asylum to all applicants. nonetheless, the generous policy, which has proved controversial, means the scandinavian country has taken in more refugees per capita than any other european nation.

the broadcast aimed to push back against a narrative developing in the media that sanders would have difficulty retaining his 2016 staff, as well as to pre-emptively refute questions about the diversity of his staff and surrogates in a hypothetical 2020 run. in addition to brezler, the speakers included nina turner, president of our revolution, and roseann demoro, former executive director of national nurses united. the discussion also featured contributions from roy tatem, the former deputy director of sanders' 2016 african-american outreach; cori bush, an african-american nurse and former progressive congressional candidate; and belén sisa, an undocumented immigrant activist and former member of sanders' latino outreach team.

when biden unveiled his $1.9 trillion coronavirus recovery proposal last week ― complete with billions to boost vaccine distribution, a $15 minimum wage and a $1,400 check sent to most americans ― casey was ecstatic.
if men are the majority of full professors (and they are), younger female academics may find it harder to have their research seen as valuable. if men are the majority of editors of economics journals (and they really are), it is not difficult to understand why, as erin hengel has shown, in some of the top journals in economics, it takes women six months longer to go through the review process for publishing in some of the top economics journals. the imbalance also may be a reason why the research topics of women economists don't appeal to those male editors.
the outcry reflects a fear that growing censorship tends to ban all gay content as dirty, a setback for efforts to carve out an online space of tolerance for homosexuality in china's traditionally confucian society, lgbt advocates say.
within the first hour of the trial, lawyers for the aclu complained kobach had sent them a document at 10:45 p.m. monday and they had not had time to review it. judge julie robinson, a george w. bush appointee, declined to let kobach use the documents in court.

i hope so. mothers and fathers cannot go back to work if you don't restore day care. we've lost so many day care centers because of the epidemic. as small businesses, they've been unable to survive. they didn't get resources for the additional ppe or the additional [social distancing] needs. before the pandemic, for every four children looking for day care spots, there was only one spot. now, for every eight children that are looking for a spot, there's only one spot. so the need has exponentially grown.

if you're looking to diversify your workforce -- or simply outsource projects to third-party development teams -- 2017 is the year to look at the options. statistically, remote workers are more driven, focused, reliable, and cost-effective than their in-office counterparts. and they're just plain happier to boot. now that's a win-win scenario.

so americans are getting vaccines a lot more slowly than their israeli counterparts. at the same time, they're getting them significantly more quickly than most of their european counterparts. only the united kingdom, where the rolling seven-day average was 0.29 on tuesday, is putting more shots into arms per capita every day.

it was our understanding that prosecution would happen in an afternoon or in days, [that a child would remain] in dhs custody and then there would be reunification with the children, hamilton said. we didn't ever imagine dhs would lose track of the kids and their location. like sending children off to a shelter in new jersey. that was not our understanding at all.

it is time for a big, multitrillion-dollar economic relief package ― for the sake of american families and public health. the results of the georgia runoff make that kind of legislation much more plausible.
the lesson of the trump years is that executive order is a weak tool, said amy myers jaffe, managing director of the climate policy lab at tufts university. the biden team absolutely needs to see how they can support states ― from new england wind to stricter methane rules mirroring colorado to california's clean freight and [electric vehicle] policies.

leading up to the president's last address tuesday night, reformers are mostly resigned to the fact that the president will decline to announce any such plan. they do believe that he could lay the groundwork for an announcement on the sixth anniversary of the supreme court's citizens united decision, which opened the door to unlimited corporate, union and, ultimately, individual spending on independent electoral efforts.

1. follow the platinum rule. the golden rule (treat others as you want to be treated) has a fatal flaw: it assumes that all people want to be treated the same way. it ignores the fact that people are motivated by vastly different things. one person loves public recognition, while another loathes being the center of attention. the platinum rule (treat others as they want to be treated) corrects that flaw. good managers are great at reading other people, and they adjust their behavior and style accordingly.
inslee fought over the past year to pass initiative 1631, a ballot measure that would have put a $15 per metric ton fee on carbon dioxide emissions and directed the money toward expanding public transit, energy-efficiency retrofits for big buildings and new wind- and solar-powered plants. the proposal, dubbed by some a state-level green new deal, failed after the oil industry spent a record $31 million pressuring evergreen state voters to reject the measure. it was inslee's third attempt at putting a price on carbon in his state.

under trump, the state department has reduced the red tape in terms of increasing the relevance of dcs track. the gains of that were witnessed in the year after trump took office when americans hit their highest peak at 55.66 billion dollars because of these actions. it is a priority for the trump administration to sell more and india emerges as a natural partner. india, after saudi arabia, is the largest importer for arms. why wouldn't they want to tap into this rising economy that is increasingly going to have enough economic heft to spend as much on its defence?

many people will balk at such a solution because it doesn't roar with accountability for offenders; female arrestees broke the law, after all, some in very serious ways. but the fever for accountability ― the fever that spiked as nassar's victims described their suffering with such eloquence and rage ― needs to be brought down. one way to do that is to recognize that our thirst for justice in an extreme case like the nassar scandal is at odds with how we treat many victims of child sex abuse.

meanwhile, in the white-collar world, if oil prices do rebound, it's more likely that oil companies will be chasing graduates than the other way around. the fossil fuel industry has been worried for years about the lack of interest shown by younger generations in working for oil and gas companies. even a few years ago, young people saw careers in the industry as difficult, dangerous and harmful to society. between the 2014 crash and the pandemic, now it also seems financially unstable. so even as they lay off workers in the field, oil companies continue to recruit at universities to avoid creating a generation gap in their workforce, a problem the industry grappled with in the 1980s.

proponents of the tax increases see them as the appropriate antidote to an uneven, or k-shaped, recovery from the economic fallout of the pandemic. working-class people, including black and latino communities already harder hit by covid-19, have been much more likely than upper-middle-class professionals to lose their jobs or otherwise have their lives upended since march. food pantries are seeing unprecedented demand and the plight of the state's 725,000 undocumented immigrants, who have not been eligible for previous rounds of aid, has been especially acute.

i've said often that the common core failed in its creators' central goal ― to establish a set of national standards followed with fidelity by every school from maine to alaska. every school would follow the exact same set of learning goals so that a child who left iowa to attend school in florida could make the switch without missing a step. the standards would be set in cement (remember the rule that a state could only add 15 percent additional stuff) and we would all march together in lockstep into a fully-standardized perfect education future.

with the exception of miller, none of these new managers has been announced to the public or even to the staff itself. and the only reason anyone knows any of this is thanks to the company's internal hr software, which has proved to be one of the only windows into management's thinking. huffpost spoke with 12 current and former times employees, all of whom asked to remain anonymous for fear of retribution. they described an atmosphere of intense secrecy, distrust and anxiety as they try to get to the bottom of a story they're living instead of reporting: what exactly does tronc have in store for them?

an example of this was the reversal of yet another obama-era rule that, for the first time, exposed banks and credit card companies to class action lawsuits by consumers who believed they were victims of fraud. the trump administration and its allies claimed this was an effort to help consumers, because class action lawsuits merely enrich trial lawyers. but, as consumer advocates point out, fear of class action suits and their potentially big awards are precisely what it takes to keep large financial institutions in line.

the party quickly made a crucial decision. rather than pursue swing voters, they would focus on turning out the democratic base, especially black voters. the choice wasn't obvious. there were roughly 100,000 voters, mostly in the atlanta suburbs, who cast ballots for biden and purdue in november. but knowing republicans had roughly 300,000 more high-propensity voters in the state than democrats, the campaigns wagered their best bet was to fire up black turnout.

earlier in the day, boris johnson had tried to love-bomb remain voters with a promise of a liberal brexit. however he also warned another referendum would only deepen the divisions in society. i think last summer, during the general election, i think there was some force in that argument, cable concedes. it's one of the reasons we didn't get any traction. the most recent yougov poll put the libdems on 8% of the national vote. it won a 7.4% share at the election. the first real test for the party since the general election will be may's local elections london where the conservatives fear a wipeout at the hands of jeremy corbyn's labour. we don't think it's going to be an easy election because we are defending a lot of seats, cable says. in some of the inner-city areas where we are up against corbynistas we don't underestimate the problems. but he says the party is hoping for substantial gains in his home borough of richmond as well as neighbouring kingston.
the authoritarian strain in the republican party, however, is not merely a product of its unwashed fringe. take, for example, trump's most aggressive attorney general, william barr, who did not rise to power through breitbart or facebook paranoia. he has a long and illustrious career serving on corporate boards and as ag for george h.w. bush in the long, long-ago days when republicans were supposedly so much more refined and sensible. but as tom hamburger and others have detailed, barr has long championed the unitary executive ― a fancy name for a theory of monarchical presidential power embraced by, among others, former vice president dick cheney. though its adherents embrace different definitions and engage in various micro-doctrinal disputes, the basic idea is, as richard nixon once put it, when the president does it, that means it's not illegal.

i absolutely thought of these textbooks when watching what played out last week, wellman said. it's the anti-science culture, anti-elite, the identification of christianity with military culture.
the number of latino-americans who also identify as black has rapidly increased over the past few decades. in 1980, approximately 389,000 latino-americans identified as black. fast forward 30 years, and by 2010, the afro-latino population in the u.s. had risen to approximately 1.2 million. the highest percentage of afro-latino individuals who self-identify as black are dominican, followed by puerto rican, but it's crucial to note many latinos, particularly recent immigrants, tend to reject our racial categories here in the u.s. in one pew research study, for example, 24 percent of latino respondents identified themselves specifically as afro-latino. however, when asked about their race, only 18 percent of these same afro-latino respondents identified as being black. this shows just how complicated self-identification and socially assigned race can be ― and how discrimination, internalized oppression and self-preservation further affects them. all of this influences a person's overall health and well-being.
nearly four years ago, yahoo ceo marissa mayer reversed the tech company's policy on working remotely, forcing all telecommuting employees to head back to the office. although some industry experts came to mayer's defense, most called the move shortsighted. fast-forward to present day, the argument for working from home has only strengthened. and whether you're the employer or employee, the scenario is surprisingly win-win.
mitchell apparently missed the memo. just last week she signed a letter issued by the conservative action committee calling on the senate to investigate election results. she identified herself in the dec. 30 message as a lawyer but didn't identify her law firm.

but on the train from the airport, she received a message from her hosts telling her they had cancelled her booking with deep regret, as they had to err on the side of caution following world health organisation (who) warnings about the spread of the deadly virus. i had not visited china, or been anywhere near hubei province [where the virus originated], the 31-year-old yale student told huffpost uk. in fact i have been living in the usa and spending a lot of time in tokyo in the last year. i only visited taiwan very briefly to renew my us visa. taiwan has had a very small number of cases compared to other countries, so why would they think i posed a risk to them? i had nowhere else to go, no access to phone data and had to jump on a random train to access wifi, so i could try to get in touch with friends who might be able to help me.
the capitol attack of jan. 6, 2021, demonstrated just how vital it is that the u.s. military ― the largest organization in the country and the best-armed force in the world ― abides by democratic norms. when outgoing president donald trump and his allies met in december to discuss how to overturn the election, retired lt. gen. michael t. flynn reportedly floated the idea of using the military to redo the vote.

the obvious commentary on so-called cancel culture quickly becomes tiresome. these days, watching a show set in the world of politics and government is already difficult, and mr. mayor, co-created by tina fey and her frequent collaborator robert carlock, is just … aggressively fine. although the workplace comedy's first two episodes, which premiered thursday, are underwhelming compared to fey's prior sitcoms (30 rock and unbreakable kimmy schmidt), mr. mayor is already emblematic of both the best and worst of the tina fey tv universe. her shows are great when their densely packed jokes and plotlines involve punching up, when the subjects of their mockery have ample power. but when the jokes and plotlines punch down and take unnecessary digs, the shows become more frustrating to watch.
democratic leadership rejected the plan, but the effort succeeded in shifting the climate debate in the direction scientists say matches the extent of the crisis. by mid-december, more than 300 local and state officials voiced support for a green new deal in an open letter. days later, a poll from yale university and george mason university found 81 percent of registered voters surveyed said they supported a green new deal, including 64 percent of republicans and 57 percent of conservative republicans.

much as the rioting in d.c. on wednesday capped trump's long record of inciting political violence, the lease sale is a fitting finale for the administration's anti-conservation legacy. trump and his team have spent four years bending over backward for fossil fuel and other extractive industries, with little concern for how its energy dominance agenda will impact the climate and wildlife.

and that ultimately is the problem with test-centered schools; the relationship between the school and the student is turned upside down. instead of asking, how does this help us meet the educational needs of our students, the school asks, how will this affect our test scores? in a test-centered school, the school is not there to serve the students -- the students are there to meet the needs of the school. and no -- there isn't a scintilla of evidence that test prep serves student needs, nor that test results are an important indicator of their education.

as i said, i live in boston. i share a two-bedroom apartment with another person, i commute an hour on the train every morning for classes. i spend my freedom dividend entirely on rent, but i could have had more to spare if i chose to share a room or live in a different town. this maybe isn't the smartest way to use my basic income — it could be more fruitful to have leftover money to pay for bills or groceries or something. but it was my decision to do so, and any time i feel like i don't have enough left in my bank for what i want to do, i at least feel the security that it was my decision and mine alone.

no. what i said is that there was an active conspiracy theory around all these companies working together. we want to state that we have a terms of service and that we are going to follow it. then when we find that we need to take action, we'll take action. but there's no decision other than making sure that we stay true to our enforcement policies.

in the longer term, a reunited korea would have enormous internal issues to deal with. this process would, we anticipate, be much more difficult than the reintegration of west and east germany. as this process unfolds, us military forces would stay where they are. as korea stabilizes, the time may come when the korean government no longer feels that it needs the reassurance of american troops stationed there. in that case, the u.s. will, of course, withdraw those troops. in no case will us troops be anywhere near the yalu river.

herbert said in a statement that the bill is good public policy aimed at reducing the number of alcohol-related deaths on utah's roads.
since our founding in 1999, fire has fought free speech zones—efforts by administrators to quarantine freedom of speech to tiny areas. and we've defeated many of them, including texas tech's infamous free speech gazebo, the university of hawaii at hilo's free speech swamp, and this sad little one at blinn college, which was divided into even smaller halves by a bulletin board. many institutions even require advance permission for students to speak inside the zones: for example, the university of cincinnati asked for 10 working days' notice.

at least, in the last months of 2016 the g20 leaders' communique recognised the impact excess capacity has had on the global economy and there's now a chance of focusing on this problem. excess global capacity in steel and other industries is mainly a result of falling demand, rising production and excessive government subsidies.
prime minister justin trudeau suggested in an interview with global news anchor dawna friesen that the u.s. has some responsibility in the tragedy. i think if there were no tensions, if there was no escalation recently in the region, those canadians would be right now home with their families, he said on monday.

in phone surveys, staffers said, ca's predictions fell short of the 85 percent accuracy the campaign expected. (different models have differing levels of accuracy, nix said in his response. i suspect these numbers have been taken out of context to make us look bad. in many previous articles the cruz campaign have highly rated the quality of our data scientists.) by september, ca's first six-month contract was up. a ca employee in the campaign's houston office accidentally left the invoice in the photocopier, and wilson happened to fish it out. the invoice totaled an eye-popping $3,119,052 for work that wilson estimated to be worth $600,000 at most. i can't fucking believe it, wilson told roe, who concurred. jeff roe (left) with ted cruz (right), who ultimately fell out of rebekah mercer's favor. we felt to some extent she was being manipulated by bannon, a cruz adviser said. ethan miller/getty images nix disputed this account too, noting that the firm's fee was clearly stated in our statement of work and contract. however, a former consultant for the campaign, tommy sears, attended budget meetings for two if not three days over the matter. there was an understanding between both parties that the totality of the contract through march 2016 would be $5.5 million, he says. the heartburn felt by the cruz team was that over $3 million had already been spent by september 1, 2015. when the cruz team decided not to pay the full $3 million, bedlam ensued.

while trump frequently claims he has done more than any previous president ― in less than two years, my administration has accomplished more than almost any administration in the history of our country, he told the united nations just 20 months into his term ― in reality, he leaves office with among the thinnest portfolios of policy successes of any president in modern times.

things got worse: the economy collapsed in 2013, plunging millions out of work and millions more back into poverty. in 2014, a money-laundering investigation turned into the world's broadest political corruption investigation. known as operation car wash, or lava jato in portuguese, it has implicated hundreds of brazilian politicians, including da silva and outgoing president michel temer, of the centrist democratic movement party. violent crime has surged ― there were more than 60,000 homicides in each of the last two years. president dilma rousseff, da silva's hand-picked successor, was impeached in 2016. da silva was convicted on money-laundering charges in 2017 and imprisoned this year; temer has only narrowly escaped trial on bribery charges.

nothing suggests that friedman or bone have met trump at mar-a-lago since he became president, or that either visited the resort to advance any special interests. and there's no comparing buttigieg's high-dollar fundraisers with the corruption scandals erupting out of mar-a-lago, where the line between trump's business interests and his policies is virtually nonexistent.

unfortunately, this is not always the case in practice. this is the reason we have noticed such abrupt changes in 2016. and this is why t4a launched political entrepreneurship: building leadership in a public private ecosystem, which was presented to global innovative entrepreneurs last october at opportunity collaboration. it was exciting to see the development of a productive dialogue on public policy from the side of entrepreneurs.
the footage, which was shot for the documentary and shared exclusively with huffpost, showed the immediate aftermath of an airstrike and included reflections by elhubbish and others that highlight the toll of the bombing campaign.
the survey found rice has a 70 percent approval rating ― higher than pelosi's, as the washington post first reported. still, nassau county activist siela bynoe said she is considering a primary challenge in 2020.
it's reprehensible that the government expects us to navigate all of this, to understand the intricacies of foreign policy and border control when we're just two 20-somethings who came out here backpacking months and months ago, she said.
i think many of us feel that if more people had been in the area earlier that we could potentially be in a better place today, the anonymous u.s. official told huffpost. but i don't do security assessments; i do public health assessments.

i also wanted to ask you a little bit about the apology you made to candace owens a while back. you said, hi candace, i want to apologize for our labeling you 'far-right.' team completed a full review of how this was published and why we corrected far too late. i think you'd be kind of hard-pressed to find anyone who would say candace owens isn't far-right, and i think she would agree with that if she was being honest. but even if you dispute that, getting an apology from the ceo of twitter for something like this seems like an extraordinary step. i'm curious why you decided to intervene in this particular instance directly.
2020 may be over, but the covid-19 pandemic continues, with a total of 86 million cases and 1.8 million deaths worldwide.

mccaul toggled between anger, frustration and flat-out exhaustion as she discussed the various institutional errors.
i've said this before, but it bears repeating. go with your gut. do not second guess yourself. i should have listened to the voice in my head when it said don't marry that one, for sure don't marry that one, the mussels do smell funny, buy apple, and go to froedtert hospital; they'll know what to do.

the lawsuit also claims that deputies often tell arrestees that if they aren't silent during bail hearings, judges may arbitrarily increase the amount required for release. a judge in harris county, texas, came under fire for exactly this behavior in 2016, when he was recorded doubling a defendant's bail from $1,000 to $2,000 after she responded to a yes or no question by saying yeah instead of yes. the woman had been arrested for misdemeanor marijuana possession.

dr. christopher bolling, who chairs the american academy of pediatrics section on obesity, argued that this racial targeting comes down to a common denominator: poverty. he said kids of lower socioeconomic status are more likely to live in food deserts ― where healthy foods are largely inaccessible and there are the most fast food restaurants per capita. and african-americans under 18 are three times as likely to live in poverty as white youths. hispanic children are more than twice as likely as white kids to live in poverty, according to 2017 data from the annie e. casey foundation.

del duca says he's the best person to rebuild the party after its whopping 2018 defeat that reduced it to seven sitting mpps. many liberal stalwarts agree.
by the time the same pollsters asked a different version of that question at the end of 2018, those differences had ballooned, due largely to movement among trump's opponents. those who voted for democrat clinton now said by a 42-point margin that the u.s. had a responsibility to do something about the fighting in syria involving isis, while trump voters said by a 16-point margin that the nation had no such responsibility. that movement is particularly notable because the question included no mention of trump, nor any cues about which of the positions he currently holds.

many academics fear what the tax law will create. many of the new changes fundamentally undermine the integrity of the tax code and allow well-advised taxpayers to game the new rules, wrote 13 professors of tax law in a december 2017 critique as the law sped toward approval. we must aim to learn from this recent historical episode, wherein a rushed and secretive process resulted in deeply flawed legislation.

tokyo — the tentacles of canceling the tokyo olympics — or postponing or staging it in empty venues — would reach into every corner of the globe, much like the spreading virus that now imperils the opening ceremony on july 24.
in a statement wednesday, the bank of canada said it is becoming clear the canadian economy won't grow as much as previously forecasted for the first quarter of this year.
once upon a time, school districts would plan curriculum, the whole scope and sequence and pedagogical approach as well as the actual content― they would do all of that by consulting the experts that they had already hired. maybe a curriculum director if they had one, or some other administrator if they didn't. certainly an assortment of their actual classroom teachers. those folks might consult some other reliable sources as well as using their own professional judgment to develop the district's educational plan.
the two share a history. trudeau has said reynolds is his favourite canadian ryan (sorry gosling) and there was that one time the vancouver actor asked trudeau to annex alaska. and while reynolds didn't formally endorse anyone in last year's federal election, he did praise the last four years of climate policy under trudeau's leadership.
the federal investigation was prompted by a massive report from the houston chronicle in 2016.
in the close to 15 years that i've been editing the journal, nobody has used donald trump's the art of the deal as a citation in their article. never. not once, said nancy waters, the managing editor of the journal, which is the publication for the program on negotiation, a consortium that includes massachusetts institute of technology and tufts university.
republican gov. sam brownback, a vocal opponent of same-sex marriage, rescinded sebelius' order in 2015, arguing that state lawmakers should set such a policy. it was clear at the time that the gop-dominated legislature and its conservative leaders would not.
we're in a race against this virus and quite frankly, we're behind, adams told fox & friends. the good news is that 700,000 people are getting vaccinated every single day. we're going to hit 1 million people and we need to continue to pick up that pace.
many drivers are doing this job part time and really only looking to make a few hundred bucks a week, campbell said, but figuring out how much they are actually earning can be quite challenging.
and i've found that my desire for representation has not dimmed in the slightest, despite a growing chorus of skeptical voices who wonder if a woman can beat trump. its return has surprised me with its ferocity. to see a female president in my lifetime is not an idle wish; it is a hunger, an insatiable desire. watching the 116th congress being sworn in was a swelling reminder of what it is to feel represented in my government, but it was also a reminder of how partial those gains have been, and how dear. in a country that has never been led by a woman, how can anyone claim that gender equality is at hand ― or even possible?
less than a year after legalizing marriage equality, bermuda passed a law last month to ban same-sex marriage once again.
the u.s. state department raised its global travel advisory to level 4 on thursday, strongly urging americans to avoid international travel during the coronavirus pandemic and to return home as soon as possible if they're already abroad.

joe brusuelas, an economist with the accounting firm rsm, estimated a full year without snap benefits would reduce gross domestic product by as much as 1 percent. (for comparison, most analyses of the new republican tax law said it would boost gdp by less than 1 percent in its early years.)
a nonprofit group called american workers for progress spent $720,000 in january on issue ads backing cuellar. the group is associated with texas-based political consultant gilberto ocañas and was created as a delaware-corporation on dec. 11. there is little other information explaining who supports it or is funding its pro-cuellar efforts.
the debates between clinton's supporters and those who backed bernie sanders became a policy battleground, one in which my natural affinity drifted toward the eminently sensible policies of single-payer health care and free college education. but gender was the undercurrent of all those arguments, the acrid aftertaste i couldn't shake. throughout it all, i still wanted a woman president.
that's not even the full extent of legislation democrats could possibly pass, thanks to an obscure provision of the budget process that seems to allow for revisions to previous reconciliation bills within the same fiscal year.
it was completely disgusting and wrong, the worker said.
the real action on brexit talks between may and other parties starts next week. mps held off proposing their alternatives today because they wanted a clear signal that may's deal was dead first.
when it comes to the question of $2,000 payments and more comprehensive covid-19 relief, such as expanded unemployment benefits and aid to state and local governments, progressives stand to serve as allies of biden against both republicans and the handful of conservative democrats who are already indicating that they plan to break with biden on the urgency of economic action.
biden has suggested a much longer timeline for republican cooperation.
nearly four years later, on jan. 6 of this year, a mob of trump's most fervent supporters ― incited by the then-president himself ― violently stormed the u.s. capitol to try to stop congress from certifying president-elect joe biden's victory.

some states, such as arkansas and kentucky, limit their programs to students in selected fields. arkansas only awards grants to students focusing on science, technology, engineering, math and other subjects employers most value. this year, work ready kentucky is limiting aid to students studying health care, transportation and logistics, advanced manufacturing, construction, and business services and information technology.
for example, if you own a home, you may consider refinancing your mortgage. now is actually a great time to refinance since interest rates are so low ― as long as the math works out, of course. if you qualify to refinance to a lower rate, and you're able to keep closing costs to a minimum, you could reduce your monthly mortgage payment and save money over the life of the loan. just be wary of extending the term length, as this will likely wipe out your savings in the long run.

guitar center has been wrapped up in a nasty labor dispute with the retail, wholesale and department store union, which provided the arbitration documents to huffpost. in 2013, rwdsu won elections at three guitar center stores, including las vegas, but the union is still without a contract at any of them. the general counsel of the national labor relations board accused the company of refusing to bargain in good faith, leading to a recent two-week trial. a decision hasn't yet been issued.

this isn't the first time jorjani has faced accusations of perjury. in july last year, sen. ron wyden (d-ore.) placed a hold on his confirmation to the top solicitor post over concerns that jorjani lied to lawmakers about his role in reviewing public information requests submitted to the department. wyden also requested that the justice department investigate whether jorjani perjured himself during his may confirmation hearing.

i just never in my wildest dreams would have expected that an elected official ― at any level ― would do what has happened, not only with the president but also local officials and state legislators who have pushed these crazy conspiracies not based in fact. i just never expected that to occur in the united states of america.
the lawmaker's identity has not been revealed, but state senators received a letter this afternoon informing them of the diagnosis and urging them to self-quarantine through the end of the month.
both the religious background to equilibrium theory and the posture of faith that is expected of market actors raise questions about the ideal response to market panics. just as various natural disasters, like the lisbon earthquake of 1755, put theories of divine providence into question, so repeated financial crises are bringing equilibrium theory under greater scrutiny. it's not at all apparent that markets will self-regulate and should thus be left to themselves -- whatever that may mean.
what people are fighting against all across the country is the dehumanization of the folks who are processed through the criminal legal system, she said. one of the key reasons that this system has developed is that the folks running it have stopped seeing the human beings that pass through it as people and have started seeing them as just cases to be processed.
everything happened so fast. it was just mass confusion, said bayes-fleming, a 24-year-old toronto resident.
despite failing to deliver on his promises, despite a botched coronavirus response that began with months of denial, despite tens of thousands of lies to the public on any number of topics, and despite funneling many millions of dollars from domestic and foreign lobbyists, republican donors large and small, and american taxpayers into his own pockets over his four years in office, trump nevertheless received nearly 11 million more votes in 2020 than he had in 2016.
i don't know the details but, um, yeah. i appreciate when people speak up when they think that, you know, someone has done them wrong. speaking truth to power is something that has flourished on our platform, and she believes we've done wrong by her, and she took action. so, i respect that. i don't agree with most of the things she says, but, you know.
doe says that she endured the after effects of sexual assault for the rest of her time at baylor: panic attacks, anxiety, and a fear of running into her rapist. (armistead was still on campus, chatman had left). she graduated in 2015.
the existing medicare for all proposals would basically eliminate private insurance because the new public program would cover everything, every single american would belong to it and the law would prohibit private insurers from offering anything similar.
and here's where the story gets really interesting. any normal supreme court would find, as the 1952 court did in the youngstown sheet and tube case, that the president had exceeded his authority.
a conversation with twitter ceo jack dorsey can be incredibly disorienting. not because he's particularly clever or thought-provoking, but because he sounds like he should be. he takes long pauses before he speaks. he furrows his brow, setting you up for a considered response from the man many have called a genius. the words themselves sound like they should probably mean something, too. dorsey is just hard enough to follow that it's easy to assume that any confusion is your own fault, and that if you just listen a little more or think a little harder, whatever he's saying will finally start to make sense.
washington ― none of this would have happened if only someone in the government had picked up the phone.

jacqueline simon, the policy director for the american federation of government employees, said no federal workers of any rank should be subjected to pay caps.
teachers play a crucial role. i mentioned earlier our comprehensive school reform that aims to develop a new way of thinking. how do we intend to realize this reform? by renovating teacher training. i have nominated a forum on teacher training, consisting of representatives from all universities providing teachers, whose task it is to develop new guidelines and contents for the formation of finnish teachers. the government will then provide grants to teachers so that they have better access to complementary education so that they, too, may upgrade their skills in, for example, using digital technology at school. we aim to have tutor teachers who instruct their colleagues on new pedagogics and the use of new technology. we encourage teachers to collaborate, to form networks and support one another.

if they succeed at trial and prove that mcdonald's has a significant hand in setting the working conditions, then mcdonald's could be punished for violating the workers' rights. the fast-food company would find itself answering to workers at franchised stores in a way it never had to before.
through it all, he said, gate agents did not explain the reason for the shuffle.
work and family can come first: there's a long-held belief that says it's nearly impossible to commit to a career and a family. and although this may have once been true, times have changed. in a recent microsoft study, nearly one-third of respondents wished they could work from home to spend more time with family. whether it's allowing workers to keep an eye on the kids or share more face time with a spouse, telecommuting is a simple and effective way to balance work and home.
rep. deb haaland (d-n.m.), one of the first two native american women elected to congress and a strong supporter of the green new deal movement, would replace a former oil lobbyist if the senate confirms her as head of the interior department. in place of the ex-coal lobbyist running the environmental protection agency would be michael regan, who brokered the biggest coal-ash cleanup settlement in u.s. history as north carolina's top environmental regulator. the energy department would swap a fossil fuel die-hard for jennifer granholm, michigan's former governor and attorney general and now a clean energy advocate.
the lesson, board members need to dial-up their pressure of holding the ceo accountable for people measures and metrics. sadly most boards today serve the ceo and are considered the epitome of the good old boys club. how many board members are asking tough questions about the progress and advancement of women in the organization? this can't merely fall on the few female board members, it must be asked by senior male board leaders as well.

there's 10 years of steady jobs for these people, not boom and bust the way it has been in the oil fields, horton said. and it's work that their skillset and identity is aligned with. plus, it leaves them in situ — they don't have to move, their kids stay in the same schools. ten years is a long time to transition, so it's really common sense convergence here. it's also worker solidarity, for these people in the fields not to feel like they're abandoned by society.
many airlines connecting australia to europe are working around the clock to accommodate customer needs amid the outbreak and have substantially changed cancellation policies.

now, according to several employees, d'vorkin is determined to find the leaker in his midst, and tronc is supporting the cause by sending human resources executive dyana burke to l.a. to assist the investigation. according to one former employee, they had to bring her in because there are no hr people left at the l.a. times. cindy ballard, tronc's former chief hr officer, resigned in december. ballard, in the words of one former employee, was the architect of the masthead purges in august, in which the editor-publisher, a managing editor, a deputy managing editor and an assistant managing editor were axed.

in the real world: my company has been implementing a significant change to our own business model based on feedback from the market. in past years, our main focus was to provide software and services directly to the federal government. however, by heeding feedback obtained via networking, social media and other sources, we found that things are changing and we should too. it's no longer solely about delivering directly to the government end user, but also helping it manufacturers and vendors enter the government market. this input led us to solidify our government reach program.
varma, who married a hindu man in 1993, was born into a shia muslim family from lucknow, a mostly peaceful city where she spent her formative years. lucknow remained calm even as the demolition of the babri masjid on 6 december, 1992, triggered the worst communal riots since the partition in 1947.
no more copays, no more coinsurance, no more deductibles ― yes, that's right, out-of-pocket spending would basically disappear under the existing medicare for all proposals. the only exception would be a provision in the sanders bill that would allow some token cost-sharing to encourage use of generic drugs.
capital gains tax is generally levied based on where you live, not where you invest. therefore, the capital gains tax charged by the canadian government has little effect on canada's ability to compete for capital from foreign investors. a foreign investor who invests in canadian companies listed on stock markets does not pay canadian capital gains tax. a lower capital gains tax may be justified for investments in small, new enterprises that are financed locally. those may deserve some special treatment, but it does not justify an across-the-board exemption.
the republican rot, in short, did not arise in january 2021 or even 2016. party power brokers have been advocating various strains of authoritarianism for decades because they are the surest way to ensure that the unpopular policy agenda of the american elite remains politically viable.

the very broad sentiment from right to left is that nobody wants big cannabis to own vermont, and whatever we do end up drafting for a tax-and-regulate bill will be oriented toward smaller production facilities and a more broad distribution of the economic benefit throughout the state, as opposed to large out of state corporate version, he said.
i was lied to and misguided into signing this contract. every manager told me different stories and offered me different things, none of which consisted of them taking any responsibility for their employees' lack of knowledge of policies. but since the at&t employee failed to put a notation on my account quoting our interaction in store, i am the party at fault, according to at&t.

the oregon siege is an extreme example of the modern struggle for legitimate power in a legal and leadership vacuum. frustration with the inadequate law and the failure of government to respond and modernize it has led to an unacceptable outcome: citizens' use of force to be heard. in the information age there are better and more accessible democratic alternatives.

a school system is never finished, and teachers are the change makers. the answer to your question lies, i believe, in three steps: first, grasping the need for a fundamental change, then making the right conclusions, and finally putting the conclusions to work. our current government has realized the need for change. we are now at the stage of getting to the conclusions, as the teacher training forum is finishing the first stage of their work. the next step is starting to implement change, and luckily, we have already set aside the money to do the work. we are going to spend 90 million euros on this, which is a big sum for a country as small as ours that is going through economically tough times.

wallace went on to press mulvaney for defending the president during other controversies. he noted that trump was impeached for pressuring ukraine to dig up dirt on his opponent, president-elect joe biden, while mulvaney was chief of staff. he also asked why mulvaney did not resign from his role as director of the office of management and budget after trump defended white supremacists who marched in charlottesville, virginia, in 2017, or after the administration separated parents from children at the u.s.-mexico border.

an actual cash value policy means that insurance will cover the actual current value of your items. so the mac laptop you bought new in 2015 for $1,500 will be replaced not at $1,500, but at whatever its value is today. and there's a very good chance that amount won't be enough to replace it new.

in a november 2015 editorial, the washington post admonished congress for blurring the line between fiscal and monetary policy, warning, many a banana republic . . . has come to grief using its central bank to facilitate government deficit spending. but according to prof. michael hudson, who has studied hyperinflations extensively, that is not why banana republics have gotten into trouble for printing money. he observes:
most republicans, we know, are not torch-bearing fascists. gop leaders have been especially keen to draw a distinction between respectable business-class conservatism and the maga mob. and yet they have bet their careers and the country on an alliance with trump's authoritarianism.
thus, in practice, there are only two ways to fix the euro: a far-reaching political union proposed in the five president's report in 2015 or returning to the system described in the maastricht treaty, where member states would be responsible for their own economies only (no bail-out).

trump spent much of the conversation wanting to talk about vaping; he was considering a new policy restricting its use. white house officials now believe trump didn't fully grasp the magnitude of the threat to the u.s. in part because azar, who was feuding with several members of trump's inner circle, did a poor job communicating it.

slowly, they have recast the second amendment to mean citizens should be armed against their government, horwitz said. examples abound, like newt gingrich saying the second amendment is not about hunting, and senate candidate sharron angle saying she hoped second amendment remedies wouldn't be the cure for the harry reid problems. in 2012, she was reid's general election opponent.
under the garb of maintaining law and order, chief minister ajay bisht, who calls himself yogi adityanath, has unleashed a brutal crackdown to crush any dissent against the discriminatory citizenship law. the up police has arrested thousands of people, beaten women and children, shot at non-protestors, and tortured children. now, the government is sending notices to people suspected of damaging public property to pay damages or face seizure of their properties.
i think that really limits the kind of interactions you have and the kind of friendships that you would make where you would even be in a position where someone would ask, 'do you want to be my plus-one?' calou said. i think there is a fear instilled on the side of employees that they might be putting themselves or that contractor at risk by engaging like they would another colleague.

all the women i spoke to agreed that this has helped, but only to a degree. women are still under-represented in ministries and decisive parliamentary commissions: among developed-world nations, only 17% of government ministers are women. it's also meaningful that in spain only 9% of male ministers do not have children, while 45% of female ministers do not.

you can't just say i'm bothered about the negative and bring them home and not care about the positives, said t sundararaman, former director of the national health systems resource centre. a sensible policy for the government of india would have been to speak with the iranian authorities to take care of these people and provide a certain degree of comfort.

it came after huffpost uk reported that patel had attempted to sack the home office director of communications andy tighe on christmas eve and had rutnam's staff cut out of meetings. allegations that patel is brutal with some staff at the home office, berating and insulting officials and branding them useless and a joke have also been raised with huffpost uk. she is said to have created a culture of fear that means officials are now afraid to challenge her or speak their minds because they are worried about being forced out like rutnam. and the claims show no sign of stopping, with the bbc reporting that a former aide to patel received a £25,000 payout after taking an overdose following bullying by the then-employment secretary in 2015. fresh allegations have also emerged of patel bullying staff around the time of her resigning from the department for international development. as those new claims emerged, a spokesman for the home secretary said she categorically denies them. but one senior former government adviser believes patel's position is now untenable. no.10 told everyone to call off the dogs of war on rutnam on monday but she was still actively encouraging it, they say. the problem for her is the machine will probably do her in in the end. she's not that bright and, as you know, at the home office you get blamed for all kinds of things that aren't your fault.

the obvious explanation is that men have literally never seen a woman in her 20s in the halls of congress before. she's attractive, telegenic and good at social media. she dances outside her cannon house office. conservative men are confused at being drawn to this bright rising star in the democratic party while loathing everything she stands for.
right, but i don't know if this is entirely gaming the system.
msnbc's rachel maddow on thursday did a deep dive into where president donald trump may get some of his conspiracy theories.

the target, enacted in 2004 and eliminated last year, was set at 8.5 percent of enrollment, and school districts were penalized for exceeding that benchmark, even though the state and national averages had both long been about 12 percent. as a direct result of the policy, regulators determined, the share of students receiving special education services in texas dropped from 11.6 percent in 2004 to 8.6 percent in 2016 — a difference of about 150,000 children.

he has taken the democratic party's loyalty pledge and repeatedly promised to support whoever becomes the party nominee to defeat president donald trump. but that hasn't been enough for many of his critics in the party's establishment, who are likely to point to the letter as evidence he doesn't play nice with the party.
the president also gave himself credit for an initial deal with china that he says will ultimately lead to a better economic relationship between the u.s. and the world's second-biggest economy ― even though it's unclear whether the key element of the bargain that's supposed to benefit american workers will actually be implemented and its effects have yet to be seen.

we are seeing young and old slip into depression in front of our eyes.
the story of 21st-century america is complex, but the narrative of powerful people behaving terribly and getting away with it is arguably the common thread. consider the illegal torture operations of george w. bush, dick cheney and john yoo. reflect on the financial frauds perpetrated by wall street bankers and foreclosure mills last decade (they're not exactly complying with the law this decade, either). contemplate the big lies of fossil fuel executives like exxon chair turned secretary of state rex tillerson. think about the violations of consent decrees, tax laws and antitrust statutes by the likes of mark zuckerberg, sheryl sandberg and the rest of silicon valley. reckon with the horrifying conduct brought front and center by #metoo. and then come to terms with the number of the aforementioned elites whose potential criminal liability has been taken seriously by prosecutors ― approximately zero.
that's why conservatives want and need to undercut her influence. and the most time-tested way to undermine a woman's power is to sexualize her, to make her an object instead of an agent. a 2013 study by the women's media center found that merely discussing a female candidate's appearance has a negative effect on her support from voters.
the 2018 farm bill can also build on state-level pilot programs. many states and localities have implemented policies limiting the amount of organic waste that businesses can send to landfills. in massachusetts, implementation of an organic waste ban achieved a five-fold increase in waste diversion, and created more than $175 million in economic activity and 500 jobs in just two years. measures like these have tremendous potential, but also require significant up-front investments to build waste diversion infrastructure. the farm bill could provide dedicated planning and implementation funding to support state governments that implement similar bans, making the wins seen in massachusetts replicable across the nation.

but after that report appeared, manchin called back the post to say that he was talking more about making vaccine funding a bigger priority and that he was not absolutely opposed to $2,000 checks. that could mean that even more conservative democrats like manchin recognize that the best way to win over voters is to show progress and enact policies that help struggling people in material ways, like speedily and simply making up for lost income during a pandemic.

the cultural conversation that peaked during the brett kavanaugh confirmation fight incorrectly pitted men against women and pitted victims of sexual violence against those who, for whatever reason, believe they may one day stand wrongfully accused. yet false sexual assault claims are no more common than false reports of other crimes, estimated at 2-10 percent of all reported assaults — and most assaults go unreported.

residential overcrowding is not the same as population density. a five-story apartment building with 10 studio apartments is densely populated, but presents little risk of coronavirus transmission because its residents are physically separated from each other. a suburban home with 10 people sharing bedrooms and living space, on the other hand, poses a significant risk.
erdogan called the moves nazi acts and said turkey could reconsider ties with the european union after many years of seeking eu membership.

there is precedent over previous interventions where parliament has had a vote and what i think what we need in this country is something more robust, like a war powers act, so that governments do get held to account by parliament for what they do in our name.
like the u.s. and russia, the people's republic of china first engaged in space activities during the development of ballistic missiles in the 1950s. while they did benefit from some assistance from the soviet union, china developed its space program largely on its own. far from smooth sailing, mao zedong's great leap forward and the cultural revolution disrupted this early programs.
three days ago, sen. elizabeth warren (d-mass.), who on monday announced the launch of an exploratory committee for a presidential bid, told axios she supports the idea of a green new deal.
warren also is still somebody with power to shape the presidential campaign. the new agenda includes one item that looks a lot like a message to former vice president joe biden, front-runner for the democratic nomination, about who he might be contemplating as members of a future administration.
and while the former is a valid argument, and businesses do seem to be worse to employees if they're allowed to, i've also found the latter to be true. when i first moved to boston, i took a low paying job i was excited about, but after spending eight months in it, i realized i was being underpaid and overworked. if i was completely reliant on that job for my income, i would have been forced to stay in that unhealthy situation until i found a replacement. instead, i quit. with savings and a few hundred dollars of freelance work, i stayed jobless for about a month, but wasn't forced into another bad position. i could hold out for something that actually benefited me.
a big part of the case will be whether kobach can show that current federal law is not doing enough to combat voter fraud. the federal form to register to vote requires a person to swear under penalty of perjury that he or she is a citizen, a safeguard kobach said tuesday was too weak and like nothing.

years ago, i was ambushed by ken ham, the head of answers in genesis, the organization in charge of the two kentucky creationist theme parks called the creation museum and ark encounter, when i agreed to do an interview on a fundamentalist christian radio show. to my surprise, ken was on the show ready to debate me. as i wrote years ago, when asked why neither the host nor ken had the courtesy to inform me that i was to participate in a debate rather than in an interview, i was told that they believed that i wouldn't have accepted their offer had i been told the truth. when i questioned them about the deception, i was told that since the debate was to further god's wishes, a minor deception of this sort was acceptable.

but there's been one thing that's sorely lacking: these teachers haven't been able to overcome the limitations imposed by a system that isolates them from one another.
if you look into the deal, it's nothing of great substance. it's a lot of chinese declaration to buy more from the americans and nothing more than that. nothing on intellectual property, nothing on theft of intellectual property or forced transfer of technology to chinese counterparts. none of those systemic changes or reforms, but just a lot of commitments. that too is enough for trump to go back to his base and say that he has been productive in term one. i think that's a calculation that we are making as well
finkenauer, who is the second-youngest woman ever elected to congress — ocasio-cortez is the youngest — indicated she wasn't too worried about biden's struggles with young voters. after all, biden had won over a college-age finkenauer during his last campaign in 2008.
um, potentially. right now we're just trying to determine what the indicators are. like, temperature on your body — that indicates whether you're sick or not, right? so if you were to apply the same concept to conversations, what are the indicators of a healthy conversation versus a toxic conversation? that's what we're trying to figure out. we did this whole thing with outside researchers and rfp to get external help to determine these indicators. but this is all in the health thread, all the details.

operation car wash, meanwhile, has long been viewed as a positive development for brazilian democracy, an effort to rid the country's political system of the corruption that runs rampant through it. but it's undeniable now, even for the investigation's proponents, that it played a role in undermining democracy instead of bolstering it.

this is going to require a lot of research and thinking, kosar said. and so they're going to need smart, trustworthy people that the committee can rely upon.
choosing another recently retired general to serve in a role that is designed for a civilian just feels off, rep. elissa slotkin (d-mich.), a former top civilian official at the defense department, said in a dec. 8 statement. after the last four years, civil-military relations at the pentagon definitely need to be rebalanced. general austin has had an incredible career — but i'll need to understand what he and the biden administration plan to do to address these concerns before i can vote for his waiver.

the white house position on the issue is clear: trump wants to either indefinitely detain the central american migrants or cast them back to mexico. but the wall won't achieve either of those aims. instead, the ploy harkens back to the symbolic solution to a largely fabricated crisis that paved trump's way to the presidency back in 2016.
contrary to the high hopes that obama's presidency would bring the country together, americans were bitterly divided leading up to the election in 2016. the democratic party had become increasingly concerned with identity politics, which is the idea that a person's race, sex, and sexual orientation form the most important parts of their humanity and that politics should reflect that belief. republicans, meanwhile, believed that their politicians had been too compromising with the increasingly radical left and that they needed a political outsider who would not back down or compromise with the democrats. ... the republican party nominated real estate mogul and reality television star donald trump from new york, whose determination and bombastic mannerisms gave republicans the fighter they wanted. as a businessman, trump stated that he would 'take the brand of the united states and make it great again.' however, many conservatives were wary of trump because of his occasional vulgar speech, his past immoral behavior, and his public support of homosexual marriage; but some were persuaded by trump's choice for his running mate — indiana's conservative governor mike pence.
oh, i want to see a great deal of resources for cities and states. i want to make sure there's provisions for food stamps and food assistance, because there's a lot of hunger in my state and in the country right now. i want to make sure we fund the health force to implement a vaccination program around the country, because the pace for getting vaccines out is unacceptable. and if we can hire hundreds of thousands more workers, and train them to support our nurses, and doctors and do these vaccinations, through centralized locations, we can get more vaccines.
the tone of the commission all along has been, 'let's figure out how to do this, regardless of whether we think it should happen or not,' he said. they're gonna come up with specific policy recommendations. now whether the legislature decides to take those recommendations or not is a whole different story.
the reagan-era bill was crafted with lengthy deliberation through its entire process. the 2017 tax act was drafted in such haste that there was no substantive deliberation on its contents, resulting in confusing language and numerous errors that need to be fixed. but newly-empowered democrats are unlikely to help republicans repair their faulty bill, with the result that it may generate even more than the $1.5 trillion ten-year deficit it was designed to create.
ottawa — the canadian taxpayers federation says canadians who are being evacuated to canada from wuhan, china, the source of the coronavirus outbreak, should have to pay something towards their flight.
i really can't even begin to imagine.
as the obama and trump presidencies prove, it could likely be a rocky road. absent new legislation, the white house must creatively interpret its legal mandate to enact rules under existing statutes, leaving them open to challenge. republican state attorneys general sued the obama administration so routinely that the top cop in texas joked: i go into the office in the morning. i sue barack obama, and then i go home. gop-led states persuaded the supreme court to block obama's signature power plant regulation in 2016, and that was before trump added three right-wing justices to the bench and stacked lower federal courts with conservatives. red states are already vowing to pursue that same strategy.

in her appearances throughout the state, there were also hints of how she would differentiate herself from sanders, who could be her main rival for the votes of progressives. while the vermonter almost never mentions his own life experiences on the trail, warren dwelled heavily on her own biography: she rued her decision to drop out of college at age 19 to get married and referenced her efforts to potty-train her 2-year-old daughter and her time as a fifth-grade sunday school teacher.

you can imagine that there might be something like the 'cornhusker kickback' ― or the 'coal miner's kickback' in this instance, for joe manchin, said shahid. (the cornhusker kickback was the nickname for a short-lived backroom deal that then-senate majority leader harry reid (d-nev.) cut with then-sen. ben nelson (d-neb.) in 2009 to secure nelson's support for the affordable care act.)
potential republicans that could replace roberts include departing gov. jeff colyer, outgoing kansas secretary of state kris kobach and rep. roger marshall, who holds the same western kansas seat roberts once did. among democrats, barry grissom, a former u.s. attorney for kansas, was considering the race before roberts' announcement.

there are many kinds of political myths. there are foundation myths, like the myth of the american founding fathers and the 1776 revolution, the roman foundation myth or the soviet myth of the october revolution. and there are other political organizing myths, like the myth of norman yoke, the confederate lost cause myth or the myth of the u.s. constitution.

after the collapse of the ussr and during the late 1990s, nato's future, its purpose, and survival have been debated among the allies. even after the 9/11 terrorist attacks in the us followed by istanbul, madrid, and london bombings some opinion makers in europe has not considered these attacks as a threat to the sovereignty and freedom of their states, but a tool for possible insecurity. however, russian's military aggression in georgia in 2008 has alerted the alliance and defense analyst.
weakening protections for factory workers and farmers
climate change already looked set to become a defining theme of this year's election. term limits opened 60% of the 51-seat city council and barred mayor bill de blasio from running again. since the end of november's historic national election, candidates have rushed into what's expected to be a heated six-month contest ahead of the june 22 democratic primary.
india and the us do not have a formal trading arrangement. they do not have a formal security arrangement. but still the us-india relationship has been promising. we are at $142.6 billion in terms of annual trade of goods and services. in terms of military cooperation, we do the most number of exercises with the americans than with any other country. it seems a lot of natural convergences have borne this progress.

beyond general comments on health care, trump returned to a specific lie from last year: the claim that he's tackling the prevalence of aids. we will eradicate the aids epidemic in america by the end of the decade, he said. in fact, the president's efforts to stop reproductive health providers from talking about abortion by cutting off government funding are making it harder to prevent the transmission of aids both within the u.s. and abroad.
it plays really well with the trump base. we buy almonds worth $600 million from the u.s. the produce comes mainly from california, which is the liberal stronghold of the democratic party. trump saying let's see how big the indian market is for nuts and let's try selling them pecan nuts becomes an election talking point. pecan nuts are mostly based in trump land, the flyover states like georgia. he says my trade deal with india is really helping you because i just got you another market. instead of buying almonds, they will also buy pecan nuts. in that sense, the trump base cares what happens with india.
men will defend their fetish for asian women as an innocent preference. i just like what i like is really code for i have sexualized my racism and bought into the stereotype of asian women. the objectification of asian women as exotic lotus blossoms isn't just confined to modern media depictions of asian women saying me so horny to u.s. military men. it links to a longer, more problematic western subjugation of asian women that dates all the way back to the silk road.
since then, five states ― connecticut, delaware, massachusetts, minnesota, and rhode island ― and a number of cities ― including new york, baltimore and oakland, california ― have accused those companies of breaking u.s. law by hiding the reality of climate change.
