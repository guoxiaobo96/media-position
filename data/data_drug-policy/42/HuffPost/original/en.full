This becomes even more important if the airline you have chosen serves your allergen. Children are especially likely to put their hands in their mouths. Those of us without food allergies worry about the germ factor on planes, but for a food allergic person, what was eaten before we boarded is potentially lethal if we touch it and then ingest it.\\n\\nAs a food allergy parent, it is far more difficult and time consuming to do a thorough cleaning during the general boarding process. Don't just take my word for it ― there is data that indicates that pre-boarding decreases the risk of an in-flight reaction.\\n\\nCan an airline prohibit a passenger from pre-boarding if they disclose a food allergy? American Airlines seems to think so as evidenced by their clear policy. But Food Allergy Research and Education (FARE) and Attorney Mary Vargas disagree.\\n\\nResearch your #airlines #foodallergy policy and choose wisely\\n\\nSome like @AmericanAir will not even let you pre-board pic.twitter.com/0hFt2IAyXG — The No Nut Traveler (@NoNutTraveler) January 10, 2017\\n\\nToday, FARE with the assistance of lawyer Mary Vargas of Stein & Vargas filed a complaint with the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) over American Airlines' policy not to allow pre-boarding in order to wipe down the seating area.\\n\\nAttorney Mary Vargas told me that Today FARE drew a line in the sand and asked DOT to enforce its own regulations to protect those with food allergies in air travel. American Airlines cannot be allowed to deny federally protected rights.\\n\\nFARE states in the complaint As an organization dedicated to improving the lives of individuals with food allergies, FARE's mission is directly impacted by American Airlines' explicit and discriminatory policy of denying pre-boarding to individuals with food allergies.\\n\\nFARE is asking for: full and complete retraction of the discriminatory policy and mandated training to ensure American Airlines adopts a uniform approach to prevent its employees from continuing to apply discriminatory policies against those with allergies.\\n\\nTo the naysayers who tell us to just choose another airline- I remind you that sometimes the airline with the least accommodating policy is the only one that can get you to your destination on time.

{"original": "Lucy Nicholson/Reuters Women in political leadership face many of the same problems, no matter where they live.\\n\\nIn my work as a gender and communications specialist I have met – and in some cases professionally advised – female ministers, legislators, mayors, community leaders and judges across the world, from the Dominican Republic and Honduras to the Netherlands and Sweden.\\n\\nI'm Argentinean, so the struggles described to me by Latin American female leaders, who confront inter-party resistance and media double standards on a daily basis, are familiar ones. Our region's gender gap is a disheartening 30%; Guatemala and Paraguay are among the world's least gender-equal places.\\n\\nI have been surprised, however, to hear that women in northern Europe – the most gender-equal region in the world – report the same grievances. While researching my latest book on women in power, I interviewed 18 female politicians in Sweden and The Netherlands, certain that their experience in public service would starkly contrast that of their Latin American peers. After all, in those countries, women already occupy 40% of political positions – and they didn't need a quota system to do it. Only in a gender-equal paradise could that happen, right?\\n\\nSadly not.\\n\\nThe women I interviewed varied in age and ideological background. Some were already retired and others were engaged as EU parliamentarians, congresspeople, government ministers, judges and congressional commission presidents.\\n\\nIt turns out that although women in Sweden and the Netherlands have achieved near parity in national parliaments, they nonetheless share many challenges. Every person interviewed – conservative, progressive, junior or senior – felt that women still had a long way to go to achieve substantive equality.\\n\\nWhen we talk about involvement of women in politics, one Dutch interviewee said, it is not just a matter of numbers, but … also of their position to exert influence. How many of them are in 'hard core' areas like budget, for example, and really have visibility?\\n\\nIn other words, equality is not just numeric.\\n\\nIn the Netherlands, since the 1970s gender mainstreaming effort, the idea of gender equality is so firmly instilled that citizens won't vote for parties whose candidate lists aren't roughly gender-equal, ensuring women get on the ticket. The EU first began to legislate equal pay and equal rights for women in 1979, pressuring member states to adopt such laws nationally. So a top-down cultural shift has been underway for decades.\\n\\nAll the women I spoke to agreed that this has helped, but only to a degree. Women are still under-represented in ministries and decisive parliamentary commissions: among developed-world nations, only 17% of government ministers are women. It's also meaningful that in Spain only 9% of male ministers do not have children, while 45% of female ministers do not.\\n\\nNeither Sweden nor the Netherlands has yet seen a female head of state – something that, for example, Argentina, Chile, Brazil and Costa Rica have all achieved.\\n\\nWe've still got a long way to go\\n\\nSo even in the world's most egalitarian countries, the debate on women's rights continues.\\n\\nThere are still many stereotypes that exert influence, especially on domestic task divisions, one Dutch parliamentarian said. Yes, even Western European women confront the can she have it all? dilemma.\\n\\nAnother woman, an EU parliamentarian, told me:\\n\\nWhen I became Member of Parliament, [the media] asked me how I managed to combine my work as a politician with motherhood or family life. Before we had kids, my husband had two jobs … He gave up one to take care of the household and our children. After eight years, he became Alderman of Amsterdam, … and then everybody turned to me and asked what I would do now. I answered 'well, I have the same job, he is the one who has a new one, so ask him.'\\n\\nOf course, in Northern Europe as in the rest of the world, stereotypes and double-standards still influence media coverage of women. Women said journalists made numerous comments about their hair or clothing, or about looking exhausted after a late-night session (men were celebrated for their stamina).\\n\\nOne woman with experience as both an EU parliamentarian and government minister, recounted this anecdote:\\n\\nA photo journalist came to me and said 'Madam, you have always the same suit on'. I said 'Yes, that's not a problem for me, is it a problem for you?' And he answered that in fact it was … because it gave the impression that photographs were always the same one. I always wore a brooch, so I told him, 'Ok, I will give you something new: I will change the brooches.'\\n\\nWomen make the road\\n\\nThe women interviewed shared recommendations for fixing these inequalities – again, political affiliation made no difference in these policy recommendations.\\n\\nEvery woman commented on the need to address gender bias in early childhood education. One congresswoman who suggested working with young boys and girls to raise awareness of gender stereotypes also commented that teachers at preschools and schools must be trained in equality as well. And indeed, some Scandanavian nations are, controversially, already mandating gender-neutral reading (goodbye, Snow White)).\\n\\nAlthough defying gender roles is everyone's job, women have a decisive part to play. Each and every woman I interviewed, regardless of age or political position, agreed that mentorship was key to her success. Women with more experience offered advice to those with less, and gave them strength to keep fighting.\\n\\nAt a collective level, too, these powerful women agreed that women's movements and women's organisations, both within civil society and inside political parties, are fundamental to the continued struggle for political inclusion. Such groups offer women a place where women meet [and] fight for their causes, one interview subject said.\\n\\nWhen Prime Minister of Canada Justin Trudeau introduced his new cabinet, comprised of 15 men and 15 women, after his 2015 election victory, a reporter asked why it was important for him to have a gender-equal cabinet.\\n\\nBut it's 2017 now, and I can't seem to find gender paradise – only more women struggling for it. Maybe in 2018?\\n\\nVirginia García Beaudoux, Professor of Political Communication and Public Opinion, University of Buenos Aires\\n\\nThis article was originally published on The Conversation.

Far better for us to debate this properly now and let Parliamentarians express their view before it is too late.\\n\\nIn their blog, the pair added that manufacturing jobs was a key issue for them.\\n\\nChanging our terms of trade to hit manufacturing communities across the North and Midlands hard is not a responsible way for Parliamentarians to behave and it is deeply unfair to those whose local manufacturing jobs would be hit.\\n\\nThe full text of the motion reads:\\n\\nThat this House notes: that the European Union is the UK's largest export market for goods, accounting for a total of £145bn of exports and £241bn of imports in 2016; further notes the Government's expressed aim to secure the freest and most frictionless possible trade in goods between the UK and the EU after 29 March 2019 further notes the importance of frictionless trade without tariffs, customs or border checks for manufacturers and businesses across the country who trade with the EU; further notes that the free circulation of goods on the island of Ireland is a consequence of the UK's and Republic of Ireland's membership of the EU Customs Union; further notes the Government's commitment (i) in the UK-EU joint report on progress during phase 1 of the Article 50 negotiations to the maintenance of North-South cooperation and the all-island economy on the island of Ireland, (ii) that the Belfast Agreement implemented in the Northern Ireland Act 1998 should remain a fundamental principle of public policy, and (iii) to the continuation of unfettered access for Northern Ireland's businesses to the whole of the United Kingdom internal market; and therefore calls on the Government to include as an objective in negotiations on the future relationship between the United Kingdom and the European Union the establishment of an effective customs union between the two territories.\\n\\nCrucially, there will be a vote on the substantive motion next Thursday, raising the prospect of Tory Remainer rebels inflicting a significant defeat on Brexiteer plans to rule out any form of tariff-free union with Brussels.\\n\\nThe House of Lords voted twice with huge majorities on Wednesday night to amend the so-called EU Withdrawal Bill, with peers urging ministers to keep alive the option of a customs union after Britain formally quits the EU next March.\\n\\nThe new Liaison Committee motion however is more explicit than the Lords motion in that it calls on the Government not just to make a statement on the issue but to include a customs union in its negotiations."}

{"original": "One of the most persistent myths about the threat of COVID-19 is that it is inextricably linked with population density. Since March, this explanation has shown up in magazine articles and news reports both domestically and internationally. It has appeared in the speeches of mayors and governors and the columns of pundits from across the ideological spectrum.\\n\\nIt has also been thoroughly debunked.\\n\\nThe supposed link between population density and COVID-19 doesn't work at any scale. At the global level, coronavirus superstars include South Korea, Japan, Hong Kong and Singapore — all among the most densely populated countries on earth.\\n\\nCountrywide statistics find no relationship between population density and COVID-19 death rates. To pick just one example, sparsely populated Canada has nearly 10 times more deaths per capita than tightly packed Bangladesh.\\n\\nThe explanation doesn't work within U.S. borders either. While it's true that America's most densely populated city, New York, had one of the country's worst outbreaks, its second densest city, San Francisco, had one of the least severe. On Jan. 6, North Dakota, which ranks 47th among the states in population per square mile, had twice as many COVID-19 cases per capita as New Jersey, which ranks first.\\n\\nDensity can't even explain how the pandemic erupted within cities. In New York, the boroughs of Bronx and Queens have up to three times more deaths than Manhattan despite having half the population density. The same pattern has appeared everywhere from Chicago to Seattle to Nashville: Coronavirus outbreaks infect front-line workers, minorities, the poor and mask-deniers, regardless of how high their apartments are stacked on top of each other.\\n\\nMAY JAMES via Getty Images Hong Kong, one of the most densely populated places on earth, has a fraction of America's COVID-19 death rate.\\n\\nA Faulty Narrative\\n\\nBeyond the numbers, the relationship between population density and COVID-19 spread doesn't even make basic common sense.\\n\\nPopulation density — the number of people per square mile — roughly measures how close people live to each other. It doesn't measure the type of work they do, the frequency of their face-to-face interactions or how often they go to church. Since March, the coronavirus has struck dozens of rural areas via meatpacking facilities, prisons and superspreader events. Homes being spaced far apart does not prevent the activities that actually spread the virus.\\n\\nSo what does explain the vast differences between cities, states and countries in the severity of their COVID-19 outbreaks? The answer is primarily public health policy: Places with political leaders who instituted early lockdowns, strict mask orders and competent testing, tracing and quarantine regimes have passed through the pandemic relatively unscathed.\\n\\nIn America, the differences between states have little to do with intrinsic factors like population density, weather or demographics and more to do with the political ideology driving their leaders' actions. The virus hit Northeastern states early and unexpectedly, causing a steep wave of cases and deaths. Since then, as the virus has settled into America's existing divides, it has spread most rapidly in states where governors were reluctant to impose mandatory controls or reopened their economies before suppressing the virus. Of the 10 states with the highest current caseloads, seven have Republican governors.\\n\\nCrowding, Not Density\\n\\nThis doesn't mean there's no relationship between population dynamics and the spread of the virus. The number of people living in each household may, in fact, be a significant driver of transmission. In October, a study in Tennessee and Wisconsin found that 53% of people who shared a home with a COVID-19 patient became infected within seven days.\\n\\nResidential overcrowding is not the same as population density. A five-story apartment building with 10 studio apartments is densely populated, but presents little risk of coronavirus transmission because its residents are physically separated from each other. A suburban home with 10 people sharing bedrooms and living space, on the other hand, poses a significant risk.\\n\\nThis is one of the reasons that farmworkers have such high COVID-19 risk despite mostly working outside. Low pay forces them to live in shared indoor spaces rather than having their own apartments.\\n\\nOvercrowding within residences may also explain why cities like Los Angeles, where most of the land is covered by single-family homes, are experiencing such severe outbreaks. Though it's less than half as densely populated as New York City, LA has roughly double the rate of overcrowded housing.\\n\\nMany smaller cities display the same dynamic. As long as it remains illegal to build multi-family apartment buildings and other density-friendly forms of housing, workers double up, growing families stay put and young people live with more roommates.\\n\\nIn other words, America's problem may not be density, but the lack of it."}

The organization represented Kim Davis, the now-former Kentucky county clerk who was jailed in 2015 after refusing to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples. Staver, who served as her lawyer, painted her as an evangelical Christian heroine, comparing her at one point to Jewish people who were persecuted by the Nazis.\\n\\nASSOCIATED PRESS Staver (left) at a news conference discussing a trial on same-sex marriages in San Francisco in 2006. In a recent interview he said his team is talking to House politicians to ensure that the anti-lynching bill is stripped of language protecting LGBT people.\\n\\nOn its surface, the Justice for Victims of Lynching Act isn't about queer rights. The bill addresses the crime of lynching ― extrajudicial executions carried out by a mob. According to the NAACP, lynching was used after the Civil War to resolve some of the anger that whites had in relation to the free blacks. At least 4,742 people, predominantly African-Americans, were reportedly lynched in America from 1882 to 1968.\\n\\nSince a new session of Congress has begun, the Senate-approved act and a corresponding bill in the House that's still in committee will likely have to be reintroduced.\\n\\nAs of now, the Senate bill defines lynching as two or more people willfully caus[ing] bodily injury because of the victim's actual or perceived race, color, religion, national origin, disability, gender, sexual orientation or gender identity.\\n\\nStaver told OneNewsNow that if passed, the Justice for Victims of Lynching Act would be the first federal law to mention gender identity and sexual orientation.\\n\\nPizer said LGBTQ Americans still urgently need comprehensive and explicit federal anti-discrimination laws. According to the American Civil Liberties Union, only a minority of states have laws that specifically protect queer people.\\n\\nLambda Legal, the ACLU, and other progressive organizations have been pushing for the passage of the Equality Act, a bill that would prohibit discrimination against queer people in employment, housing, education and other areas of their lives.\\n\\nBecause there continues to be confusion and debate about whether LGBTQ people already are legally equal — and whether or not we should be equal — we need the law to be inclusive and crystal clear, Pizer told HuffPost in an email.\\n\\nASSOCIATED PRESS Mike Huckabee (left), Rowan County Clerk Kim Davis and Staver, her lawyer, after her release from jail in 2015 for refusing to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples in Kentucky.

He confirmed that Liberty Counsel is questioning members of Congress about the created list of protected categories.\\n\\nThe historical victims of lynching should not, as I do not, tolerate the hijacking of this issue by political agenda, he said.\\n\\nLiberty Counsel has not responded to a request for comment on why it believes LGBTQ Americans should not be treated as a protected class.\\n\\nPizer said she believes Liberty Counsel has repeatedly used an ends-justify-the-means approach to furthering its goals.\\n\\nWith the grossly disproportionate rates of hate crimes against LGBTQ people, and the horrifying rate of murders of transgender women of color in particular, a demand to strip [sexual orientation and gender identity] out of an anti-lynching bill is truly dumbfounding, and beyond comprehension, she said. That it would be done by someone claiming to be motivated by Christian teachings just shows how deeply perverse and inhumane that anti-LGBT advocacy can become."}

{"original": "Now that the phrase #MeToo comes trippingly off the tongue, it could be easy to forget what those words actually signify. The hashtag is about not being alone. Time and again, after an allegation of sexual harassment has been made against a powerful person or institution, others have stood up to say they have had similar experiences. Publicity and numbers serve to protect individuals from retaliation.\\n\\nBut even as the #MeToo moment becomes a movement, employers are trying to stop individuals from obtaining the accountability and justice that so many are demanding.\\n\\nAs a condition of applying for or accepting a job, many employers require employees to sign documents cutting off their rights to file lawsuits in court. These documents don't merit being called contracts because they are neither negotiated nor negotiable. Rather, the forms state that the only route for any redress when problems arise is a closed arbitration through a private dispute resolution company picked by the employer. These documents specifically ban class-action lawsuits, turning all claimants into single-file applicants rather than allowing them to join with other similarly aggrieved individuals.\\n\\nOver 60 million employed Americans are required to waive the right to pursue legal action in courts, according to the Economic Policy Institute. Employees ― whether they work at small retail gas stations operated by Murphy Oil, USA, or at a Wisconsin software data company called Epic Systems, or whether they are one of 40,000 employees at Ernst & Young ― are blocked from going to court and from being part of collective actions. Even if employees allege injuries such as sexual harassment or age discrimination, the only remedies available are through private, solo arbitrations.\\n\\nSome federal judges have recoiled from enforcing these provisions against workers, who have been protected since the 1930s by the National Labor Relations Act and the Fair Labor Standards Act. Congress enacted these labor laws 80 years ago that specifically protected the right to collective action, so that employees could join together, with or without a union, to improve their working conditions.\\n\\nLooking back, it is clear that Congress knew then what #MeToo is teaching us again now: Workers can't be expected to stand alone and challenge their employers by themselves.\\n\\nBecause it is hard, expensive and scary to go it alone, and because the procedures for doing so are complex, most people who have been injured don't do anything.\\n\\nEmployers argue that they are providing a process that is as effective as, or better than, public courts. That arbitration is simpler. That employees don't lose rights, they just get vindication in another venue. But zoom into some of the details. In private arbitration, the company picks the providers who supply the arbitrators. Those arbitrators rule, in closed offices, on whether the company violated the law. And many companies insist that the outcomes remain confidential ― preventing individuals with similar claims from knowing about others.\\n\\nIt may sound simple, but hardly ever provides a remedy. Most people never file claims for arbitration because, as #MeToo has reminded us, most people do not go it alone to challenge powerful opponents ― especially not their current employers. Even starting requires finding and figuring out how to use the rules on the website of organizations like the American Arbitration Association ― or locating a lawyer willing to help on claims that may be of great value to the individual but that are under $10,000. That's why states provides small claims courts to make individual pursuit of cases easier, and why class actions in regular courts bring together a lot of claimants who share the expenses of lawyers skilled at amassing the evidence needed. Because it is hard, expensive and scary to go it alone, and because the procedures for doing so are complex, most people who have been injured don't do anything. They lump it by absorbing the losses and, as we know from #MeToo, by suffering in silence.\\n\\nThe problem has urgency now because the Supreme Court is currently considering arguments on whether to keep these barriers to public courts and to class-action suits in place. The reason to use Murphy Oil, Epic Systems and Ersnt & Young as examples is that they are all before the U.S. Supreme Court, under the aptly named header of Epic Systems.\\n\\nThe trio of cases are joined together because the three employers required employees to sign onto arbitration. The employees are arguing that the 1930s labor laws protect their right to collective action. The employees used form clauses in job applications or, as in Epic Systems, in a mass email sent after employees had already taken their jobs. The court heard oral arguments last fall, and the companies argue that employees agreed to use binding arbitration. What choice did employees have?\\n\\nHowever good arbitration between equally powerful companies may be, what we know now is that pushing people into single-file arbitration against companies erases their rights.\\n\\nThat question is not one for employees alone. All consumers who use an array of goods and services are faced with the same mandates. In my research, I found that during a five-year period when a major wireless company had between 85 million and 120 million customers, fewer than 30 customers per year brought claims to arbitration about issues such as overcharges or failure of services. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau looked into millions of credit loans and found the same: Almost no one files individual claims against creditors.\\n\\nIn short, whether you are an employee or a consumer, you can be locked out of court by formulaic statements about the waiver of rights to which the argument is that you agreed when you applied for a job or got a cell phone or loan. And however good arbitration between equally powerful companies may be, what we know now is that pushing people into single-file arbitration against companies erases their rights.\\n\\nThe massive #MeToo moment demonstrates women and men in the workplace still face illegal practices, and that they need each other to make structural changes as well as to obtain individual remedies. The NLRA is a key part of that change. So, too, is a new legislative proposal introduced in both the House and the Senate to end forced arbitration of sexual harassment claims brought by workers.\\n\\nIn 1935, the NLRA told workers that they could say #MeToo. The Supreme Court should confirm that in the Epic Systems case and ensure that the option provided by the law continues to open the door to public courts. The collective consciousness-raising and storytelling of #MeToo is one way to form a group. But it should not be the only way.\\n\\nJudith Resnik is the Arthur Liman Professor of Law and the founding director of the Arthur Liman Center for Public Interest Law at Yale Law School."}
{"original": "Five years ago today, I was driving from Phoenix to Tucson to see my friend Gabby Giffords. That Saturday morning, she was at a shopping center parking lot, holding office hours, doing the most basic job of a representative, meeting with her constituents.\\n\\nThe day before, she had sent what would be her last tweet for a long time endorsing my new candidacy for chair of the Arizona Democratic Party. It was not a job I had been looking for.\\n\\nWe had just ended the 2010 elections. She had run for reelection. I had been the nominee for Arizona State Treasurer. It was a terrible year for Democrats nationwide, but it was particularly so in an Arizona riven over immigration and suffering from the aftermath of the real estate collapse. On Election Day, I lost by a lot. Gabby narrowly won.\\n\\nBut one of the many joys of that campaign was getting to spend time with Gabby, whom I had known since she was a newly elected State Senator, as well as her new husband Mark, a former Naval aviator who flew combat missions in the Persian Gulf War and NASA astronaut who had flown four missions to space.\\n\\nWhen, a couple of months later, the position of the chair of the state Democratic party came open, some party leaders and activists asked me to run. I said no at first. I felt more comfortable as a policy wonk than as a partisan warrior. And after a long, tough, and failed campaign, and with two very young children at home, I wanted a break from politics.\\n\\nThen Gabby called. She said the post was one from which I could help bridge divisions in the state and offer new ideas. I still hesitated. She said she knew it was not what I had wanted to do. And then she said words I can still hear, echoing over the years, Andrei, sometimes you don't get to choose the way in which you'll serve.\\n\\nSometimes you don't get to choose the way in which you'll serve.\\n\\nI said yes. It was a Tuesday. We made plans to see each other that weekend in Tucson.\\n\\nOn that Saturday, Gabby and her husband Mark's lives, and the lives of so many others, changed forever.\\n\\nAnd if afterwards, Gabby and Mark had decided to spend all the rest of their days focused on her healing, and holding tight to each other and their loved ones, they would still have been rightly hailed by every American as heroes, heroes who gave so much - in fact, almost everything - in service to their country.\\n\\nIf they had spent their time not only on her healing, but on healing our nation's wounds, working to make our civic discourse less coarse, that would have been worthy of even more praise and they would have been universally admired by all.\\n\\nBut instead, Gabby and Mark did all those things and then also stepped forward to serve again on perhaps the most contentious, bitterly divisive issue in America today.\\n\\nSpurred on by the murder of 20 six-and-seven year olds and their teachers in a small town in Connecticut - and the steady, daily drip of gun deaths across the nation - Gabby and Mark have spent day after day campaigning around the country and organizing more than half a million Americans in a new push for responsible, moderate, common sense approaches to stem the awful tide of gun violence.\\n\\nTheir lives today are not what they imagined when they awoke on that Saturday morning four years ago.\\n\\nSometimes you don't get to choose the way in which you'll serve."}

{"original": "Win McNamee via Getty Images House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and House Democrats proposed a paid leave program to deal with the fallout from coronavirus.\\n\\nWorkers affected by the coronavirus outbreak may soon be able to take advantage of the first nationwide paid leave program in the U.S. if Congress can agree on the plan.\\n\\nLate Wednesday, House Democrats unveiled a big legislative package to address the public health and economic threats posed by COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus. The bill includes a government-funded program that would reimburse eligible workers who lost wages because they were unable to work during the crisis.\\n\\nThe bill also includes a provision that would establish a future nationwide paid sick leave program ― prompting howls of protest from Republicans.\\n\\nDemocrats and Republicans have been unable to agree on a federal paid leave program for years, but some form of the bill stands a chance of passing due to the damage the virus is doing to the economy. Many Republicans who've opposed such programs in the past agree something must be done to keep money flowing into workers' pockets as business slows.\\n\\nHow the plan would work:\\n\\nThe bill includes provisions for 14 days of emergency leave for workers who are either diagnosed with COVID-19 or quarantined because of the virus. Crucially, workers would also qualify if they must care for others who are sick or stuck at home, including because of school closures.\\n\\nThe benefits would be administered and paid directly to workers by the Social Security Administration, and capped at two-thirds of a person's monthly earnings, not to exceed $4,000. If a worker already receives sick leave benefits from their job or state government, they would still be eligible for the new federal benefit minus what they're already receiving.\\n\\nWorkers can apply for the reimbursement retroactively, meaning people who are already quarantined or missing work to take care of someone would be able to receive a later payment for their time off.\\n\\nThe plan differs from earlier proposals in that it creates temporary, emergency funding specifically to deal with the coronavirus. It also includes a permanent mandate that employers provide sick leave in the future.\\n\\nUnder the bill, employers would have to let workers gradually accrue up to seven paid sick days per year. Those days could also be used to care for family members who are sick, or deal with domestic violence-related issues.\\n\\nEmployers would also be required to provide 14 days of sick leave immediately in the event of a public health emergency like the current one. Large employers would have to pay for those 14 emergency days, while smaller employers (defined as 50 or fewer workers) would be reimbursed by the government.\\n\\nThe fact that the U.S. has no national paid sick leave policy has become a huge issue during the coronavirus crisis.\\n\\nThe potential problem with including permanent paid sick leave in the package is that it could hinder the bill's passage and gum up the works, said Claudia Sahm, director of macroeconomic policy at the Washington Center for Equitable Growth. I have concerns it'll slow down the process and more people will get hurt than need to get hurt, Sahm said.\\n\\nThose parts of the plan are already drawing real pushback from Republicans, who generally hate employer mandates. Democrats proposed an emergency sick leave plan last week that included those provisions, and Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) spoke out against it on the Senate floor Wednesday and prevented it from being fast-tracked.\\n\\nAlexander said he was open to a paid sick leave program to deal with coronavirus and thought it was a good idea. But he said the government should have to foot the bill, not employers. Employees are struggling, our employers are struggling, and it's not a cure for the coronavirus to put a big new expensive federal mandate on employers, he said.\\n\\nIt's possible Republicans like Alexander would support an emergency fund but demand that the permanent mandate be dropped from the House package. A spokesperson for the senator said Thursday that he had nothing to add beyond his comments on the Senate floor.\\n\\nProponents of paid leave programs were happy to see a potential deal coming together, even if the final details weren't clear.\\n\\nThis is an extremely substantial step toward addressing the very real and immediate needs of this emergency and setting up a system for paid sick days for the future so people won't face this risk again, said Vicki Shabo, a senior fellow at The New America Foundation and paid leave expert.\\n\\nSome economists worried that the funding provisions for the plan would prove too complicated to enact quickly. It might take a while to get set up, said Jay Shambaugh, director of the Hamilton Project. He suggested giving companies a tax break to offset the cost.\\n\\nThe bill does say that small businesses would be compensated for the costs of providing 14 days of emergency leave.\\n\\nSamuel Corum via Getty Images President Donald Trump hinted Wednesday that the White House would support some kind of paid leave program.\\n\\nThe House is scheduled to vote on the bill on Thursday, which will likely pass with mostly Democratic support. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) called the legislation completely partisan and unworkable.\\n\\nIt's not clear if the bill can get through the Senate. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said Thursday morning that the Democratic bill is an ideological wish list that was not tailored closely to the circumstances.\\n\\nRegarding the paid leave provision, McConnell said the proposal appears to impose permanent unfunded mandates on businesses that could cause massive job losses and put thousands of small businesses at risk.\\n\\nThursday could be the last day to pass legislation before lawmakers leave Washington for a planned recess next week.\\n\\nPresident Donald Trump, meanwhile, seemed to hint that the White House would support emergency paid sick and family leave in his Oval Office address Wednesday night.\\n\\nTo ensure that working Americans impacted by the virus can stay home without fear of financial hardship, I will soon be taking emergency action, which is unprecedented, to provide financial relief, he said. This will be targeted for workers who are ill, quarantined, or caring for others due to coronavirus.\\n\\nThe administration, however, hasn't offered any detail. A White House spokesman could not provide any as of Thursday morning.\\n\\nThe fact that the U.S. has no national paid sick leave policy has become a huge issue during the coronavirus crisis, shining a light on a safety net gap long highlighted by Democrats and progressives.\\n\\nThe lack of paid sick leave is an urgent problem for low-income workers in the service industries, who are particularly at-risk during the current crisis."}

{"original": "New York Governor Andrew M. Cuomo recently pledged to make undergraduate education at the the City University of New York (CUNY) and the State University of New York (SUNY) system free for families making less than US$120,000 annually.\\n\\nIf this happens, it wouldn't be the first time that undergraduate education has been free in New York. For most of its history, up until the 1970s when New York City was in dire financial straits and the state had to step in to bail out the City University of New York, CUNY was free to many of the city's residents.\\n\\nAnd this is not just the case in New York. College has been tuition-free in other states as well. In 2014, Tennessee governor Bill Haslam promised to provide free community college to all residents in his state. He has delivered on the promise, making Tennessee a model state in this area.\\n\\nIn a country where student debt and the rising cost of the college degree grab national headlines on a weekly basis, efforts to make college free can also get attention. In truth, however, a large part of tuition costs are already subsidized in the U.S. through a combination of grants, tax breaks and loans. What causes waves is the ever-increasing sticker price, rather than what students actually pay.\\n\\nMy interest, as a scholar of global education policy, is understanding how college costs in the U.S. compare to those of the rest of the world. The fact is that nowhere is college truly free. The critical difference is whether the bulk of the costs are born by the student or by the government.\\n\\nSo, what are some of the changes taking place globally as countries try to manage college costs?\\n\\nWho pays?\\n\\nSome countries follow a model similar to the U.S. by charging high tuition rates but then defraying the costs for certain students with grants, loans or tax incentives.\\n\\nAs to which country charges students the most, that depends on how one does the calculations.\\n\\nLet's look at the 2015 Education at a Glance report from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). The report shows that public colleges in England charged the highest fees, when factoring in public aid, to domestic students (approximately ($9,000), followed by the U.S. ($8,200), Japan ($5,100), South Korea ($4,700) and Canada ($4,700).\\n\\nBut the numbers alone do not tell the full story.\\n\\nA simple comparison between the total cost of tuition fees and the median self-reported income of the country reveals a very different picture: Hungary becomes the most expensive country, with 92 percent of median income going toward the cost of education, followed closely by Romania and Estonia. The U.S. ranks sixth on this listing. (This calculation does not factor in loans and grants.)\\n\\nLow or no tuition models\\n\\nSome countries take a very different approach, charging no or low tuition fees. According to the International Higher Education Finance, a project sponsored by the Rockefeller Institute of Government, more than 40 countries offer free or nearly free post-secondary education to domestic students. These include Argentina, Denmark, Greece, Kenya, Morocco, Egypt, Uruguay, Scotland and Turkey.\\n\\nA variety of approaches are used to fund higher education in these countries, such as imposing high taxes or making use of their significant natural resources (e.g., oil and natural gas reserves) to provide the financial resources for extensive social investment.\\n\\nIn other places, such as Germany, an egalitarian philosophy and deeply held beliefs about the value of a public education preclude the government from shifting costs to the students. In Germany, for example, there was a short-lived effort from 2005-2014 to charge minimal tuition, which was rolled back after a major public outcry. Germans strongly believe that higher education is a public good to be totally subsidized the government.\\n\\nThe point being in these countries students pay very little for post-secondary education - a policy shift going on in the U.S.\\n\\nThe UK: A divided approach\\n\\nThere have been attempts in other countries to shift some of the cost of higher education to students.\\n\\nFollowing the great recession in 2012, England, for example, tripled tuition in one year to approximately $11,000 (9000 pounds). The intent was to offset steep declines in government funding. Despite a significant outcry by students and other critics, these high tuition costs have stayed.\\n\\nIn fact, England recently surpassed the U.S. in terms of having the highest tuition fees of the 34 countries in the industrialized world. While the sticker price for many U.S. institutions is higher, financial aid helps bring down the total cost.\\n\\nHowever, England's sister country Scotland continues to provide more substantial subsidies for higher education, providing domestic students with free access to college while at the same time charging significant fees to students from elsewhere in the U.K.\\n\\nWhat about international students?\\n\\nThe free tuition debate typically is domestically focused, but it can spill over into affecting international students. There are now more than one million international students in the US - comprising about 5.2 percent of the total number of college students.\\n\\nThe question now facing policymakers globally is whether to extend the concept of free college to international students or to let them be a source of additional revenues to offset costs of domestic students.\\n\\nThe no-tuition and low-cost tuition models have emerged as competitive advantages for attracting international students in many countries.\\n\\nFor example, a growing number of U.S. students are pursuing their degree outside of the U.S. in countries such as Germany and Scotland as they look for ways to escape the rising cost of college at home. Even though some U.S. students can receive subsidies to offset their education, those in the middle- and upper-income levels tend to receive minimal support and are also most likely to see studying abroad as a possibility.\\n\\nNew Zealand saw the number of international students quadruple from 2005 to 2014, soon after it made the decision to subsidize international doctoral students at the same level as domestic students.\\n\\nIn contrast, nations that have significantly increased their tuition costs for international students have found mixed results.\\n\\nDenmark, for example, saw attendance from outside the EU drop by 20 percent in one year, after it introduced tuition fees for international students in 2006. Sweden too saw a massive drop in international students after it introduced fees in 2011-12 - the number of international students plummeted by 80 percent. (Some modest recovery has happened in recent years.)\\n\\nImplications for U.S.policy\\n\\nThe issue in the U.S. is that it already has the largest share of the international student market - approximately 15 percent - and a steady stream of international students looking to study in the U.S.\\n\\nIn fact, state universities often seek to make up resource declines by increasing the number of full-fee paying international students. A recent report from the National Bureau of Economic Research found that a 10 percent reduction in state funding resulted in an 12 percent increase in the number of international undergraduate students at public research universities.\\n\\nA number of questions therefore arise when considering the implications for the free college policies in the U.S.: Could free college policies reverse the trend of more U.S. students studying outside of the U.S. to escape high fees? Could improved state funding in support of making college more financially accessible to domestic students stop colleges from actively seeking international students? Or, could it push these students into the private sector which will likely have more room as students take advantage of free public education?\\n\\nThere are far too many variables still in play to answer any of these questions. But while the push for free college in the U.S. may be a sexy political move, we need to think through intended and unintended consequences.\\n\\nJason Lane, Chair and Professor of Educational Policy and Leadership & Co-Director of the Cross-Border Education Research Team, University at Albany, State University of New York\\n\\nThis article was originally published on The Conversation.

{"original": "Joe Biden has pitched his presidency as a salve for American democracy ― something more needed than ever after a mob stormed the Capitol in an attempt to deny voters' will in the 2020 presidential election.\\n\\nBut national security experts and lawmakers, including many Democrats, are increasingly alarmed that one of Biden's first plans for his time in office threatens a key democratic norm: civilian control of the military.\\n\\nBiden and his allies in Congress want to quickly confirm retired Gen. Lloyd Austin as the new secretary of defense ― defying a legal ban on soldiers serving in the role until they have been retired for at least seven years. (Austin retired from the Army in 2016.)\\n\\nThat barrier is meant to prevent the impression that the chief Pentagon job is relatively close to that of a uniformed officer and to ensure that the defense secretary looks beyond the military in crafting policy.\\n\\nBoth the House of Representatives and Senate must pass a special waiver for Austin to take the job. They have done that only twice in the history of the modern military, most recently for President Donald Trump's choice of Jim Mattis in 2017. The Senate Armed Services Committee is will hold a confirmation hearing for Austin on Tuesday and the equivalent panel in the House will host a hearing with him on Thursday.\\n\\nWith Democrats controlling both chambers and many traditionally hawkish Republicans comfortable with the waiver, Austin is expected to get the votes he needs and to take over at the Pentagon in a matter of days.\\n\\nBut ever since news of Biden's selection broke in December, legislators and analysts have said that while Austin will almost certainly be confirmed, it's extremely important to be careful about how it's achieved and what comes next.\\n\\nChoosing another recently retired general to serve in a role that is designed for a civilian just feels off, Rep. Elissa Slotkin (D-Mich.), a former top civilian official at the Defense Department, said in a Dec. 8 statement. After the last four years, civil-military relations at the Pentagon definitely need to be rebalanced. General Austin has had an incredible career — but I'll need to understand what he and the Biden Administration plan to do to address these concerns before I can vote for his waiver.\\n\\nThe Capitol attack of Jan. 6, 2021, demonstrated just how vital it is that the U.S. military ― the largest organization in the country and the best-armed force in the world ― abides by democratic norms. When outgoing President Donald Trump and his allies met in December to discuss how to overturn the election, retired Lt. Gen. Michael T. Flynn reportedly floated the idea of using the military to redo the vote.\\n\\nThat didn't happen. But it showed that as more and more Americans, whipped up by politicians like Trump and misinformed by social media, become willing to challenge principles like a peaceful transition of political power, the risk of the country's armed forces becoming involved in political fights is rising.\\n\\nAustin is not considered to have that kind of anti-democratic view of the military's role and is widely respected across party lines and the various branches of the U.S. armed forces. Still, after four years under a president who treated soldiers as a personal base of political support, it's imperative for decision-makers and regular Americans to seriously consider how to maintain a healthy balance for one of the country's most powerful institutions.\\n\\nRules For A Reason\\n\\nHistorically, a key sign of democratic decline is when a country's armed forces become increasingly powerful and independent of its civilian leaders. The people elect those leaders to reflect society as a whole, not just soldiers; they are supposed to run the show. And a common feature in most failed states is that large numbers of military personnel are guided by personal ambition or extremist ideologies rather than the national interest and constitutionally enshrined values.\\n\\nPutting recently retired military leaders in the Defense Department's top civilian job threatens to make those developments more likely in the U.S.\\n\\nOne potential problem is that it could boost the impression that military professionals who are supposed to serve any duly elected commander-in-chief are instead prioritizing their own politics, creating what Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) called the perception of Republican generals and Democratic generals ― and the fear that officers might not fully respect the authority of elected officials whose views they do not personally share.\\n\\nDuring last week's Senate discussion of Austin, Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.) highlighted one of the most alarming aspects of the Jan. 6 attack: the fact that a striking number of the perpetrators had military and law enforcement backgrounds. To her, that seemed like evidence that intense partisanship is already growing to an alarming degree within the armed forces.\\n\\nAn Associated Press review published Friday found that at least 21 of the rioters fit that profile, including a retired Air Force lieutenant colonel, another Air Force veteran and a retired Navy SEAL.\\n\\nAgreeing to a waiver for Austin ― particularly so soon after doing the same for Mattis ― also sends a troubling signal about military service, observers argue. It could convince rising stars in uniform that the pinnacle of their careers should not be earning four stars but taking over the entire Pentagon, because it may come to be taken for granted that a former soldier should be defense secretary.\\n\\nJIM WATSON/AFP via Getty Images President-elect Joe Biden introduces his nominee for defense secretary, retired Army Gen. Lloyd Austin, on Dec. 9, 2020.\\n\\nThere are major differences between the role of a defense secretary and the highest ranks of the armed services. While the defense secretary job is fundamentally political, military leaders are meant to advise civilians and then carry out the decisions the civilians make on the basis of that advice and other considerations.\\n\\nIt is normal and natural for the military to want overwhelming resources, overwhelming force, to be allowed to use that force in as unrestrained a manner as possible, because that is how you win battles with the fewest losses on your own side, Lindsay Cohn, a professor at the Naval War College, said at last week's hearing. She contrasted that with political logic: looking beyond the tactical considerations of any one battle or mission to broader national strategies that rely on the military as well as other tools to achieve broader goals.\\n\\nAnalysts warn that a former officer in the secretary role may take too many cues from former colleagues within the military, further reducing civilian influence on national security policy.\\n\\nIn describing her reluctance toward granting Austin's waiver, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) quoted the expert Biden has tapped to be number two at the Pentagon, Kathleen Hicks. Hicks spoke before the Senate when it was considering granting a waiver for Mattis.\\n\\nFour years ago, Dr. Hicks said that our system of civil-military relations is 'strong enough to withstand any risk a once-in-two-generation exception could pose,' Gillibrand said. If we're granting a twice-in-one-decade exception for back-to-back administrations, what kind of system are we actually protecting?\\n\\nThe Damage Already Done\\n\\nIn 2018, a bipartisan report on the Pentagon found that civilian voices have been relatively muted on issues at the center of U.S. defense and national security policy, undermining the concept of civilian control. That's the product of years of problems, per analysts like Kathleen McInnis of the Congressional Research Service; she chalks it up to policies like personnel cuts and prioritizing military tactical advice.\\n\\nTrump has badly twisted the role of uniformed officers even further. He flirted with deploying the military against protesters, and in his failed effort to steal the 2020 election, spoke of commanders as my generals, pardoned soldiers and contractors who committed war crimes and left nearly half of the key civilian jobs at the Defense Department empty.\\n\\nMattis, who was widely viewed as a possible force of stability and reason, failed to rein him in, experts and lawmakers concur. To Cohn, it's clear that both he and George Marshall ― the only other person to ever receive the waiver Austin is seeking ― failed to prevent the politicization of the military on their watch and relied too much on uniformed personnel over civilians.\\n\\nAustin and Biden could try to win over skeptics. The former general could publicly emphasize that he values civilian control of the armed forces and avoid using his military title, while the incoming president could be careful to avoid Trump-style posturing with the military. And the choice has positive ramifications for other big concerns about the national security world, like the severe lack of diversity among high-level officials. Austin would be the first-ever Black chief of a diverse Defense Department whose leadership is almost totally white.\\n\\nBut the two need to be careful amid a very fragile situation.\\n\\nAustin's nomination will neither heal nor break American democracy by itself, but it is a critical node in the web, Cohn told the Senate."}

{"original": "However much you tip your Uber driver, it's probably not enough. And however much Uber pays its drivers, it's almost definitely not enough, either.\\n\\nThose are two big takeaways from a new working paper by a group of researchers led by Stephen Zoepf, executive director of the Center for Automotive Research at Stanford University and a researcher at the MIT Center for Energy and Environmental Policy Research, which found that a substantial percentage of drivers for ride-hailing companies probably earn less than they think they do, though their wages are padded thanks to per-mile tax deductions.\\n\\nAs a working paper, it's important to note the figures haven't been peer-reviewed and are subject to change. Nevertheless, it offers interesting insight into an industry where driver pay has been the subject of much scrutiny.\\n\\nUnlike previous economic analyses that report drivers' gross profits without factoring in operational costs, the MIT paper takes into account how much drivers spend on things like insurance, maintenance, repairs, fuel and the car's depreciation in value, using data from Edmunds, Kelley Blue Book and the Environmental Protection Agency.\\n\\nOnce those costs are accounted for, the working paper found, 74 percent of ride-hailing drivers make less than the minimum wage in their states, and 30 percent of drivers actually lose money for every mile they drive.\\n\\nZoepf et al. A graph shows revenue versus expenses per mile by drivers for ride-hailing services. Drivers above the line are losing money for every mile they drive.\\n\\nIn the survey of 1,121 drivers, the median driver earned $0.59 per mile and paid out $0.30 per mile in vehicle costs, leading to a median hourly profit of $3.37.\\n\\nNotably, a choice few drivers with the most efficient vehicles and running the most profitable routes were able to turn out revenue of $1.50 per mile. Zoepf told HuffPost the Toyota Prius, a gas/electric hybrid, was drivers' vehicle of choice by a factor of two.\\n\\nMore than 80 percent of the drivers surveyed said they work less than 40 hours per week.\\n\\nIt isn't all bad news for drivers, however. The paper found nearly half of all drivers can declare a loss for tax purposes at the federal tax deduction rate of roughly $0.54 per mile. Per the researchers, that drastically decreases the amount of taxable income drivers need to report, to the extent that an estimated 74 percent of driver profit ― representing billions of dollars ― is going untaxed.\\n\\nAt an average of $661/month in net profit per driver and with hundreds of thousands of drivers in the U.S. alone, the standard mileage deduction facilitates billions of dollars of untaxed income, and hundreds of millions of unrealized tax revenue, the paper notes. This untaxed profit represents a social subsidy for the ride-hailing business model.\\n\\nWhile the paper is certainly attention grabbing, its methodology and findings are deeply flawed. Uber spokesman\\n\\nLyft didn't respond to a request for comment from HuffPost, but a spokesman for Uber vigorously disputed the paper's methodology and findings.\\n\\nWhile the paper is certainly attention grabbing, its methodology and findings are deeply flawed, the spokesman said. We've reached out to the paper's authors to share our concerns and suggest ways we might work together to refine their approach.\\n\\nZoepf didn't immediately respond to followup questions about his methodology.\\n\\nCompared to other studies that used different methodology, the MIT paper is indeed an outlier. A National Bureau of Economic Research study in November 2016 found drivers in six major metropolitan areas earned around $18 an hour, not taking into account hourly costs varying from $2.94 to $6.46 per hour depending on the hours they worked and the vehicle they drove.\\n\\nThe paper also received some scrutiny from Harry Campbell, founder of The Rideshare Guy, an industry blog. Campbell's 2017 Reader Survey provided the hard data the researchers used for their paper.\\n\\nUsing the same data, Campbell came up with an average hourly rate of around $16 an hour, not taking drivers' operational costs into account. But, he said, even if MIT's methodology needs to be tweaked ― which is possible, since it's a working paper ― its fundamental finding is spot on: Drivers aren't making enough money.\\n\\nMany drivers are doing this job part time and really only looking to make a few hundred bucks a week, Campbell said, but figuring out how much they are actually earning can be quite challenging.\\n\\nI think that's why we see such high turnover, and the No. 1 reason we hear from drivers as to why they're quitting is because of lower-than-expected earnings."}
{"original": "A federal judge blocked the Trump administration from adding a citizenship question to the 2020 census, a win for critics who say the question is unnecessary and would cause fewer immigrants and minorities to respond to the decennial survey.\\n\\nThe Trump administration is expected to swiftly appeal the Tuesday ruling from U.S. District Judge Jesse Furman of the Southern District of New York.\\n\\nSeveral states and activists said immigrants, fearful of volunteering their immigration status to the Trump administration, would refuse to respond. The plaintiffs in the suit ― 18 states, the District of Columbia, several cities and a handful of immigrant rights groups ― argued the Trump administration intended to drive down the response rate among those groups when it added the question and ran afoul of a federal statute requiring them to rationally consider evidence and input before making a policy decision.\\n\\nIn his opinion, Furman wrote the way the Trump administration added the question violated the federal statute, the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). The law, Furman wrote, requires agencies to carefully study an issue before it implements or changes a policy. The Trump administration failed to do that in adding the citizenship question and the public rationale given by Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, who oversees the Census Bureau, Furman said, was pretextual.\\n\\nMost blatantly, Secretary Ross ignored, and violated, a statute that requires him, in circumstances like those here, to collect data through the acquisition and use of 'administrative records' instead of through 'direct inquiries' on a survey such as the census, Furman wrote.\\n\\nAdditionally, Secretary Ross's decision to add a citizenship question was 'arbitrary and capricious' on its own terms: He failed to consider several important aspects of the problem; alternately ignored, cherry-picked, or badly misconstrued the evidence in the record before him; acted irrationally both in light of that evidence and his own stated decisional criteria; and failed to justify significant departures from past policies and practices ― a veritable smorgasbord of classic, clear-cut APA violations, he continued.\\n\\nWhile Furman found the Trump administration violated the APA, he said the evidence in the record did not show the decision to add the question was unconstitutional and motivated by an intent to discriminate.\\n\\nDale Ho, the director of the ACLU's Voting Rights Project, which represented some of the plaintiffs at trial, praised Furman's decision.\\n\\nThis ruling is a forceful rebuke of the Trump administration's attempt to weaponize the census for an attack on immigrant communities, he said in a statement. The evidence at trial, including from the government's own witness, exposed how adding a citizenship question would wreck the once-in-a-decade count of the nation's population. The inevitable result would have been — and the administration's clear intent was — to strip federal resources and political representation from those needing it most.\\n\\nKelly Laco, a Justice Department spokeswoman, said the Trump administration acted within its legal authority.\\n\\nWe are disappointed and are still reviewing the ruling. Secretary Ross, the only person with legal authority over the census, reasonably decided to reinstate a citizenship question on the 2020 census in response to the Department of Justice's request for better citizenship data, to protect voters against racial discrimination, she said in a statement. Not only has the government asked a citizenship question in the census for most of the last 200 years, 41 million households have already answered it on the American Community Survey since 2005. Our government is legally entitled to include a citizenship question on the census and people in the United States have a legal obligation to answer. Reinstating the citizenship question ultimately protects the right to vote and helps ensure free and fair elections for all Americans.\\n\\nBecause the data in the census is so valuable, officials rigorously test questions before they are added to the survey. The citizenship question, however, has not been sufficiently tested, according to Furman.\\n\\nIn his opinion, Furman found that while the citizenship question had been tested for the American Community Survey (ACS), which goes out to a few million households each year, it had not been tested on the decennial census, which goes out to every household. The Trump administration argued the ACS question testing was adequate for the decennial, but Furman said it was not. The ACS questions, he wrote, were last tested in 2006 and the macroenvironment has changed considerably since then.\\n\\nAn inaccurate census would have severe and lasting consequences. The survey is used to determine how congressional seats are allocated to the states and how roughly $675 billion in federal funds are disbursed.\\n\\nThe Trump administration argued that it was well within its authority to add the question and that doing so would not depress the overall response rate. Even if fewer people initially chose to respond to the survey voluntarily, the Census Bureau had robust plans to follow up with people, officials said. Furman disagreed, writing that the inclusion of a citizenship question would mean hundreds of thousands — if not millions — of people will go uncounted in the census.\\n\\nAdministration officials were warned that adding the question would likely cause fewer people to voluntarily respond, but chose to add the question anyway, plaintiffs said. The plaintiffs also said the government's decision to add the question was arbitrary and capricious and presented evidence showing officials wanted to add the question even before a formal request to do so was made.\\n\\nThroughout the litigation, government officials have repeatedly appealed incremental rulings in the case to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit and the U.S. Supreme Court.\\n\\nWhile the census asks about citizenship on surveys that go out to a sample of households, it has not asked about the matter on the decennial survey, which goes to every American household, since 1950.\\n\\nASSOCIATED PRESS Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross has changed his story on why his department wants to add a question about citizenship to the decennial census.\\n\\nRoss said in March that he began exploring adding the question after the Justice Department said it needed better citizenship data to enforce it. But documents disclosed as part of the lawsuit revealed that Ross was interested in adding the question months before the Justice Department sent him its request. Ross also disclosed he was the one who initially approached the Justice Department about making the request.\\n\\nIn his 277-page opinion, Furman thoroughly worked through all of the ways Ross had ignored and misrepresented evidence showing adding a citizenship question was a bad idea. He found that Ross and top Commerce Department aides became set on adding a citizenship question in early 2017, sought a way to do it that could potentially withstand legal scrutiny, and were not going to stop no matter what the evidence showed.\\n\\nThe former head of the Justice Department's civil rights division, responsible for enforcing the Voting Rights Act, also said in a deposition that he was unsure whether citizenship data potentially collected in the census would be more accurate than the data it currently has access to. The statement supported the plaintiffs' argument that the DOJ did not really need a citizenship question on the census and its request for one was driven by other motivations.\\n\\nThere is an ongoing dispute in the trial over what evidence could be considered in reaching the decision. The Justice Department argued that courts should not be allowed to consider information about the decision other than the documents it voluntarily assembled. The plaintiffs fought to have access to more information and wanted to depose Ross, but the Supreme Court blocked them from doing so in October.\\n\\nThe Supreme Court will hear oral argument on what evidence the courts can consider in the case in February. But In his opinion, Furman made it clear that the evidence the Justice Department had volunteered on its own was sufficient to show Ross broke the law.\\n\\nThis story has been updated with quotes from Furman's opinion, Ho and Laco."}
{"original": "Trevor Williams via Getty Images 49 per cent of Canadian women said they were very worried about the virus, compared to 30 per cent of men.\\n\\nMore men than women are dying from COVID-19. So why is it that men take it less seriously?\\n\\nThere are likely medical explanations why a large number of men are dying. But many of the reasons why they take the disease less seriously are behavioural — and a good number of those reasons are dangerous, according to Diana Sarosi, director of policy and campaigns for Oxfam Canada.\\n\\nWhen asked if she finds it surprisingly that men, on average, take the pandemic less seriously than women, Sarosi said, No, not at all.\\n\\nWomen are very worried about what they're seeing in terms of far-reaching and longterm impacts of this pandemic, she told HuffPost Canada.\\n\\nEven in places where more women get the virus, men are dying at higher rates\\n\\nA study published last week in the BMJ (formerly the British Medical Journal) looked at the 20 countries with the most confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus. Not all 20 countries differentiated by gender, but of the ones that did, the majority — including Canada — reported more confirmed cases of the virus in men than women.\\n\\nAnd of those countries, the six that recorded gender in their death rates — China, Italy, France, Germany, Iran and South Korea — all reported that more men died of the virus than women, even though France and South Korea saw higher rates of infected women than men. The deaths in those six countries were between 54 and 71 per cent male.\\n\\nCOVID-19 is too new for any clear answers about why more men are dying than women. It's possible that there are some genetic factors, Dr. Cara Tannenbaum, scientific director of the Institute of Gender and Health for the Canadian Institutes of Health Research, told Global News — but she was quick to point out that that's still speculation at this point.\\n\\nThere are also likely behavioural reasons: men tend to smoke and drink more than women, Queen's University professor and infectious diseases expert Dr. Gerald Evans told Global. And heart and respiratory diseases are also more common in men, and can exacerbate coronavirus symptoms.\\n\\nStill, men are more likely than women to believe coronavirus fears are overblown\\n\\nAlthough there are more than 10,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus in Canada, and over 100 deaths, one in eight Canadians still think the threat is overblown, according to an Angus Reid poll released Tuesday.\\n\\nAnother significant finding from the poll: those people are more likely to be male. This isn't true in every case, but overwhelmingly, the demographics most likely to minimize the crisis are men aged 35 and over.\\n\\nAngus Reid Angus Reid poll demonstrating the demographics who are mostly likely to consider the threat of coronavirus serious versus overblown.\\n\\nAnother Canadian poll had similar findings. The National Post reported on an Abacus poll last week that found that 49 per cent of Canadian women said they were very worried about the virus, compared to 30 per cent of men.\\n\\nAnd this trend exists outside of Canada, too: American men are also less likely than women to heed coronavirus-related health warnings.\\n\\nWhy is this happening?\\n\\nSarosi, who's worked with non-governmental organizations throughout southeast Asia, says she's seen these kinds of gendered roles play out elsewhere.\\n\\nWhat's happening right now is very typical for any sort of crisis, in terms of women mobilizing to be first responders, taking on the care work, she said.\\n\\nShe sees several possible reasons for the gender discrepancy in terms of attitudes about the virus. Part of it has to do with frontline medical workers: Four out of every five health-care workers in Canada are women. Nursing, in particular, is an overwhelmingly female work force, with more than 90 per cent of Canada's nurses identifying as women.\\n\\nIt's really women who are on the front lines of this crisis, Sarosi said. They're in the hospitals, in the health-care centres, providing home care and so on. I think it's a lot more close to home for them than it is for many of the men.\\n\\nAntonio Masiello via Getty Images An Italian army doctor works at the chemical analysis laboratory of the scientific department at Celio Military Polyclinic Hospital in Rome on Wednesday.\\n\\nShe sees women's unpaid labour as a part of the equation, as well. An Oxfam report from earlier this year found that women's unpaid labour — mainly caring for children or elderly people, but also domestic work like cooking and cleaning — is valued at about $1.8 trillion.\\n\\nThe pandemic has changed that, of course.\\n\\nIn the best of times, women do twice as much unpaid care in Canada as men do, Sarosi said. This is really growing exponentially now, with the closures of schools and daycares, and caring for the elderly and sick.\\n\\nThere are also societal attitudes that actively discourage men from seeking help or appearing vulnerable. Sarosi links it to research that's found many men don't fight against climate change, or even adjust behaviour like eating plant-based diets, recycling, or using reusable bags, because they're worried that will come across as feminine.\\n\\nI think the same thing is happening here as well, in terms of women generally being more [socialized] to care about their families, their communities, the broader impact globally, she said.\\n\\nIn the best of times, women do twice as much unpaid care in Canada as men do. This is really growing exponentially now. - Diana Sarosi\\n\\nThat follows general male attitudes towards health care. A U.S. study found that men were much less likely than women to regularly see doctors, and much more likely to skip suggested appointments. In general, men who have the most traditional, macho views about masculinity are the least likely to get routine check-ups and necessary medical care, according to Harvard Men's Health Watch.\\n\\nHow to get men to care\\n\\nOne of the most effective ways for men to take the risk more seriously is for other men to take a public stance, Sarosi said.\\n\\nIt's important that men speak about it as well, that it's not this 'women's issue' but that men are out there really talking to the severity of this crisis, she said.\\n\\nCanadians have seen some of this from our political leaders. Ontario premier Doug Ford and Quebec premier François Legault are both taking the virus very seriously, and both have won over many of their constituents who weren't previously fans with their clear-headed, no-nonsense approach to virus containment.\\n\\nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau, too, has issued a stark warning to Canadians who think they're invincible, which may resonate with some men. You're not, he said at a press conference last week. Enough is enough. Go home and stay home."}

The move comes just days after the New York Police Department announced its decision to allow officers to wear turbans and grow beards for religious reasons.\\n\\nSuch accommodations for Army service members were previously made on a case-by-case basis.\\n\\nBased on the successful examples of Soldiers currently serving with these accommodations, I have determined that brigade-level commanders may approve requests for these accommodations, wrote Secretary of the Army Eric Fanning in a letter announcing the decision.\\n\\nThe new regulations will also permit religious bracelets, as well as dreadlocks for female soldiers.\\n\\nSeveral lawsuits in recent years have pressured the Army to change its policies on grooming and dress. In April 2016, Bronze Star recipient Captain Simratpal Singh was granted a permanent accommodation to wear his turban and beard after he sued the military for discrimination. The ruling, however, applied only to Singh. A short video produced by Becket Law, one of the firms that has petitioned for Sikhs' right to serve in the military, explores the history of the Army's rulings on articles of faith:\\n\\nTuesday's decision ensures that brigade-level commanders will approve all requests for religious accommodations as long as the soldier demonstrates sincere faith observance and doing so would not present a specific, concrete hazard.\\n\\nThe Army will continue testing for safety hazards posed by accommodating articles of faith, Fanning said. And for the time being, soldiers with religious accommodations to grow beards will be restricted from military schools and positions where proximity to toxic chemical agents may arise.\\n\\nMilitary officers and religious liberty advocates celebrated the ruling, which could have far-reaching implications for people of faith serving in the Army.\\n\\nMy turban and beard represent my commitment to pluralism and equality, said Major Kamaljeet Singh Kalsi, who was granted an accommodation in 2009. This new policy change underscores the military's commitment to these values and is a sign of meaningful progress that will ensure the strength of our democracy.\\n\\nRep. Joe Crowley (D-N.Y.) applauded the Army's decision in a statement on his website, saying: This is major progress, not just for the Sikh American community but for our nation's military. Sikh Americans love this country and want a fair chance to serve in our country on equal footing. Today's announcement will help do just that."}

Sina did not respond to a request for comment.\\n\\nThe official People's Daily newspaper of the ruling Communist Party on Sunday encouraged tolerance towards gay people, but added that vulgar content must be removed regardless of sexual orientation.\\n\\nChinese LGBT advocates hope to promote gay rights by educating society about sexual preferences and pushing back against traditional pressures to marry and have children.\\n\\nRECLAIMING BATTLE GROUND FOR ADVOCACY\\n\\nSocial media is a key battle ground where LGBT advocates take on conservative celebrities who dish out popular dating advice, such as saying that the best couples marry early, produce sons and are straight, according to Xiao Tie, head of the Beijing LGBT Center.\\n\\nThe problem with the policy is that it equates LGBT content with porn, Xiao said on Sunday, adding that she believes the government is not actively anti-LGBT. Just that it has no clear idea how to deal with the issue.\\n\\nBut the bigger problem is the culture of strict censorship, she added. Social media used to be an open space, but in the last year things have started to change.\\n\\nSina said the campaign is to ensure that the company is in line with online content regulations released in June last year that lump homosexuality in with sexual abuse and violence as constituting abnormal sexual relationships.\\n\\nThe fight against Sina's decision saw LGBT groups, advocates and gay Chinese speaking out through letters and hashtags.\\n\\nThe tag I am gay was viewed nearly 300 million times on Weibo before being censored on Saturday.\\n\\nBeijing-based advocacy group PFLAG China on Sunday called on Sina's shareholders to punish the evil acts of the NASDAQ-listed company by voting with their feet and selling shares.\\n\\nOther gay Chinese are wrote their own stories in letters to the CEO of Sina, Charles Chao.\\n\\nHao Kegui, one such writer, came out as a lesbian in an open letter published on social media last year where she describes how she had felt pressured into marrying a man to please her parents.\\n\\nThe main concern for me is that, because China is very big, and places outside big cities are quite conservative, there are lots of gay people who only learn about their sexuality online, Hao told Reuters.\\n\\nI worry the censorship will cause more people to just live in the closet and never come out."}
{"original": "With the start of the new year and the thoughts of the money you'll spend making it memorable, you may find yourself thinking of ways to earn extra cash or income. Possibly another part time job, perhaps a freelancing stunt. You might even be thinking about renting your home out on a short-term basis using Airbnb, especially if you'll be away for the holidays. That seems like an easy way to get quick cash without really doing so much work, especially with the rising popularity of holiday rentals.\\n\\nHowever, it is essential to note the risks involved in renting out your home to a total stranger. Even though Airbnb has a solid system for screening would-be guests and requires Airbnbers to abide by a standard set of rules, unforeseen risks may still arise.\\n\\nSo how do you do business through Airbnb, make cool cash, and mitigate some of these risks? Here are five tips for protecting yourself as an Airbnb host.\\n\\nGuard your mail\\n\\n\\n\\nIf your mail were to fall into the wrong hands, you could fall prey to identity theft. The contents of your letters and correspondence contain a lot of sensitive information about you: your financial details, your full name, and the services you subscribe to, to name a few. If this information were to fall into the wrong hands, you would be in trouble!\\n\\nTake extra care to ensure that your mail is protected while you are away. If your mailbox locks, then you're safe. Just lock it up and either take the key with you or stow it somewhere safe. However, if your mailbox doesn't lock, you may want to get a PO box. Your mail will be safer there. On the other hand, if you have neighbours who are trustworthy, you can get them to promise to collect your daily mail, though this tactic is not foolproof as they may forget on some days.\\n\\nAll in all, choose a scenario that works best for you. Worst case scenario, you can stop your mail from the post office altogether and pick it up when you return from your vacation.\\n\\nIt may seem like a lot of work, but it's better to be safe than sorry. And what's more, you have peace of mind wherever you are knowing that your personal details are not being poached by someone else.\\n\\nGet a safe box and insurance\\n\\n\\n\\nThough Airbnb has an insurance system that covers certain types of damage, they don't protect debit or credit cards, cheques or financial papers, jewellery, etc. Get a safe deposit box to store all your important papers, birth certificates, passports, and any other items that would be very difficult to replace.\\n\\nThe safe deposit box could be at home or at your bank, though I would advise you to get one at your bank. Just walk in and request a safe deposit box. It might cost you some money, but your security and peace of mind are priceless.\\n\\nAlso make sure you have your own insurance even after getting a safe box. Don't rely on Airbnb's insurance alone. Speak to your insurance agent and find out what your existing policy coverage is and what amendments you can make to suit your renting endeavours.\\n\\nProtect yourself from hacking and malicious guests with a VPN router\\n\\n\\n\\nUsing an unsecured router will leave you vulnerable to cyber thieves and hackers, so it's best to protect yourself with a VPN router. VPNs are commonly used by people who want to ensure that their online activities cannot be traced, tracked, and ultimately hacked.\\n\\nA router outfitted with a VPN will protect you as an Airbnb host. When guests connect to your home Wi-Fi, all of their browsing and online activity will run through the VPN. A VPN router gives all devices connected to the network a new, anonymized IP address, making it impossible to trace their online activity back to your home. A VPN router is essential because you never know if one of your guests may be engaged in illegal online activities, using your home network for their shady deals. The last thing you want when you come back from your holiday is a visit from the authorities--without a VPN, they could trace a malicious guest's internet activity back to your IP address and home, and you could be liable.\\n\\nScreen guests by yourself and set an emergency plan\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen someone requests to book your space, personally check them out before you decide to host them. You have the final say. Go through their profile and read their reviews if they have any. Search for them on social networks and browse through their accounts. It might amaze you how much you can learn from an individual through his or her social network platforms. And after doing all your reviewing, go with your instincts. If someone doesn't feel right, simply decline. Even if your insurance is 101%, don't take the chance.\\n\\nYou should also draw up a manual of in case of emergency. If there's a fire, it's important that your guests know where the fire extinguisher is. Make this piece of information very clear, conspicuous, and accessible on your home tab. This tab also includes important information like emergency numbers and emergency exit routes.\\n\\nGet a security system\\n\\n\\n\\nWith a security system, you can monitor what goes on in your home. In addition, outfitting your home with a home security system may earn you more bookings as it provides your guests with an extra layer of security which may not be available in other rentals they are also considering.\\n\\nInvest in a home security system that allows home automation. This would let you control your security system from the ease and comfort of your mobile devices, allowing you to turn off or on the lights, lock the doors, or control the heating.\\n\\nHowever, before you install any security system, it's important that you're aware of the Airbnb security policies to avoid any legal implications. Avoid putting cameras in the guest rooms, but if you have off-limit areas, you could use monitors to track if a guest is intruding in your private spaces.\\n\\nBONUS: Add a security deposit to your listing to help protect you in the event of any accident in the house or damages to your household appliances."}
{"original": "In one very heartfelt swoop, Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg has raised the bar on a very important employment benefit most people hope they'll never use: paid bereavement leave ― the time off you need to recover from the loss of a loved one.\\n\\nThe tech giant will now provide 20 days of paid bereavement leave, double the amount previously given.\\n\\nSandberg knows from whence she speaks. She went back to work 10 days after her husband, Dave Goldberg, died in 2015.\\n\\nThis is personal for me, Sandberg said when making the announcement at the Makers conference, a women's leadership event sponsored by AOL, the parent company of The Huffington Post. I lost my husband very suddenly. Facebook provided leave and flexibility, and now we're doing more.\\n\\nFacebook employees will also be able to take off three additional days if they need to take care of family member with a short-term illness, and six weeks if they need to provide longer-term care for ailing family members.\\n\\nBereavement leave has historically been an afterthought\\n\\nFor tech companies that typically attract young workers, the value of being paid while you grieve a spouse, partner, child or parent just hasn't sparked many fires. Perhaps because of its sorrowful nature, bereavement leave doesn't compete favorably against benefits like a generous vacation policy or paid sabbaticals.\\n\\nThe U.S. Fair Labor Standards Act doesn't include a specific provision for bereavement leave, which means an employee has to get an employer's approval before taking it ― even if it isn't paid. Compare this to Canada, where all eligible employees get paid bereavement for three days.\\n\\nMost U.S. states ― Oregon and Washington being the notable exceptions ― don't require companies to pay employees for missing even a single hour of work when they take time off to bury a loved one, but some companies do it voluntarily. Three days is the typical allotment for time off.\\n\\nWhy three days isn't enough\\n\\nHow do you mourn the loss of husband or wife or mother or father in just three days? The short answer is: You don't. It all takes time, and we each grieve on our own timeline.\\n\\nDeath certificates don't even get processed in three days. Funeral arrangements have to be made, people notified, wills located, insurance applications filed, beneficiaries changed, drivers licenses canceled, bills sorted. And yes, bereavement leave lets you take care of most of that. But healing takes time.\\n\\nHopefully, few employees will need to take this leave. Still, it behooves companies to offer it because it speaks to the employer's corporate heart. A generous policy on bereavement leave says a company understands that devastation accompanies grief and recognizes that an employee needs to set aside work in order to manage personal feelings and issues during this most difficult time."}
{"original": "I announced yesterday that I would not be attending the State of the Union this year. I join other distinguished members, including Rep. John Lewis, in refusing to dignify a president who has used the platform of the Oval Office to fan the flames of racism, sexism and hatred — most recently with his vulgar condemnation of Haiti and other African countries.\\n\\nAs a member of Congress, my highest responsibility is to advance the interests of the 7th District, our nation as a whole and our global community with which we are now so inarguably interconnected. If I felt that attending the State of the Union advanced us, I would absolutely be there.\\n\\nMy analysis, however, is that my highest contribution — in these extraordinary times and circumstances where President Trump is himself breaking all established precedents to serve very narrow and self-serving interests — is to stand up to declare that I profoundly disagree with his approach and his unacceptable behavior. His path is dangerous. His path is destructive. His path cannot be normalized. I will not normalize it. This is our own form of nonviolent resistance, a path advocated for by Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., whose birthday we just celebrated yesterday but whose lessons we must continue to incorporate.\\n\\nThis president has consistently indicated that he has no interest in leading a unified country. He has gone out of his way to play to a small and shrinking base of voters by using language that diminishes and demeans vast swaths of people in our own country and around the world. He does and says things that none of us, as parents, would condone for our children. He consistently uses language that is outright racist. He actively uses the highest office of the land to promote hatred as a political tool for his own benefit.\\n\\nMy constituents and people across the country are heartbroken, terrified and demoralized. It is hard to express how deeply scarring the president's words are to them and their families. As a brown immigrant female member of Congress, I feel the impact of these words personally, as well as collectively.\\n\\nIn my career standing up for civil, immigrant and human rights, I have also been steadfast in listening to those who disagree with me and in building unlikely alliances, even on controversial issues such as immigration. Even in this divided Congress, I work with conservative members, co-chairing a new members coalition on immigration with Republican Rep. Roger Marshall from Kansas. I have introduced several bipartisan bills with Republican members of Congress who I have many disagreements with, but find things on which we agree to work together. My refusal to attend the State of the Union, then, is not about policy differences — of which I have many. I would attend a State of the Union by a president with whom I disagree if I felt she or he was otherwise respectful and adhered to basic moral values or basic tenets of civility and respect.\\n\\nHowever, this president has gone beyond the pale, over and over again reaching new lows in his leadership of this country that I love. I cannot and will not reward him as he pushes a self-centered agenda that hurts the district I represent, endangers our country's struggles for unity and abdicates any moral authority that the rest of the world has accorded to America in the past. I hope that there will come a time soon when Republicans who I respect will also understand that to be silent is to be complicit. History has always judged silence and complicity harshly in these times of moral consequence.\\n\\nCivil rights leaders like Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and Rep. John Lewis fought hard to move our nation forward on civil rights. Courageous women like Sojourner Truth, Susan B. Anthony and Ida B. Wells fought for women to have the rights we have today. And throughout the course of history, here and abroad, men and women have died to stand up against despots, dictators and those who sought to pursue paths of ethnic cleansing. Our job today is to honor those who came before us by refusing to go backward. Our job today is to stand clearly for a moral center that this president has shunned.\\n\\nThis is a time for crystal clarity and courage. We cannot send mixed messages — to him or to the millions of people he demeans. That is why I will not attend the official State of the Union, and instead will join activists from across the country, women of color and others in holding our own State of OUR Union, where we resist this racism and put forward our own progressive vision for our beloved country."}

{"original": "WASHINGTON ― Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) was positioned to make a strong bid for president in 2020, but she infuriated tribal leaders by releasing the results of a DNA test to prove her Native ancestry and now her future is unclear.\\n\\nThat's what lots of news outlets want you to think, anyway, after Warren unexpectedly released a carefully choreographed video in mid-October featuring a geneticist who confirmed that she had a Native ancestor six to 10 generations ago.\\n\\nNearly two months after Ms. Warren released the test results and drew hostile reactions from prominent tribal leaders, the lingering cloud over her likely presidential campaign has only darkened, The New York Times reported in December.\\n\\nWarren enraged tribal groups and other minorities concerned about her reliance on a test to measure ethnicity, The Washington Post reported last month. That episode injected uncertainty over the decision-making by Warren and her campaign staff and subjected her to both anger and mockery just as she was gearing up for a potential presidential effort.\\n\\nWow, this sounds bad! Let's see what all these tribal chiefs and Native people are saying about Warren's DNA test and why her decision to release it was so outrageous.\\n\\n[Crickets]\\n\\nOops. Neither of these stories included comments from any elected tribal leaders. The Post story didn't include comments from Native people at all. Of the three Native voices mixed in with political pundits in the Times story, one is a known Warren critic and one is a congresswoman-elect whose positive comments were buried ― a stunning distortion of how many tribal leaders and Native people in general feel about Warren's move.\\n\\nHuffPost talked to a dozen tribal chiefs, Native politicians, researchers and influencers to get a sense of why this narrative that has taken off in the media ― that Warren, who has been a strong ally to tribes, is suddenly on the ropes with them because of her DNA test ― seems off. Some spoke on record; others spoke only anonymously, given their close work with tribes whose privacy they wanted to respect.\\n\\nThe consensus was clear: This narrative is incredibly overblown. Tribal leaders have far more pressing matters to deal with than a senator's DNA test. And, frustratingly, non-Native people are defining a debate about Native people without letting them speak for themselves.\\n\\nASSOCIATED PRESS Rep. Deb Haaland (D-N.M.), one of two Native women who just made history by getting elected Congress, has defended Warren's efforts to understand her ancestry.\\n\\nWas Warren wrong to release DNA test results showing that she had a Native ancestor? Are tribal leaders and Native people mad? It depends on whom you talk to. In the group that HuffPost surveyed, the answer to both those questions was overwhelmingly no.\\n\\nRichard Sneed, the principal chief of the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians, said he's not upset at all by Warren's DNA test. He hasn't heard from any tribal leaders who are mad either. His tribe is different from the Cherokee Nation and is based in North Carolina.\\n\\nIt's media fodder. It's sensationalism. That's what it is, he said. All it takes is for one person to say they're offended, and then everybody does a dog pile. But to me, it's 'Wait a second. Let's get to some of the facts here.' Sen. Warren has always been a friend to tribes. And we need all the allies we can get.\\n\\nSneed has been publicly defending Warren ever since she released her DNA test results, but he's not being quoted in most of the coverage, despite being a Cherokee tribal chief. He emphasized that while he doesn't want to diminish any Native person's anger at Warren, given the injustice and historical trauma that tribal nations have endured, it's important to be clear on what she did and did not do.\\n\\nShe's never claimed to be a tribal citizen. She's never used her story of ancestry to her advantage. She just has a story of Native ancestry, he said. People tell me that all the time. Everywhere I go. I don't think people are trying to gain some status by saying that.\\n\\nTo date, Sneed is the only principal chief of a federally recognized tribe ― there are 573 of them ― who has publicly said anything about Warren's DNA test.\\n\\nDennis Coker, the principal chief of Delaware's Lenape Indian Tribe, which is recognized by the state but not the federal government, also defended Warren. His comments haven't gotten much news play.\\n\\nSomeone who is proud of having that native ancestor — no matter what percentage or what degree it is — in my view, is a person I honor, Coker said in October. I honor people who are seeking their roots.\\n\\nSo where is this outrage?\\n\\nThe reason so many news outlets are reporting that tribes are furious at Warren goes back to a statement released by a single official at the Cherokee Nation, Secretary of State Chuck Hoskin. He ripped the senator after she released her video, and his statement is prominently featured in virtually every story critical of the senator.\\n\\nUsing a DNA test to lay claim to any connection to the Cherokee Nation or any tribal nation, even vaguely, is inappropriate and wrong, read Hoskin's statement (which no longer appears to be on the tribe's site but does appear on Anadisgoi, the official Cherokee Nation newsroom). Senator Warren is undermining tribal interests with her continued claims of tribal heritage.\\n\\nIt's a brutal statement. And it reflects legitimate anger felt by some Native people over Warren's handling of the situation. She didn't get consent from the Cherokee Nation before dropping her video. Even if unintentionally, she amplified sensitive issues around tribal citizenship (including federal versus state recognition, benefits and Native identity) versus ancestry that most non-Native people know nothing about.\\n\\nOne Native politician irked by Warren said the situation was just embarrassing.\\n\\nBut several of the people interviewed by HuffPost noted that Hoskin is an appointee, not an elected official, and he was speaking only for himself, not on behalf of the Cherokee Nation, according to Doug George-Kanentiio, a co-founder of the Native American Journalists Association and a former trustee for the National Museum of the American Indian.\\n\\nNo one bothered to contact the principal chief of Cherokee Nation to see if he agreed, said George-Kanentiio, who is Akwesasne Mohawk. Instead, they took one phrase by this one official in Oklahoma, and it ignited this debate about Warren's heritage.\\n\\nA Cherokee Nation spokesperson did not initially respond to a request for comment on whether Hoskin was speaking on behalf of the tribe or for himself in his statement or whether Principal Chief Bill John Baker agreed with him. But after this story was published, spokeswoman Amanda Clinton emailed to say Hoskin does speak for the tribe.\\n\\nAs any Secretary of State's role is, he is our primary ambassador to other tribes, the state of Oklahoma and the federal government, said Clinton.\\n\\nBaker hasn't said anything publicly about Warren's DNA test results. But he previously weighed in on her heritage: He defended her efforts to understand her ancestry.\\n\\nShe said that she has Native American ancestors, he said in a 2012 interview. I wished every congressman and senator in the U.S. had a kinship or felt a kinship to the Cherokee Nation.\\n\\nIt's media fodder. It's sensationalism. That's what it is. Richard Sneed, principal chief of the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians\\n\\nWarren's office did not respond to a request for comment on whether she regrets releasing the video or the way she rolled it out. She said last month that the video is out there and people can make of it what they want. A source close to her said she has had dozens of conversations and meetings with tribal leaders since October to apologize for any offense taken and to explain her intentions.\\n\\nBut is this really the issue on the minds of tribal leaders? George-Kanentiio said he recently attended the American Indian Justice Conference, which brings together tribal leaders, judges and lawyers to work on policies related to drug abuse, tribal security and tribal youths. Nobody talked about her DNA test at all, he said, because they were focused on tribes' serious problems with domestic abuse, youth suicide, environmental contamination, loss of territory and horrifying levels of missing and murdered Native women.\\n\\nThat's the essence of what Native people are thinking about, he said. They're just trying to keep afloat.\\n\\nIf people really want to know how tribal leaders feel about Warren, they should watch the fiery speech she gave at the National Congress of American Indians in February, said George-Kanentiio. There were nearly 1,000 reputable tribal leaders there, he said, and she stood there and was embraced.\\n\\nTo some, the fact that any Cherokee Nation official issued a statement, along with Sneed publicly weighing in, should have made Warren's DNA test a non-issue going forward.\\n\\nI think the jury's out. I've heard both sides of the Cherokees. I respect both sides, said Frank LaMere, a longtime Native activist and citizen of the Winnebago Tribe of Nebraska. I support Elizabeth Warren. Nobody's going tell me what she is and what she's not.\\n\\nOthers lamented that it feels as though Warren's personal journey of self-discovery is being weaponized against Native identity and Native people.\\n\\nShe merely claims to have Native ancestry, as do millions of others like her, said Ruth Hopkins, a Dakota/Lakota Sioux writer and co-founder of Last Real Indians, a news site focused on tribal issues. Her claim is valid, and she and those like her have the ability to be powerful allies for Native nations struggling to deal with real-life problems stemming from colonization, imposed poverty, treaty breaches, forced assimilation and attempted genocide.\\n\\nRaina Thiele, a former White House liaison for tribes who now runs a consulting firm with expertise in tribal policy, said it has been very odd to see that the few Native people who are quoted in the press are critical of Warren for having pride in her ancestors because, as a Native Alaskan, Thiele said she was raised to always be proud of her heritage.\\n\\nBeyond that, the reason Warren even decided to release her DNA test results, for better or for worse, was to try to move on from President Donald Trump's constant mockery of her Native ancestry and racist attacks on her as Pocahontas. She has been relentlessly harassed. Boston shock jock Howie Carr said in March that he got her spit on a pen and tried to get a DNA sample from it. He encouraged readers of his Boston Herald column to grab her water glass at a St. Patrick's Day event so he could do a DNA test. One of her political opponents mailed two DNA test kits to her house.\\n\\nTrump's bullying of Warren is part of the president's record of disrespecting tribes ― like the time he made a Pocahontas crack about her during a White House ceremony honoring Native American World War II veterans ― and destroying or taking their land.\\n\\nI feel like a lot of anxiety and anger has been misdirected, Thiele said of Warren's Native critics in the press. I do feel like it's about the opportunity to get time in the media. If they are this critical of Donald Trump, no one is going to cover it. If they are this critical of Elizabeth Warren, they will get covered. I feel like there are some perverse incentives here.\\n\\nChip Somodevilla via Getty Images Shiva Ayyadurai, an independent who ran against Warren in 2018, set up this racist, photoshopped image of her wearing a Native American headdress at the Conservative Political Action Conference in National Harbor, Md. in February 2018.\\n\\nStill, if there's one constant in the news coverage of Warren's DNA test, it's that non-Native political pundits have lots of thoughts about it while Native voices are largely missing.\\n\\nThe thing that really, really got me about these articles is that the emphasis is on all of the outrage on behalf of Native Americans, but they're not talking to any Native Americans about it. At all, said Crystal Echo Hawk, a member of the Pawnee Nation of Oklahoma and the CEO and president of Echo Hawk Consulting.\\n\\nEcho Hawk knows all about Native people being erased. She helped lead a groundbreaking $3.3 million research project called Reclaiming Native Truth, the largest public opinion research initiative ever conducted by and about Native Americans. Not surprisingly, it found that the majority of Americans know little to nothing about Native people. Most of what they know comes from popular culture, the media and the toxic stereotypes they perpetuate. Some people don't even know that Native Americans still exist.\\n\\nWe found that the invisibility of Natives is so deeply institutionalized and powerful that it dehumanizes, she said. The New York Times is absolutely reinforcing what we found. It's a problematic pattern within the media.\\n\\nPoliticians and cable TV news anchors have been unabashedly mocking Warren since she announced her DNA test results. In an October speech at a glitzy New York City dinner, outgoing U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley joked that when Trump found out she was Indian-American, he asked me if I was from the same tribe as Elizabeth Warren. CNN's Don Lemon and Chris Cuomo called Haley's jokes hilarious and appropriate. Fox News' Tucker Carlson's coverage has been dripping with racism. Last month Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) tweeted a photo of a wooden teepee and said he was looking for Warren but couldn't find her.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Native officials like Rep.-elect Deb Haaland (D-N.M.), who made history in November by becoming one of the first two Native women ever elected to Congress, have been celebrating Warren's efforts to understand her roots.

Her research found that more than one-third of Americans claimed some sort of Native ancestry. It's part of the national folklore of the country, she said, and when people are introduced to accurate information about Native people, it changes their perceptions in a positive way.\\n\\nWe have a huge opportunity to teach people about claiming ancestry versus tribal citizenship, she said. Tribes are sovereign political Nations. We are not racial groups. We are citizens of Nations that pre-date the United States. It's like nobody is interested in really hearing from tribal leaders and Native people on this issue.\\n\\nEcho Hawk is already doing something about this. She launched a nonprofit, IllumiNative, focused on increasing the visibility of contemporary Native people in popular culture ― and chipping away at the steady stream of ill-informed, racist narratives about them.\\n\\nWe need to be able to talk for ourselves, she said, and not be used as an ax to grind because of Elizabeth Warren's aspirations to run for president.\\n\\nDaniel Marans contributed reporting.\\n\\nThis story has been updated to include a comment from a Cherokee Nation spokeswoman."}
{"original": "President Trump has threatened to use his emergency powers as president to build his $5 billion vanity wall. Can he do this?\\n\\nA series of laws gives extraordinary emergency powers to the president — in a true emergency. Who decides what's a true emergency? In the first instance, the president does. In the end, the courts do.\\n\\nTraditionally, the courts have cut the president a wide berth when it comes to allowing extra-legal powers during a genuine national emergency. Lincoln suspended habeas corpus during the Civil War, when the South had invaded parts of the Union. Roosevelt, with no justification, was able to incarcerate patriotic Japanese-American citizens during World War II.\\n\\nCourts upheld both. In a less urgent circumstance, when Truman tried to seize the steel mills to avert a strike in 1952 during the Korean War, the Supreme Court overruled him.\\n\\nIf you want a chilling account of the kinds of executive power that a president can lawfully wield during an emergency, have a look at Liza Goitein's authoritative piece in The Atlantic. To some extent, Congress has been willing to rein in a president's use of emergency powers, but only rarely.\\n\\nTrump, presumably, could declare a national security emergency, reprogram money already appropriated, and order the Pentagon or the DHS to build the wall. Of course, it's wildly far-fetched to characterize Mexican immigration as a national emergency warranting this sort of extraordinary authority. Illegal cross-border immigration has been declining. The real crisis is Trump's failure to have of any sort of reasonable refugee policy.\\n\\nShould Trump attempt to order a wall built based on his emergency powers, he would immediately be sued by members of Congress. The Democratic House would surely pass a law or a resolution of disapproval while the Republican Senate would be inclined to back the president. However, Trump's move would be massively unpopular, both as policy and as an extra-legal power grab. That might give some Republican senators pause. It's not hard to imagine the defection of several Republican senators, and a joint resolution blocking the wall. Whether Trump has to obey that resolution would also end up in court.\\n\\nAnd here's where the story gets really interesting. Any normal Supreme Court would find, as the 1952 Court did in the Youngstown Sheet and Tube case, that the president had exceeded his authority.\\n\\nBut this Supreme Court is far from normal. It has been a toady for far-right ideology and Republican policies. While lower courts overruled Trump's orders limiting migration from predominantly Muslim countries as a patent violation of the First Amendment's ban on religious discrimination, the Supreme Court upheld it by a 5-4 vote.\\n\\nTom Williams via Getty Images\\n\\nHowever, there are growing signs that Chief Justice Roberts has had a bellyful of Trump's antics, and that he is looking to salvage the reputation of one of the few institutions of government that retains a semblance of legitimacy.\\n\\nEven before Trump, Roberts voted with the court's four liberals to uphold most of the Affordable Care Act. When Trump referred sneeringly last year to an Obama Judge, Roberts declared indignantly (and somewhat disingenuously), We do not have Obama judges or Trump judges, Bush judges or Clinton judges … What we have is an extraordinary group of dedicated judges doing their level best to do equal right to those appearing before them.\\n\\nIf only. Trump shot right back:\\n\\nSorry Chief Justice John Roberts, but you do indeed have Obama judges, and they have a much different point of view than the people who are charged with the safety of our country. It would be great if the 9th Circuit was indeed an independent judiciary, but if it is why...... — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 21, 2018\\n\\nSince then, Roberts sided with the court's liberals on two occasions in December. He refused to allow High Court review of a lower court decision blocking state efforts to ban Planned Parenthood from Medicaid.\\n\\nHe also voted with the liberals to deny review of an appellate court decision that had blocked Trump's effort to deny asylum reviews to refugees who cross the border illegally and then turn themselves in.\\n\\nWhat would Roberts do if Trump spuriously asserted emergency powers to order the building of a wall in defiance of the usual legislative and budgetary progress?\\n\\nThis has little to do with ideology (where Roberts is a faithful conservative) and everything to do with incipient autocracy — an area where Roberts has been discovering his inner constitutionalist.\\n\\nTrump is so mercurial that we may never find out. If we do, the result could be an important part of the evolution of John Roberts, and the defense of our democracy.\\n\\n\\n\\nRobert Kuttner is co-editor of The American Prospect and professor at Brandeis University's Heller School.

{"original": "WASHINGTON ― The Trump administration has come up with a complicated plan to ensure people who receive food assistance will still get benefits for February even if the government remains shut down.\\n\\nAfter that, all bets are off.\\n\\nThe nation's 38 million Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program enrollees will get their February benefits early ― no later than Jan. 20, according to the plan announced Tuesday by Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue.\\n\\nWe want to ensure states and SNAP recipients that the benefits for February will be provided, Perdue told reporters.\\n\\nPerdue said that the last government funding bill Congress passed, which expired on Dec. 21, gave him 30 days to issue the following month's benefits, which will amount to nearly $5 billion overall. Perdue didn't make any promises about what would happen in March.\\n\\nPresident Donald Trump initiated the partial government shutdown last month in an effort to make Congress pay for a border wall that he previously said Mexico would fund. Congress has shown no willingness to play along, and Trump has said the shutdown could go on for months or even years.\\n\\nFor now we have solved the problem of what to do about February SNAP benefits, Perdue said Tuesday. I believe this is ample time for Congress to act.\\n\\nPerdue said the U.S. Department of Agriculture would still have a $3 billion contingency fund that it might be able to use for benefits in March, but he didn't offer any details about the agency's plans for that month.\\n\\nFood assistance, commonly known as food stamps, is one of the federal government's most responsive antipoverty programs. Suspending benefits, which is what would apparently happen if the shutdown continues past March, would have serious economic consequences ― and create a lot more hunger.\\n\\nWord that the federal shutdown could suspend SNAP benefits has spread through state and local media since last week. Just on Tuesday, local reporters in Hawaii, New Jersey, South Carolina, Utah and several other states filed stories on the shutdown possibly bringing hunger to town.\\n\\nPerdue's plan will be no small administrative feat. The USDA is telling state agencies to suspend their normal operations this week so they can instead prepare to issue February's benefits early. States are responsible for taking federal SNAP funds and loading them onto debit cards for program enrollees to spend on food at grocery stores. The average benefits come to about $123 per month per person.\\n\\nIt's good that the government has guaranteed SNAP benefits through February, said Stacy Dean, a nutrition policy expert with the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. But, she said, if the shutdown continues we face the same dilemma in March.\\n\\nSome experts have said there's no reason for USDA to suspend food benefits just because Congress hasn't appropriated funds, arguing that the government ought to treat SNAP as an entitlement like Social Security or Medicare. Those programs continue on autopilot even in a government shutdown.\\n\\nPerdue and his spokespeople have not responded to questions about paying SNAP benefits without an appropriation.\\n\\nHuffPost readers: Are you affected by the government shutdown?

{"original": "Bloomberg via Getty Images\\n\\nSir Vince Cable says the Lib Dem policy of holding a referendum on the final Brexit deal is now much more appealing to voters, despite the party not getting any traction with that message at the snap general election last year. It is six months since the 74-year-old was elected as Lib Dem leader, 30 years since his party was founded and one year until the United Kingdom is due to leave the European Union. Cable is speaking to HuffPost UK on Valentines Day - before meeting his wife Rachel at a nice romantic restaurant down by the river. The chances of stopping it are now quite high, Cable says of Brexit. I take the view the Lib Dems are important players. We have 12 MPs - but we have 100 peers and we have a big army in the country. But we are not going to do this on our own. We've got to do it by working with people in the other parties. It was supposed to be somewhat different. Under Tim Farron, the Lib Dems hoped to entice a large chunk of the 48% who voted 'Remain' to back the party with an overtly pro-EU campaign. But it did not really work. Farron, having had his religious beliefs and views on homosexuality put under the microscope, resigned. He has since said he regrets saying he did not think gay sex was a sin. It wasn't helpful and he acknowledged that himself. And that's why he stood down, Cable says of his predecessor. I don't think it was what he said, that did upset quite a lot of people, it was the fact that he basically went missing in the early part of the campaign because he was preoccupied with that problem. He's acknowledged that himself. I spoke out very strongly and made it clear that was absolutely not my view and absolutely not the party's view. But he is a party spokesman I am not proposing to change that.\\n\\nLeon Neal via Getty Images Tim Farron and Vince Cable together as the party leadership changed hands.\\n\\nCable was essentially anointed party leader after Jo Swinson, now deputy leader, decided not to run. What is the difference between Farron's Lib Dems and Cable's? Well it's an evolution of the same, Cable says. I think the change is not from the Tim Farron era, but pre-2015 and post-2015. We had taken a very bad hit in 2015. I think two thirds of our members have come in since 2015 and that process started under the last leader and its continued since. The membership has changed and the nature of the party has changed and of course Brexit has become an all-consuming issue. Cable, initially sceptical of committing the party to another referendum, has embraced the idea of giving the public a vote on the final Brexit deal. It didn't happen in the 2017 election for sure, he says of the success of that strategy. But we haven't had any real tests of electoral support since then. We do have lots of local by-elections where we tend to do very well actually. I think if there were an election now, there isn't going to be, but if there was, I think our position is much more appealing.\\n\\nBloomberg via Getty Images Vince Cable was speaking to HuffPost UK after Boris Johnson gave his big speech on Brexit.\\n\\nEarlier in the day, Boris Johnson had tried to love-bomb Remain voters with a promise of a liberal Brexit. However he also warned another referendum would only deepen the divisions in society. I think last summer, during the general election, I think there was some force in that argument, Cable concedes. It's one of the reasons we didn't get any traction. The most recent YouGov poll put the LibDems on 8% of the national vote. It won a 7.4% share at the election. The first real test for the party since the general election will be May's local elections London where the Conservatives fear a wipeout at the hands of Jeremy Corbyn's Labour. We don't think it's going to be an easy election because we are defending a lot of seats, Cable says. In some of the inner-city areas where we are up against Corbynistas we don't underestimate the problems. But he says the party is hoping for substantial gains in his home borough of Richmond as well as neighbouring Kingston.\\n\\nPA Wire/PA Images\\n\\nCable says had Theresa May gone for a soft-Brexit, by which he means keeping the UK in the single market and customs union, a lot of pro-EU voters would have gone along with it. I think a lot of Remainers would have said 'ok fine, we would rather not leave, but this is something we can cope with and it's not going to cause a lot of economic harm', he says. The fact they are pursuing a much more extreme and also very uncertain outcome means that these divisions are not going to go away. They are becoming more extreme and acute. People will want to have a fresh look at this when they know what the outcome is. I think there is a peculiar thing you encounter with the public, on the one hand they are absolutely bored stiff with the subject but equally they're very intensely divided. It's worrying in the long run. As somebody used the phrase the other day, there is a kind of non-violent civil war's going on. There's an element of truth in that. He predicts a big Tory rebellion in the Commons over May's plan to leave the customs union. There are a lot of people who probably wouldn't go to the stake over the single market because of immigration issues but would go tot stake over the customs union, he says. Cable adds that while domestic issues such as the NHS, education, housing and broader economic policy matter, Brexit is so central to parliament and the future of the country we have to prioritise it.\\n\\nPA Wire/PA Images Vince Cable makes his keynote speech at the Lib Dem conference in Bournemouth last year.\\n\\nCable has been here before of course. He served as acting leader in 2007 during the transition from Sir Ming Campbell to Nick Clegg. But that was under very different circumstances than where he finds his party today. We had never been in government. So, you know, there was nothing to defend. It was all attack, attack, attack. Ten years on Cable, the former business secretary, acknowledges his association with the coalition has been a factor in the past but this diminishing as an issue. We do know from our surveys there about 25%+ of the electorate are considering voting for us. They may not, and they haven't firmed up on it, but there is a potential market, he says. From my recollection a majority of those who currently not voting for us but considering it are Labour, on the left Labour people. I guess the coalition was an issue for them but will become less so over time. The whole Brexit thing has brought other issues to the fore. There are some good things happening, Cable says of his party's position. We have this record level of membership, lots of enthusiastic young people. We are the youngest of the three parties, I've discovered, in terms of average age. You go around the country and lots of kind of idealistic young people, full of energy who want to do things and that's really good. I think the other thing that pleasantly, I'm not going to say pleasantly surprised me, but which is good - we've got a very good cohesive team. It would be nice to have a lot more than 12 MPs, but they are pretty harmonious and work together. They are very good and it has made my life a lot easier.\\n\\nPA Wire/PA Images"}

{"original": "As markets tumble again in China, with ripple effects across the globe, concerns about the role of fear and anxiety in market behavior have reemerged. Is the sharp decline based on real changes in value or the result of speculation and a herd mentality? Are emotions and anxieties the actual source of the problem? Calls for calm are being issued. After the previous crash last August, Chinese authorities even cracked down on the spread of rumors about market activity! Analysts around the world hasten to explain the economic forces at work, with many calling for renewed trust in the market.\\n\\nIt's important to understand what's behind this language of calls for market confidence, because it bears on how we respond to crises like this one.\\n\\nAlmost 20 years ago, Alan Greenspan famously spoke of the irrational exuberance of market actors contributing to a stock bubble. He pitted calm and reasonable trust in market mechanisms against the emotional irrationality of certain regions and market players.\\n\\nThe language of serene trust in the market has an even longer history. It's deeply tied to religion -- and particularly to the language of faith.\\n\\nIn 1759 Adam Smith referred to the invisible hand to describe supposedly self-correcting capacities of markets as they emerged in Europe. Smith unabashedly appropriated the language of providence -- talk of the hand of God arranging and guiding the universe and history -- and applied it to the market.\\n\\nAs historians of science and economics note, a worldview based on divine providence was gradually switched out with a new framework: equilibrium. The same principles of order and regulation were maintained, but without the language of an external guide. Instead, this was all accomplished internally, through the logic of the system itself. Smith could talk about the hand of God without reference to God, but the idea that some rational force was leading things in orderly fashion still lingered.\\n\\nThere is an important counterpart to equilibrium theory: the ideal self or person that exists in such a self-calibrating system. In a providential framework, humans are expected -- at their best -- to show faith in the divine hand, to trust that God works all things together for good (Romans 8:28). In the newer language of equilibrium, ideal market actors (those who avoid irrational exuberance) are called to trust in the self-regulation of the market. True disciples, the story goes, should show faith in the market's capacity to return to equilibrium.\\n\\nThe attitudes aren't identical, but the similarities are noteworthy.\\n\\nOne of the ways this faith is demonstrated is through taming the passions. As the economic historian Albert Hirschman recollected in his 1977 book The Passions and the Interests, early capital markets emerged amidst heated debates about the place of virtue and vice in civil society. Disorderly rushes of emotion and desire were viewed with suspicion and seen as destabilizing to newly formed European nations.\\n\\nAn antidote emerged: channeling those passions by engaging in market transactions, and believing that such acts, while competitive, would contribute to the common good. The invisible hand would ensure that all market activities, however self-interested, would lead to a net benefit for society as a whole. Taming the passions and trusting in providence -- or, better, in the market God of equilibrium -- thus became key virtues of capitalism.\\n\\nScientists and theorists continue to debate whether equilibrium theory is useful, as many claim that equilibrium hasn't ever been observed. One could argue that equilibrium theory appears to lie on the same foundation as its predecessor providence -- a mixture of faith and reason. Arguments can be gathered and apparent evidence highlighted, but in the end a leap is required. But when it comes to market behavior, many argue that the evidence for equilibrium is scanty.\\n\\nBoth the religious background to equilibrium theory and the posture of faith that is expected of market actors raise questions about the ideal response to market panics. Just as various natural disasters, like the Lisbon earthquake of 1755, put theories of divine providence into question, so repeated financial crises are bringing equilibrium theory under greater scrutiny. It's not at all apparent that markets will self-regulate and should thus be left to themselves -- whatever that may mean.\\n\\nDoes authentic market faith mean remaining calm in the face of collapse, trusting predictive models that tell of eventual return and restabilization? Shall we rationalize collateral economic damage as blips on a graph of the ordained greater good?\\n\\nOr might faithfulness involve types of intervention and proactive policy making, recognizing our own responsibility as humans to manage the now global consequences of our actions? Whatever our opinions are on the merits or dangers of faith, let's agree in the least that it should not be blind.\\n\\nFollow Devin Singh on Twitter: devinps"}

{"original": "CHELTENHAM, England (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - In a 25-year battle to have the identity of genderless people recognized in British passports, Christie Elan-Cane fought depression and unemployment.\\n\\nThe campaigner, who was born female but identifies as neither male nor female, wants the government to change its passport policy and introduce a third category for people who regard themselves as genderless.\\n\\nElan-Cane could move a step closer to realizing that goal when the high court holds a hearing on Wednesday and Thursday to review the government's passport policy.\\n\\nThe current system allows applicants to tick only a male or female option, and does not provide for a genderless alternative, which is usually symbolized with an 'X'.\\n\\nIt is the first legal challenge against that policy, Elan-Cane said.\\n\\nI'm quite apprehensive because it could go either way, and the future direction of what I'm doing and the lives of a lot of people will be dependent on this, Elan-Cane said.\\n\\nI can't remember when I last slept a night, Elan-Cane told the Thomson Reuters Foundation in an interview in Cheltenham, a town in southwest England.\\n\\nThe 60-year-old first started campaigning for awareness of genderless people in 1992 after shedding a female identity and taking on a gender-neutral one.\\n\\nAlthough Britain recognized the gender identity of trans people in the 2004 Gender Recognition Act, Elan-Cane said the decision to identify as non-gendered had drastic consequences, including being forced out of work and facing discrimination.\\n\\nI find it very degrading that I have to fight to achieve (a) legitimate identity that most people can take for granted within gendered society, Elan-Cane said.\\n\\nAfter initially raising the issue of 'X-passports' with the British passport office in 1995, the campaigner went on to seek support from a local parliamentarian in 2005.\\n\\nIn 2013, London-based law firm Clifford Chance took on the case pro bono and has since represented Elan-Cane.\\n\\nNarind Singh, a partner at Clifford Chance who is leading the legal team, said in a statement that X-passports were a crucial step in protecting the rights of genderless people.\\n\\nWithout such documents, Singh said, they faced an unacceptable choice between forgoing a passport, and making a false declaration, and using a passport which misrepresents their identity.\\n\\nThe law firm told the Thomson Reuters Foundation it was hopeful for a positive outcome, but expected it would be weeks before a decision was made.\\n\\nThe British-based charity Stonewall, which advocates for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) rights, said it supported a move for X-passports, and wanted government documents accurately to reflect gender identity.\\n\\nMany trans people are afraid to travel abroad for fear of intrusive questioning or difficulties at passport control, said Laura Russell, head of policy at Stonewall, by email.\\n\\nBritain would join Australia, New Zealand, Denmark, Germany, Malta, India, Nepal, Pakistan, Ireland and Canada if it were to issue genderless passports.\\n\\nA government spokesperson said it would be inappropriate to comment on ongoing legal proceedings.\\n\\nShould the court rule the current passport policy unlawful, it could increase pressure to amend the law, Elan-Cane said.

{"original": "Public opinion on Syria has reshuffled in the wake of President Donald Trump's decision to withdraw U.S. forces from the country, recent polls suggest, underscoring how malleable those views often are.\\n\\nBy all accounts, leaving Syria should have been relatively unpopular, especially among the president's core supporters. In past surveys, a majority of Trump's backers and the public as a whole backed the president's decision to order military airstrikes in Syria in 2017 and favored using U.S. troops to combat Islamic extremists in Iraq and Syria last year.\\n\\nTrump's withdrawal poses a test for how far Republicans will follow his lead on foreign policy, an issue that has often split the party between Trump's strongest supporters and those who are less enthusiastic, Scott Clement, The Washington Post's polling director, wrote in late December.\\n\\nIn a set of surveys taken since, Trump's supporters largely appear to have accepted his decision to withdraw from Syria, although without high levels of enthusiasm. And in a more dramatic shift, his opponents appear to have become much more approving of U.S. intervention.\\n\\nIn an Economist/YouGov poll conducted last April, Hillary Clinton voters said by a 6-percentage-point margin that the U.S. has a responsibility to do something about the fighting in Syria between government forces and anti-government rebels, while Trump voters said by an 8-point margin it did not.\\n\\nBy the time the same pollsters asked a different version of that question at the end of 2018, those differences had ballooned, due largely to movement among Trump's opponents. Those who voted for Democrat Clinton now said by a 42-point margin that the U.S. had a responsibility to do something about the fighting in Syria involving ISIS, while Trump voters said by a 16-point margin that the nation had no such responsibility. That movement is particularly notable because the question included no mention of Trump, nor any cues about which of the positions he currently holds.\\n\\nMost Americans don't have deeply held views on whether the U.S. should withdraw from Syria.\\n\\nFifty-nine percent of Trump voters in the most recent Economist/YouGov survey said they supported the immediate withdrawal of U.S. forces from Syria, but just 24 percent were strongly supportive. Most Clinton voters said they opposed the withdrawal, but just over a third did so strongly.\\n\\nBut Americans do have strong views about Trump ― especially those who dislike him. In a HuffPost/YouGov survey also taken after the withdrawal, more than 80 percent of Trump voters approved of his handling of Syria (51 percent strongly approved), and 88 percent approved of his handling of foreign policy in general (64 percent strongly); in both cases, a majority approved strongly. Meanwhile, 81 percent of Clinton voters disapproved of Trump's handling of Syria (with 66 percent disapproving strongly) and 93 percent of his handling of foreign policy (81 percent strongly).\\n\\nThe HuffPost/YouGov poll consisted of 1,000 completed interviews conducted Dec. 20-22 among U.S. adults, using a sample selected from YouGov's opt-in online panel to match the demographics and other characteristics of the adult U.S. population.\\n\\nHuffPost has teamed up with YouGov to conduct daily opinion polls. You can learn more about this project and take part in YouGov's nationally representative opinion polling.

{"original": "When I moved to Barcelona last autumn, I pictured long wine-filled evenings in squares and trips to the beach. I didn't imagine weeks spent inside my flat isolating from a global viral pandemic.\\n\\nOn Sunday 15 March, the Spanish government announced a two-week lockdown to stop the rapid spread of coronavirus. The public were ordered to stay at home unless they needed essential food or medicine. Schools, universities, restaurants, bars and public spaces were all to be closed.\\n\\nThe Spanish are a very sociable bunch, and an enviable climate means much of life is spent outdoors. All year round in my neighbourhood, bars keep their doors swung open and people sit outside at restaurants. Every morning and afternoon, like clockwork, a crowd of children and their families gather at the school gates to gossip, eat pastries and play games.\\n\\nBut when I ventured out last Monday, the first official day of lockdown, the city looked like a very different place. There's something very odd about seeing a bright blue sky and a completely empty city beach but it was the ghost-like streets that were even weirder. A few people were out running errands but the majority were wearing masks and gloves. At the big supermarket, I was met with a security guard monitoring the queue with a 'one in, one out' policy you're more used to seeing at some exclusive nightclub. I passed a pharmacy where medicine was handed to customers through a small hole in a screen.\\n\\nThe first week was really difficult. The situation escalated very fast and as all upcoming plans fell through...\\n\\nThe first week was really difficult. The situation escalated very fast and as all upcoming plans fell through – including a visit from my parents and an upcoming holiday to Colombia – I struggled to look forward to a completely clear diary. I read the news obsessively in an attempt to understand what the hell was going on and when on earth it would end. The thought of staying in my flat for the foreseeable felt incredibly claustrophobic. And while drinking wine in my pyjamas was fun at first, the novelty of Christmas in March quickly wore off.\\n\\nAs the first week came to a close, the government extended the lockdown for a further two weeks and tightened the rules – including asking citizens to carry a slip of paper or digital form detailing why they weren't at home. It felt like things had just got even more serious but I kept reminding myself that the stricter the measures, the sooner the situation would get better. Police presence was visibly upped, and only one person should now only leave the house at once – something a friendly policeman told my housemate and I as we made our way to the supermarket on a joint trip. Dogs, however, must have felt like they struck gold. Going for a walk is only allowed if you have a canine companion – and photos of exhausted dogs and adverts pimping out pets circulated widely on social media. One man was even caught walking a goat.\\n\\nHowever, by week two, things got – whisper it – a little easier. Unfortunately, when everything was in chaos, I found the boring things like routine and exercise made the most difference. I set my alarm for 8am each weekday morning, do a HIIT or yoga video before work and try and take a proper hour-long lunch break. I'm a big advocate of the loungewear life but when you might not get dressed for months, I've found it's worth switching into normal clothes for at least some part of each day. Evenings we began to fill with virtual plans: a phone call with family, a Houseparty catch-up with friends, a pub quiz over Zoom. I've never been so in touch with my wider circle since moving abroad - a much-needed silver lining to this whole debacle.\\n\\nSlowly but surely, I stopped thinking so much about the parallel reality of what I should have been doing...\\n\\nOther things that have kept me sane include trying to separate the weekend from the week (we save films and take-away for Fridays and Saturdays) and finding new things to look forward to (a wine and cheese night or a new book). While the Internet may suggest this is the perfect time to start your novel, Etsy side hustle or online masters, I realised fast there's no point putting pressure on yourself to use this extended time 'productivity'. Life is still pretty busy even if you're at home all day and coping with the current overwhelming situation is enough before adding an extra challenge into the mix.\\n\\nSlowly but surely, I stopped thinking so much about the parallel reality of what I should have been doing if it weren't for this dreaded virus. Sure, I miss my old life but I'm also weirdly getting quite used to this one. People talk about a 'new normal' and it's true, somehow you manage to adjust.\\n\\nAnd, when all else fails, I look forward to 8pm when the whole street comes out onto their balconies and claps in solidarity with emergency workers. As days go on there's been people dancing, singing, blasting the music and tooting their car horns.\\n\\nA reminder that when this is all over, what a party there will be.\\n\\nElizabeth Bennett is a freelance journalist based in Barcelona.

{"original": "And Sanders benefited from an organized labor movement in Nevada that, as in much of the rest of the country, is fiercely divided when it comes to Sanders' signature policy of Medicare for All. The state's largest local teachers union, the Clark County Education Association, endorsed Sanders in part because the union has struggled to protect its health care benefits and is less wary of a transition to a single government plan. Nevada's SEIU Local 1107, which unlike CCEA did not endorse in the race, also condemned the Culinary Union's critical treatment of Medicare for All, arguing that pitting union health care plans against Medicare for All created a false choice.\\n\\nAt the Rancho High School caucus site in northeast Las Vegas, Sanders swept to victory in both precincts, while no other candidate won any delegates.\\n\\nRather than focus on the high-minded policy debates over health care and legislative pragmatism that have dominated the national media narratives, caucus-goers who expressed their preference for Sanders there tended to refer broadly to his commitment to expanding access to health care and education, and immigration reform. Several also cited what they see as his authenticity, honed over decades of progressive activism.\\n\\nHe has been fighting for our rights since he was younger, said Allison Rangel, a restaurant hostess.\\n\\nRodrigo Loera, a warehouse manager, initially expressed a preference for Buttigieg. But after Buttigieg failed to reach viability in his precinct, Loera switched to Sanders.\\n\\nI like his ideas ... the way that he wants to change the way that the country is going right now, Loera said, singling out Sanders' plan to reform the health care system.\\n\\nThe Nevada caucuses went notably more smoothly than the first caucus-style contest of the cycle. Iowa's Democratic Party is recounting votes from 10 precincts in the state after the apparent leaders in that race, Sanders and Buttigieg, both requested limited recounts.\\n\\nNevada is also shaping up to be somewhat of a comeback for Biden. After disappointing showings in Iowa and New Hampshire, where he came in fourth and fifth respectively, Biden said his strength would show through when communities of color began casting their votes.\\n\\nBiden, who drew criticism for leaving New Hampshire well before results came in, held a caucus day celebration in Nevada after voting, unlike Sanders, who spent the day campaigning in Texas — a Super Tuesday state.\\n\\nBiden took the opportunity to celebrate a rebound performance, even though it was still unclear how he would place. Y'all did it for me! he told a crowd of supporters at an IBEW union hall in Las Vegas. Someone shouted back: The comeback kid!\\n\\nWe're in a position now to move on in a way that we haven't been until this moment, Biden said.\\n\\nBiden now heads to South Carolina, where he has been polling ahead of the field ― although Sanders has been closing the gap in South Carolina as well.\\n\\nSen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) stepped into the spotlight during the Democratic debate in Las Vegas earlier this week, grilling her opponents and demonstrating she's still got her fighting spirit. She trained an especially fiery line of questioning on former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who has decided not to compete in the first four states of the Democratic primary. She heads to South Carolina without any clear victories to her name.\\n\\nThe stakes of the caucus results are especially high for Buttigieg, who had hoped a strong performance in the state would prove his appeal beyond the predominantly white states of Iowa and New Hampshire.\\n\\nAs of Saturday night, a full picture of how Buttigieg fared with the more diverse electorate had yet to emerge. Still, the former mayor sounded a triumphant note in a speech to supporters in Las Vegas, before pivoting to a lengthy attack on Sanders. He reiterated his criticism that Sanders' Medicare for All plan would deprive Americans of the option to keep their private insurance coverage. Buttigieg began airing television ads on Friday in South Carolina that blast Sanders by name for forcing over 122 million Americans off their private plans, including 22 million seniors covered by Medicare's private variant, Medicare Advantage."}
{"original": "MANHATTAN, Kan. (AP) — Longtime Republican Sen. Pat Roberts of Kansas said Friday that he will not seek re-election in 2020, ending a decades-long career in Congress and setting up an intense political scramble to replace him.\\n\\nThe 82-year-old senator has spent decades in Congress but faced pressure to step aside in part because he would have been 84 when facing voters in 2020. He also faced grueling primary and general election contests in 2014, when his congressional longevity became a liability.\\n\\nRoberts is the second veteran Republican senator in less than a month to announce plans not to run again in 2020, following Tennessee's Lamar Alexander.\\n\\nRepublicans have won every U.S. Senate race in Kansas since 1932, often by comfortable margins. Roberts won a U.S. House seat representing western Kansas in 1980 and was elected to the Senate in 1996. But his seat was in play in 2014 as Republicans sought to reclaim a Senate majority, after opponents on both the right and left painted him as an out-of-touch Washington insider.\\n\\nCritics mocked him for claiming his home was in Dodge City, the iconic former Wild West town, even though he maintained a residence in the Washington area. Roberts hurt his re-election bid by joking that renting space in the home of two Dodge City supporters gave him full access to a recliner. He bought a home in Topeka in 2016.\\n\\nIn 2014, Roberts captured less than 50 percent of the vote in a four-person primary after a spirited challenge from tea party candidate Milton Wolf, a Kansas City-area radiologist. The Democratic nominee dropped out, giving stronger independent candidate Greg Orman, a Kansas City-area businessman, a cleaner shot at Roberts. The national GOP quickly retooled Roberts' campaign.\\n\\nThe resulting national spotlight was unlike anything Roberts had seen during his previous campaigns.\\n\\nPotential Republicans that could replace Roberts include departing Gov. Jeff Colyer, outgoing Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach and Rep. Roger Marshall, who holds the same western Kansas seat Roberts once did. Among Democrats, Barry Grissom, a former U.S. attorney for Kansas, was considering the race before Roberts' announcement.\\n\\nAfter working 13 years as a congressional staffer, Roberts in 1980 won the safe GOP seat for western Kansas in the House held by his retiring boss. He kept the seat for 16 years and made his mark on farm policy, eventually rising to House Agriculture Committee chairman.\\n\\nHe won his Senate seat in 1996 when popular moderate Republican Sen. Nancy Kassebaum Baker decided not to seek re-election. Democrats did not field a candidate against him in 2002, and he handily won re-election in 2008.\\n\\nHe continued to focus on agriculture as a senator and just weeks ago helped negotiate the final terms of a massive farm bill as Senate Agriculture Committee chairman. The legislation reauthorized agriculture and conservation programs worth $400 billion over five years but failed to tighten work requirements for recipients of food stamps, a goal of some Republicans.\\n\\nHe also served four years as the Senate Intelligence Committee chairman, presiding over intensely partisan hearings over the intelligence before the 2003 invasion of Iraq. He left the chairmanship in 2006, after anger over the war cost Republicans their Senate majority.\\n\\nBut his 2014 gaffe about the recliner showed how his sharp tongue could sometimes get him into trouble. After then-President Barack Obama had a contentious lunch in 2010 with GOP senators, Roberts called the Democrat pretty thin-skinned and told reporters, He needs to take a Valium before he comes in and talks to Republicans."}
{"original": "ATLANTA (AP) — Usually it's a president's first midterm election that reorders a White House's political approach and priorities. For President-elect Joe Biden, his most defining congressional election is coming before he takes office.\\n\\nTwo runoffs Tuesday in Georgia will decide which party controls the Senate and, thus, how far the new president can reach legislatively on issues such as the pandemic, health care, taxation, energy, and the environment. For a politician who sold himself to Americans as an uniter and a seasoned legislative broker, the Georgia elections will help determine whether he's able to live up to his billing.\\n\\nIt's not that you can't get anything done in the minority or get everything done in the majority, but having the gavel, having that leadership control can be the difference in success or failure for an administration, said Jim Manley, once a top aide to former Democratic Senate Leader Harry Reid, who held his post opposite current Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.\\n\\nBoth Georgia Democrats Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock must win Tuesday to split the Senate 50-50. Vice President-elect Kamala Harris, as president of the Senate, would provide the tiebreaker needed to determine control.\\n\\nTo be sure, even a closely divided Democratic Senate wouldn't give Biden everything he wants. Senate rules still require 60 votes to advance most major legislation; for now, there aren't enough Democrats willing to change that requirement. So, regardless of Georgia's results, Biden will have to win over Republicans in a Senate where a bipartisan group of more centrist senators stands to see their stock rise.\\n\\nA Democratic Senate still would clear an easier path for Biden's nominees to key posts, especially on the federal judiciary, and give Democrats control of committees and much of the floor action. Conversely, a Senate led by McConnell almost certainly would deny Biden major legislative victories, as it did late in President Barack Obama's tenure, by keeping his agenda from even getting up-or-down votes.\\n\\nASSOCIATED PRESS President-elect Joe Biden speaks at a drive-in rally for Georgia Democratic candidates for U.S. Senate Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff, Tuesday, Dec. 15, 2020, in Atlanta. (AP Photo/Patrick Semansky)\\n\\nBiden's team is keenly aware of the stakes. The president-elect will travel to Atlanta on Monday, the eve of the runoffs, to campaign with Ossoff and Warnock for the second time in three weeks. Biden's campaign aides have helped raise millions to boost the party infrastructure that helped Biden become the first Democratic presidential nominee since 1992 to carry the state. Vice President-elect Kamala Harris will campaign Sunday in Savannah.\\n\\nIn his last visit, Biden called Republican Sens. David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler roadblocks and urged Georgians to vote for two United States senators who know how to say the word 'yes' and not just 'no.'\\n\\nCongressional makeup shapes any administration, but perhaps even more so for Biden, who spent 36 years in the Senate, plus eight as Obama's vice president and top congressional liaison. Biden leaned on that resume to pitch himself to the country as a consensus builder; he also criticized presidents' increased use of executive action to go around Congress and insisted it would be different in his presidency.\\n\\nEven some Republicans are hopeful. Michael Steel, once a top adviser to Republican House Speaker John Boehner, a chief Obama foil along with McConnell, blamed Obama's Capitol Hill troubles on his personal approach to his fellow politicians. Conversely, Steel said, President-elect Biden is a legislator by avocation, by training, by instinct, by experience in a way that former President Obama was not.\\n\\nSteel predicted Biden and McConnell, two former colleagues, can find common ground on infrastructure and immigration — policy areas that have stumped multiple administrations. Steel noted a handful of Republican senators, including Marco Rubio of Florida and Rob Portman of Ohio, could face tough reelection fights in 2022, potentially making them eager to cut deals they could tout in campaigns.\\n\\nStill, there's no indication McConnell would allow consideration of other top Biden priorities, most notably a public option expansion of the 2010 Affordable Care Act, which passed without a single Republican vote when Democrats controlled both chambers on Capitol Hill. Biden's proposed tax hikes on corporations and the wealthiest Americans also are likely dead in a GOP Senate.\\n\\nBiden will need his negotiating skills to navigate the left flank of his own party as well. While progressives say they've lowered their expectations of what's possible — even under a Democratic Senate — they still intend to push Biden.\\n\\nLarry Cohen, chairman of Our Revolution, the offshoot of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders' 2016 presidential bid, said progressives will press Democrats in Congress to use the budget reconciliation process to work around the Senate's 60-vote filibuster threshold. Cohen argued that tactic might be used to accomplish long-sought goals like ending tax subsidies to fossil fuel companies and enabling the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services to negotiate as a single customer with pharmaceutical companies.\\n\\nThose moves, Cohen noted, could generate considerable savings, creating new revenue even if Republicans won't agree to any tax increases.\\n\\nHe also said progressives will push Biden to use executive authority. He named two initiatives Biden has called for publicly: ending new drilling on federal lands and raising the minimum wage for federal contractors to $15 per hour, even if Congress won't set that floor across the economy. Another progressive priority, canceling student debt under federal loan programs, is something Biden has not said whether he'd be willing to attempt unilaterally.\\n\\nDemocrats' limited expectations about their own power, even with a potential majority, belie the exaggerated claims Republicans have used in the Georgia races.\\n\\nIn Perdue's and Loeffler's telling, a Democratic Senate would rubber stamp a socialist agenda, from ending private insurance and expanding the Supreme Court to adopting wholesale a Green New Deal that would spend trillions and raise taxes on every U.S. household by thousands of dollars each year. Besides misrepresenting Biden's and most Democratic senators' policy preferences, that characterization ignores the reality of the Senate's roster.\\n\\nAt one campaign stop this week, Ossoff said Perdue's ridiculous attacks blow my mind. He scoffed at the claim that his policy ideas, which align closely with Biden, amount to a leftist lunge. But the challenger agreed with the incumbent on how much the Georgia runoffs matter.\\n\\nWe have too much good work to do, Ossoff said, to be mired in gridlock and obstruction for the next few years."}

{"original": "SAN DIEGO (AP) — President-elect Joe Biden's decision to immediately ask Congress to offer legal status to an estimated 11 million people in the country has surprised advocates given how the issue has long divided Democrats and Republicans, even within their own parties.\\n\\nBiden will announce legislation his first day in office to provide a path to citizenship for millions of immigrants in the United States illegally, according to four people briefed on his plans.\\n\\nThe president-elect campaigned on a path to citizenship for the roughly 11 million people in the U.S. illegally, but it was unclear how quickly he would move while wrestling with the coronavirus pandemic, the economy and other priorities. For advocates, memories were fresh of presidential candidate Barack Obama pledging an immigration bill his first year in office, in 2009, but not tackling the issue until his second term.\\n\\nBiden's plan is the polar opposite of Donald Trump, whose successful 2016 presidential campaign rested in part on curbing or stopping illegal immigration.\\n\\nThis really does represent a historic shift from Trump's anti-immigrant agenda that recognizes that all of the undocumented immigrants that are currently in the United States should be placed on a path to citizenship, said Marielena Hincapie, executive director of the National Immigration Law Center, who was briefed on the bill.\\n\\nIf successful, the legislation would be the biggest move toward granting status to people in the country illegally since President Ronald Reagan bestowed amnesty on nearly 3 million people in 1986. Legislative efforts to overhaul immigration policy failed in 2007 and 2013.\\n\\nRon Klain, Biden's incoming chief of staff, said Saturday that Biden will send an immigration bill to Congress on his first day in office. He didn't elaborate and Biden's office declined to comment on specifics.\\n\\nAdvocates were briefed in recent days on the bill's broad outlines by Esther Olivarria, deputy director for immigration on the White House Domestic Policy Council.\\n\\nDomingo Garcia, former president of the League of Latin American Citizens, said Biden told advocates on a call Thursday that Trump's impeachment trial in the Senate may delay consideration of the bill and that they shouldn't count on passage within 100 days.\\n\\nI was pleasantly surprised that they were going to take quick action because we got the same promises from Obama, who got elected in '08, and he totally failed, Garcia said.\\n\\nAli Noorani, president of the National Immigration Forum and among those briefed Thursday night, said immigrants would be put on an eight-year path to citizenship. There would be a faster track for those in the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which shields people from deportation who came to the country as young children, and Temporary Protected Status, which gives temporary status to hundreds of thousands of people from strife-torn countries, many from El Salvador.\\n\\nVice President-elect Kamala Harris offered similar remarks in an interview with Univision that aired Tuesday, saying DACA and TPS recipients will automatically get green cards while others would be on an eight-year path to citizenship.\\n\\nMore favorable attitudes toward immigration — especially among Democrats — may weigh in Biden's favor this time. A Gallup survey last year found that 34% of those polled favored more immigration, up from 21% in 2016 and higher than any time since it began asking the question in 1965. The survey found 77% felt immigration was good for the country on the whole, up slightly from 72% in 2016.\\n\\nNoorani said the separation of more than 5,000 children from the parents at the border, which peaked in 2018, alienated voters from Trump's policies, particularly conservatives and evangelicals. He believes a constantly shifting outlook for DACA recipients also hurt Trump among people who felt he was using them as political pawns.\\n\\nWhat was seared in their mind was family separation. They took it out on the Republican Party in 2018 and they took it out on Trump in 2020, Noorani said. To put a really fine point on it, they want to end the cruelty of the Trump administration.\\n\\nIt is impossible to know precisely how many people are in the country illegally. Pew Research Center estimates there were 10.5 million in 2017, down from an all-time high of 12.2 million in 2007.\\n\\nThe Homeland Security Department estimates there were 12 million people in the country illegally in 2015, nearly 80% of them for more than 10 years. More than half were Mexican.\\n\\n___\\n\\nAssociated Press writer Zeke Miller in Washington contributed to this report."}
{"original": "Certain jobs will always require staff to remain at their place of work. When we go to a bar or restaurant, we need people there to serve us. When we have oral hygiene concerns, there's no better place than the dentist's office. But for many employees, the option to work from home is fast becoming more desirable -- and economical.\\n\\nNearly four years ago, Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer reversed the tech company's policy on working remotely, forcing all telecommuting employees to head back to the office. Although some industry experts came to Mayer's defense, most called the move shortsighted. Fast-forward to present day, the argument for working from home has only strengthened. And whether you're the employer or employee, the scenario is surprisingly win-win.\\n\\nPROS FOR EMPLOYERS\\n\\nChinese travel website Ctrip recently gave its call center staff the chance to work from home for nine months. The results were impressive. They completed 13.5% more calls per shift, which meant Ctrip garnered an extra day's worth of productivity per employee per week. To boot, morale increased, and the company saved a whopping $1,900 per person each month on furniture, utilities, and parking.\\n\\nCtrip is far from alone with these findings. Several other organizations have dismissed the idea that telecommuting leads to lost revenue and employee apathy. Global Workplace Analytics scoured over 4,000 reports, studies, and articles on the subject. Its conclusion? Employers can dramatically benefit from letting staff work from home, be it full or part time. Some advantages:\\n\\nExpanded talent pool: The quality of hires increases when jobs open up to prospects outside commuting distance. Telecommuting also provides more options to hire workers with disabilities. And let's not overlook the cost of bringing talent to your office: Nortel estimates it regularly saves $100,000 per employee it doesn't have to relocate.\\n\\nLower salaries: Not only do two thirds of people favor working from home, 36% would choose it over a pay raise. In fact, 37% say they'd take a pay cut for the chance to work remotely.\\n\\nReduced attrition: When companies lose quality employees, recruiting and training costs can climb into the thousands of dollars. Not surprisingly, 95% of businesses say working from home significantly improves employee retention.\\n\\nPROS FOR EMPLOYEES\\n\\nSome employees may have concerns about working from home. They may question whether they can properly adapt to such an unfamiliar set-up. Turns out, there's little to worry about:\\n\\nNo more daily slog: Few things in life are despised more than the daily journey to and from work. Telecommuting can put an end to this process, getting rid of travel costs (gas, transit) and freeing up between five and 15 hours per week.\\n\\nMore focus, less stress: Whether it's cramped conditions or intrusive coworkers, offices can be the enemy of productivity. Working from home can not only curb these distractions, it's been proven to reduce stress and enhance overall mood.\\n\\nWork and family can come first: There's a long-held belief that says it's nearly impossible to commit to a career and a family. And although this may have once been true, times have changed. In a recent Microsoft study, nearly one-third of respondents wished they could work from home to spend more time with family. Whether it's allowing workers to keep an eye on the kids or share more face time with a spouse, telecommuting is a simple and effective way to balance work and home.\\n\\nOVERCOMING THE CONS\\n\\nIt would be naive to think working from home doesn't come with its share of obstacles. Fortunately, steps can be taken to smooth out the process:\\n\\nThe issue: Lack of in-person communication and collaboration. Many businesses rely on face-to-face meetings to troubleshoot, provide feedback, and discuss policy changes. Telecommuting has the potential to disrupt this process.\\n\\nThe fix: Mandatory in-office days are an option, allowing companies to round up their entire staff for high-value meetings. (Not to mention team-building social events.) That said, with services like Skype, FaceTime, and various conference call providers, it's easier than ever to keep the lines of communication open. Email and secured instant messaging are also on hand to fill in any gaps, allowing direct collaboration to continue. This approach is particularly helpful to workforces that span numerous time zones: employees can simply reply to a written query when they're back at their desk.\\n\\nThe issue: Concerns employees will perform poorly due to lack of at-home supervision.\\n\\nThe fix: Managers can feel a loss of control when allowing staff to work remotely. But direct oversight is still very achievable. The key is in the metrics. By setting measurable performance targets (e.g. specific sales, customer service, or production outcomes), it's easy to track accountability and boost performance.\\n\\nThe issue: Privacy concerns. Employees working from home can leave businesses vulnerable to everything from data loss to security breaches.\\n\\nThe fix: Although such threats are real, the risks can be minimized. The company's IT department should carefully review all network protocols, and be placed in charge of remote access granted to staff members. On top of this, employees working remotely should attend mandatory security training, and only be given access to databases relevant to their job duties.\\n\\nHOW TO TRY IT ON FOR SIZE\\n\\nAny business considering a work-from-home option needs to know it isn't an all-or-nothing proposition. There's no shame in proceeding with caution before making a firm decision either way. Some options:\\n\\nTest the waters: It's easy to turn a workplace nuisance into a productivity experiment. Has the power gone off in your building? Or maybe you need to assemble a skeleton staff for an upcoming holiday weekend. Why not use such opportunities to let staff work from home? So long as their output can be monitored, you're in a perfect position to see if telecommuting can benefit you (and them).\\n\\nThe rotation solution: Instead of clearing the decks by having everyone work remotely, consider a rotating schedule. This way, a certain percentage of staffers are always under management's watchful eye. Most employees will still relish the opportunity to work from home once or twice a week.\\n\\nPlace emphasis on performance: Here's a low-risk method for ensuring productivity and accountability. Employees who meet weekly or monthly performance targets can continue to work remotely. Those who can't meet agreed-upon goals will be sent back to the office. No fuss, no muss.\\n\\nTHE WORKING FROM HOME TAKEAWAY\\n\\nIf you're looking to diversify your workforce -- or simply outsource projects to third-party development teams -- 2017 is the year to look at the options. Statistically, remote workers are more driven, focused, reliable, and cost-effective than their in-office counterparts. And they're just plain happier to boot. Now that's a win-win scenario."}

{"original": "In a move that was long overdue, the San Francisco school board finally got rid of a discriminatory education policy.\\n\\nThe city's school board voted unanimously on Tuesday to repeal a rule that restricted students of Chinese, Korean, and Japanese descent to an Oriental School in San Francisco's Chinatown ― over a century after it was passed.\\n\\nThe rule had been put into effect in 1906, during an era of growing anti-Asian sentiment. And though it's survived through the years, the rule hasn't been observed for some time. The board, whose district is made up of more than 40 percent Asian students, claims the vote was more of a symbolic one.\\n\\nWe have this really dark part of history in our school district, and it's important to acknowledge that happened, Emily M. Murase, board member and a co-author of the resolution, told the San Francisco Chronicle.\\n\\nIn addition to rescinding the rule, the resolution called for the creation of a mural that will showcase the progress that's been made since that tragic era as well as an increase in Asian-American instructional resources and library books to better reflect the district's demographic make-up. It also pushed for further collaboration with Asian-American community educational organizations.\\n\\nWe want to put some substance to it, which includes knowing about this history, knowing about Asian-American history, Murase explained to NBC.\\n\\nThe repeal has certainly been a long time coming. Shortly after the policy was enacted, the Aoki family challenged it in Aoki vs. Deane, when they protested Redding Elementary School principal's refusal to admit their child. The board sided against them.\\n\\nThe case drummed up so much controversy that the Japanese government expressed outrage. President Theodore Roosevelt ended up summoning the San Francisco mayor and Board of Education to the White House in an attempt to repair relations with Japan.\\n\\nIt resulted in the Gentlemen's Agreement, which, in part, allowed students of Japanese ancestry to attend white schools. Aoki's case was also dismissed and settled out of court. However, those of Chinese and Korean descent remained restricted to the Oriental school ― something that continued on paper until the repeal.\\n\\nKen Maley, a local historian, says that the repeal, though symbolic, was necessary. It is especially so for the students who would have been affected by it at one point.\\n\\nThere's no hiding from the past, Maley told the San Francisco Chronicle.

{"original": "Christopher Furlong via Getty Images\\n\\nJeremy Corbyn's mission to hand more power to Labour members has received a major boost after the party's ruling body agreed his sweeping reform plans. The leader's plan to 'democratise' the party was approved by the National Executive Committee (NEC) on Tuesday, and will now go forward for a vote at the annual conference in Brighton. Under the changes, party members are set to get three extra seats on the 35-strong body, with an extra place for trade unions too. The move will further embed Corbyn's vision for Labour and underline its leftward direction since he became leader in 2015, attracting more than 250,000 new members to the party. His reform package, which included a plan to reduce MPs' veto over future leadership contenders, was adopted by the NEC with no opposition. A wider review of party structures, to be led by former MP Katy Clark, will now take place with everything from one-member-one-vote leadership rules to regional structures and new policy-making powers. The only reform not on the review list is mandatory reselection of MPs.\\n\\nLabour The priority items in the review.\\n\\nFresh moves to create more female Labour MPs were also set to be adopted, with more all-women shortlists for Parliamentary selections ahead of any snap general election. A new plan to crack down on anti-semitic and racist abuse was also approved. Expanding the NEC to include 39 members is a key move in ensuring it reflects the Corbyn-supporting membership. At present, just six seats are reserved for Constituency Labour Party (CLP) representatives, while 12 go to trade unions. Under the changes, there will be nine CLP reps, and an extra union seat, to reflect shopworkers' union Usdaw's large membership. Key ally and Momentum founder Jon Lansman told the Indepdendent this week: Out of 35 members, half a million members have just six representatives. It's absurd.\\n\\nPA Wire/PA Images Jeremy Corbyn and office director Karie Murphy after the June election.\\n\\nThe ruling body also backed moves to reshape the annual conference to give more debate time for the rank and file, and less for Shadow Cabinet ministers. As reported by HuffPost UK, neither London Mayor Sadiq Khan nor Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham will have speaking slots on the platform in Brighton. The NEC was until this summer finely balanced between pro-Corbyn and 'moderate' wings of the party, but it is now set to shift much more in his favour. Under a 'compromise' plan first revealed by HuffPost UK this month, the proportion of MPs and MEPs needed for a leadership bid would be reduced from the current 15% threshold to 10%. The change in rules - first proposed by the TSSA transport union - all but guarantees that Corbyn's successor will be from the Left, as it lowers the bar for the Parliamentary Labour Party's (PLP) veto on candidates. At present, 42 Parliamentarians are needed for any new leadership candidate, but if the change gets the go ahead, just 28 nominations will be required. Once MEPs are abolished after Brexit in 2019, just 26 MPs' nominations will be needed.\\n\\nPA Archive/PA Images Tom Watson and Jeremy Corbyn.\\n\\nIn a significant shift, deputy leader Tom Watson told Corbyn in July that he would not stand in his way on party reform, although allies warned the leadership to focus on taking on the Tories than 'faction fighting'. Katy Clark, who is now Corbyn's political secretary, will lead the wide-ranging structural review. A senior source at grassroots group Momentum told HuffPost UK: The review is a very promising first step towards a Labour Party that is election ready and fit for the 21st century. I'm sure the 500,000 members who showed such energy, enthusiasm and dedication during the last election will welcome having more of a say, and we're glad that every wing of the party is recognising the huge contribution they make. But Richard Angell, director of Progress, Labour's centrist pressure group, said: Today, Labour's new establishment bounced the NEC in private session into a series of reforms that amount to a factional power grab and more roles for members in London and the south-east. It is a missed opportunity to not give members in every corner of the country a voice by regionalising the NEC. In a bizarre turn of events Corbyn's political secretary will be leading a review into party structures rather than working out how to beat the Tories and run the country. It is a warped set of priorities when a general election could take place at any point.\\n\\nPete Willsman Labour NEC member Pete Willsman\\n\\nThe NEC meeting on Tuesday was not without debate, with member Pete Willsman, of the Campaign for Labour Party Democracy (CLPD), at one point declaring that some of our MPs deserve to be attacked for disloyalty.

The Government is at its weakest after seven years of damage to the country, and my inbox is full of resident's worries about police and crime. And some people are just determined to foster division with infighting instead.

{"original": "The Trump administration has repeatedly pointed to declines in U.S. carbon emissions to justify its fossil fuel-focused energy dominance agenda. But a new analysis has delivered a blow to that defense, concluding that the nation's greenhouse gas emissions rose sharply in 2018.\\n\\nEmissions in the country jumped 3.4 percent last year, the second largest annual increase in more than two decades, according to a preliminary estimate by the economic research company Rhodium Group.\\n\\nThe analysis comes on the heels of two gut-wrenching climate reports, one by the United Nations and another authored by scientists from more than a dozen federal agencies in the U.S., that warn the world is running out of time to stave off catastrophic, and potentially irreversible, climate change.\\n\\nThe Trump administration continues to dismiss and downplay the crisis. I don't believe it, President Donald Trump, who has a long history of climate change denial, said of his own administration's report. He added that we're the cleanest we've ever been.\\n\\nBetween 2005 and 2017, CO2 emissions in the U.S. fell by about 14 percent. Administration officials have touted these declines to explain their push to boost fossil fuels, as well as to defend the president's decision last year to withdraw the U.S. from the historic Paris accord on combating climate change.\\n\\nAt a Dec. 11 briefing on the Environmental Protection Agency's proposal to gut an Obama-era clean water rule, acting EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler credited Trump's leadership for a 2.7 percent reduction in CO2 emissions from 2016 and 2017.\\n\\nWe are moving forward, but we are not moving forward in a detrimental impact to our economy as what the Paris climate accord would have called for, Wheeler said. We are reducing our CO2 emissions faster than most other developed countries. We have our own plan. We're moving forward. We're addressing the issue.\\n\\nFormer Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, who resigned Jan. 2 under a cloud of ethics scandals, told the National Petroleum Council last month that the administration's regulatory philosophy is to partner with the fossil fuel sector, which he said was at the leading edge of technology. The U.S. has lead the charge in cutting emissions of CO2 and methane, a potent greenhouse gas, he added.\\n\\nWe're doing the right thing, Zinke said. But it's a narrative that's very difficult to get across.\\n\\nZinke repeated this defense in a parting interview last month with Fox News' Bret Baier.\\n\\nEveryone else is up, he said, referring to other countries' overall emissions. We're going down while we have our record-breaking oil and gas production.\\n\\nThe U.S. was already off track in meeting its Paris Agreement targets. The gap is even wider headed into 2019. Rhodium Group analysis\\n\\nBut as Rhodium Group's new analysis makes clear, that was not the case in 2018. The emissions uptick ― the largest since the economic bounce back from the recession that ended in mid-2009 ― comes despite a record number of coal-fired power plants going offline, replaced largely by the use of natural gas.\\n\\nAlong with an 1.9 percent spike in power sector emissions, increases occurred in the transportation, industry and buildings sectors, according to Rhodium. Contributing to the overall increase were the growing U.S. economy, a cold start to the year that required additional energy for heating, and the limited progress made in developing decarbonization strategies, the analysis found.\\n\\nThe U.S. was already off track in meeting its Paris Agreement targets, it stated. The gap is even wider headed into 2019.\\n\\nResponding to Rhodium's analysis, May Boeve, executive director of climate advocacy group 350.org, stressed that the Trump administration energy and environmental policies come with consequences.\\n\\nWith a new Congress in session, we demand they heed these warnings (about climate change) and step up to act at the scale of the crisis, she said in a statement.\\n\\nThe administration has aggressively rolled back environmental and climate regulations, including President Barack Obama's Clean Power Plan, a policy limiting greenhouse gas emissions from power plants. At Interior, Zinke overturned an Obama-era moratorium on new coal leases on federal land, scrapped a hydraulic fracturing rule meant to better protect public health and curtailed a rule limiting the amount of methane that can be released from oil and gas operations on federal and Native American lands.\\n\\nEven amid the current partial government shutdown, the administration has prioritized fossil fuels. The Interior Department, one of the main agencies affected by the shutdown. is still issuing permits for oil companies, according to Bloomberg. And the agency is continuing its push to open Alaska's fragile Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to drilling, holding public meetings as part of its ongoing environmental review process, Alaska Public Media reported."}
{"original": "Anushree Fadnavis / Reuters Demonstrator display placards and shout slogans during a protest against a new citizenship law, in New Delhi, India, December 19, 2019. REUTERS/Anushree Fadnavis\\n\\nMUMBAI — The Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI), the apex body for India's telecom industry and considered to be the industry's official voice, has criticised the Modi government's policy of internet shutdowns in the wake of country wide protests against the controversial Citizenship Amendment Act.\\n\\nRajan Mathews, Director General of the association, which includes operators such as Reliance Jio, Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea, told HuffPost India that the industry was surprised by the cavalier fashion in which the government had issued recent shutdown orders, and called on the government to review the policy.\\n\\nThis is not the first time that the internet has been used as a way to control protests or unrests, but we have approached [The Ministry of Communications] asking it to not use internet shutdowns as the first line of defence in these situations, Mathews said. The general consensus among major telecom operators is that the industry does not want the use of this policy in a cavalier fashion. We have been raising this issue with the government.\\n\\nFor the latest news and more, follow HuffPost India on Twitter, Facebook, and subscribe to our newsletter.\\n\\nInstances of internet shutdowns have increased exponentially since 2014 when Prime Minister Narendra Modi's first term began. The government shut down the internet 106 times in 2019 as compared to just 6 times in 2014, according to Internet Shutdown Tracker, a portal which tracks such incidents across the country.\\n\\nMost of these shutdowns have happened in Jammu & Kashmir, where the information blackout has now entered its fifth month — the longest recorded internet shutdown for a democracy globally. This most recent Kashmir blockade began on August 5, 2019 shortly before the Indian government abrogated Kashmir's autonomy and statehood. On October 14, the government allowed some leeway by restoring postpaid phone connections in the valley with curbs still in place for mobile internet.\\n\\nBut on October 20, the Apex Advisory Council for Telecom in India—a joint industry initiative backed by COAI—dispatched a letter to Ajay Kumar Bhalla, Home Secretary in the Ministry of Home Affairs, questioning the merit behind the decision.\\n\\nThe council called the decision to restore postpaid connections while maintaining curbs on prepaid connections manifestly arbitrary, saying that it will lead to serious financial and economic losses for the member operators. Both prepaid and postpaid consumers were subject to the same stringent identification and address verification norms as mandated by the Department of Telecom, the letter noted.\\n\\nThe council requested the ministry to lift curbs on both prepaid and postpaid connections, even offering an explanation in person if required by the ministry. The ministry didn't respond to the letter.\\n\\nCOAI has also informally conveyed its reservations regarding a prolonged internet shutdown in Kashmir to the DoT, Mathews said.\\n\\nSince 2016, Mathews said, the COAI has consistently written to the Department of Telecom asking for a review of the policy of internet shutdowns, which the association maintains has considerable economic costs — both for the industry and millions of customers accessing basic services. The association has never received a response by the DoT either.\\n\\nThe COAI estimates Indian telecom companies are losing close to Rs 2.45 crore for an hour of internet shutdown, which, it maintains, would doubly hurt companies at a time when the sector is piling on losses and remains under financial stress after a Supreme Court order in October asking the telecom companies to pay overdue licensing fee amounting to $13 billion.\\n\\nBut Mathews says that the effect of internet shutdowns could be more profound on common people.\\n\\nIn an increasingly integrated society where more and more people look to the internet for their livelihood, shutting it down becomes a serious issue. We have always said that internet shutdowns—given the increasing dependence of various forms of commerce and service deliver—ought not to be the very first line of defence in any situation. It should be used very carefully, Mathews said.\\n\\nSOPA Images via Getty Images A 'No Signal' notification displayed on a smartphone during the shutdown in Srinagar.\\n\\nTemporary Suspension Provision\\n\\nTo shut down the internet, the government relies on the Temporary Suspension of Telecom Services (Public Emergency or Public Safety) Rules of 2017 that were inserted into the Indian Telegraph Act, 1885 by a gazetted notification dated August 2017.\\n\\nThese rules place the onus of the final authority on internet shutdowns with the home secretary at the Ministry of Home Affairs, or the secretary to state government in charge of home department or an officer not below the rank of joint secretary to the government of India.\\n\\nBut despite the above rules, which were enacted without public consultations and notified without public access to the published draft, the frequency of internet shutdowns have increased in the country mostly owing to lax oversight and few safeguards.\\n\\nOn December 19, in response to protests against CAA in the city, the government shutdown the internet in parts of New Delhi for the first time.\\n\\nMathews was surprised. So were senior executives at the telecom companies.\\n\\nI think it took a lot of us by surprise. And not just because it is the capital city, Mathews said. But the fact that these notices have been a longstanding requirement in the terms and conditions of telecom licenses - so if the government gives us any orders for internet shutdowns, we are obligated to comply otherwise our licenses could come under scrutiny even leading to possible cancellations.\\n\\nBut if a big telecom operator defied the government's notice for internet shutdown, would the government still threaten to cancel its telecom license despite the risk of disrupting millions of mobile customers?\\n\\nThe government can do it, Mathews said. And it could begin with a host of severe penalties for non compliance with T&Cs of the license at the time when the telecom companies are already reeling under a financial stress.\\n\\nThe policy is always to comply with such orders. Look, we can't defy a sovereign order if our licenses are under a sovereign government - So even if we do not agree with an order, we have to comply with it.\\n\\nMathews said that the government should seriously consider a cost-benefit analysis of this policy and called for more investment in better intelligence gathering by upgrading security infrastructure in relatively poorer states. He also asked the government to minimise the impact of internet shutdowns on common people by making its execution more granular in nature.\\n\\nBut more importantly, what we need at the moment is a post-facto evaluation of how effective are these internet shutdowns.\\n\\nThus far, the government is yet to publicly clarify if it has conducted any official evaluation of the effectiveness of this policy.\\n\\nResearch by Stanford's Jan Rydzak, who has closely studied the impact of internet and communication shutdowns in India, indicates there is no evidence to suggest that internet shutdowns quell protests or check violence.\\n\\nIn an interview to HuffPost India in September, Rydzak called for an urgent assessment of this policy's effectiveness by the government.\\n\\nDespite hundreds of internet shutdowns at this point in Kashmir and other states, there have been no impact assessments or evaluations of its effectiveness by either the state or central governments, Rydzak told Huffpost India in September. So that begs the question of whether they are not publishing these impact assessments because they don't know the effects or because they know that internet shutdowns don't work."}
{"original": "WASHINGTON (AP) — By the time President Donald Trump first spoke publicly about the coronavirus, it may already have been too late.\\n\\nInterviewed at Davos, a gathering of global elites in the Swiss Alps, the president on Jan. 22 played down the threat posed by the respiratory virus from China, which had just reached American shores in the form of a solitary patient in Washington state.\\n\\nWe have it totally under control, Trump said on CNBC. It's one person coming in from China, and we have it under control. It's going to be just fine.\\n\\nIn the 11 weeks since that interview, the coronavirus has reached every corner of the globe. It has infected more than 500,000 Americans and killed at least 20,000. It has rewritten the rules of society, isolated people in their homes, closed schools, devastated the economy and put millions out of work.\\n\\nWhen Trump spoke in Switzerland, weeks' worth of warning signs already had been raised. In the ensuing month, before the president first addressed the crisis from the White House, key steps to prepare the nation for the coming pandemic were not taken.\\n\\nLife-saving medical equipment was not stockpiled. Travel largely continued unabated. Vital public health data from China was not provided or was deemed untrustworthy. A White House riven by rivalries and turnover was slow to act. Urgent warnings were ignored by a president consumed by his impeachment trial and intent on protecting a robust economy that he viewed as central to his reelection chances.\\n\\nTwenty current and former administration officials and Republicans close to the White House were interviewed for this account about the critical weeks lost before the president spoke to the nation on Feb. 26. Most spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about private discussions.\\n\\nASSOCIATED PRESS President Donald Trump speaks during a coronavirus task force briefing at the White House, Friday, April 10, 2020, in Washington. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci)\\n\\n'MYSTERIOUS PNEUMONIA'\\n\\nOn New Year's Eve, China informed the World Health Organization of a mysterious pneumonia outbreak spreading through Wuhan, an industrial city of 11 million.\\n\\nThe government closed a seafood market at the center of the outbreak, moved all patients with the virus to a specially designated hospital and collected test samples to send to government laboratories. Doctors were told to stay quiet; one who issued a warning online was punished. He later died of the virus.\\n\\nThe Pentagon first learned about the new coronavirus in December from open source reports emanating from China. By early January, warnings about the virus had made their way into intelligence reports circulating around the government. On Jan. 3, the head of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Robert Redfield, received a call from his Chinese counterpart with an official warning.\\n\\nDr. Anthony Fauci, the government's top infectious disease expert, was alerted to the virus around the same time — and within two weeks was fearful it could bring global catastrophe.\\n\\nQuickly, U.S. intelligence and public health officials began doubting China's reported rates of infection and death toll. They pressed China to allow in U.S. epidemiologists — both to assist the country in confronting the spread and to gain valuable insights that could help buy time for the U.S. response. U.S. officials also pressed China to send samples of the virus to U.S. labs for study and for vaccine and test development.\\n\\nOn Jan. 11, China shared the virus' genetic sequence. That same day, the National Institutes of Health started working on a vaccine.\\n\\nUltimately, the U.S. was able to get China's consent to send two people on the WHO team that traveled to China later in the month. But by then precious weeks had been lost and the virus had raced across Asia and had begun to escape the continent.\\n\\nBALANCING ACT\\n\\nFor much of January, administration officials were doing a delicate balancing act.\\n\\nInternally, they were raising alarms about the need to get Americans on the ground in China. Publicly, they were sending words of encouragement and praise in hopes Beijing would grant the Americans access.\\n\\nMatthew Pottinger, Trump's deputy national security adviser, persistently urged more aggressive action in calling out China and sending teams there.\\n\\nBut while word of the virus was included in several of the president's intelligence briefings, Trump wasn't fully briefed on the threat until Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar called with an update on Jan. 18 while the president was at his private Mar-a-Lago club in Florida.\\n\\nTrump spent much of the conversation wanting to talk about vaping; he was considering a new policy restricting its use. White House officials now believe Trump didn't fully grasp the magnitude of the threat to the U.S. in part because Azar, who was feuding with several members of Trump's inner circle, did a poor job communicating it.\\n\\nAzar was trying to walk a fine line between Trump's upbeat statements and preparing the government for what might lie ahead. America's risk is low at the moment, he later told House lawmakers. That could change quickly.\\n\\nMoreover, the president was in the middle of his Senate impeachment trial and focused on little else, punctuating nearly every White House meeting with complaints about the Democrats out to get him, grievances he would continue late into the night on the phone from his private quarters.\\n\\nTrump also had little desire to pressure Beijing or criticize its president, Xi Jinping, with whom he wanted to secure cooperation on ending a yearlong trade war before the reelection campaign kicked into high gear. When Trump fielded his first question about the virus in Davos, he enthusiastically praised Xi's response, going well beyond the calibrated risk-reward messaging his aides were encouraging.\\n\\nINFIGHTING\\n\\nThe West Wing was adrift.\\n\\nBy late January, acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney held the post in name only as rumors swirled of his impending, post-impeachment departure. He was on the initial coronavirus task force, which was plagued with infighting. At the same time, the White House Office of Management and Budget was clashing with Azar's HHS over money to combat the virus.\\n\\nHHS wanted to send a special coronavirus funding request to Congress but the White House budget office resisted for weeks, insisting that HHS should instead repurpose $250 million of its existing budget to bolster the national stockpile by buying protective equipment. HHS, however, claimed that without congressional authorization it could not buy the needed quantities of masks, gowns and ventilators to rapidly bolster the national stockpile\\n\\nEventually, an initial request went to Congress for $2.5 billion in virus aid, an amount that lawmakers of both parties dismissed as too low. The bill that Congress quickly passed and Trump signed — the first of three so far — was for $8 billion.\\n\\nEven as the two agencies fought, there was no influential voice in Trump's orbit pushing him to act swiftly on the pandemic. Trump had surrounded himself with loyalists and few in the administration, including national security adviser Robert O'Brien, were able to redirect the president's attention. In mid-January, meetings were being held at the White House, but the focus was on getting U.S. government employees back from China, which was still playing down how contagious the virus was.\\n\\nA Jan. 29 memo from senior White House aide Peter Navarro accurately predicted some of the challenges faced by the U.S. from what would become a pandemic, though he was hardly the first to sound the alarm. But he, like Pottinger, was viewed by others in the White House as a China hawk and their concerns were rejected by others in the administration who did not bring them to the president.\\n\\nOn Jan. 30, the WHO declared the virus a global health emergency while Trump held a packed campaign rally in Iowa. The next day, the Trump administration banned admittance to the United States by foreign nationals who had traveled to China in the past 14 days, excluding the immediate family members of American citizens or permanent residents.\\n\\nTrump styled it as bold action, but continued to talk down the severity of the threat. Despite the ban, nearly 40,000 people have arrived in the United States on direct flights from China since that date, according to an analysis by The New York Times.\\n\\n'VERY, VERY READY'\\n\\nOn Feb. 10, Trump stood before thousands of supporters packed into a New Hampshire rally and declared: By April, you know, in theory, when it gets a little warmer, it miraculously goes away.\\n\\nThe crowd roared its approval at Trump's unproven assertion. The Senate had acquitted Trump on the impeachment charges and the president shifted his focus toward reelection even as others in the administration keyed in on the virus.\\n\\nFederal officials put the CDC solely in charge of developing a test for the virus and left out private interests, a choice that cost precious time when the resulting CDC test proved faulty.\\n\\nTrump spent many weeks shuffling responsibility for leading his administration's response to the crisis. He put Azar in charge of the administration's virus task force before replacing him with Vice President Mike Pence toward the end of February. Even as the virus spread across the globe, prevailing voices in the White House, including senior adviser Jared Kushner and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, urged the president to avoid big steps that could roil financial markets.\\n\\nThe president had firmly linked his fate to Wall Street, and it took a tumble by the markets for Trump to ratchet up his response. In late February, while Trump was on a trip to India, the Dow Jones plummeted 1,000 points amid rising fears about the coronavirus.\\n\\nTrump stewed about the collapse on his Feb. 26 flight back to Washington and lashed out at aides over comments made by a top CDC official, Dr. Nancy Messonnier, during a briefing the prior day, when she warned Americans that they would have to prepare for fairly severe social distancing.\\n\\nIt's not so much of a question of if this will happen anymore but rather more of a question of exactly when this will happen, she said.\\n\\nThe White House announced that Pence would brief the media about the response that night. But Trump took the podium instead and has not relinquished the stage much since, belatedly making himself the face of the battle against the virus.\\n\\nWhen Trump first took the lectern in the White House briefing room to speak about the virus, the U.S. had 15 coronavirus patients.\\n\\nWe're at that very low level, and we want to keep it that way, Trump said. We're very, very ready for this.\\n\\n___\\n\\nLemire reported from New York. Associated Press writers Deb Riechmann, Kevin Freking and Lauran Neergaard also contributed to this report."}

The principles for which he advocated may be applied across to women and to members of other ethnic, racial, and sexual minority groups. Dreaming of peace and security within the institutional framework under which we exist -- the law -- should not be unrealistic. For members of more privileged populations this has been less of an issue, but there still are important populations of American democracy who struggle with access to equal opportunities and protection under the law.\\n\\nWhile there have been a variety of additions and enhancement to US economic and social policy since Women's suffrage in the 1920s and the rise of civil rights activism for ethnic and racial minorities beginning in the 1950s, there still are a number of items that must be addressed so that the foundations on which historically disadvantaged groups may be established more consistently. Social and economic policy took a somewhat sharp conservative turn in the 1980s, and with it slowed down the environmental policy-making progress typified in the 1970s. During this time, despite the advances, environmental conservation was missing in social and economic policies. Social and economic issues, while provided as reasons for various environmental policies like the Clean Water Act and the Clean Air Act, mostly paid lip service to social and economic issues.\\n\\nDespite this, there have been some sound adjustments to social and economic policies over the past 20 years. There are still some fairly significant issues that that must be addressed, such as fair pay and appropriate taxing, but we cannot ignore the interwoven complexities posed by environmental issues. And, as we design or redesign environmental policy, we would do very well to include the needs of communities traditionally marginalized by dominant society. As participants in democracy, we are endowed with certain rights and liberties with which faulty environmental policies may infringe. We often see this happen in neighborhoods, communities, and municipalities where its residents live in poverty.\\n\\nAs we continue to address and mitigate various economic and social issues afflicting our fellow American citizens, we need to think more holistically. Because we have an economic system based on our natural resources, many economic policies should have an environmental component. Our social institutions exist in relation to one another and to both our economic system and the ecosystem, so the natural environment should be a consideration in the development of social policy as well. Including the environment into social and economic policies and understanding these intricacies will help us to build healthier communities, respect diverse cultures and peoples, and promote meaningful economic development."}

Think the rule of law is important? Prosecute powerful people when they commit crimes. Even people who worked for a president. Even a former president.\\n\\nThe story of 21st-century America is complex, but the narrative of powerful people behaving terribly and getting away with it is arguably the common thread. Consider the illegal torture operations of George W. Bush, Dick Cheney and John Yoo. Reflect on the financial frauds perpetrated by Wall Street bankers and foreclosure mills last decade (they're not exactly complying with the law this decade, either). Contemplate the big lies of fossil fuel executives like Exxon chair turned Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. Think about the violations of consent decrees, tax laws and antitrust statutes by the likes of Mark Zuckerberg, Sheryl Sandberg and the rest of Silicon Valley. Reckon with the horrifying conduct brought front and center by #MeToo. And then come to terms with the number of the aforementioned elites whose potential criminal liability has been taken seriously by prosecutors ― approximately zero.\\n\\nThis is all the evidence you need to see how things are likely to go whenever the Trump administration meets its demise.\\n\\nThere will be the inevitable establishment calls to look forward and not behind. Elites of all stripes will argue for the president's successor to allow Trump and his accomplices to avoid legal accountability for everything from the Trump Foundation scam to conspiring with Russian agents.\\n\\nThe story of 21st-century America is complex, but the narrative of powerful people behaving terribly and getting away with it is arguably the common thread.\\n\\nOne can already imagine the Washington Post editorial board's calls to remember how Gerald Ford pardoned Richard Nixon and healed the country, setting aside the fact that failing to prosecute Nixon for a wide swath of violations far beyond merely covering up political espionage undoubtedly encouraged future presidents to think they are above the law.\\n\\nIndeed, few of the generally hagiographic obituaries of George H.W. Bush mentioned his lame-duck pardons of senior Reagan and Bush administration officials to foil the special counsel's investigation into serious criminality (including potentially Bush's own) in the Iran-Contra affair.\\n\\nTrump, who has spent a lifetime stretching (and seemingly bursting) the legal limits on tax avoidance, money laundering, housing discrimination, deceptive consumer practices and sexual assault, ran a presidential campaign that represents the apotheosis of elites breaking laws to achieve massive gains. Since taking office, Trump has plausibly been implicated in a broad array of crimes, including breaking campaign finance rules, violating state and national tax laws, conspiring to violate the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, and of course, obstructing justice.\\n\\nShould Trump's successor, be it Mike Pence or a Democrat, pardon Trump? How should New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) and other state and local officials treat Trump as well as his children and cronies who seem exceedingly likely to have acted in a manner that warrants prosecution?\\n\\nThat Americans no longer trust their institutions or elites should not be a source of wonderment ― it should be seen as a rational response to the declining trustworthiness of the people with the most power in this country. If with great power comes great responsibility, then why is our criminal justice system so focused on jailing poor people for being unable to pay fines for modest offenses or nonviolent drug possession?\\n\\nA just America would seek, first and foremost, to hold the most powerful Americans to account.\\n\\nThere is a reason that Equal Justice Under Law is carved into the physical architecture of the Supreme Court above its primary west entrance. Far, far too often, America has not been a society where we are all actually subject to law equally. And yet the notion that politicians and billionaires are supposed to be the same under the law as the poor and the oppressed is a powerful principle. This aspiration is necessary for the development of a sense of community and has served as a powerful impetus for America becoming generally less unfair over time.\\n\\nWhen the idea of equality under the law is breached serially and nearly irrevocably, that sense of commonality fractures. We won't be able to address our many challenges ― for instance, a Green New Deal ― as an actually *united* United States unless we can create a sense that the rule of law applies to all equally.\\n\\nChip Somodevilla via Getty Images Barack Obama's governance strategy of burying the broadly accepted failures of the Bush presidency created a path for Bush's enablers in Congress to secure historic victories in the 2010 midterms.\\n\\nIn 2009, then president-elect Obama expressed a belief that we need to look forward as opposed to looking backwards in previewing his administration's free pass to George W. Bush alumni. That view was at odds with a commitment to justice, since, by its very nature, justice is always retrospective ― crimes are committed, criminals are charged, juries or judges weigh the evidence and proceed to punish (or not) accordingly.\\n\\nThe view was also a political calamity ― Obama's governance strategy of burying the broadly accepted failures of the Bush presidency created a path for Bush's enablers in Congress to secure historic victories in the 2010 midterms. And the Obama administration's failure to prosecute bankers and other elites responsible for economic cataclysm added fuel to the fire of resentment that led so many Americans to the tea party, and ultimately, Trumpism.\\n\\nBut an argument for accountability is not principally about politics. If Pence or a Democratic successor follows in the footsteps of presidents Ford or Obama, they will be continuing a cycle of nonaccountability for the powerful. They will be helping cynicism flower anew.\\n\\nDemocrats and their candidates should resolve now to end the cycle of injustice that allows the powerful to shield themselves from the consequences of their actions. It should be a litmus test for any aspiring Trump opponent to commit to governing under the principle of equal justice for all and to empowering prosecutors to go where the evidence takes them.\\n\\nThe end of Trumpism will not be when Trump is defeated at the polls or even when he is impeached. It will be when America comes together as a nation and acts to ensure that elites like Trump who transgress against our shared laws suffer consequences proportionate to their actions.\\n\\n\\n\\nJeff Hauser is the executive director of the Revolving Door Project at the Center for Economic Policy and Research."}

Canada's CTV and Reuters later confirmed the CBC's reporting.\\n\\nThe Keystone XL pipeline has been deeply controversial for more than a decade and faced a litany of legal challenges. If completed, it would carry up to 830,000 barrels of crude oil from Canada's tar sands into Nebraska, where it would then be ferried to refineries along the Gulf of Mexico.

Through hand gestures and the bits of English he understood, I learned he had moved just six months earlier from Mexico to my small Midwestern town. He primarily spoke Spanish and was doing his best to learn a new language in a country that was completely foreign to him. I knew some Spanish from taking classes in high school but I hadn't used it in a long time. I had never even met someone that was from Mexico until I met him.\\n\\nJavier was sleeping in a tent in the living room of an apartment that he shared with four other Mexican guys. They were all cooks at the local Mexican restaurant. He worked seven days a week for nearly 12 hours a day. He had not had a day off in six months, which meant he had worked every single day since moving to America.\\n\\nMeeting someone new is always scary and exciting, but being unable to communicate as well as or in the ways you normally would makes it so much more intense. You soon begin to realize that every word has more meaning, every touch has more purpose. I gave Javier my number and I left the bar wondering if we would ever speak again. Our understanding of each other seemed too small or too difficult, but I couldn't shake the feeling that I had met someone who was meant to be in my life. And, sure enough, the next day he called and asked me out on a date. I hadn't stopped thinking about him from the moment I met him, so, of course, I agreed immediately.\\n\\nThe following Friday night, Javier picked me up for our date. I was so nervous. I had been practicing Spanish online; taking quizzes, trying to refresh my memory with what little Spanish I knew from when I was a teen. Our plan was to go to the Mexican restaurant where he worked, and he promised me that we would have a great time. I later learned that he had to pay a friend $50 to cover his shift so he could get off work and take me out.\\n\\nEven though we'd only known each other for a few hours, on the drive to the restaurant I felt his intensity in every word he said and every look he gave me, and I could already feel myself falling for him.\\n\\nJavier was sleeping in a tent in the living room of an apartment that he shared with four other Mexican guys. They were all cooks at the local Mexican restaurant. He worked seven days a week for nearly 12 hours a day. He had not had a day off in six months.\\n\\nSuddenly flashing lights appeared behind us and we realized we were being pulled over. Panicking, Javier looked at me and said, No tengo papeles, or I don't have papers.\\n\\nWhat do you mean!? I asked confused and scared.\\n\\nWith tears in his eyes, he grabbed my hand and told me, Soy ilegal ― I am illegal.\\n\\nI was stunned.\\n\\nAs the police officer approached the car, I saw beads of sweat starting to form on Javier's face. His breathing intensified as his grip on my hand tightened. Apparently, one of the car's tail lights was out. I soon learned it wasn't even his car ― he was borrowing it from a friend to impress me. He also didn't have a driver's license or insurance.\\n\\nThe officer berated Javier in front of me and I did my best to translate what he was saying. Thankfully ― and shockingly ― he let us go with a warning. He must have pitied us, his eyes flickering back and forth between us as I tried to communicate what he was saying to Javier. I couldn't believe he was just letting us go, and I wanted to get out of there as quickly as possible before he changed his mind. As we drove away (I was now behind the wheel since I had a valid license), I asked: Does this happen to you a lot? You must be constantly living in fear.\\n\\nI am, he replied.\\n\\nFast-forward three years. Javier and I welcomed a beautiful baby girl four months ago and we couldn't be happier about it. However, his uncertain legal status has affected every single moment and detail of our lives over the last 36 months.\\n\\nSince the moment we became a couple, I've felt like I'm constantly looking over my shoulder, and I spend every waking moment (and many of my dreaming ones too) petrified by the fear of Javier being discovered. I wake up each morning terrified for him over whom or what he might encounter that day, and I go to sleep thanking God he returned home to me and our daughter.\\n\\nBeing with Javier has cost me more than I can explain. I have lost the respect of people I love because of his legal status. I have lost friendships simply because he is undocumented. I have had people I once considered friends threaten to get him deported after they'd had one too many drinks. My relationship with my father has been severely strained because he doubts Javier's intentions and constantly questions his motives. We must keep many parts of our lives ― and our life together ― hidden for fear of what might happen if the wrong people learned about Javier. In fact, our real names and any identifying characteristics had to be omitted from this article to protect us. We can't share photos of our family ― not even a single picture of our beautiful daughter ― because the risk of what could happen to us is too great.\\n\\nWe know we are never truly safe. We know we must always keep our guard up. We've been forced to formulate an emergency plan in case ICE shows up at our door. We have to keep a bag filled with essentials and a couple hundred dollars in the closet so we can attempt to escape at a minute's notice if necessary.\\n\\nWe know we are never truly safe. We know we must always keep our guard up. We've been forced to formulate an emergency plan in case Immigration and Customs Enforcement shows up at our door. We have to keep a bag filled with essentials and a couple hundred dollars in the closet so we can attempt to escape at a minute's notice if necessary. We're aware of other individuals who've been discovered, and now they are facing active deportation orders and their families have been ripped apart. Recently, an acquaintance of ours was taken into custody by ICE and sent to a detention center. His daughter tried to kill herself that same night. I can't stop myself from wondering if Javier is next.\\n\\nI found out I was pregnant on one of the coldest days of the year. Instead of being happy, I cried tears of white-hot fear. How could we bring a child into this world knowing that their father could be deported at any time? When I shared the news with Javier, he was overjoyed, but I know he wished he could obtain the same security and opportunities his daughter would have when she was born.\\n\\nIf Javier were to be deported, it wouldn't just destroy his life, it would destroy the lives of people who need him and depend on him most: his infant daughter, who has just started to smile, and his family in Mexico, including a sister who has Down syndrome, his sweet abuela, who has begun to show signs of dementia, and his other daughter. All of them rely on him for support ― financial and emotional ― and for him, the risk he's taking being in this country is worth it.\\n\\nSending money to home to Mexico has allowed his daughter there to attend the best schools. His sister is able to avoid living in an institution and instead can remain comfortable at home with their mother serving as her caretaker. While his life may not be easy or fun, and the stress and fear that follows him ― and my daughter and me ― each and every moment of every day is overwhelming to say the least, the chance to provide a better life for his family is one he feels he must take.\\n\\nWhen people ask me why we're not married (which they do constantly), my usual response is, We would be if we could be. Unfortunately, it's just not that easy. We are currently working with an immigration attorney, but Javier's case is complicated and having a lawyer is expensive. Because Javier entered this country without documentation, he would need to reenter the United States with documentation in order for us to get married. However, if the government finds out he's lived in America without documentation, he could be barred from the United States for 10 years before he could attempt to legally enter. That would mean he'd be forced to live in Mexico for at least a decade without me or his daughter. It would also mean losing the income he's currently bringing in, which is roughly triple what he would make working outside the United States.\\n\\nSo doing things the right way might just be the wrong way. Some days we want to get married. Other days we want things to stay the same as they are now. It's a constant battle of weighing every one of the risks we're facing ― risks that have intensified as we now have an infant daughter ― and trying to determine the best path forward. No matter what we do, one thing remains the same: The stress and uncertainty we are grappling with is wreaking havoc on our relationship. If I'm being totally honest, there are days when I just want to walk away from my life, but I won't and I know that Javier won't either. Even though we are unsure of what the future will bring ― even though we answer every phone call with apprehension and we greet every knock on the door with chills traveling up and down our spines, it's all worth it to us.\\n\\nLove doesn't need 'papers' to be validated. Love doesn't need a Social Security number to be real.\\n\\nWhat I've learned over the last three years is that love doesn't need papers to be validated. Love doesn't need a Social Security number to be real. The love I have for Javier is so deep and so visceral and every day my love grows as I watch him interact with our beautiful daughter. She gives us so much hope and fills us with so much more love, and it is a love that binds us together and makes us stronger. It is also a love that scares some people ― that many say should not be allowed to even exist ― and it is partly the fear of this love that makes immigration reform so emotional and so hard to achieve.\\n\\nAs I look forward to the upcoming election, I'm hoping that the state we live in turns from red to blue and immigration reform finally happens. I am hopeful Javier and I can find a solution to the nightmare we are living every day and that our immigration lawyer can figure out a way to obtain a green card for Javier without his having to face a 10-year ban from the United States. I am hopeful we don't go broke trying to do so. I'm hoping our relationship can stay strong despite all of the obstacles we face. I hope one of us doesn't throw in the towel and walk away. I hope my family finally begins to accept Javier for who he is instead of punishing him for what he is ― undocumented.\\n\\nThere is a saying I've learned ― la lucha sigue ― that means the fight goes on, and for us it has an especially personal and poignant resonance. Every day we fight ― and not just for justice and freedom and fairness ― but also for understanding and kindness and respect, as well as for the opportunities to give just as much as we receive. Javier continues to fight for a better life for his family and our daughter, and I continue to fight for him and for our family's life together. Everyone deserves to feel safe, to feel secure, and to feel like they belong ― regardless of immigration status.\\n\\nSarah is a freelance writer who lives in the Midwest.

{"original": "Anadolu Agency via Getty Images The authoritarian strain in the Republican Party is not merely a product of its unwashed fringe.\\n\\nThe Republican Party is toxic and poisons every institution it touches. There can be no separating Wednesday's horrifying pro-Trump raid on the U.S. Capitol from the political organization that reared these self-described revolutionaries.\\n\\nWe have more than four years of evidence revealing what Trump is and who is attracted to his ideas. Nobody in American politics is confused about the danger he represents to democracy. The accumulated evidence includes a murderous Charlottesville, Virginia neo-Nazi riot in 2017 and a shoutout to a fascist street gang from a presidential debate stage last fall.\\n\\nMost Republicans, we know, are not torch-bearing fascists. GOP leaders have been especially keen to draw a distinction between respectable business-class conservatism and the MAGA mob. And yet they have bet their careers and the country on an alliance with Trump's authoritarianism.\\n\\nWednesday's attempted coup is the price Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), former House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), tea party darlings Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), nouveau nationalist Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) and arch-militarist Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) were willing to pay to advance their policy priorities under Trump's banner.\\n\\nNor were the standard-bearers of the conservative movement ever confused about what they were doing. Explaining his decision to vote for Donald Trump in 2020, conservative debate-me icon Ben Shapiro ― once a Trump critic in the far-gone days of 2016 ― declared that he had been wrong to think Trump would stand in the way of right-wing policy priorities.\\n\\nAs for the rest, well, how bad could it get? I wasn't really wrong about Donald Trump on character, but whatever damage he was going to do, he's already done, and it's not going to help if I don't vote for him, Shapiro said.\\n\\nThe alliance between these cufflinkers and the catastrophists has proved overwhelmingly successful for the conservative elite. McConnell has reshaped the federal judiciary, with three Supreme Court Justices and well over 200 other lifetime appointments. Ryan was so satisfied with the Trump tax bill's offerings for the rich that he retired in glory, his life's work at last accomplished. Former Trump chief of staff Mick Mulvaney resigned as special envoy to Northern Ireland in ostensible protest Wednesday night, having taken advantage of his previous post to gut the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Cotton has been correctly denouncing Republicans who bought into Trump's conspiracy theories about the 2020 election, but only after he got Trump to rip up President Barack Obama's diplomatic detente with Iran and move the U.S. embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, a longstanding goal of both the ultranationalist right in Israel and the apocalyptic evangelical Christian fringe in the United States.\\n\\nCruz even got Trump to stop mocking his wife in public. Which leads us, as all pathetic roads eventually do, to Rubio. After tweeting his frustration with 3rd world style anti-American anarchy, Rubio gave a speech on the Senate floor Wednesday night comparing the events of the day to the activities of mid-century Marxist revolutionaries in Cuba.\\n\\nMy entire life I have lived with and next to people who came to America because their country was chaotic and their country was unsafe, Rubio said. What I saw today, what we have seen, looks more like those countries than the extraordinary nation that it is my privilege to call home … I think politics has made us crazy. Everybody in this country has lost their minds.\\n\\nO Politics, what hath thou wrought ― be there no agency nor accountability to thine abstract malevolence!\\n\\nOf course there is. Rubio, like nearly all of his colleagues, got in bed with Trump because he recognized, correctly, that Trump was the best way to achieve his near-term political goals. Now that the alliance has blown up in his face, Rubio hopes to concoct some weird formula in which the whole thing is really the fault of the radical left ― Cuban Marxists and American anarchists.\\n\\nGOP leaders have been especially keen to draw a distinction between respectable business-class conservatism and the MAGA mob. And yet they have bet their careers and the country on an alliance with Trump's authoritarianism.\\n\\nWednesday's MAGA riot was the work of the Republican Party, not of the left or politics. There have always been politics and there always will be, but not all of it leads to QAnon lunatics storming the Capitol at the behest of a Republican president hoping to overturn the result of an election that didn't go in his favor. Most Americans are not, in fact, bloodthirsty authoritarians.\\n\\nThe authoritarian strain in the Republican Party, however, is not merely a product of its unwashed fringe. Take, for example, Trump's most aggressive attorney general, William Barr, who did not rise to power through Breitbart or Facebook paranoia. He has a long and illustrious career serving on corporate boards and as AG for George H.W. Bush in the long, long-ago days when Republicans were supposedly so much more refined and sensible. But as Tom Hamburger and others have detailed, Barr has long championed the unitary executive ― a fancy name for a theory of monarchical presidential power embraced by, among others, former Vice President Dick Cheney. Though its adherents embrace different definitions and engage in various micro-doctrinal disputes, the basic idea is, as Richard Nixon once put it, When the president does it, that means it's not illegal.\\n\\nNor is Barr the only ghost of Fancy Republicanism Past to make his way into the Trump administration. Trump's Supreme Court nominees have all been members of the ultra-elite conservative Federalist Society. His labor secretary, Eugene Scalia, is the son of the late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia. His treasury secretary, Steve Mnuchin, is a Goldman Sachs alum. His former Securities and Exchange Commission chairman, Jay Clayton, was a Goldman lawyer. His commerce secretary, Wilbur Ross, was a private equity kingpin. His CIA director turned secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, is a former businessman whose enterprise was backed by an investment from the Koch Brothers. His education secretary, Betsy DeVos, is the billionaire ex-chair of the Michigan Republican Party, and his vice president, Mike Pence, is a career conservative movement man who eventually became governor of Indiana before joining the Trump administration.\\n\\nEvery one of these people knew what they were doing when they signed up to work with Trump.\\n\\nThe Republican rot, in short, did not arise in January 2021 or even 2016. Party power brokers have been advocating various strains of authoritarianism for decades because they are the surest way to ensure that the unpopular policy agenda of the American elite remains politically viable.\\n\\nCORRECTION: This article previously mischaracterized Mick Mulvaney as Trump's chief of staff, a role he left in March 2020, and Mike Pompeo as CIA director, a role he left in 2018."}

{"original": "Chicago Alderman Carlos Ramirez-Rosa dropped out of the Democratic primary to succeed Rep. Luis Gutíerrez (D-Ill.) on Tuesday and endorsed Cook County Commissioner Jesús Chuy Garcia, the odds-on front-runner in the race.\\n\\nAfter spending the last week discussing with family, friends, supporters, and leaders in the progressive movement, I have come to the conclusion that this is the best course of action not just for me, but for the vitally important movement we continue to build every day, Ramirez-Rosa said in a statement announcing his decision.\\n\\nCalling Garcia a good friend and progressive champion, the alderman invited his supporters to endorse Garcia as well.\\n\\nI hope you will join me in ensuring we have strong progressive leadership in this district at such a vital time in this country, when so many of our critical concerns are at stake, Ramirez-Rosa said.\\n\\nRamirez-Rosa's announcement follows polling indicating that he would have faced a blowout in a matchup against Garcia. A Public Policy Polling survey released on Dec. 19 showed Garcia with 54 percent support compared with 7 percent for Ramirez-Rosa, and even less for other challengers.\\n\\nHe didn't want to waste people's time, said Lucie Macías, a supporter of Ramirez-Rosa and a fellow member of the Chicago chapter of the Democratic Socialists of America. He wanted to respect people who had put in effort into this campaign, so it made sense to make the announcement now.\\n\\nThe immediate impact of Ramirez-Rosa's decision is to virtually ensure Garcia's victory in the March 20 race.\\n\\nBut it is also likely to disappoint the progressive activists and democratic socialists who had rallied behind Ramirez-Rosa's bid.\\n\\nIf elected, Ramirez-Rosa, 28, would have been the first openly gay Latino member of Congress. He also would have been the only person who was both a sitting member of Congress and a dues-paying member of the DSA, which has grown several-fold in size since President Donald Trump's election.\\n\\nDSA has made significant inroads into government in the past 14 months, with several members being elected to state and local posts. But just as Ramirez-Rosa's success in getting on the ballot reflected DSA's rising prominence, his failure to mount a robust challenge to Garcia reflects the limits of the organization's political reach.\\n\\nTed Cox/DNAInfo Chicago Alderman Carlos Ramirez-Rosa, 28, has made no secret of his ambitions for higher office since winning a City Council seat in 2015.\\n\\nWhen Gutíerrez, 64, announced his retirement as congressman for Illinois' 4th Congressional District in late November, he immediately endorsed Garcia. Gutíerrez's blessing conveniently took Garcia out of the running for another bid against Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, whose 2015 re-election Gutíerrez backed. (Garcia's progressive challenge against Emanuel forced the first mayoral runoff in Chicago history.)\\n\\nIn addition, the timing of Gutíerrez's announcement left less than a week for candidates to collect the number of signatures necessary to get on the ballot.\\n\\nBut with the help of a crew of fellow DSA members, Ramirez-Rosa collected the requisite signatures and then some.\\n\\nRamirez-Rosa has emerged as one of the most charismatic figures in the resurgent Democratic Socialists of America. With his impassioned speaking style, hip fashion sense and diverse background, he has a knack for making the sometimes arcane precepts of the far left accessible to ordinary people ― especially his fellow millennials.\\n\\nEvery day, Donald Trump and the Republicans intensify their attacks against our working families, against our immigrant families, against anyone that doesn't look like a rich, white billionaire just like him, Ramirez-Rosa told HuffPost in a December interview about his decision to run. We need a bold, progressive response in Washington, D.C., that's tied to grassroots movements that says not just 'We're gonna resist Donald Trump,' but 'We're gonna vigorously resist Donald Trump by uplifting the bold progressive policies that are gonna help our working families.'\\n\\nEarly in his career, Ramirez-Rosa worked in Gutíerrez's Washington office.\\n\\nI quickly saw how he and his office were not connected to the grassroots movement led by undocumented people, Ramirez-Rosa said of his stint there in a July interview with The Nation.\\n\\nRamirez-Rosa subsequently returned to Chicago to work as a grassroots immigrants rights organizer with the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights.\\n\\nFollowing a successful 2015 bid to represent Chicago's 50th aldermanic district on the City Council, Ramirez-Rosa became one of the council's most outspoken critics of Emanuel. He was the only alderman to vote against the creation of a $95 million police academy on Chicago's west side.\\n\\nBut from the get-go, Ramirez-Rosa faced an uphill battle against Garcia. At 61, Garcia has been in city and state politics for over three decades, and his name recognition and support network far outweighed Ramirez-Rosa's.\\n\\nIt was also difficult for Ramirez-Rosa to outflank Garcia from the left. Garcia enjoyed strong progressive credibility for taking on Emanuel in 2015, and was part of the coalition of Chicago politicians who backed the insurgent 1983 mayoral bid of Harold Washington, the Windy City's first mayor.\\n\\nAs an early endorser of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders' 2016 presidential bid, Garcia also benefited from Sanders' early blessing in the race.\\n\\nGutíerrez, by contrast, supported both Emanuel's re-election and Sanders' main rival for the Democratic nomination, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. A Garcia win would likely assure the left a more independent fighter in Congress than the seat's previous occupant.\\n\\nWhat's more, Garcia and Ramirez-Rosa both back a long list of progressive priorities, from single-payer Medicare for all to a federal $15 minimum wage.\\n\\nOne area of apparent disagreement was on the question of the boycott, divestment and sanctions movement to end the Israeli occupation of the Palestinian territories. In September, Ramirez-Rosa's refusal to renounce the nonviolent movement cost him a spot as running mate in state Sen. Daniel Biss' Democratic gubernatorial run. Garcia condemned BDS unequivocally in a December interview with HuffPost, and volunteered it unprompted as an area of policy disagreement between the two candidates.\\n\\nIllinois' 4th Congressional District is gerrymandered to combine heavily Latino areas of northwestern and southwestern Chicago with nearby suburbs. It is heavily Democratic, and whoever wins the March primary is almost certain to win the general election in November.\\n\\nIn addition to Garcia, Chicago Alderman Proco Joe Moreno, police Officer Richard Gonzalez and Sol Flores ― founding executive director of La Casa Norte, a nonprofit that addresses homelessness ― are competing in the district primary.\\n\\nFlores, who has received the endorsement of the national group EMILY's List, served on the transition team for Emanuel's second mayoral term. Flores' association with Emanuel, a centrist with a notoriously rocky relationship with the city's progressive activist community, has prompted suspicion that she is Emanuel's favored candidate. (Emanuel has not officially endorsed in the race.)\\n\\nAlthough Chicago DSA has no plans to endorse Garcia at the moment, Flores' presence on the ticket and perceived ties to Emanuel might be enough to inspire individual DSA members to campaign for Garcia, according to Macías of Chicago DSA.\\n\\nIt's important that he wins that, especially against a Rahm candidate like Sol, Macías said.\\n\\nA lot of people are always afraid of the Rahm candidate, the big Chicago machine, she added. It's still a very important campaign.\\n\\nThis story has been updated throughout."}
{"original": "The State of our Union is Strong. President Obama and Governor Nikki Haley represented this strength last Tuesday as they reminded us of enduring American values like civility and inclusion. Their words demonstrate that we have durable, resilient democracy in the leadership of both political parties.\\n\\nAt the same time, the state of Oregon has offered us nearly two weeks of a 21st century governing challenge. One that has demonstrated a durable, resilient democracy among American citizens.\\n\\nEarlier this month, a group of armed men seized a federal bird sanctuary headquarters in remote Harney County, Oregon. The group members claim that militant action is a justified resistance against government oppression. Specifically, they feel aggrieved over federal regulation on public lands and want to impose their own rules for land use. National reactions to the siege have ranged from alarm to scorn. However, much of the back and forth has been a healthy and important democratic discourse questioning how we use and manage public lands and define terrorism and pointing out double standards in law enforcement. Wanting to avoid violence, federal law enforcement has taken a wait it out strategy.\\n\\nThe state of our union is strong in Oregon, where locals have demonstrated the capacity for calm, discerning leadership in crisis. The closest city to the siege is Burns, with a population of 2,800, 30 miles away. At a Burns Town Hall, citizens put aside their differences over land use (which are significant) and criticized the armed action. Harney County Sheriff Dave Ward has been a key communication link, even meeting with the militants and offering them an escorted departure. Open deliberation and the unconditional rejection of violence is a sign of resilient democracy in action.\\n\\nFederal land use is a long-simmering issue across the American West. Arguments magnify the tensions of East vs. West priorities: wilderness vs. livestock; urban vs. rural; day trips vs. country livelihoods. Yet almost everyone agrees that the laws governing public land are inadequate and obsolete--leftover from the 1870's push to settle the West. To prevent widespread land degradation and abuse of the system, the grazing laws were revised in the 1930's and then the 1970's. However, much has changed since then and the law has not evolved accordingly.\\n\\nThe Oregon siege is an extreme example of the modern struggle for legitimate power in a legal and leadership vacuum. Frustration with the inadequate law and the failure of government to respond and modernize it has led to an unacceptable outcome: citizens' use of force to be heard. In the Information Age there are better and more accessible democratic alternatives.\\n\\nLet Oregonians Update the Grazing Law\\n\\nWe don't yet know how the drama in Oregon will turn out. But one way we can support peaceful civic progress in future disputes is through new civic technologies that allow group participation in lawmaking.\\n\\nCivic technology is any information-sharing platform that facilitates citizen engagement and communication on behalf of the public good. Examples include voting and resident feedback apps. More recently, tools for broadening participation in legislation are multiplying around the world. Policy Forge in Austria, Open Ministry in Finland and Plataforma in Brazil are some of the ongoing experiments with inclusive lawmaking. The intention behind these open government developments is to build democratic legitimacy through transparency and shared decision making.\\n\\nWhy not use the latest in civic technology to encourage a modern upgrade of the law governing Oregon's public land? Oregon is already a national leader in civic innovation. Its Citizens Initiative Review is a deliberative process that includes citizens in policymaking. Across the USA, cities are also experimenting with new forms of collaboration. Just this week, Washington, DC went online with its Draft Open Data Policy . Open government platforms such as these, which allow scrutiny and participation in the formation of rules, create an unprecedented accountability mechanism for democracy.\\n\\nLikewise, citizens in Oregon can use Madison, a hosted solution developed for use in the US Congress. They can then download the legal language from Cornell University's Legal Information Institute. Here's the link to US Code Subchapter IV on Range Management. You can find all US law on this site, and anyone can put this platform to work, running deliberative discussions without technical heavy lifting. The questions for Harney County are who should administer the process and what are the rules for creating content together?\\n\\nIdeally, a trusted local institution or individual would organize and facilitate the effort, and those directly impacted by the law would be vital participants. In Oregon this could include everyone from farmers and ranchers to birders and hikers. The Bureau of Land Management and its scientists are also essential players, but outside expertise might also be important and bring with it new kinds of forecasting tools like data science. The challenge will be to find the balance so the process is inclusive but not unwieldy.\\n\\nThe state of the union is strong in Oregon. The threat of violence has been met with a counter force of civility. In today's world of governing crises, the reputation of democracy is at stake. Harney County's adherence to civic rules of engagement despite deep differences is a bright light on a murky horizon. The Oregon standoff is not over yet, but let us look to the citizens there with hope for an auspicious outcome.

{"original": "Justin Goromaru's phone is stolen. But no worries -- he has insurance. Oh wait, no he doesn't. Is he out of luck?\\n\\nQuestion: I recently upgraded my phone with AT&T. When I did, they they offered me insurance through a company called Asurion.\\n\\nI told the representative that I had two insurance claims on my number, but he assured me that since I am signing a new contract, I'm definitely eligible and will be covered.\\n\\nMy phone was stolen and I filed a claim. Asurion asked me to fax over my affidavit. Then they denied the claim, saying I don't have insurance and I'm not eligible due to having two claims on my number.\\n\\nI was lied to and misguided into signing this contract. Every manager told me different stories and offered me different things, none of which consisted of them taking any responsibility for their employees' lack of knowledge of policies. But since the AT&T employee failed to put a notation on my account quoting our interaction in store, I am the party at fault, according to AT&T.\\n\\nI have spent the last three days researching and calling different options I can take. I feel like AT&T has made me their jester. I want a Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge +, and free service for no less than two months, as compensation. Can you help? -- Justin Goromaru, Harrisburg, Pa.\\n\\nAnswer: If an AT&T representative promised you that you were definitely eligible, then you should have definitely been eligible. Full stop.\\n\\nI wasn't there when you upgraded your phone, but I'm not sure an employee would, or could, offer you such assurances. And even if he did, you would need to check the contract you sign to make sure you are covered, despite having two other claims.\\n\\nI have no doubt that you were led to believe you'd be covered, and that's a problem. In fact, the sample contract on the AT&T site is clear that you can't make more than two claims within a 12-month period. That's something you would have seen -- and had to sign -- before upgrading.\\n\\nI sympathize with you because you were led to believe you were covered -- which could be construed as an oral contract. Besides, shouldn't you be able to trust the word of an employee?\\n\\nOn the other hand, as the Russian proverb goes, you have to trust but verify. In journalism, we also have a saying: If your mother says she loves you, check it out.\\n\\nYou should have done your due diligence.\\n\\nThere's always the court of appeals. I list AT&T's executive contacts on my website, and a brief, polite email to them might persuade them to honor the word of their employee.\\n\\nI contacted both AT&T and Asurion on your behalf. Asurion did not respond, but an AT&T representative did.\\n\\nA store representative advised Justin that if he upgraded his device, he would be able to add insurance to his line, but that was because Justin didn't tell the rep nor did the rep know that Justin had already processed two claims, the representative said. Asurion's policy is for the wireless number associated with the account.\\n\\nI'm sorry, but your phone isn't covered after all.\\n\\nChristopher Elliott specializes in solving intractable consumer problems.

{"original": "HONG KONG (AP) — Hong Kong police arrested 53 former lawmakers and democracy proponents Wednesday for allegedly violating the new national security law by participating in unofficial election primaries for the territory's legislature last year.\\n\\nThe mass arrests, including of former lawmakers, were the largest move against Hong Kong's democracy movement since the law was imposed by Beijing last June to quell dissent in the semi-autonomous territory.\\n\\nThe operation today targets the active elements who are suspected to be involved in the crime of overthrowing, or interfering (and) seriously destroy the Hong Kong government's legal execution of duties, said John Lee, Hong Kong's security minister, in a news conference.\\n\\nHe said those arrested were suspected of trying to paralyze the government, via their plans to gain a majority of the seats in the legislature to create a situation in which the chief executive had to resign and the government would stop functioning.\\n\\nIn a video released by former lawmaker Lam Cheuk-ting on his Facebook page, police turned up at his house and told him he was suspected of violating the national security law, subverting state power. Police told those recording the video to stop or risk arrest.\\n\\nThe legislative election that would have followed the unofficial primaries was postponed by a year by Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam, who cited the public health risks during the coronavirus pandemic. Mass resignations and disqualifications of pro-democracy lawmakers have left the legislature largely a pro-Beijing body.\\n\\nASSOCIATED PRESS In this image taken from a video, Hong Kong's Democratic Party member and former lawmaker Lam Cheuk-ting, center, is arrested by police officers at his home in Hong Kong, on Jan. 6, 2021.\\n\\nLee said the police would not target those who had voted in the unofficial primaries, which were held in July last year and attracted more than 600,000 voters even though pro-Beijing lawmakers and politicians had warned the event could breach the security law.\\n\\nAll of the pro-democracy candidates in the unofficial primaries were arrested, according to tallies of the arrests being reported by the South China Morning Post, online platform Now News and political groups.\\n\\nAt least seven members of Hong Kong's Democratic Party — the city's largest opposition party — were arrested, including former party chairman Wu Chi-wai. Former lawmakers Lam, Helena Wong and James To were also arrested, according to a post on the party's Facebook page.\\n\\nBenny Tai, a key figure in Hong Kong's 2014 Occupy Central protests and a former law professor, was also arrested, reports said. Tai was one of the main organizers of the primaries.\\n\\nThe home of Joshua Wong, a prominent pro-democracy activist who is serving a 13 1/2-month prison sentence for organizing and participating in an unauthorized protest last year, was also raided, according to a tweet posted from Wong's account.\\n\\nAmerican human rights lawyer John Clancey was also arrested on Wednesday. Clancey was the treasurer of political group Power for Democracy, which was involved in the unofficial primaries.\\n\\nWe need to work for democracy and human rights in Hong Kong, Clancey said as he was being led away by police, in a video posted by local online news outlet Citizen News.\\n\\nPolice also went to the headquarters of Stand News, a prominent pro-democracy online news site in Hong Kong, with a court order to hand over documents to assist in an investigation related to the national security law, according to a livestreamed video by Stand News. No arrests were made.\\n\\nLee also pointed to a 10 steps to mutual destruction plan among those arrested, which included taking control of the legislature, mobilizing protests to paralyze society and calling for international sanctions.\\n\\nThat plan was previously outlined by former law professor Tai. He predicted that between 2020 and 2022, there would be 10 steps to mutual destruction which includes the pro-democracy bloc winning a majority in the legislature, intensifying protests, the forced resignation of Chief Executive Carrie Lam due to the budget bill being rejected twice, and international sanctions on the Chinese Communist Party.\\n\\nThe concept of mutual destruction — in which both Hong Kong and China would suffer damages — is popular among some protesters and pro-democracy activists.\\n\\nThe plot is to create such mutual destruction that if successful ... will result in serious damage to society as a whole, said Lee. That is why police action today is necessary.\\n\\nSenior superintendent Steve Li from the national security unit said in a news conference that 53 people — 45 men and eight women aged between 23 to 64 — were arrested in an operation that involved 1,000 officers.\\n\\nSix were arrested for subverting state power by organizing the unofficial primaries, while the rest were arrested for allegedly participating in the event, Li said. He said more arrests could be made and investigations were ongoing.\\n\\nIn recent months, Hong Kong has already jailed several pro-democracy activists including Wong and Agnes Chow for their involvement in antigovernment protests, and others have been charged under the national security law including media tycoon and outspoken pro-democracy activist Jimmy Lai.\\n\\nThe security law criminalizes acts of subversion, secession, terrorism and collusion with foreign powers to intervene in the city's affairs. Serious offenders could face up a maximum punishment of life imprisonment.\\n\\nHong Kong leader Carrie Lam had said at the time of the unofficial primaries last year that if their aim was resisting every policy initiative by the Hong Kong government, the election may fall under subverting state power, an offence under the national security law.\\n\\nBeijing had also called the primaries illegal and a serious provocation of Hong Kong's electoral system.\\n\\nFollowing the handover of Hong Kong to China by the British in 1997, the semi-autonomous Chinese city has operated on a one country, two systems framework that affords it freedoms not found on the mainland. In recent years, Beijing has asserted more control over the city, drawing criticism that it was breaking its promise of Hong Kong maintaining separate civil rights and political systems for 50 years from the handover.\\n\\nThe sweeping arrests drew condemnation from Anthony Blinken, the U.S. Secretary of State nominee for the upcoming Biden administration, who said on Twitter that it was an assault on those bravely advocating for universal rights.\\n\\nThe Biden-Harris administration will stand with the people of Hong Kong and against Beijing's crackdown on democracy, Blinken wrote in his tweet.\\n\\nHuman Rights Watch said the arrests suggest Beijing has failed to learn that repression generates resistance. HRW senior China researcher Maya Wang said in a statement that millions of Hong Kong people will persist in their struggle for their right to vote and run for office in a democratically elected government.\\n\\nIn further remarks to The Associated Press, Wang said it wasn't clear what provisions of the law were being cited to justify the arrests, but that local authorities seem less concerned with legal substance.\\n\\nThe very nature of the national security law is as a draconian blanket law allowing the government to arrest and potentially imprison people for long terms for exercising their constitutionally protected rights, Wang said.\\n\\nThe veneer of rule of law is also applied in mainland China stripped of any meaning. Hong Kong is looking more like mainland China but where one ends and the other begins is hard to discern, she said."}
{"original": "FILE -- In this Sunday, Jan. 3, 2016 file photo, Shiite Muslims take part in a rally to condemn the execution of Saudi Shiite cleric Sheikh Nimr al-Nimr, in Lahore, Pakistan. Diplomatic tensions between Saudi Arabia and Iran, which began with the kingdom's execution of al-Nimr and later saw attacks on Saudi diplomatic posts in the Islamic Republic, have seen countries around the world respond. Some nations have followed the Saudis' lead in severing or downgrading ties with Iran, while others have offered words of caution. (AP Photo/K.M. Chaudary, File)\\n\\nThe United States should rethink its ties to a country that engages in mass executions and disastrous military campaigns.\\n\\nLike other totalitarian regimes that have no legitimacy and no base of support, the Saudis are wrapping themselves in religion. Saddam Hussein in the 1990s and currently Bashar al-Assad -- the heads of the Baath party in Iraq and Syria -- both played the religious card. However, Baathist doctrine in Iraq and Syria is basically irreligious. The Saudis are using religion as their excuse now, labeling the recent mass executions as preserving their religion when they are actually a message to frighten their citizens into submission.\\n\\nEarly in the Arab Spring of 2011, out of fear of losing its grip on the country's citizens, the Saudi government allocated $35 billion in open giveaways and services to Saudi citizens. Although this monetary inducement succeeded in tamping down any thoughts of revolution at the time, the Saudis only deferred the day of reckoning. The impulse to fight against the sense of injustice is strong among those who live in that police state, with no democracy, and obscene inequality (many Saudi residents are working residents, with no rights at all).\\n\\nThe Saudis began this new year by executing 47 citizens on January 2, some by the barbaric method of beheading. These executions came after a total of 158 in 2015. Presumably the Saudi government sought to begin the year with a warning that it will not tolerate the crime of opposing the Saudi regime. These executions, some of them for people who merely spoke out against the state, is a slap in the face of all those democracies in the world.\\n\\nMost of those executed were Sunni, and the executions were designed to frighten the overwhelmingly Sunni population of Saudi Arabia into silence. At the same time, the inclusion of Shiite cleric Sheikh Nimr Baqir al-Nimr sent a similar warning to the Shiite minority. It also served to divert the attention of the world from the cruel executions to the conflict between Shia and Sunni and to drag in Iran as the guilty party. Sheikh Nimr's crime was to actively oppose the Saudi regime and call for better treatment of the 20% of Shiites in eastern Saudi Arabia.\\n\\nSadly, Iranians fell for the Saudi trap and set fire to the Saudi embassy in Tehran. Although President Hassan Rouhani and many of the political and military leaders in Iran -- with the exception of Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei -- condemned the setting of fire of the Saudi Embassy, Saudi Arabia went ahead and closed their embassy in Tehran. Their strong allies Bahrain, Sudan, and the United Arab Emirates closed their embassies as well to show support for the Saudi regime.\\n\\nThe Saudi effort to sustain the life of their regime is broad and profound. For decades, Saudi Arabia has spent billions of dollars for madrasas and mosques that spread their Wahhabi brand of Islam, and has funneled comparable sums to insurgents such as the al-Qaeda, the Islamic State, and Jubhat al-Nusra directly and indirectly through covert operations. The Saudis support all those who oppose Assad in Syria. They seek to sway the outcome of Sudan's civil war and install their puppet regime in Yemen.\\n\\nThe Saudis also claimed that the Houthis in Sudan are Iranian proxies, and even though much of the U.S. media accepts this claim at face value the evidence is slim. The Houthis are a different sect than Iranian Shiites. Iran has no troops in Yemen. Moreover, Iran is separated from Yemen by a large Gulf. Furthermore, Iran has not invaded Yemen as the Saudis did with support from the United States by positioning a carrier near Yemen.\\n\\nThe Saudis have contributed a great deal to fueling two civil wars -- Syria and Yemen -- without any consequences. And neither war has resulted from religious differences but rather because of Saudi efforts to fend off any challenges to their corrupt regime.\\n\\nSaudi Arabia is on a dangerous path. Its fortunes are receding. The price of oil has dropped to 30 dollars per barrel. The country is spending $1 billion monthly on its reckless invasion of Yemen, while its citizens suffer from an economic downturn. The regime is attempting to bolster its authority by threat of death, rather than the promise of reform.\\n\\nWhen President Obama took office in 2008, he correctly rejected the past policy of supporting non-democratic, corrupt, and abusive regimes simply because they are strategic partners of the United States. The Arab Spring of 2011 brought hope that democracy might just have a chance in the Middle East. But the task has proven to be exceedingly difficult, as events and policies in Egypt, Syria, Libya, and Yemen have led President Obama to continually retreat from his policy of distancing the United States from these totalitarian regimes.\\n\\nSaudi Arabia's recent mass executions represent a significant test to the United States. Our founding principles of freedom and democracy are being torn to shreds in the last throes of the Saudi regime. The United States should not blindly march in lock step with Saudi Arabia to the edge of the cliff of fire and destruction in the Middle East."}

{"original": "In 2018, the Trump administration estimated opening Alaska's pristine Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil and gas development would generate $1.8 billion in federal revenue over a decade. Independent analysts dismissed that economic outlook as, among other things, a pipe dream.\\n\\nOn Wednesday afternoon, as pro-Trump extremists violently stormed the U.S. Capitol in a naked attempt to subvert American democracy, the Trump administration held its long-anticipated, highly controversial Arctic refuge lease sale.\\n\\nJust three entities — two small oil companies and an Alaska state-owned economic development corporation ― bid on roughly half of the 1.09 million acres up for grabs. The sale generated a measly $14.4 million, less than 1% of the administration's total revenue estimates. That's an average of $27 per acre, only slightly above the $25 minimum bid price.\\n\\nThe state agency, the Alaska Industrial Development and Export Authority, placed the top bid on all but two of the 11 tracts that received bids. The revenues from the leases, if ultimately approved, will be split 50/50 between the federal government and the state of Alaska.\\n\\nMuch as the rioting in D.C. on Wednesday capped Trump's long record of inciting political violence, the lease sale is a fitting finale for the administration's anti-conservation legacy. Trump and his team have spent four years bending over backward for fossil fuel and other extractive industries, with little concern for how its energy dominance agenda will impact the climate and wildlife.\\n\\nASSOCIATED PRESS An airplane flies over caribou from the Porcupine Caribou Herd on the coastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in northeast Alaska.\\n\\nTrump and his team have made greenlighting oil drilling in the Arctic refuge a top priority, despite worsening climate and biodiversity crises and warnings from scientists, environmentalists and a bipartisan group of former Interior Department officials that doing so would forever spoil one of the nation's last true wilderness areas.\\n\\nThe refuge, often described as America's Serengeti, covers more than 19 million acres in northeastern Alaska. It is home to polar bears, caribou, moose and hundreds of species of migratory birds. For decades, Republicans and energy companies have been trying to gain access to the oil beneath the refuge's coastal plain, known as the 1002 Area.\\n\\nThe GOP tax law passed by Congress in late 2017 included a provision, introduced by Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), requiring the Interior Department to approve at least two lease sales for drilling — each covering no less than 400,000 acres. Since then, the Trump administration has been in a race to approve leases, at times ignoring and altering career scientists' work in an effort to downplay the potential environmental impacts, as Politico reported in 2019.\\n\\nJenny Rowland-Shea, a senior public lands policy analyst at the left-leaning Center for American Progress, said Wednesday's auction is the logical conclusion to this completely flawed effort: a massive failure.\\n\\nThe process of getting to this lease sale has been nothing short of a sham and all eyes should be on a robust antitrust review, she said in a statement. Either the courts, President-elect Biden, or the new Congress should have no problem rejecting these bids.\\n\\nAutumn Hanna, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, called it a bust for taxpayers.\\n\\nHolding this lease sale at the 11th hour of this Administration, during the pandemic when oil demand is low and prices in flux, all but doomed this already questionable sale from the start, she said. Now taxpayers will have to deal with the fallout.\\n\\nThe eleventh-hour lease sale comes less than two weeks before President-elect Joe Biden assumes office. Biden has repeatedly vowed to block oil drilling in the refuge, although active leases are likely to prove difficult to revoke.\\n\\nDespite the severe lack of industry interest on Wednesday, Murkowski called it a great day and the result of many Alaskans' tireless efforts over the course of decades.\\n\\nThe first lease sale in the non-wilderness 1002 Area did not occur under ideal conditions, but it will benefit Alaskans both in the short-term and well into the future, she said in a statement."}

Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) on Sunday blasted White House staff for undercutting efforts to craft a deal on immigration and end the ongoing government shutdown.\\n\\nSpeaking with reporters, Graham singled out White House senior policy adviser Stephen Miller as an outlier, and said despite President Donald Trump's willingness to forge a deal, his aides have made such negotiations difficult.\\n\\nEvery time we have a proposal it is only yanked back by staff members, Graham said. As long as Stephen Miller is in charge of negotiating immigration, we're going nowhere.\\n\\nHe's been an outlier for years, there's a deal to be had, he added.\\n\\nMiller, a former aide to then-Alabama Sen.

{"original": "Australian Department of Immigration and Citizenship via Getty Images The former Manus Island center, in a photo from 2012, has been closed, but the fate of those who are seeking asylum remains in limbo because they haven't been officially declared refugees.\\n\\nAsylum seekers in Australia's offshore detention camp in the Papua New Guinean province of Manus Island have been given a grim choice: Remain in a Papua New Guinea jail forever or return to their home countries to face arbitrary detention, torture or death.\\n\\nAustralia's hard-line policy of mandatory detention for unauthorized boat arrivals saw thousands of men, women and children who were seeking asylum shunted to offshore processing facilities on Manus Island and the Pacific island nation of Nauru in recent years. The Papua New Guinea (PNG) Supreme Court ruled in 2016 that the arrangement breached the country's constitution and ordered the detention center to close. In 2017 the Australian government agreed to pay $70 million in compensation to about 1,900 asylum seekers detained on Manus over the years but simply moved the detainees ― all men ― to new facilities after the old center was shut down.\\n\\nAlthough those deemed to be legitimate refugees are allowed to settle in the PNG community as normal residents, those found to not be refugees are held in a separate, newly built facility called Hillside House and have been pressured to return to their home countries, which include Iran, Somalia and Sudan. Most of the men on Manus have been found to be legitimate refugees by agencies including the United Nations, but some have had their claims for refugee status rejected.\\n\\nMany of the would-be refugees have been deported or returned home already, after being tempted by $20,000 (about $16,000 U.S.) packages from the Australian government.\\n\\nLast week, a number of Hillside House residents received a grim letter from the PNG Immigration and Citizenship Service Authority, saying that the government wants to deport them but that a pre-deportation assessment found these asylum seekers would face mortal danger if they returned to their home countries.\\n\\nThis included an assessment of whether there is a real risk that you will be subjected to torture, cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, arbitrary deprivation of life or the imposition of the death penalty, the letter obtained by HuffPost stated.\\n\\nThe assessment found that there is a real risk of one or more of these events and therefore the Government of Papua New Guinea will not remove you to your home country.\\n\\nThe letter said that, despite this, you do not have a right to remain in Papua New Guinea and your removal and detention orders remain in effect.\\n\\nThe letter distributed to asylum seekers on Manus Island in Papua New Guinea.\\n\\nIt's essentially putting people who need protection into limbo or detention forever, Natasha Blucher, detention advocacy manager at the Asylum Seeker Resource Centre. The men detained in Hillside have limited rights to movement. There is no solution. The men who received these letters are at their wits' end. Where can they go?\\n\\nBlucher said many of the men would be persecuted and targeted if they returned home.\\n\\nIt has been acknowledged they'd face torture and death if they go home. They can't stay in PNG. They're not allowed to go to Australia. This has heaped a lot of distress onto people. It's dangerous when you take already hopeless people and tell them there's no solution in the foreseeable future, she said.\\n\\nIt's something Australia could have absolutely foreseen yet failed to plan. It's another example showing this entire system is a disaster.\\n\\nThe Australian government says it no longer bears any responsibility for the asylum seekers, despite the asylum boats having been on a course for Australia and having been detained in Australian waters. The Department of Home Affairs, which has jurisdiction over immigration, issued a one-line response to HuffPost: This is a matter for the PNG Government.\\n\\nDr. Maria O'Sullivan, senior lecturer at Monash University's law school and deputy director of the Castan Centre for Human Rights Law, told HuffPost that, although fear of torture or death was not in itself a basis to claim refugee status, most developed nations offered protection for non-refugees with such fears.\\n\\nMany countries are party to the United Nations Convention Against Torture or the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which means they can't return someone to torture. The thorny issue is that Nauru and PNG are developing countries that have only recently relatively signed up to these conventions, she said.\\n\\nPNG can't send them back, but they don't have to give them a status that allows them to stay. When you're recognized as a refugee, you're allowed certain rights to education, work, social security and more. It's a big issue in refugee law worldwide, you won't get sent back but you don't have any status.\\n\\nO'Sullivan claimed the PNG government was attempting to encourage the non-refugees to go back to their home countries, regardless of the potential danger.\\n\\nThe policy wants them to voluntarily return home. The government is giving them one choice, staying in PNG in this uncertain status, she said.\\n\\nYou could argue it is in itself a breach of human rights to not give someone permanent status."}
{"original": "Chris Wattie / Reuters The Canadian Forces Snowbirds aerobatic team fly past the Peace Tower during Canada Day celebrations on Parliament Hill in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, July 1, 2016. REUTERS/Chris Wattie\\n\\nA poll by the Government of Canada, recently made public, shows Canadians are more inclined to spend their tax dollars on traditional infrastructure, like roads and public transportation, rather than high-tech infrastructure because they believe the former will grow the economy and create jobs.\\n\\nIt's understandable why taxpayers may prioritize investment this way. Ensuring that the Gardiner Expressway is in a good state of repair and public transit is growing are things that are critical to the functioning of Torontonians' daily lives. Physical infrastructure also has the benefit of its economic returns being familiar and immediately visible. And when it doesn't function the way it should, citizens feel the fallout immediately. There's also no doubt that infrastructure spending leads to jobs.\\n\\nBut the question we need to ask ourselves when we think about investment in our country -- and ultimately the lives of Canadians -- is what kind of world will we be living in 50 years from now, and how can we ensure we're ready for it and able to thrive as citizens and a nation?\\n\\nThis debate isn't a new one. When Sir John A. MacDonald unveiled his National Policy in 1876, he championed a vision for Canadian Pacific Railway's transcontinental line. The idea received a great deal of criticism initially, but the railway is now viewed as a critical building block of Canada. It linked east with west, facilitated communications and the transportation of goods between Canada's previously fractured regions, and helped the country compete internationally. High tech now, like the railway then, is the great connector and a key part of our country's competitive advantage and economic future. We must invest in it or risk getting left behind.\\n\\nTechnology is no longer a tactic in business, it's an imperative to the overarching strategy of any organization, and it's critical to thrive in an era where any business risks getting Uberized. As an employee, digital literacy and skills are tantamount to staying relevant and employable in today's digital world.\\n\\nAt a macro level, technology is one of the fastest growing sectors of the Canadian economy in terms of GDP output. From 2007 to 2014, Information Communications Technology sector revenues grew from $133.4 billion to $169.8 billion, a 27.2% increase. According to The Brookfield Institute for Innovation and Entrepreneurship at Ryerson University, the technology sector was responsible for 7.1% of Canada's real economic output in 2015. The study also notes that the sector's growth has been steady over the last few years -- lacking the volatility of other industries -- a good indicator of future growth.\\n\\nThe Global Innovation Index in 2016 ranked Canada as the 15th most innovative country in the world. This is good. However, a central finding of the same report is that investments in research and development and innovation are central for economic growth and the index noted that Canada is lagging when it comes to research and development expenditure.\\n\\nIt's easy to think about new technology and innovation in futuristic terms, but today's high school students will soon live in an economy with jobs anchored in technologies their parents would likely have seen as science fiction - everything from nanotechnology to AI to driverless cars. We stand at a tipping point.\\n\\nPlanning today for the infrastructure of tomorrow will ensure the generations who celebrate our 300th birthday will do so in a prosperous, competitive nation.\\n\\nAccording to the World Economic Forum, 65% of kids today will have jobs that haven't been invented yet. We're only scratching the surface when it comes to innovation. We owe it to future generations to lay the foundation to help them become skilled and competitive in a technology economy.\\n\\nThe current Federal Government has an innovation agenda, which includes bringing high speed internet to more than 300 communities and investing up to $2 billion to accelerate infrastructure projects at universities and colleges. So does Toronto's Mayor John Tory, and it's important that this collective focus at multiple government levels grows, expands and continues to gain momentum.\\n\\nFor our part, Salesforce in Canada offers free high tech training through Trailhead, which trains participants on Salesforce expertise, helping prepare Canadians for the nearly 30,000 Salesforce-based jobs projected to be created in the country between now and 2018. But there's much more to do to keep pace with the continued digitization of the economy, and investment in the required infrastructure is critical to all efforts.\\n\\nThis year is Canada's 150th birthday. The innovation agenda is our generation's transcontinental line, linking us all together. Planning today for the infrastructure of tomorrow will ensure the generations who celebrate our 300th birthday will do so in a prosperous, competitive nation."}

I was shocked, I was angered, I was sad, I was angered, I was embarrassed, I was frustrated, Mulvaney said, adding that he was still trying to figure out what I could have done differently.\\n\\nHe admitted that he was wrong to argue, in a Wall Street Journal op-ed published six weeks ago, that Trump would concede gracefully. He said he really believed at the time that Trump would leave in a presidential manner.\\n\\nMulvaney then suggested to Wallace that Trump and his advisers had changed since he left the acting chief of staff position nine months ago.\\n\\nMick, respectfully, there are people who say he isn't different, this is the Donald Trump you worked for, Wallace responded, before bringing up comments made by John Kelly, who preceded Mulvaney as chief of staff.\\n\\nKelly says specifically that you and others didn't have the spine to tell the president 'no,' he said.\\n\\nMulvaney disagreed and defended himself.\\n\\nWe were very proud of the work that we were doing. Very proud of letting the president be the president because he was elected as the president, he said. But again, all of that changed on Wednesday and I don't know why.\\n\\nWallace went on to press Mulvaney for defending the president during other controversies. He noted that Trump was impeached for pressuring Ukraine to dig up dirt on his opponent, President-elect Joe Biden, while Mulvaney was chief of staff. He also asked why Mulvaney did not resign from his role as director of the Office of Management and Budget after Trump defended white supremacists who marched in Charlottesville, Virginia, in 2017, or after the administration separated parents from children at the U.S.-Mexico border.\\n\\nChris, these are policy differences, Mulvaney said. These are things that you think the country should look one way, we think it should look another. These are differences of style, the way the president speaks, he added. Did he misspeak at Charlottesville? Yes. Should he have corrected it? Yes. Did he handle it poorly? Yes. It's not something people resign over. Watch the full interview on Fox News below:"}
{"original": "When I joined the Assembly, one of the first issues I started working on was making diapers more affordable and accessible to parents. The lack of sufficient supply of diapers to keep an infant or toddler clean, dry, and healthy has ripple effects through the community, and with nearly 5.3 million babies in the U.S. age three or younger living in poor or low-income families, and one third of infants and toddlers with at least one parent working full time living in low-income families, it's a problem that demands real action.\\n\\nWe know diaper need is a serious, widespread problem, but while our existing government support programs work around the edges to define the problem, we still don't actually address it. California alone is home to about 2.5 million children under age five. One third live in single parent households, and the number of low income working families with children is more than one-in-five and rising. Medicaid currently covers over 1/3 of all births in the U.S. each year, and perhaps not surprisingly 1 in 3 U.S. moms report suffering from diaper need.\\n\\nWe have programs like CalFresh and CalWORKs to support low-income families, but despite being a clear necessity, direct diaper assistance remains 100% non-governmental. Low-income parents have to rely on a network of diaper banks, food banks, social service agencies, community and faith based groups, because government assistance programs like food stamps and CalFresh do not cover diapers. Unfortunately, this blind spot is getting worse.\\n\\nCalifornia's cost of living continues to rise, especially for low-income families, and everyday necessities of life like diapers are expensive. Diapers cost anywhere from $72 to $100 per child every month, adding up quickly for those struggling to make ends meet.\\n\\nMeanwhile, California's formula for calculating the income limit making families eligible for subsidized child care and preschool has been falling over the last decade relative to the state's median income. As a result, families are disqualified for subsidized child care at a lower income than in the past. According to the California Budget and Policy Center, that means a single mother of two would have to spend 70% of her income to cover the full cost of child care.\\n\\nDiaper need impacts not just economics, but the physical and mental well-being of children and parents. Parents who lack diapers may change diapers less often or reuse disposable diapers, putting their children at risk for preventable medical problems while generating unnecessary medical costs and pulling parents away from work for doctor visits.\\n\\nIt's also well established that children who participate in early childhood education are almost three times more likely to go on to higher education. But without providing the six to 10 diapers they need each day, babies cannot participate in early childhood education programs. In most cases, parents who can't provide diapers are shut out of daycare options altogether, not only making it extremely difficult to provide a good start for their child early in life, but making it even harder to rejoin the workforce.\\n\\nI've raised two kids myself as a single mom, so I know the financial and logistical strain this issue creates for parents. And the country understands this too: 95% of Americans strongly agree that clean diapers are a basic need for children, and 97% agree that clean diapers are as important as shelter and food.\\n\\nIf we want family support programs like those offered by CalWORKs to be effective, we have to ensure that parents are in a position to take advantage of the help that's available. That's why I have authored two legislative approaches to relieving California's working families of diaper need.\\n\\nAssembly Bill 717 would exempt diapers from sales tax like in seven other states, a simple bit of financial relief for new parents that can add up to the cost of a full month of diapers annually. While the policy isn't explicitly need-based in the same way as the CalWORKs voucher in Assembly Bill 492 that I have also authored, we all agree sales tax is an extremely regressive tax that impacts working families the hardest, costing them upwards of $100 annually on diapers alone.\\n\\nAB 492 provides vouchers to specifically help make diapers more affordable for parents trying to get back to work. This proposal would make sure California's kids are on track for success early, and that parents have every opportunity to get back to work to provide for their families. We're beginning our 2016 efforts this week as the Assembly Committee on Human Services considers AB 492 to finally address diaper need in California, and I hope you'll be with us.\\n\\nAssemblywoman Lorena Gonzalez serves as Chair of the Assembly Select Committee on Women in the Workplace and represents the 80th Assembly District, which includes Chula Vista, National City and the San Diego neighborhoods of City Heights, Barrio Logan, Paradise Hills, San Ysidro and Otay Mesa.

{"original": "RIO DE JANEIRO — The tanks began to roll into Rio de Janeiro on the morning of April 1, 1964, some of them from the neighboring state of Minas Gerais, others from São Paulo. The Brazilian capital had moved to Brasília, the new planned city in the country's interior, a few years prior, but Rio remained the effective center of power, and somewhere in the city, President João Goulart was clinging to power.\\n\\nGoulart, a leftist who became president in 1961, had spent the days prior on the phone with a top military officer, Gen. Amaury Kruel. The general was hoping to prevent the collapse of Brazil's government by urging Jango, as Goulart was known to Brazilians, to fire prominent leftist officials and institute a slate of reforms that would please both the military and the centrist establishment in Congress that opposed Goulart's shifts to the left.\\n\\nGoulart refused. The military marched.\\n\\nBy the next morning, Goulart had fled to Porto Alegre. A few days later, he was in Uruguay. Brazil's democracy had collapsed.\\n\\nFive decades later, on the evening of Oct. 28, 2018, members of the Brazilian military were parading through the streets of Rio again. Green Army jeeps honked their horns and flashed their lights; soldiers stood atop them as flag-waving crowds cheered their arrival.\\n\\nThis time, though, the military was not coming to depose a president; it was rolling through celebrations of a new one. Jair Bolsonaro, a federal congressman and former Army captain, had just won the election to become Brazil's 38th president. (The military later denied it was a parade, saying the soldiers were returning from a mission meant to guarantee the election; a video shot by a journalist depicted, let's call it, a festive procession.)\\n\\nMilitares brasileros desfilan por las calles de Río festejando el triunfo de Bolsonaro y la gente los vitorea. Qué pesadilla. pic.twitter.com/hh1gAiHA0r — Diego Iglesias (@IglesiasDiego) October 29, 2018\\n\\nWhat a nightmare, Argentine journalist Diego Iglesias tweeted in Spanish of the scene.\\n\\nBolsonaro, whose presidency will begin with a New Year's Day inaugural ceremony in Brasília, has routinely praised Brazil's military dictatorship, which gave way to the return of democratic governance in 1985. And his rise to power shares many similarities with the military regime's: Bolsonaro has seized on widespread discontent and fatigue with an incapable and corrupt political establishment, on fervid opposition to a leftist party that had spent more than a decade in power, on an economic collapse that Brazil has only slowly begun to escape, and on rising levels of violent crime.\\n\\nAnd while he has pitched his surge to power as the result of a populist revolt, his base of support mirrors that of the old coup masters: wealthy financial elites, segments of the population willing to trade the rights and lives of the poor and marginalized for their own safety and economic prosperity, and traditional parties and politicians who refuse to acknowledge their own roles in creating the monster before folding themselves into his arms.\\n\\nAP Photo/Leo Correa In this Dec. 1, 2018 photo, Jair Bolsonaro, left, and Minister of Defense Gen. Joaquim Silva e Luna attend a graduation ceremony at the Agulhas Negras Military Academy in Resende, Brazil.\\n\\nMuch like the military once did, Bolsonaro has threatened his leftist political opponents with violence and imprisonment. He has promised to deliver a political cleansing never seen before in Brazil, and threatened media outlets that report news unfavorable to him. His vice president is a former Army general who, in an interview with HuffPost Brazil, refused to rule out a return to military rule, and who has posited — over Bolsonaro's unconvincing objections — that the new administration could rewrite the country's constitution.\\n\\nThis is not exclusively a Brazilian phenomenon. Countries around the world, from Hungary to Turkey to the Philippines, have turned to noisy leaders who promise instant renewals and silver-bullet solutions under the banner of a right-wing, nativist populism ― the preferred term of news outlets, even though the key constituencies backing these candidates tend to comprise the nations' elite.\\n\\nEach major election has become, in part, a referendum on the state of global democracy as a whole. And each victory for a right-wing, anti-democratic figure has paved the way for a similar candidate in the next major election somewhere else.\\n\\nOf the bunch, though, Bolsonaro might be the most pressing threat to a major democracy. Brazil's is the fourth-largest in the world, and the largest by population in Latin America. If it dies, this time, it won't be at the hands of the armed forces. It will be self-inflicted.\\n\\nThere have been very, very few military coups in Latin America over the last 35 years, said Steven Levitsky, a Harvard University political scientist and author of How Democracies Die. So I think that while increased public support for a military coup is troubling, it's much more likely Brazilian democracy will die at the hands of an elected leader.\\n\\nBrazil is about to show the world how a modern democracy falls apart.\\n\\n'Democracy Hasn't Delivered'\\n\\nASSOCIATED PRESS Bolsonaro supporters rally and pray in Brasília ahead of a New Year's Day inauguration ceremony that will make him Brazil's 38th president.\\n\\nIt was still too early for an afternoon beer when I passed the first vendor doling out ice-cold cervejas along São Paulo's Avenida Paulista on a Brazilian summer day in late November.\\n\\nPaulista, which splits one of the city's wealthiest neighborhoods, was closed thanks to a mid-week holiday, storefronts advertised Black Friday sales, and a giant Christmas tree outside one of the shopping malls gave away the approaching holiday season. Locals and tourists alike perused pop-up tents selling handcrafted wooden bowls and art, and loudspeakers blared a pop soundtrack for the people who'd come to do yoga in the street.\\n\\nAside from the occasional bit of political graffiti sprayed onto a lamp post or the sidewalk, there were barely any signs that throughout 2018, Brazilians had repeatedly swarmed Avenida Paulista to demonstrate in favor of and against Bolsonaro.\\n\\nIt was here, in July, that people in São Paulo joined the largest women-led protest in Brazilian history, as women and LGBTQ people who feared Bolsonaro's history of racist, sexist and homophobic statements urged Brazilians to vote for anyone else. Ele Nāo, they yelled ― Not Him.\\n\\nIt was also here that Bolsonaro's supporters gathered in mid-October for a rally meant to push him over the majority threshold he had fallen just short of in the first round of voting. At that demonstration, Bolsonaro, who had been stabbed on the campaign trail in September, told the crowd via a cell phone that, as president, he would target funding for the media and human rights groups. He vowed to give his opponent ― former São Paulo Mayor Fernando Haddad, of the leftist Workers' Party ― and prominent leftist activists two options: Leave, or go to jail.\\n\\nBut by the end of November? Everything feels normal, a friend told me, until you watch the news.\\n\\nFERNANDO SOUZA/AFP/Getty Images Demonstrators take part in a protest against Bolsonaro organized under the hashtag #EleNao (#NotHim), in Rio de Janeiro on Oct. 20, 2018.\\n\\nLike Trump, Bolsonaro is a creature of the rot in his country's democratic institutions that had set in years before he'd entered the picture, or that had been there all along.\\n\\nPower in Brazil has always remained concentrated largely among a white and wealthy elite; literacy and education rates are still low, especially among the poor; an over-militarized and under-trained police force has continued to kill large numbers of poor (and mostly black) citizens; and the return to democracy was marked by more than a decade of economic instability and hyperinflation that perpetuated vast social, racial and income inequality.\\n\\nStill, Brazil has spent much of the last several decades fashioning itself into a shining example of what a democratic Latin America could one day look like. Former President Fernando Henrique Cardoso stabilized the economy in the early 2000s, then leftist President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, a working-class firebrand, presided over a period of rapid growth that had Brazil's economy on pace to surpass those of France and the United Kingdom.\\n\\nOn da Silva's watch, expanded social welfare programs helped some 30 million Brazilians rise out of poverty, and broader affirmative action policies increased educational, health and employment access for black Brazilians, women, the poor and the indigenous. Violent crime fell to its lowest levels in decades. When da Silva left office in 2010, his approval ratings neared 90 percent. Brazil, it seemed, was finally working.\\n\\nOr was it? In 2010, Tiririca, a Brazilian clown, announced a run for a congressional seat in São Paulo and launched a campaign meant to parody the Brazilian political system. Pior do que está não fica, vote no Tiririca, he said: It can't get any worse, vote Tiririca. He playfully satirized the corruption endemic in Brazilian politics, promising that he would enrich every Brazilian family ― especially mine.\\n\\nThen he won, and that victory, in retrospect, might have been a sign of a lurking discontent that Bolsonaro would soon exploit.\\n\\nUeslei Marcelino / Reuters Tiririca, a Brazilian comedian and member of the Lower House of Congress, is congratulated after voting in favor of the impeachment of President Dilma Rousseff in Brasilia, on April 17, 2016.\\n\\nBrazil was already one of the world's most unequal countries in terms of income distribution, and while the poor unquestionably benefited from the Workers' Party's policies ― including a hike in the minimum wage ― the vast majority of the economic gains achieved under da Silva went to the richest 1 percent of Brazil's population. So even as a new lower-middle class earned more than it ever had, Brazil's obscene levels of income inequality likely expanded during the good years. Violent crime had been reduced, but not to levels befitting a developed democracy: Even before the economic collapse, Brazil was home to more than a dozen of the planet's 50 most violent cities.\\n\\nThings got worse: The economy collapsed in 2013, plunging millions out of work and millions more back into poverty. In 2014, a money-laundering investigation turned into the world's broadest political corruption investigation. Known as Operation Car Wash, or Lava Jato in Portuguese, it has implicated hundreds of Brazilian politicians, including da Silva and outgoing President Michel Temer, of the centrist Democratic Movement Party. Violent crime has surged ― there were more than 60,000 homicides in each of the last two years. President Dilma Rousseff, da Silva's hand-picked successor, was impeached in 2016. Da Silva was convicted on money-laundering charges in 2017 and imprisoned this year; Temer has only narrowly escaped trial on bribery charges.\\n\\nCompared with their counterparts across Latin America, Brazilians have always shown a low level of support for democracy. That support has eroded even further amid the crises: In 2017, just 32 percent of Brazilians agreed when Latinobarómetro, which conducts polls across the region, asked if they agreed that democracy may have problems but is the best system of government. No other Latin American nation showed less support for democracy, while other surveys found that nearly two-thirds of Brazilians had lost faith in political parties, the presidency and Congress. More than half of Brazilians said they would support a more authoritarian style of government if it solved problems.\\n\\nIf you ask people on the street if they're worried about what Bolsonaro may mean for democracy, it's not like people are particularly concerned, said Oliver Stuenkel, a political scientist at the Getúlio Vargas Foundation in São Paulo.\\n\\nDemocracy, he said, hasn't delivered what many of us have expected.\\n\\nEven if he were a racist, I would still vote for him. Marcelo Amador Pereira, São Paulo resident\\n\\nThe PT, as the Workers' Party is known by its initials in Portuguese, has received much of the blame for the backlash that fueled Bolsonaro's rise. A great deal of this criticism is legitimate: Da Silva and the Workers' Party had risen to power on something resembling revolutionary hope ― a belief that it could use the established order in Brazil to benefit the poor, without harm – indeed with help – to the rich, as the British essayist Perry Anderson wrote in 2016.\\n\\nBy the time Rousseff was impeached in 2016, to the delight of millions of mostly middle-class and wealthy Brazilians who had marched in the streets demanding her ouster, the party had embraced a brand of economic austerity and engaged in the sort of corruption that alienated many of its own working-class supporters.\\n\\nIn addition to its usual base of elites, the counter-revolution in Brazil could now count on winning at least some support from the PT's natural constituency. Bolsonaro drew support from across the political and social spectrum, even from poor and black voters whom some of his most repressive policy goals will surely target. Polls ahead of the election showed that Bolsonaro led Haddad among black and mixed-race voters and women ― and that he also earned a surprisingly large share of the vote from LGBTQ Brazilians ― despite his racism, sexism and homophobia.\\n\\nEven if he were a racist, I would still vote for him, Marcelo Amador Pereira, a black man who lives in São Paulo and lost his job during the Rousseff administration, told HuffPost Brazil before the election. Because he is running against the PT, and I will not accept any part in what the PT did to Brazil.\\n\\nElite Failure ― And Acquiescence\\n\\nGetty Editorial Protesters hold signs saying Temer Out in Portuguese to protest the unpopular centrist leader who took power after the impeachment of former leftist President Dilma Rousseff. Temer's links to corruption and pursuit of unpopular economic reforms sent his approval ratings into the single digits for most of his two years in office.\\n\\nThe problem with pitching Bolsonaro's rise to power as a purely populist revolt, though, is that the main source of his support was not the poor and working classes that had once fervently backed the Workers' Party, but the same elites Bolsonaro constantly railed against, who have taken almost no responsibility for their role in creating the circumstances that made his ascent possible.\\n\\nHealthy democracy relies on mutual support for a basic set of rules, but in the aftermath of the 2014 presidential election, Brazil's center-right establishment began to disregard the old consensus. The center-right Social Democratic Party, or PSDB, questioned the results of Rousseff's narrow re-election that fall, giving oxygen to fringe social media conspiracy theories that the Workers' Party president had benefited from election fraud.\\n\\nTwo years later, the centrist parties launched an effort to impeach her that looked less like an effort to hold Rousseff accountable than a chance for Brazil's establishment to seize via goo-goo crusade the sort of power it couldn't win at the ballot box — and protect itself from judicial and public scrutiny in the process. For others on the right, including Bolsonaro, it was merely an opportunity to rid Brazil of a leftist government that they claimed had waged a war on God, family and the Brazilian people.\\n\\nPaulo Whitaker/Reuters Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff with Vice President Michel Temer, left, and outgoing President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, right, on Jan. 1, 2011. Since then, Rousseff has been impeached, Da Silva has been imprisoned and Temer has only narrowly escaped trial on bribery charges.\\n\\nOperation Car Wash, meanwhile, has long been viewed as a positive development for Brazilian democracy, an effort to rid the country's political system of the corruption that runs rampant through it. But it's undeniable now, even for the investigation's proponents, that it played a role in undermining democracy instead of bolstering it.\\n\\nOne of the undesired results of the Lava Jato case ― this confrontation of corruption ― is a very extreme polarization of the public debate in Brazil, said Bruno Brandão, the Brazil director of Transparency International. It also discredited the political system and the political class. And more worrisome, it discredited the democratic system itself.\\n\\nThe polarization isn't entirely the result of the corruption investigation ― on the left and the right, the parties of implicated politicians have spent years trying to discredit Car Wash. Temer repeatedly attempted to curtail it; Congress tried to kill new anti-corruption legislation in the middle of the night; da Silva and the PT decried it as an elite effort to destroy the left, which wasn't entirely true, given that a rash of politicians from other parties were removed from office and sent to prison, too.\\n\\nBut the investigators themselves helped undermine the credibility of their cause and, by extension, democracy. Judge Sergio Moro, who spearheaded the Car Wash investigation, was responsible for the conviction of da Silva, who had led presidential polls before he was banned from the race thanks to the corruption case.\\n\\nMoro spent years positioning himself as apolitical, but his pursuit of da Silva took on an air of zealotry. The conviction was criticized as sloppy and legally questionable by independent Brazilian legal experts, and the timing of certain revelations from Moro — wiretapped phone calls between Rousseff and da Silva, released in 2016 in the midst of her impeachment; testimony accusing da Silva, Haddad and the PT of graft, unsealed the eve of the election — suggested the judge was putting a finger on the scales of the cases and, perhaps, the election. (In November, Moro agreed to serve as the head of the National Justice Ministry under Bolsonaro.)\\n\\nThroughout the last two years, Brazilian political observers and journalists assured me not just that Bolsonaro wouldn't win, but that he couldn't. When they didn't ignore him outright, they treated him as a sideshow.\\n\\nBrazil's elites and its media, meanwhile, underestimated the strength of the anti-establishment surge taking place under their feet, or the dynamics allowing it to fester. Over and over again throughout the last two years, Brazilian political observers and journalists assured me not just that Bolsonaro wouldn't win, but that he couldn't. When they didn't ignore him outright, they treated him as a sideshow; surely his worst, most provocative statements would be enough to convince Brazilians he was too radical a reactionary.\\n\\nBeneath the surface, Bolsonaro and his supporters took advantage of social media, amplifying his message across Facebook, Twitter and WhatsApp ― Brazil's most popular social network ― exploiting both the existing distrust of Brazil's largest media outlets and the utility of those social networks for spreading news that was baseless and manufactured out of thin air.\\n\\nMembers of the media and political elite were sure that, with da Silva and the PT seemingly discredited, a moderate, establishment figure from the center-left or center-right would emerge. But Brazilians made their fatigue with the centrist establishment clear: Whereas the Workers' Party still won more seats than any other party in congressional elections, the center-right was crushed in the first round of voting. Cynicism, corruption and the pursuit of unpopular economic policies under Temer had left a vacuum on the right, and along came Bolsonaro to fill the void.\\n\\nBolsonaro wielded corruption as a cudgel against the PT from the start, turning its links to Car Wash into an all-out attack on its legitimacy and right to exist. The left, Bolsonaro suggested on his website, wanted to import ideologies that destroy our identity as Brazilians. That appealed to growing evangelical and conservative movements, as well as segments of the middle classes that opposed the left's social liberalism, and played on a backlash against efforts to advance the civil rights of the poor, LGBTQ people and black Brazilians.\\n\\nThat Bolsonaro had adopted an anti-corruption posture merely as a campaign tactic ― much like Trump's promise to Drain the Swamp ― was evident even before he took office. Bolsonaro's son, Flávio, is already facing questions about potential corruption, and despite pledging that his government ministries would not include anyone convicted of corruption, Bolsonaro has appointed at least seven people who have been or currently are involved in such scandals, according to The Intercept. They include his chief of staff and his finance minister, Paulo Guedes ― the University of Chicago–educated economist and free marketeer whose close ties to Bolsonaro during the campaign gave Brazil's business elite the assurances they needed to cozy up to the supposed populist.\\n\\nAs with Trump, Bolsonaro's attack on corruption went beyond hypocrisy. It was a Herrenvolk appeal — spoils for the dominant class, banishment or marginalization for everyone else — and the tubthumping about corruption fit into larger themes about the contamination of Brazilian identity by the country's underclasses.\\n\\nFor the whole of history, as Hannah Arendt wrote, totalitarians have depended on a coalition between the elite and the mob. In Brazil, as elsewhere, the rise of a new authoritarian required the acquiescence of a patrician class unwilling to accept any of the blame for the systemic ills the country was facing. And while so much media attention was lavished on the ordinary folks who supported Bolsonaro, it was more significant that his levels of support rose with each step up the income ladder, thanks to elites who shared his disdain for the left and were happy to empower a fascist to thwart it.\\n\\nThe worst ills Bolsonaro would inflict would be reserved for the most vulnerable of Brazil's populations, anyway. The elites, as always, are exempt from the pain they cause.\\n\\n'Bolsonaro Can Do Things Trump Can't Do'\\n\\nAFP Bolsonaro will take power with high levels of public support for some of his most dangerous policy proposals — including his calls to allow police officers even more leeway to shoot and kill alleged criminals.\\n\\nIf this all seems to bear a striking resemblance to what happened in the United States, that's no coincidence. Bolsonaro has modeled his ascent to power on the rise of Trump, whose own victory was built on years of democratic erosion.\\n\\nTrump, too, was merely a symptom of a larger disease, a product of declining faith among Americans in their democratic institutions. And Bolsonaro adopted many of Trump's strategies: He, too, encouraged violence against critics, appealed to nativist and racist fears, and suggested that if he lost, it would be the result of political rivals' shenanigans. He also called for imprisoning not just his opponent, but activists who worked on the left. He targeted civil society, suggesting that nongovernmental organizations and human rights groups would be shut down. He promised to give law enforcement even more leeway to kill on sight and decried the media as agents of fake news who were simply protecting the corrupt establishment.\\n\\nBolsonaro's campaign, like Trump's, also made a habit of tossing out increasingly absurd and anti-democratic ideas, often filtered through his son Carlos, a lawmaker who served as Bolsonaro's de facto social media guru. Carlos and vice presidential candidate Gen. Antonio Hamilton Mourão would suggest increasingly radical ideas ― like, say, closing Congress if necessary ― only for the elder Bolsonaro to gently walk them back if a reporter asked about them or if they generated too much scrutiny.\\n\\nThis strategy, deliberately or not, has the effect of making Bolsonaro look more moderate than he is while shifting the very grounds on which he is being evaluated. Now, a Bolsonaro who does everything short of closing Congress, rewriting the constitution or re-establishing military rule starts to resemble a committed democrat.\\n\\nBolsonaro has modeled his ascent to power on the rise of Trump, whose own victory was built on years of democratic erosion.\\n\\nA key difference between Bolsonaro and Trump, though, is that the worst version of the former will have much more damaging effects on Brazilian democracy than the latter has had, or could have, in the United States.\\n\\nBolsonaro can do things in Brazil, potentially, that Trump can't do, Levitsky said, because Brazilian institutions ... are nowhere near as strong as they are in the United States.\\n\\nBolsonaro's ministerial appointments include more former military officers to serve at once in a civilian government than in any since the end of the dictatorship. He has appointed ministers who wield the same paranoid, anti-globalist rhetoric that became commonplace in the early days of the Trump administration.\\n\\nBolsonaro and his choice to head the education ministry, Ricardo Vélez Rodríguez, are supporters of the Escolas sem Partido (Schools Without Party) movement, a previously fringe effort to prevent public schools and universities from indoctrinating students with leftist political ideologies. There were reports in the days after the election that some universities had been raided to rid them of books on fascism, and that professors and other academics who opposed the new president and had described him as a fascist were targeted and harassed.\\n\\nBolsonaro, too, has sent early signals that he will follow through on his threats to seize indigenous lands to open them to mining and agricultural interests; he has said Brazil should integrate its indigenous tribes ― which include those living on protected reservations, as well as uncontacted peoples ― into Brazilian society against their wishes.\\n\\nEven in the best-case scenario, Bolsonaro's Brazil will become even less democratic for the people who already suffer the vast majority of violence and oppression.\\n\\nIt is possible Bolsonaro will govern as a true autocrat ― that he could take advantage of any small crisis to consolidate power and sweep aside democracy in a single act. He could close Congress; he could criminalize the Workers' Party and other leftist opposition parties and movements; he could criminalize dissent, protest and the free press.\\n\\nMore likely is that he will govern in a manner similar to Trump, targeting the press, political opponents and democratic institutions with a constant barrage of criticism that further erodes their credibility among his supporters and the public writ large, and has a chilling effect on legitimate opposition. Bolsonaro refers to nearly everything to his political left as communism, and has said his movement is meant to keep foreign ideologies from making their way to Brazil. Rather than outright dictatorship, Bolsonaro's reign could come to resemble the ugliest anti-left purge in American history.\\n\\nIt sounds like McCarthyism, Alexandre Padilha, a high-ranking member of the Workers' Party who served in da Silva's government, told me. He hates everything that is left in Brazil, and thinks they should be eliminated, basically.\\n\\nTo the right, these fears and the rhetoric that has inspired them are a source of humor. The day before the inauguration, Carlos Bolsonaro ― a Rio councilman and another of the new president's sons ― posted a video on Twitter of his father celebrating police killings and calling his opponents pussies.\\n\\nThe left is crying, he said, mockingly.\\n\\nIn the U.S., Trump's continued attacks have had negative effects on how Americans view their elections, the press and other democratic institutions, and his rhetoric has emboldened racists and white nationalists and potentially contributed to rises in violent crime against racial, ethnic and religious minorities.\\n\\nPolitical violence is already shockingly common in Brazil: In 2018, Rio de Janeiro city councilwoman Marielle Franco was assassinated while leaving an event, and 28 candidates were killed during 2016 election cycle alone. Bolsonaro's insistence that his supporters take aim at Workers' Party politicians could have deadly consequences.\\n\\nHis people have taken their cues: In the days before the election, Bolsonaro supporters proudly destroyed memorials to Franco in Rio, and the symbols of American white nationalism ― including a flag of Kekistan, the mythical country created and worshipped by alt-right fanboys in online forums ― began to show up at Bolsonaro rallies. The night of the election, his supporters waved banners commemorating the former Army colonel who carried out the military dictatorship's torture program.\\n\\nLGBTQ Brazilians, who are already subject to high rates of violence, are also fearful that Bolsonaro's aggressive opposition to their rights will give his supporters license to level even more attacks against them. And Bolsonaro's rhetoric on policing and public security has only emboldened some of the hard-line officers within Brazil's police forces, according to locals.\\n\\nIn São Paulo, a young black writer who lives in a favela on the city's outskirts told me that he had been stopped by police five times in the first three weeks after the election, usually as he was returning to the neighborhood on the way home from work. In Rio, videos circulated last month of two men lying in the street, shot to death, before the police officers who killed them threw their bodies into the back of a pickup truck. Brazil's police already killed more than 4,200 people last year ― in Rio, they were responsible for 1 in every 5 homicides across the state. Bolsonaro will likely make police forces even more deadly.\\n\\nOn this, he will have allies both in and out of politics. Brazilians overwhelmingly support aggressive stances on policing, and amid the violent crime epidemic, more politicians have adopted hard-line stances. Wilson Witzel, the incoming governor of Rio de Janeiro, has said the state will dig graves for the bodies of alleged criminals police kill. Newly elected São Paulo Gov. João Doria, a politician who aligned himself with Bolsonaro during the campaign, has adopted similar rhetoric when it comes to protecting police accused of killing.\\n\\nBrazil's institutions may shield its democracy as a whole. But even in the best-case scenario, Bolsonaro's Brazil will almost certainly become even less democratic for the people who already suffer the vast majority of violence and oppression there, from the state and otherwise.\\n\\nA Model For 'Really Egregious Illiberalism'\\n\\nThe Independent Bolsonaro modeled his rise to power on Donald Trump's. Now, right-wing politicians across Latin America will likely take lessons from Bolsonaro's victory in Brazil.\\n\\nWhere are you from? a woman in São Paulo asked me as our hotel elevator hit the ground floor.\\n\\nWhen I told her I lived in Washington, D.C., she smiled and turned to her child. In Portuguese, she told him that I was from the same place as Trump.\\n\\nEveryone here wants to go there, she said. They say all bad things about him, but everyone here wants to move there.\\n\\nTo many Brazilians who support Bolsonaro, the chaos Trump has sown and the threats to the tenets of American democracy he poses are nothing to worry about. The U.S. economy, after all, is doing well, and Trump is, in their view, responsible. He's an outsider who came in and shook up the system, and the establishment just hasn't learned to cope with that yet.\\n\\nNow, there are others looking to Bolsonaro. In Uruguay, an upstart presidential candidate is already modeling himself as his country's version of Bolsonaro; in Argentina, which faces many of the same economic and corruption issues that have plagued Brazil, similar candidates could soon emerge.\\n\\nThe political right has not done well in Latin America in the last few decades, Levitsky, of Harvard, said. So right-wing politicians are looking around for a new formula, and illiberalism ― really egregious illiberalism ― may be that formula. If he's perceived to be successful, it will be reproduced.\\n\\nBolsonaro wasn't the first right-wing authoritarian to put a major democracy under threat. Neither will he be the last.\\n\\nWe have Bolsonaro because we have Trump, Stuenkel said. We would not have seen the same dynamic here without what happened in the U.S. in 2016. I think that inspired a lot of people who basically learned from Trump.\\n\\nAnd I think that same way, he continued, neighboring countries in Latin America will learn from Bolsonaro.\\n\\nHuffPost Brazil's Diego Iraheta contributed reporting.\\n\\nThis piece has been updated to include the military's assertion that members of the armed forces were not parading through the streets of Rio after Bolsonaro's election."}
{"original": "When the youth-led climate action group Sunrise Movement endorsed Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) for president on Thursday, it boosted Sanders' efforts to cast himself as the Democrat with the strongest commitment to fighting climate change.\\n\\nMore than a boon to his reputation and ground game ― the relatively new group boasts an army of 10,000 mostly college-age activists ― the endorsement has solidified Sanders' stature as the candidate of choice for progressive voters, particularly young ones.\\n\\nIt comes on the heels of endorsements from the Florida-based social justice group Dream Defenders; the national progressive community group network People's Action; and the Center for Popular Democracy Action, a network of community groups that caters specifically to working-class people of color.\\n\\nMy sense is that some parts of the progressive movement felt kind of unprepared by Sanders' successes in 2016 and now feel like they don't want to miss out on being part of it this time around, said Waleed Shahid, a spokesman for the left-wing group Justice Democrats, which has not endorsed in the presidential primary. There's no question that Sanders has been a huge ally of social movements and community organizations and helped them gain a platform on the national level.\\n\\nSanders' hold on the progressive mantle may have seemed like it would be a given. But in September, when the Working Families Party, a network of progressive groups with a presence in over 14 states, endorsed Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), it looked like an activist exodus was underway.\\n\\nStephen Maturen/Getty Images Bernie Sanders speaks at a town hall in Anamosa, Iowa. A run of prominent progressive endorsements is buoying the presidential hopeful's post-heart attack resurgence.\\n\\nTo Sanders, the loss of that endorsement to Warren was especially biting because his political director, Analilia Mejia, was a former head of the New Jersey Working Families Party. Several people with a say in WFP's endorsement process told HuffPost at the time that Warren's team had simply put in more work for it, with Sanders forgoing the opportunity to address WFP delegates in a private address in which Warren and former Housing Secretary Julián Castro participated.\\n\\nAnd the WFP endorsement crystalized a residual sense from the 2016 election that Sanders had not yet mollified critics in the activism community who considered him unduly articulate about and focused on questions of racial justice. His groan-inducing remarks at the She the People conference in Houston for women of color in April and his absence at the Netroots Nation conference in Philadelphia in July contributed to a sense that Sanders had missed his moment. While those activists do not directly affect votes in the early primary and caucus states, they are influential in liberal organizations and websites that help shape perceptions of candidates.\\n\\nA surge in national coverage of Warren finally turned into a polling spike as the summer came to a close. By the time the mid-September debates rolled around, Sanders was enough of an afterthought that superrich individuals and members of the Democratic establishment ― elected officials, donors and operatives ― were training their fire exclusively on Warren.\\n\\nThen, at the start of October, Sanders had a heart attack. For a moment, it seemed like he might be down for the count. The incident kept Sanders off the campaign trail for two weeks and raised fears among Democratic voters about his age and health.\\n\\nBut the prospect of losing him rallied activists to his cause.\\n\\n[Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez] reminded us that he has been so consistent from his time as mayor to his time in Congress on the issues that he's cared about. - Natalia Salgado, Center for Popular Democracy Action\\n\\nIt was that event that really sent a message through the organization that this is an important time and there may not be another time for him to run, and it feels like the whole campaign for him got more focused, said Jeff Link, an Iowa-based Democratic strategist who has not endorsed in the presidential primary.\\n\\nThe post-heart attack endorsement of one activist, in particular, made a world of difference for Sanders: Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), who was reportedly moved by his illness to get off the sidelines.\\n\\nOcasio-Cortez went on to headline Sanders' comeback rally in Queens at the end of October ― the largest of any campaign during the entire primary, per campaign estimates ― and a host of packed rallies in Iowa the following month.\\n\\nHer endorsement helped nudge Stacey Walker, the chair of Iowa's Linn County board of supervisors, into Sanders' corner. And Ocasio-Cortez also played a role in securing Sanders the endorsement of the Center for Popular Democracy Action.\\n\\nShe reminded us that he has been so consistent from his time as mayor to his time in Congress on the issues that he's cared about, said Natalia Salgado, CPD Action's political director. That kind of reminder, for a lot of folks, when we're dealing with an administration as inconsistent and unstable as the one we're dealing with, is so incredibly refreshing but also exciting.\\n\\nAnd as Sanders was showing renewed vigor on the trail and the debate stage, Warren got mired in a debate over her position on Medicare for All that seemed to please neither centrists nor the policy's progressive champions.\\n\\nSanders' consistency on Medicare for All ― he would introduce it right away rather than three years into his presidency ― as well as his support for a moratorium on the deportation of undocumented immigrants were key to getting CPD Action's blessing, according to Salgado.\\n\\nSanders' uncompromising policy stances played a role in other endorsements. Hector Bajaras, a founder of the Deported Veterans Support House, cited Sanders' pledge to roll back a rule requiring the deportation of any undocumented immigrant, including veterans, who commit an aggravated felony, in an endorsement announcement on Wednesday.\\n\\nJoel Sheakoski/Barcroft Media/Getty Images Elizabeth Warren addressed throngs of supporters in Manhattan on Sept. 16, 2019. It was a high point for her campaign, coming the day the Working Families Party endorsed her.\\n\\nRachel Gilmer, a co-executive director of Dream Defenders, which emerged after the killing of Trayvon Martin in 2013 and endorsed Sanders on Wednesday, pointed to Sanders' transformational vision for the political system.\\n\\nWhen asked about his rhetoric on race during the 2016 run, Gilmer disputed critics' arguments that it was deficient, but also conceded, His intersectional analysis grew in 2020.\\n\\nMore than from any policy though, Sanders has benefited from the warmth he exhibits in the small audiences where he has had to court his would-be endorsers, according to Salgado.\\n\\nI'm not sure exactly what happens to him when he is in a room surrounded by the people he had made a career advocating for, but something does click and there is a certain humanity that comes into play that isn't seen on the broader stages, Salgado said.\\n\\nWarren still has her share of wins from which to take heart. In addition to the Working Families Party, she has at her side former Housing Secretary Castro, climate expert Rhiana Gunn-Wright, the group Black Womxn For, and the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, which has adopted the role of attack dog with gusto.\\n\\nOther entities currently sitting out the race include the Indivisible Project, Democracy for America and MoveOn.org. The latter two groups endorsed Sanders in the last election.\\n\\nIn a Thursday article in The Intercept outlining progressive leaders' efforts to preserve unity between Sanders and Warren supporters, Democracy for America revealed that it plans to launch an initiative to defeat the corporate wing of the Democratic Party and bolster both of the New England senators.\\n\\nThe Working Families Party is also keen to make clear its preference for Warren does not amount to contempt for Sanders.\\n\\nOur movements are bigger than any presidential campaign, said Nelini Stamp, the WFP director of strategy and partnerships.\\n\\nIt's not clear what kind of consequences these endorsements will have in the early states — especially in Iowa, where Sanders, Warren and Buttigieg have invested so much of their resources. People's Action has an Iowa affiliate, the Iowa Center for Community Improvement, but most of the other groups do not."}

Doe discussed her concerns about Jones with Jackson Lee's chief of staff, Glenn Rushing, who assured her that Jones would not be hired.\\n\\nHer suit says that she carried on with her role with Jackson Lee and had a good standing with her office until last March, when she shared her plans to take legal action against the CBCF over the alleged assault. Just days later, she said her employment was abruptly terminated, with Jackson Lee's office citing budget concerns.\\n\\nPrior to Ms. Doe telling Mr. Rushing that she was moving forward with legal action, Mr. Rushing and Representative Jackson Lee both stated on several occasions that they were pleased with Ms. Doe's performance, her suit states.\\n\\nDoe's lawsuit maintains that her career was derailed as a result of her firing and that she suffered lost wages.

{"original": "ASSOCIATED PRESS/J. Scott Applewhite Sen. Bernie Sanders has yet to decide whether he will run for president in 2020.\\n\\nBROOKLYN, N.Y. ― Supporters of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) held over 400 house parties in all 50 states and Puerto Rico on Saturday afternoon calling on Sanders to run for president again in 2020.\\n\\nSanders maintains that he is still considering whether he is the best person to defeat President Donald Trump.\\n\\nBut Saturday's show of force, arranged by Organizing for Bernie ― an upstart group founded by Sanders campaign alumni and grassroots activists ― demonstrated one of the senator's biggest advantages if he decides to return to the ring: a network of supporters already familiar with his message and skilled in do-it-yourself internet organizing.\\n\\nSpeaking to the house parties by livestream, Kat Brezler, a Bronx public school teacher and co-founder of the group People for Bernie, called on the participants to use social media to show Sanders the scale of his support with the hashtag RunBernieRun.\\n\\nWe need to convince Bernie Sanders to run. He isn't in this race yet, Brezler said.\\n\\nEmphasizing the policy stakes of Sanders' bid, Brezler added, We need 'Medicare for all,' we need tuition-free college and we need to abolish [Immigration and Customs Enforcement], end mass incarceration, [enact national marijuana] legalization and all of the other reasons why we come to this movement.\\n\\nAlthough Sanders and his campaign team were not directly involved in Saturday's events, the house parties were co-sponsored by People for Bernie and Our Revolution, the latter group created to carry on the mission of Sanders' 2016 campaign.\\n\\nThe livestream, which was broadcast by progressive media upstart Act.tv, had attracted over 100,000 views as of Saturday evening.\\n\\nThe broadcast aimed to push back against a narrative developing in the media that Sanders would have difficulty retaining his 2016 staff, as well as to pre-emptively refute questions about the diversity of his staff and surrogates in a hypothetical 2020 run. In addition to Brezler, the speakers included Nina Turner, president of Our Revolution, and RoseAnn DeMoro, former executive director of National Nurses United. The discussion also featured contributions from Roy Tatem, the former deputy director of Sanders' 2016 African-American outreach; Cori Bush, an African-American nurse and former progressive congressional candidate; and Belén Sisa, an undocumented immigrant activist and former member of Sanders' Latino outreach team.\\n\\nTatem, president of the East Valley NAACP in metropolitan Phoenix, argued that a second Sanders campaign would have greater success in reaching the middle-aged and older voters of color who proved so elusive for Sanders in 2016. The senator would no longer struggle to merely establish name recognition with these voters and inform them about his progressive platform, according to Tatem.\\n\\nNow everybody knows who Bernie Sanders is and about his program for free college, health care for all and actually dealing with police violence, he said. I encourage people to take a look at our racial justice platform in 2016. I'm hoping that we have a campaign so we can really talk about [that].\\n\\nAs Sanders, 77, deliberates whether to toss his hat in the presidential ring, other Democratic candidates are rapidly jumping into the race.\\n\\nSen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), who would very likely be the field's second-most progressive contender after Sanders, announced her bid on New Year's Eve. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii) joined the field on Friday. And former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julián Castro launched his campaign on Saturday.\\n\\nEven though Bernie has not announced yet, the opposition certainly has. RoseAnn DeMoro, former executive director for National Nurses United\\n\\nMeanwhile, Sanders is undergoing scrutiny for complaints that senior figures in his 2016 campaign did not appropriately deal with sexual harassment among campaign staff. Earlier this month, The New York Times reported that some former staffers wanted an opportunity to confront Sanders about the lack of attentiveness to harassment issues, as well as alleged gender pay disparities among the staff. On Thursday, Politico also revealed that Robert Becker, a former top Sanders field staffer, was accused of forcibly kissing a subordinate.\\n\\nAmid pressure to demonstrate that a 2020 campaign would not repeat the same mistakes, Sanders' former campaign manager, Jeff Weaver, announced Wednesday that he would not be returning in that role for a second run. Sanders has also apologized for the mistreatment of some women and promised that his campaign team has already taken steps to improve.\\n\\nIn Saturday's livestream, Sanders allies applied a dual approach to addressing the controversy. On the one hand, DeMoro implied that some of the negative stories were the product of ideologically driven efforts to undermine Sanders.\\n\\nEven though Bernie has not announced yet, the opposition certainly has, said DeMoro, one of the only national labor union leaders to back Sanders in 2016. They're not trying to take Bernie out; they're trying to take the movement out.\\n\\nAt the same time, Sheila Healy, who worked on Sanders' successful 2018 Senate re-election, told supporters that his campaign had implemented much tougher measures to prevent future workplace issues.\\n\\nHealy noted that the Senate campaign had created a human resources hotline which employees could use to report harassment without fear of retaliation or discomfort, provided mandatory sexual harassment training to all staff and volunteers, and made sure that the signs explaining the campaign's anti-harassment policy were posted visibly in all areas.\\n\\nI can say with certainty, if the senator does decide to run, these new policies are going to remain in place in 2020, she said.\\n\\nWe don't know if they can beat Trump. We pretty much know Bernie can beat Trump. Amber Watson, speaking of other potential Democratic candidates\\n\\nIn Lindsey Ullman and Charles Frantz's stylish two-bedroom apartment in Brooklyn's Bushwick neighborhood, about 20 hardcore Sanders fans gathered to watch the livestream over pizza, beer and LaCroix. Following the recommendations of the livestream organizers, they subsequently discussed strategies for improving on Sanders' impressive but ultimately failed 2016 performance.\\n\\nUllman, a graphic designer, and Frantz, a software engineer, knew only two of the attendees beforehand. The people who had signed up for their gathering through the Organizing for Bernie website now displayed their names and preferred pronouns on name tags.\\n\\nThe crowd skewed younger and whiter with a roughly even gender balance. About half of those present were active in the Democratic Socialists of America, a dues-paying organization that saw its ranks explode in the wake of Sanders' 2016 run.\\n\\nSome of the partygoers were convinced that Sanders needed to run because he was the most electable candidate in a head-to-head matchup against Trump.\\n\\nReferring to other candidates, Amber Watson, a sound engineer, said, They haven't run in any presidential elections.\\n\\nWe don't know if they can beat Trump, she said. We pretty much know Bernie can beat Trump.\\n\\nReferring to 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, Russell Whitehouse, a progressive activist and internet entrepreneur, said, It didn't work last time. We ran a centrist last time.\\n\\nBut other attendees simply believed that Sanders is the politician most authentically committed to enacting Medicare for all, free college and the dramatic measures needed to combat climate change.\\n\\nWhat matters is the policies, said Andy Simpson, a Manhattanite who crossed the East River to attend the party.\\n\\nAsked about other rumored contenders' adoption of some of Sanders' core policy positions, like Medicare for all, Dave Crumbley, a standup comic visiting from Ohio, replied, It's lip service.\\n\\nThe fact that Bernie is the only candidate who could inspire this kind of gathering says it all, Ullman said.\\n\\nFrantz offered one caveat: If Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), a former Sanders organizer, were 35 years old ― and thus eligible to serve as president ― she might be capable of generating the same level of enthusiasm.\\n\\nIf she were 35 years old, this party would be for her, Ullman interjected. The other partygoers laughed with approval."}
{"original": "Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, once touted as a progressive rising star who threw her support behind Bernie Sanders in 2016, announced that she's running for the Democratic presidential nomination over the weekend.\\n\\nMuch of the coverage of Gabbard's announcement has focused on the number of foreign policy actions she's taken that have confounded or enraged members of her own party. She secretly met with Syrian dictator Bashar Assad, courted India's right-wing Prime Minister Narendra Modi, voted with the GOP to make it harder for Syrian and Iraqi refugees to come to the U.S., and met with President-elect Donald Trump shortly after the 2016 election amid rumors she was being considered for a job in his administration, which she denied. The news of her presidential run also brought renewed scrutiny to Gabbard's early-career opposition to LGBTQ equality, a position she now says she regrets.\\n\\nAll this is to say, Gabbard doesn't appear to have a solid constituency anywhere within the national Democratic Party, thus making her bid for the nomination dead on arrival.\\n\\nStill, it's worth taking a closer look at Gabbard's positions on LGBTQ rights, an issue she claims she has evolved on in quite an extraordinary way. In the 2020 election, every candidate's record on LGBTQ rights will be critical — and that includes both statements in their past and how they're presenting themselves in the media right now.\\n\\nFor two years, we've lived under a president who has brutally assaulted LGBTQ rights at every opportunity, after having seduced a complacent media into thinking that he'd evolved too and that he was actually more accepting on gay issues, as The New York Times infamously put it. If we've learned anything, it's that we can't trust media narratives on the civil rights views of candidates — narratives often fed to reporters by the candidates themselves.\\n\\nGabbard was an ardent foe of equality for queer people in her younger years, working for two anti-LGBTQ organizations in the late '90s that were led by her father. Mike Gabbard, a Hawaii legislator who helped drive the fight against marriage equality in the state, headed up the Alliance for Traditional Marriage and Stop Promoting Homosexuality, which promoted harmful conversion therapy.\\n\\nThe younger Gabbard, elected to the Hawaii legislature herself in 2002 at the age of 21, railed against homosexual extremists in 2004, coming out against same-sex civil unions in her state. That same year she opposed anti-bullying legislation meant to protect gay students, arguing that it would teach young people that homosexuality is normal and natural.\\n\\nYears later, while successfully seeking a U.S. House seat in 2012, Gabbard portrayed herself as having evolved and apologized for very divisive and even disrespectful positions and comments in the past. And this week she issued a statement apologizing further:\\n\\nFirst, let me say I regret the positions I took in the past, and the things I said. I'm grateful for those in the LGBTQ+ community who have shared their aloha with me throughout my personal journey.\\n\\nGabbard isn't the only Democrat to have evolved since their early years, but few young Democrats held such extreme views so recently.\\n\\nHer statement this week went on to tout her votes for pro-LGBTQ measures during her six years in Congress, including a sweeping civil rights bill called the Equality Act and a proposed repeal of the Defense of Marriage Act. She committed herself to fighting for LGBTQ rights if elected president.\\n\\nIn 2013, Gabbard credited part of her change on these issues to having served in the military before her election to the U.S. House, saying she had witnessed in Iraq the destructive effect of having governments who act as moral arbiters for their people.\\n\\nMike Segar / Reuters Rep. Tulsi Gabbard has recently signaled that her transformation on LGBTQ rights doesn't go very deep.\\n\\nHowever, in a 2016 interview with the publication Ozy, Gabbard suggested that her personal beliefs on homosexuality actually haven't changed:\\n\\nIt was, she says, the days in the Middle East that taught her the dangers of a theocratic government imposing its will on the people. (She tells me that, no, her personal views haven't changed, but she doesn't figure it's her job to do as the Iraqis did and force her own beliefs on others.)\\n\\nIt's not exactly comforting as a gay man to know that a politician decided you should be afforded civil rights as a matter of policy while she still personally thinks you're immoral. But even if we could separate these two things and believe that Gabbard would passionately defend LGBTQ rights the way that, say, now-deceased Sen. Robert Byrd of West Virginia — a Democrat who was once a member of the Ku Klux Klan — became a supporter of civil rights for African-Americans, it's Gabbard's actions right now that are still of great concern.\\n\\nRecently, she wrote a Hill op-ed that was lauded by right-wing publications. In the piece she attacked those like Democratic Sens. Mazie Hirono of Hawaii and Kamala Harris of California who sharply questioned Brian Buescher, a religious extremist nominated by Trump to a federal district court vacancy in Nebraska, accusing them of religious bigotry. Although Gabbard did not name either senator in the op-ed, the fingerpointing was clear.\\n\\nBuescher plainly said during his unsuccessful run for Nebraska attorney general, I do not believe homosexuality should be considered the same way race or ethnicity is considered with regard to anti-discrimination laws which currently apply to race or ethnicity. The Leadership Conference on Civil and Hum­­­­an Rights has come out strongly against Buescher, saying that his track record of partisan activism and deep-seated hostility to LGBTQ equality and reproductive freedom makes him unqualified for the bench and calling him an ideological warrior.\\n\\nHirono and Harris had asked Buescher if he could rule impartially on issues such as abortion and LGBTQ rights, and they had referred to his membership in the Knights of Columbus, the Catholic fraternal organization that is opposed to abortion and same-sex marriage. The questioning touched off a wave of faux outrage on the right claiming anti-Catholic bigotry.\\n\\nThe senators were, however, doing their jobs, questioning a judicial nominee who has used his religious faith to justify his policy positions. For Gabbard to say this amounts to religious bigotry is to drag out another right-wing trope.\\n\\nIt also shows us that Gabbard isn't being honest about her transformation and can't be trusted. Though she says she opposes Buescher's nomination herself, Gabbard's attack should give everyone pause about which voters she was signaling to just days before she announced her presidential candidacy.\\n\\nNo matter that Gabbard's candidacy is likely going nowhere, her op-ed should be a warning sign to voters and those in the media who, as with Trump in 2016, might again buy in to a candidate's claims of evolution while the candidate keeps signaling their actual views.\\n\\nWe can do better.\\n\\nMichelangelo Signorile is a HuffPost editor-at-large.

Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) was accosted by angry Trump supporters at an airport on Friday.\\n\\nAP Photo/Angie Wang Russell Moore is a noted voice in the evangelical community and a longtime critic of President Donald Trump.\\n\\nIn moments of national crisis, the president shouldn't be reaching out just to his own base but seeking to bring the country together, Moore said.\\n\\nThere has to be a time of healing. If the president can't or won't do that, then there are 12 more days left and I think he should take responsibility one way or the other, Moore said. We have to have stable, unifying leadership in this country.\\n\\nOther Southern Baptist leaders have condemned the riot and have even criticized Trump's role in inciting the chaos. But most haven't gone so far as to call on the president to resign.\\n\\nMoore is a longtime critic of Trump and one of the first American evangelical leaders with a national platform to openly condemn the insurrection as it was taking place.\\n\\nThis mob attack on our Capitol and our Constitution is immoral, unjust, dangerous, and inexcusable. What has happened to our country is tragic, and could have been avoided. — Russell Moore (@drmoore) January 6, 2021\\n\\nCharacter matters, he tweeted later Wednesday afternoon, echoing a phrase that white evangelicals used in the 1990s to insist that private immoral behavior should preclude a politician from holding public office ― a standard that they no longer hold as strongly.\\n\\nMoore said on Friday that he was trembling with rage while watching the extraordinary scenes unfold at the Capitol, partly because the rioters were displaying Christian symbolism. Photos and videos from the siege show one rioter holding a sign that reads, Jesus Saves. Another person appears to have entered the Capitol carrying a large white flag with a red cross on a blue canton, which is often called the Christian flag.\\n\\nViolent insurrection and the Gospel of Jesus Christ cannot coexist, Moore said.\\n\\nTayfun Coskun/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images Pro-Trump rioters stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, some carrying signs and flags with religious references.\\n\\nIn addition to an act of domestic terrorism, Moore called the riot a violation of Scripture's calls for Christians to submit to governing authorities and refrain from spreading lies. It could have a damaging impact on evangelicals' efforts to witness to those outside the faith, he added.\\n\\nMoore said Christians have a responsibility to call out this kind of Christian nationalism.\\n\\nThere are people who don't yet know who Christ is, who all they know about Jesus is seeing 'Jesus saves' in the hands of violent insurrectionists who are disobeying the clear commands of Scripture and the explicit words out of the mouth of Jesus himself, Moore said. That is blasphemy."}
{"original": "Conservatives' bizarre, escalating obsession with Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) reached a new level this week when The Daily Caller published fake revenge porn of the new congresswoman.\\n\\nSince Ocasio-Cortez, a 29-year-old working-class democratic socialist, unexpectedly toppled powerful white male incumbent Joe Crowley in a June primary, she's become an object of fixation among Republicans, especially Republican men. Conservative writer Ed Scarry posted a photo of her backside on Twitter, questioning whether her black suit was befitting of a girl who struggles. Right-wing media discovered that she ― like a lot of people named Alexander, Alexandra or some variant thereof ― went by the nickname Sandy in high school. A self-proclaimed proud Christian Dad on Twitter circulated a video of her dancing in a T-shirt in college as if it would be a career-damaging revelation. A Republican strategist referred to her as the little girl on Fox News, which runs segments about her constantly.\\n\\nHere is America's favorite commie know-it-all acting like the clueless nitwit she is...\\n\\n...High School video of Sandy Ocasio-Cortez @AoDespair pic.twitter.com/j3hTnwErib — AnonymousQ1776 (@AnonymousQ17763) January 4, 2019\\n\\nThe obvious explanation is that men have literally never seen a woman in her 20s in the halls of Congress before. She's attractive, telegenic and good at social media. She dances outside her Cannon House office. Conservative men are confused at being drawn to this bright rising star in the Democratic Party while loathing everything she stands for.\\n\\nBut that doesn't fully explain the fervor with which conservatives hang on her every word, waiting for her to slip, and dig through her past for any feeble sign that she isn't who she says she is. There's an existential, panicked tinge to the behavior here ― what you might call AOC Derangement Syndrome. Indeed, some experts say conservative men are obsessed with Ocasio-Cortez because they're threatened by her.\\n\\nConservatives tend to respond to fear more strongly than liberals do, according to Bobby Azarian, a neuroscientist whose expertise in anxiety has led him to examine political behaviors. His research has found that the brains of conservative people are likely to display the same attention biases as the brains of people with anxiety.\\n\\nThe one main cognitive difference is that conservatives are more sensitive to threat, he said. Their fears are sometimes exaggerated. I think they fear her.\\n\\nOcasio-Cortez's power is a direct threat to conservatives because her very existence in Congress as a young, Latina, working-class woman threatens to upend the social order that has kept white men in the ruling class for centuries. (Eighty-eight percent of House Republicans are white men, most are over the age of 50, and the party's voters are majority white and male.) On top of that, she is using her position and platform to directly challenge that order ― to attempt to get money out of politics, raise taxes on the super-rich and level the playing field.\\n\\nShe doesn't just challenge the patriarchy, she's challenging the race, class, and gender hierarchies all at once, as well as the capitalist system that requires member of Congress be wealthy before they get there, said Caroline Heldman, a gender and politics professor at Occidental College. That's remarkably threatening.\\n\\nIn a way, Ocasio-Cortez is the most formidable opponent to President Donald Trump the Democratic Party has put forth yet. She has even more of a knack for social media than America's first Twitter president; she's anti-establishment like he is; she breaks all the rules of how a politician is supposed to behave; and she has an undeniably strong emotional appeal.\\n\\nShe's engaging attention and emotion in people at this visceral level, Azarian said. She has some combination of a lot of features that really seems to give her this ability to go viral. And I think that's what Trump had.\\n\\nThat's why conservatives want and need to undercut her influence. And the most time-tested way to undermine a woman's power is to sexualize her, to make her an object instead of an agent. A 2013 study by the Women's Media Center found that merely discussing a female candidate's appearance has a negative effect on her support from voters.\\n\\nThe moment at which you turn someone into a sex object, you put yourself in a position of authority over them, which is why sexual harassment is classified as being a form of gender discrimination in the workplace, Heldman said. They are the object who exists for you, and you are validating their worth.\\n\\nOr, as former Hillary Clinton campaign staffer Jess McIntosh put it: Defining a woman's value by whether or not men want to have sex with her is the oldest trick in the patriarchy. Either way, she's diminished.\\n\\nThe problem for these men is that Ocasio-Cortez doesn't seem interested in what they think of her. She doesn't seek attention for anything other than her policy ideas and ambition, even though Americans still seem to dislike power-seeking women. The typical strategies men use to devalue women ― sexualizing, dismissing, controlling, teasing, criticizing, interrupting, psychopathologizing, humiliating, abusing, according to one psychologist ― seem to bounce right off her.\\n\\nAlexandria presents a challenge, because conservative men or men in general who are encouraged to objectify women are attracted to her, but she's also 'unmanageable' in that she doesn't exist for them, Heldman said. She is a woman who not only has now formal power, but a lot of informal power, in that she doesn't give a damn what they think of her. I think it's a disconcerting place for men who may be used to attractive women seeking their validation.\\n\\nThat kind of inability to deal with a woman like Ocasio-Cortez is, in many ways, emblematic of the broader crisis facing the Republican Party, which is moving backward in terms of gender diversity in Congress even as Democrats add more women and people of color to their ranks each year. In the 1990s, women were equally distributed across both parties in Congress; today, there are 13 Republican women and 89 Democratic women. Republicans have only ever had one black woman in the House of Representatives, Mia Love of Utah, and she just lost her bid for re-election.\\n\\nThat's a self-reinforcing dynamic, said Laurel Elder, politics professor and head of the gender studies program at Hartwick College.\\n\\nThe way they've talked about some of the new women in the 116th Congress, and the way they've tried to belittle or mock [Ocasio-Cortez], this just makes women feel like, 'Oh, this party is not welcoming of women,' Elder said. 'This is not a place where I'd feel comfortable throwing my hat in the ring.' Now the dynamic has a life of its own.\\n\\nThe obsessive focus on Ocasio-Cortez and her past may not just discourage Republican women from seeking office ― it could intimidate any woman who grew up in the age of social media and is interested in politics but doesn't want to see her adolescent life splashed all over the front pages.\\n\\nFor now, though, Ocasio-Cortez has proven able to parry the attacks, simply by holding up a mirror to the men who are convulsing in anxiety as she rises to influence."}

The year before, 2,437 Iranians applied to Canada for a study permit.

{"original": "YouTube/Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee Daniel Jorjani appears before the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee for his confirmation hearing on May 2, 2019.\\n\\nThe question that Sen. Angus King (I-Maine) asked Daniel Jorjani, then the nominee to serve as the Interior Department's top lawyer, in his confirmation hearing last year was direct: Since you've been in the Department of the Interior, have you had any oral or written contact with any of the personnel associated with Freedom Partners or the Koch brothers' various business or political interests?\\n\\nBefore joining the department in January 2017, Jorjani worked as a high-paid operative at several organizations connected to fossil fuel moguls Charles and David Koch. He held a senior policy position at the Charles Koch Foundation and Charles Koch Institute from 2010 to 2012 and served as general counsel at the Koch-backed Freedom Partners from 2012 to 2017.\\n\\nTo the best of my recollection, Jorjani replied at the May 2019 hearing, I've never had a meeting nor any official communications with them. He subsequently dodged the same question when King asked it in writing.\\n\\nIt turns out the Interior official did in fact have contact with the Koch network.\\n\\nIn April 2017, a few months after joining the Trump administration, Jorjani emailed Brian Hooks, president of the Charles Koch Foundation, to ask if he knew anyone who might want to serve on the board of the National Park Service's official charity, as Yahoo News' Alexander Nazaryan reported Jan. 15.\\n\\nWould any of the stakeholders' families or key network participants be interested in joining the board of the National Park Foundation? Jorjani wrote, according to documents that the Western Values Project, a public lands advocacy group, obtained through a public records request and provided to Yahoo News. It is one of our top-tier boards.\\n\\nThe inquiry ultimately didn't amount to much. An official in the Koch network told Yahoo there was no communication beyond Hooks' initial response, in which he told Jorjani he would have a look and let you know if there's an opportunity to learn more.\\n\\nIn addition to not noting the communication with Hooks, Jorjani didn't mention that he'd had breakfast as many as four times with his former longtime colleague and Koch operative Richard Ribbentrop ― get-togethers that appear on Jorjani's official agency calendars. Ribbentrop was with now-defunct Freedom Partners until at least mid-2016, serving as executive director and senior vice president.\\n\\nJorjani's first meeting with Ribbentrop was on May 3, 2017, a few months after he joined the Interior Department, as freelance journalist Jimmy Tobias noted in a tweet last year. A new batch of calendars that the Western Values Project obtained this month through a public records request and shared with HuffPost show that Jorjani and Ribbentrop had as many as three other scheduled breakfasts between September 2018 and March 2019 ― all of them at the same diner in Arlington, Virginia.\\n\\nJorjani's failure to disclose his contacts with Hooks and Ribbentrop could land him, yet again, in hot water ― not because the man who is now Interior's solicitor violated federal ethics rules, but because he possibly perjured himself.\\n\\nHe appears to have misrepresented the facts to Congress, Virginia Canter, chief ethics counsel at the watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, told HuffPost in an email. That raises the question of whether he knowingly gave a false statement under oath ― in other words, committed perjury. Jorjani did qualify his statement with the phrase to the best of my recollection.\\n\\nInterior Department spokeswoman Carol Danko told HuffPost via email that Jorjani did not recall sending an email [to Hooks] almost 2 years prior, in part at the request of the National [Park] Foundation, that led to no action of any kind.\\n\\nAny suggestion that his answer is somehow controversial is absurd, she said.\\n\\nInterior notified Sen. King's office once Jorjani became aware of the email thanks to a FOIA request, Danko said.\\n\\nDanko did not initially respond to HuffPost's question about whether Jorjani had any other contact with the Koch network. Presented with Jorjani's calendars showing his meetings with Ribbentrop, she said the question posed by King seemed reasonably focused on whether he'd had contact with current employees of Freedom Partners.\\n\\nSince the meeting with Mr. Ribbentrop was clearly posted on Mr. Jorjani's calendar, it was obvious these meetings were publicly disclosed, Danko said.\\n\\nBut only one of the scheduled meetings with Ribbentrop appears on Jorjani's publicly available calendars. The others only surfaced through the Western Values Project's public records request and have not been posted to the agency's website.\\n\\nDanko did not respond to a question about whether the meetings with Ribbentrop were official Interior business but said that it seems silly to spend so much time on this topic.\\n\\nKing's office did not respond to a request for comment.\\n\\nAs for potential violations of ethics rules, Canter said there do not appear to be any. The Trump administration's ethics pledge bars political appointees from participating in certain matters involving former employers or clients for two years, but defines former employer as someone for whom the official worked within two years of their appointment. Jorjani left the Charles Koch Foundation and Charles Koch Institute, where he'd worked with Hooks, in January 2012. (Hooks was also on the board of Freedom Partners, but he became a member in late 2017, months after his communication with Jorjani about the National Park Foundation.)\\n\\nAs for the Ribbentrop meetings, ethics experts suggest ethics rules likely didn't prohibit those because it appears Ribbentrop was no longer employed at Freedom Partners by the time Jorjani met with him.\\n\\nDaniel Boczarski via Getty Images Brian Hooks (left), now CEO and chairman of the Koch network Stand Together, and Charles Koch attend an organizational gathering in Colorado Springs, Colorado, on June 29, 2019.\\n\\nThis isn't the first time Jorjani has faced accusations of perjury. In July last year, Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) placed a hold on his confirmation to the top solicitor post over concerns that Jorjani lied to lawmakers about his role in reviewing public information requests submitted to the department. Wyden also requested that the Justice Department investigate whether Jorjani perjured himself during his May confirmation hearing.\\n\\nAt that hearing, Jorjani, by then Interior's principal deputy solicitor, told lawmakers that I myself don't review FOIAs or make determinations. It was a baffling statement from the person who oversaw the department's Freedom of Information Act program as the designated chief FOIA officer, per a 2018 order from then-Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke.\\n\\nJorjani not only knew about the department's awareness review policy ― under which political appointees were told if their names showed up in documents about to be released ― but often examined records before their release, according to documents made public by the environmental group Earthjustice. CQ Roll Call reported in June that Interior political appointees regularly delayed and in some cases withheld records.\\n\\nInterior's FOIA policy is the subject of an ongoing inspector general investigation.\\n\\nTop Interior officials have repeatedly stressed that improving the agency's ethics program is a top priority. The role of ethics is incredibly important to the U.S. Department of the Interior, Jorjani told lawmakers last May.\\n\\nBut ethics probes have plagued the department under President Donald Trump. Zinke resigned in January 2019 under a cloud of scandal and federal investigations. David Bernhardt became the subject of a probe four days after being confirmed as the new secretary, shortly after The New York Times reported that he intervened to block a scientific report on the threat certain pesticides pose to endangered species. In December, the agency's inspector general concluded there was no evidence that Bernhardt exceeded or abused his authority or that his actions influenced or altered the findings of career [Fish and Wildlife Service] scientists.\\n\\nAnother ongoing inspector general investigation targets six current and former officials who maintained close ties to former employers while at Interior. That probe stems from a complaint by the D.C.-based nonprofit Campaign Legal Center that cites HuffPost's reporting and alleges a disturbing pattern of misconduct across the department.\\n\\nIn a March 2017 email to colleagues, Jorjani boasted that he had successfully protected Interior political appointees facing investigations and that at the end of the day, our job is to protect the Secretary from ethics probes and bad press ― comments that Wyden called particularly troubling in May.\\n\\nThe revelation of Jorjani's exchange with Hooks reaffirms that the Trump administration was dead set on politicizing a board that should have been solely focused on supporting America's national parks, Jayson O'Neill, deputy director of the Western Values Project, said in a statement earlier this month, before the Ribbentrop news.\\n\\nThe Trump administration and Interior Secretary David Bernhardt's cast of corrupt characters are up to more of the same crooked diablerie threatening the future of America's public lands and national parks, O'Neill said.\\n\\nThe Interior Department called the Western Values Project statement another example of the group's incessant, unjustified attacks on Interior Department officials.\\n\\nThe story has been updated with information about Jorjani's multiple scheduled meetings with Ribbentrop."}
{"original": "Getty Dr. Travis Bradberry takes a closer look at 7 mistakes that kill morale, with advice for how managers can do right by their employees.\\n\\nFew things are as costly and disruptive as managers who kill morale.\\n\\nDemotivated employees underperform and then walk out the door at the first opportunity.\\n\\nThe scariest thing is how prevalent this lack of motivation is. Gallup research shows that 70% of employees consider themselves to be disengaged at work.\\n\\nOrganizations know how important it is to have motivated, engaged employees, but most fail to hold managers accountable for making it happen.\\n\\nWhen they don't, the bottom line suffers.\\n\\nResearch from the University of California found that motivated employees were 31% more productive, had 37% higher sales, and were three times more creative than demotivated employees. They were also 87% less likely to quit, according to a Corporate Leadership Council study on over 50,000 people.\\n\\nThe Gallup research shows that a mind-boggling 70% of an employee's motivation is influenced by his or her manager. It's no wonder employees don't leave jobs; they leave managers.\\n\\nMaking Things Worse\\n\\nBefore managers can start creating motivated, engaged employees, there are some critical things that they need to stop doing. What follows are some of the worst behaviors that managers need to eradicate from the workplace.\\n\\n1. Making a lot of stupid rules. Companies need to have rules—that's a given—but they don't have to be short sighted and lazy attempts at creating order. Whether it's an overzealous attendance policy or taking employees' frequent flier miles, even a couple of unnecessary rules can drive people crazy. When good employees feel like big brother is watching, they'll find someplace else to work.\\n\\n2. Letting accomplishments go unrecognized. It's easy to underestimate the power of a pat on the back, especially with top performers who are intrinsically motivated. Everyone likes kudos, none more so than those who work hard and give their all. Rewarding individual accomplishments shows that you're paying attention. Managers need to communicate with their people to find out what makes them feel good (for some, it's a raise; for others, it's public recognition) and then to reward them for a job well done. With top performers, this will happen often if you're doing it right.\\n\\n3. Hiring and promoting the wrong people. Good, hard-working employees want to work with like-minded professionals. When managers don't do the hard work of hiring good people, it's a major demotivator for those stuck working alongside them. Promoting the wrong people is even worse. When you work your tail off only to get passed over for a promotion that's given to someone who glad-handed their way to the top­­­­­­­, it's a massive insult. No wonder it makes good people leave.\\n\\n4. Treating everyone equally. While this tactic works with school children, the workplace ought to function differently. Treating everyone equally shows your top performers that no matter how high they perform (and, typically, top performers are work horses), they will be treated the same as the bozo who does nothing more than punch the clock.\\n\\n5. Tolerating poor performance. It's said that in jazz bands, the band is only as good as the worst player; no matter how great some members may be, everyone hears the worst player. The same goes for a company. When you permit weak links to exist without consequence, they drag everyone else down, especially your top performers.\\n\\n6. Going back on their commitments. Making promises to people places you on the fine line that lies between making them very happy and watching them walk out the door. When you uphold a commitment, you grow in the eyes of your employees because you prove yourself to be trustworthy and honorable (two very important qualities in a boss). But when you disregard your commitment, you come across as slimy, uncaring, and disrespectful. After all, if the boss doesn't honor his or her commitments, why should everyone else?\\n\\n7. Being apathetic. More than half of people who leave their jobs do so because of their relationship with their boss. Smart companies make certain their managers know how to balance being professional with being human. These are the bosses who celebrate an employee's success, empathize with those going through hard times, and challenge people, even when it hurts. Bosses who fail to really care will always have high turnover rates. It's impossible to work for someone eight-plus hours a day when they aren't personally involved and don't care about anything other than your productivity.\\n\\nMaking Things Better\\n\\nOnce managers have eradicated the seven negative behaviors that demotivate their best people, it's time to replace them with the following seven behaviors that make people love their jobs.\\n\\n1. Follow the platinum rule. The Golden Rule (treat others as you want to be treated) has a fatal flaw: it assumes that all people want to be treated the same way. It ignores the fact that people are motivated by vastly different things. One person loves public recognition, while another loathes being the center of attention. The Platinum Rule (treat others as they want to be treated) corrects that flaw. Good managers are great at reading other people, and they adjust their behavior and style accordingly.\\n\\n2. Be strong without being harsh. Strength is an important quality in a leader. People will wait to see if a leader is strong before they decide to follow his or her lead or not. People need courage in their leaders. They need someone who can make difficult decisions and watch over the good of the group. They need a leader who will stay the course when things get tough. People are far more likely to show strength themselves when their leader does the same. A lot of leaders mistake domineering, controlling, and otherwise harsh behavior for strength. They think that taking control and pushing people around will somehow inspire a loyal following. Strength isn't something you can force on people; it's something you earn by demonstrating it time and again in the face of adversity. Only then will people trust that they should follow you.\\n\\n3. Remember that communication is a two-way street. Many managers think that they're great communicators, not realizing that they're only communicating in one direction. Some pride themselves on being approachable and easily accessible, yet they don't really hear the ideas that people share with them. Some managers don't set goals or provide context for the things they ask people to do, and others never offer feedback, leaving people wondering if they're more likely to get promoted or fired.\\n\\n4. Be a role model, not a preacher. Great leaders inspire trust and admiration through their actions, not just their words. Many leaders say that integrity is important to them, but great leaders walk their talk by demonstrating integrity every day. Harping on people all day long about the behavior you want to see has a tiny fraction of the impact you achieve by demonstrating that behavior yourself.\\n\\n5. Be transparent. Good managers are transparent and forthcoming about company goals, expectations, and plans. When managers try to sugarcoat, mask, or euphemize in order to make things seem better than they are, employees see right through it.\\n\\n6. Be humble. Few things kill motivation as quickly as a boss's arrogance. Great bosses don't act as though they're better than you, because they don't think that they're better than you. Rather than being a source of prestige, they see their leadership position as bringing them additional accountability for serving those who follow them.\\n\\n7. Take a genuine interest in employees' work-life balance. Nothing burns good employees out quite like overworking them. It's so tempting to work your best people hard that managers frequently fall into this trap. Overworking good employees is perplexing to them; it makes them feel as if they're being punished for their great performance. Overworking employees is also counterproductive. New research from Stanford shows that productivity per hour declines sharply when the workweek exceeds 50 hours, and productivity drops off so much after 55 hours that you don't get anything out of the extra work.\\n\\nBringing It All Together\\n\\nIf you cultivate the characteristics above and avoid the demotivators, you'll become the kind of boss that people remember for the rest of their careers.\\n\\nHave you seen these motivators and demotivators in action? Please share your thoughts in the comments section, as I learn just as much from you as you do from me.\\n\\nIf you'd like to learn more, my book Emotional Intelligence 2.0 is a great place to start."}
{"original": "As lunch was winding down Wednesday in the Los Angeles Times cafeteria, Bruce Upbin, one of several newly hired but as-yet-unannounced assistant managing editors, sat alone at a table speaking a little too loudly into his headphone mic.\\n\\nUpbin was a mystery to much of the newspaper's staff, which had just voted to unionize the week before. He was one of several similarly unannounced middle-manager types who had come aboard in recent weeks. Although he and the others were listed in the Times' human resources software as having editorial titles, they were reporting to Rob Angel, the Times' chief business development officer. These new L.A. managers had also been working on the second floor, despite the newsroom being on the third. And, of course, there was the bizarre fact that they had yet to be introduced to any of the actual newsroom staff of about 400.\\n\\nOne L.A. Times employee, who spoke to HuffPost on the condition of anonymity, overheard Upbin say they were creating a national newsroom outside of the union, to service all of Tronc's markets. Tronc, formerly Tribune Publishing, is the owner of the L.A. Times, along with other newspapers in 10 markets across the country.\\n\\nUpbin also mentioned that he had a total of five people to hire. This was the closest thing Times employees have gotten in weeks to a real answer about what the company is up to — and it was a confirmation of some of their worst fears.\\n\\nThe new management team is apparently being framed as part of a reorganization, according to Harvard's Nieman Lab. Since being hired in October, L.A. Times Editor-in-Chief Lewis D'Vorkin has quietly brought on a number of editors from around the country. In addition to Upbin, who had worked with D'Vorkin at Forbes, he hired former Fox Sports executive Steve Miller as an assistant managing editor for digital; Louise Story, a renowned former New York Times reporter, as managing editor; The Washington Post's Sylvester Monroe as an assistant managing editor; and Will Tacy of Good Media as an editor.\\n\\nHello @sylvestermonroe @louisestory @bupbin @tacyw ! Those of us in the @LATimes newsroom would love to hear what you all are doing here! — Robin Abcarian (@AbcarianLAT) January 23, 2018\\n\\nWith the exception of Miller, none of these new managers has been announced to the public or even to the staff itself. And the only reason anyone knows any of this is thanks to the company's internal HR software, which has proved to be one of the only windows into management's thinking. HuffPost spoke with 12 current and former Times employees, all of whom asked to remain anonymous for fear of retribution. They described an atmosphere of intense secrecy, distrust and anxiety as they try to get to the bottom of a story they're living instead of reporting: What exactly does Tronc have in store for them?\\n\\nThe newsroom has basically become a large-scale intelligence operation to figure out what the fuck our managers are up to, one current employee explained. And though the newsroom did discover bits and pieces, Upbin helped tie the whole thing together. Staffers fear that Tronc is building a shadow national newsroom — non-union, of course — that would duplicate not only parts of the L.A. Times union staff but that of other Tronc properties as well, making the union employees expendable. And, although Tronc and L.A. Times senior management — which includes D'Vorkin, Times President Mickie Rosen and CEO and Publisher Ross Levinsohn, who is currently on a leave of absence following allegations of sexual harassment — have refused to offer any clarity about what this might mean, much less acknowledge the existence of a new national operation, you can only stonewall a roomful of reporters for so long before they start digging on their own.\\n\\nD'Vorkin and the newly hired managers did not initially respond to HuffPost's requests for comment. On Jan. 29, after this story was first published, Louise Story told HuffPost, I had agreed to work at Tronc and at The Los Angeles Times in very high-level managerial roles. But, as a result of recent significant changes in those roles, I decided not to work there in any capacity. I'm sorry that I won't get to join the scores of great journalists who work there.\\n\\nA Shadow Scab Outfit\\n\\nPart of what makes these new hires' roles so difficult to pin down for staffers, though, is a curious little trait shared by all of Tronc's new managerial hires (and at least a few non-managerial ones): They've all actually been hired under a different company than the one employing every other editorial employee on staff. Though union L.A. Times staffers are all employed under Los Angeles Times Communications LLC, according to the same internal HR system that revealed the existence of these hires in the first place, these mysterious new employees have been hired under a Tronc company that was renamed Los Angeles Times Network LLC in November, as reported earlier Friday by Nieman Lab's Ken Doctor.\\n\\nIf you look on the California Secretary of State's website, you'll find the name change filing below.\\n\\nCalifornia Secretary of State\\n\\nThe new L.A. Times entity first came to the attention of newsroom employees when they saw an LA Network referenced in a Tronc job listing.\\n\\nGlassdoor\\n\\nEmployees realized this was likely the network mysteriously referenced in a slide from a presentation Levinsohn gave on Jan. 18, the same day sexual harassment allegations against him came out. This presentation was ostensibly about an upcoming network of unpaid contributors, along the lines of the one D'Vorkin implemented at Forbes.\\n\\nTRONC\\n\\nAccording to both a former employee and a current staffer, Levinsohn wasn't explaining the full picture. In addition to this free contributor network, Tronc is apparently planning to create a series of specialized teams, called verticals, that will exist entirely within this new L.A. Times Network, which is being referred to internally as NewCo and which exists as part of the business side — not editorial, as one would expect from a news operation. Each of the new managers is supposedly presiding over a different vertical, multiple employees told HuffPost. For instance, Monroe will head up a vertical covering race issues, Upbin will be overseeing the tech vertical, and Story, who is in New York, will take on an investigative vertical. The work created under these verticals, both from professional and non-professional contributors, will then be distributed across not only the L.A. Times but also Tronc newspapers nationally.\\n\\nComplicating this is the fact that many of these non-union verticals already exist under the actual L.A. Times editorial operation, which strives to maintain a strict separation from any business interests. (The paper has a history of trampling the line between business and editorial.) Some employees worry this is a precursor to layoffs for the union staffers, whom Tronc seems to be actively making redundant. Another possibility is that Tronc will focus on building up a non-union workforce under NewCo and kill the union through attrition.\\n\\nOn Jan. 19, the newsroom voted overwhelmingly to unionize, 248 to 44, with the NewsGuild. Given the turmoil in recent days, the union sent a note to members informing them of their so-called Weingarten right to be accompanied by a union representative in any meeting with management in which discipline seems possible. After workers vote to unionize, a company generally has to keep the status quo in place as the parties bargain toward a contract, meaning that, legally speaking, it would be tough for the company to fire a bunch of newsroom staffers and give their work to new non-union workers.\\n\\nThe NewsGuild declined to comment, but the standard union move here would be to demand information from the company on any new hires and where they fit in with the current organization. As one staffer put it, Our strategy right now as a union is to find out everything we can and to raise our voices without fear of individual repercussions.\\n\\nWhatever its intentions, management is taking no steps to assuage staffers' concerns.\\n\\nAt a recent meeting that D'Vorkin held with a group of reporters and editors, one employee asked what Levinsohn's Jan. 18 presentation meant for Times staffers. D'Vorkin didn't have an answer, according to a current employee and a former employee. I didn't see Ross's presentation was all he would allow. Staffers pressed him, explaining that that's not what they'd asked — they had asked what was going to happen to them. I didn't see Ross's presentation, he said again.\\n\\nThe Los Angeles Times is like a Soviet circus right now, said one current employee. Propaganda. Dancing bears. Mercurial leaders who say weird shit. People who disappear. It sucks, because we have a good team here.\\n\\nBlurred Boundaries\\n\\nThe company may not have officially explained what this hazy border between the Times and the business side of Tronc actually means, but its effects are already causing trouble for the paper's increasingly anxious staff.\\n\\nLast week, Dan Strauss, senior vice president and general manager for entertainment and lifestyle, met with a group of entertainment section editors. Strauss, who works at the Times under the Tronc business side, introduced several of the editors to Christina Schoellkopf, who is listed internally as a senior social media manager and who Strauss said would be running the entertainment social channels on a day-to-day basis. Schoellkopf, however, had been hired under NewCo, meaning she was technically a business employee and reported directly to a business manager.\\n\\nWhen an editorial staffer raised an objection to someone from the business side running accounts that were supposed to represent the news outlet, according to an employee, Strauss said simply: We're all on the same team. We all work for the L.A. Times. When the employee noted again that the two sides were supposed to be separate, Strauss said that they would take the conversation offline and discuss it later. They did not discuss it later.\\n\\nIn an email addressed to D'Vorkin and Miller that eventually got forwarded around the newsroom, Jessica Roy, the audience engagement editor, plainly laid out the reasons for her and her team's discomfort:\\n\\nLewis and Steve- I wanted to raise some concerns I had based on my meeting this morning with Dan Strauss and the entertainment editors. Dan informed us that he has hired Christina Schoellkopf as a senior social media manager, and that she would be assuming responsibility for all entertainment editorial social media accounts. I have serious concerns about an employee who was vetted, hired by and reports to the business side of the Los Angeles Times making editorial decisions and assuming publishing control of our brand on social media. Such an arrangement is unprecedented in this newsroom ― and is not the standard practice in most newsrooms. Our audience has an expectation that these accounts are independent from the business side in the same way print readers expect that editors choose the stories on the front page. What we post on social media and how it is framed is an extension of the journalism that we do here at The Times, and it should come from our editorial side. Over the past few years, my team has guided best practices and style across all social media channels, including Entertainment. When we trained the WebEnt producers to do this, we went over things like photo permissions (which photos we legally can and can't tweet, for instance), the L.A. Times voice on social media, our policy for corrections on social media, and general best practices. Furthermore, journalists in the newsroom adhere to certain guidelines and standards. We carefully craft social media messages to maintain both the objectivity of our work and the trust of our readership. I am deeply concerned this violates the separation between editorial and business. At the least, this infringes on the structures that ensure our editorial independence. I wanted to raise this issue with both of you to get your perspectives. -Jessica Roy Co-signed by the entire audience engagement team\\n\\nD'Vorkin replied thanking her and assuring the team that there would be more discussions to come. When, exactly, D'Vorkin intends to hold those discussions remains unclear.\\n\\nThe secrecy surrounding both the editorial staff's future and NewCo hires in general has begun to take its toll on the staff.\\n\\nThey're creating these supposed management jobs, and they're not opening any of them to the people currently on staff, said a current employee. So no matter how many Pulitzers you've won, what your reputation is, [newsroom employees] have not been given the opportunity to apply for any of these jobs. D'Vorkin won't even answer questions about them.\\n\\nThe Crackdown\\n\\nThough he has so far refused to answer any questions, D'Vorkin has been plenty busy asking them. According to multiple current and former employees, D'Vorkin is still livid about an article that appeared in The New York Times in November. That paper had obtained a recording of a meeting in which D'Vorkin forbade Los Angeles Times staffers from recirculating their own recent investigation into Disney's business ties with the city of Anaheim. A couple of months later, NPR obtained a recording of a second meeting, in which D'Vorkin berated his staff for the first leak: At its core, it was unethical. And frankly, I think it showed a degree that whoever was involved was morally bankrupt.\\n\\nNow, according to several employees, D'Vorkin is determined to find the leaker in his midst, and Tronc is supporting the cause by sending human resources executive Dyana Burke to L.A. to assist the investigation. According to one former employee, They had to bring her in because there are no HR people left at the L.A. Times. Cindy Ballard, Tronc's former chief HR officer, resigned in December. Ballard, in the words of one former employee, was the architect of the masthead purges in August, in which the editor-publisher, a managing editor, a deputy managing editor and an assistant managing editor were axed.\\n\\nD'Vorkin is also getting proactive about leaks, multiple staffers worry. They expressed concerns that Tronc was monitoring company phones and computers — and apparently they have reason to be worried. One former staffer noted that people are being hauled before D'Vorkin and Burke to explain why, for example, they had an 11-minute conversation with Sydney Ember of The New York Times on a particular date. Staffers have been using encrypted messaging apps, such as WhatsApp, to speak with one another, with some going so far as to buy actual burner phones to discuss their own newspaper.\\n\\nIt strains belief that the editor-in-chief of a major newspaper, with all the other issues and challenges confronting the LAT, is conducting a leak investigation of his own staff, a former employee told HuffPost. That's the kind of thing the FBI and NSA do to persecute journalists. To see an editor do it is dumbfounding, and sickening.\\n\\nMultiple staffers said that this investigation is what led to business editor Kimi Yoshino's removal from the building on Wednesday. Management hasn't explained why Yoshino was escorted off the premises and suspended for two days. But a former employee and a current employee both pointed to the Disney story that caused D'Vorkin so much grief, which Yoshino edited.\\n\\nThe staff of the Business section just sent the following letter to @latimes Editor in Chief Lewis D'Vorkin. I want to add that @kyoshino is the best boss I've ever had - smart, kind, compassionate and fair. Hope she's back in the newsroom soon. pic.twitter.com/F8UcuUe9UN — Andrea Chang (@byandreachang) January 25, 2018\\n\\nThat Yoshino edited the Disney investigation is particularly significant considering that multiple current and former employees commented on D'Vorkin's particularly rough treatment of Yoshino, with one describing his behavior toward her as harshly critical and caustic. Yoshino declined to comment.\\n\\nA recent profile of D'Vorkin in the Columbia Journalism Review, titled LA Journalism's 'Prince of Darkness,' noted that even those who speak positively about him acknowledge he can be difficult, threatening, and, in the words of one writer who worked with D'Vorkin for more than four years and actually likes him, 'without journalistic ethic.' Though D'Vorkin has been in his position for only a few months, he's made sure to leave a mark, with one employee noting that he's at war with the entire staff. It's incredible.\\n\\nStill, though the current editorial staff has fluctuated somewhere between misery and terror, the recent landslide union victory has offered some consolation. People have zero confidence in top management, said one current employee. Nobody believes a word that comes out of Lewis' mouth. They're pushing a business plan from 10 years ago. And yet people are banding together, and we are still doing what we've done since 1881, which is putting out the goddamn paper every day.\\n\\nUPDATE: Jan. 27 — The Los Angeles Times Guild organizing committee has released a statement demanding that Tronc's management team explain its plans for their future and reminding Tronc of the Guild's rights as employees, saying, As journalists, we demand transparency from the people we cover. As employees of the Los Angeles Times, we demand the same of the executives who run our company. You can read the Guild's statement in full here.\\n\\nThis story has been updated to include comment from Louise Story.\\n\\nCORRECTION: An earlier version of this article said that executive Dan Strauss met with the newspaper's audience engagement team. He met with a group of Times entertainment editors. Also, Yoshino was removed from the building on Wednesday, not Thursday."}
{"original": "Progressive activists and experts are calling on President-elect Joe Biden to expand his policy ambitions after two Democratic Senate victories in Georgia on Tuesday.\\n\\nGiven Democrats' existing hold on the House and the White House, the party will now have unified control of the federal government for the first time since the first two years of the Obama administration, when Obama enacted his most significant pieces of legislation.\\n\\nThese liberals, who have sometimes been critical of Biden, are encouraging the president-elect to take advantage of what is likely to be a narrow window to enact legislation with little Republican obstruction.\\n\\nUnified control of the government is extremely rare in American politics and the next nine months could be the last time they have unified control for another 10 years, said Waleed Shahid, a spokesperson for Justice Democrats, a left-wing group that has hired a political director to advance its agenda on Capitol Hill. Delivering results is much more important than bipartisan branding or anything like that.\\n\\nAdam Green, co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, sounded a similar note. The ceiling of possibility is higher for everything we want to do, he said.\\n\\nKevin Lamarque / Reuters After Democrats' takeover of the Senate, progressives closer in ideology to Sen. Sanders Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) than President-elect Joe Biden, see a chance to push Biden left.\\n\\nWith that in mind, prominent progressives are calling on Biden to immediately deliver on his promise of $2,000 relief checks, as well as to pass a robust COVID-19 recovery package, enact sweeping democracy reforms, cancel student debt, and roll back the Trump tax cuts.\\n\\nWhen it comes to the question of $2,000 payments and more comprehensive COVID-19 relief, such as expanded unemployment benefits and aid to state and local governments, progressives stand to serve as allies of Biden against both Republicans and the handful of conservative Democrats who are already indicating that they plan to break with Biden on the urgency of economic action.\\n\\nSen. Joe Manchin, a conservative West Virginia Democrat, who is due to hold immense veto power as a critical swing vote in a 50-50 Senate, told The Washington Post on Friday that he disagrees with Biden and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer's insistence that the Senate prioritize $2,000 payments to low- and middle-income households. Instead, Manchin said, Getting people vaccinated should be the first order of business.\\n\\nIf Manchin's hesitation prevails, Democrats can be credibly accused of failing to uphold a central election promise. On the eve of Ossoff's and Warnock's victories in Tuesday's Senate runoffs, Biden vowed to prioritize the checks if Democrats won the Georgia contests and retook the Senate in the process.\\n\\nThe left and Biden are probably united in the sense that bold economic relief, both on humanitarian grounds and political grounds, is going to be key for the success of the administration, a senior aide to a progressive member of Congress, who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak on the matter, told HuffPost.\\n\\nA key reason for the activist left's emphasis on economic recovery funding is its experience with the first two years of the Obama administration. Progressives blame deficit hawks in the Obama White House for blocking economist Christina Romer from presenting Obama with an option for a stimulus package that exceeded $1 trillion ― a figure closer to the size of the hole in the economy than the roughly $800 billion bill Obama ultimately settled on.\\n\\nAs a result, the unemployment rate was nearly 10% going into the 2010 midterm elections, contributing to the dismal environment that cost Democrats the House and limited Obama's political capital for the remainder of his presidency, these progressives maintain.\\n\\nJustice Democrats, the climate-focused Sunrise Movement and their allied think tank, Data for Progress, and media firm, New Deal Strategies, have also sought to counter claims that Democrats' disappointing performance in November's congressional races is due to left-wing activists' adoption of unpopular slogans like defund the police. Instead, they argued in a joint memo that Democrats failed to adequately articulate the ways they planned to materially improve voters' lives, noting, for example, that two losing Democratic Senate candidates failed to use the words jobs or economy in any digital ads.\\n\\nGetty Images Rev. Raphael Warnock, left, and Jon Ossoff flipped two Georgia Senate seats for Democrats. Progressives see their successful use of a fight over $2,000 payments as a model.\\n\\nAhead of the Georgia Senate runoffs, Justice Democrats and Sunrise teamed up once again in December to argue that Biden and Democrats should turn the Jan. 5 Senate contests into a referendum on the inclusion of $1,200 checks in a COVID-19 relief bill. Around the same time, Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) mounted a public push for a second round of $1,200 payments ― Americans received $1,200 checks from the CARES Act in March ― along with an additional $500 for every child. Their pressure campaign, backed by the Congressional Progressive Caucus, helped ensure the addition of a $600 stimulus in the bill that Congress passed shortly before Christmas.\\n\\nAfter President Donald Trump insisted at the last minute that a relief bill provide $2,000 checks, House Democrats immediately passed an amendment increasing the stimulus payment by $1,400 that then-Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) blocked in the Senate. The issue would end up becoming a critical political cudgel for Warnock and Ossoff, the victorious Georgia Senate Democrats, to wield against their Republican opponents.\\n\\nRunning against a Republican Senate blocking popular relief payments was a powerful message, Shahid said. The basic multiracial populist approach of their campaigns is a great roadmap for Democrats across the ideological spectrum.\\n\\nBeyond immediate COVID-19 relief, progressive divergences from Biden are likely to grow.\\n\\nOne reason is that Congress is limited to one budget reconciliation bill per fiscal year, restricting how much legislation it can pass with a simple majority and heightening competition for what takes precedence. Because Congress has not yet used a budget reconciliation bill in Fiscal Year 2021, which began in October, it can pass one such bill for FY2021 and another such bill for FY2022.\\n\\nGreen suggested that Biden use one of the reconciliation bills to pass the $2-trillion clean energy jobs plan, which the PCCC co-founder called the centerpiece of Biden's 'Build Back Better' agenda.\\n\\nWe should raise [the tax rates] because rich people should have less wealth and power. Marshall Steinbaum, economist, University of Utah\\n\\nMarshall Steinbaum, a progressive economist at the University of Utah, favors using one of the reconciliation bills to repeal all of the Trump tax cuts. Trump's 2017 tax cut bill lowered personal income tax rates, doubled the exemption for the estate tax on the assets of the super-rich and lowered the top corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%.\\n\\nCorporations' decision to spend much of their tax savings on massive payouts to shareholders undercuts the idea that the tax cuts spur economic investment, according to Steinbaum.\\n\\nThe corporate tax rate is an effective tax on the people who own profitable corporations, which is to say, rich people, he said. We should raise [the tax rates] because rich people should have less wealth and power.\\n\\nThus far though, congressional Democrats have shown the most interest in removing the federal income tax deduction for state and local taxes, which mainly affects upper-middle-class homeowners in blue states. Biden has already promised not to raise taxes on households earning less than $400,000, and wants to restore the corporate tax rate to 28%, not its pre-Trump level of 35%.\\n\\nBiden is more likely to take Steinbaum up on a more modest suggestion: that he use the Congressional Review Act, a law enabling passage of some regulatory changes with a simple majority, to rapidly undo the Trump administration's evisceration of Obama-era rules protecting workers and the environment.\\n\\nWhen it comes to legislative priorities neither eligible for either budget reconciliation, nor the Congressional Review Act, Democrats are constrained by the threat of a Republican filibuster.\\n\\nThat makes the prospects for passing democracy reforms, another top progressive priority, seem bleak. Democracy reform refers to political process changes ranging from the adoption of public campaign financing and an end to partisan gerrymandering, which House Democrats have already approved, to more ambitious goals like bestowing statehood on the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico.\\n\\nOne process change that would create room for additional reforms would be the abolition of the filibuster, which only requires a simple Senate majority vote. Manchin already flatly declared his opposition to abolishing the filibuster after the November election.\\n\\nBut progressives want Biden, who has stopped short of outright opposition to the move, to press the matter with Manchin and other reluctant moderates.\\n\\nShahid of the Justice Democrats envisions the possibility of winning Manchin over with giveaways directed to West Virginia, where 16% of people live in poverty.\\n\\nYou can imagine that there might be something like the 'Cornhusker Kickback' ― or the 'Coal Miner's Kickback' in this instance, for Joe Manchin, said Shahid. (The Cornhusker Kickback was the nickname for a short-lived backroom deal that then-Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) cut with then-Sen. Ben Nelson (D-Neb.) in 2009 to secure Nelson's support for the Affordable Care Act.)\\n\\nGreen predicted that Senate Republicans' excessive use of the filibuster against popular legislative priorities might eventually soften Manchin's opposition to getting rid of the tool ― or at least, dramatically curtailing its use.\\n\\nJoe Manchin might not support filibuster reform on Day One, but if Republicans try to obstruct coronavirus relief on Week 3, he might support filibuster reform on Week 4, Green said. Make it less of a process issue and more of a substance issue. Give Republicans a rope to hang themselves with."}
{"original": "It's hard to find agreement in the politically polarized environment of Washington, but there's one thing on which members of both parties can agree: Congress sucks.\\n\\nIt sucks to be a congressman. It sucks to be a congressional staffer. And it probably really sucks for their spouses, partners and children. New and old members alike have been speaking out of late.\\n\\nThe way we've done things around here for the past 10 years pretty much sucks, Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.) said in January 2018 as he called on Senate leadership to let senators vote openly on immigration reform proposals.\\n\\nThis is a disgrace, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) tweeted after meeting congressional staffers who also worked as bartenders due to low federal pay.\\n\\nCongress is increasingly unable to comprehend a world growing more socially, economically and technologically multifaceted — and we did this to ourselves, Rep. Bill Pascrell (D-N.J.) wrote in The Washington Post on Jan. 11.\\n\\nCongress has gutted its own capacity to develop legislation and perform oversight, Pascrell explained, an act that has helped shift power away from Congress and toward the executive branch. But now it has an opportunity to reverse its self-imposed lobotomy and empower individual members again ― in the House of Representatives, at least. (Sorry, Sen. Kennedy.)\\n\\nEarlier this month, the House voted 418-12 to create the Select Committee on the Modernization of Congress to try to fix things. The select committee is charged with producing proposals related to staff pay, retention, benefits and diversity, technology and innovation, and House procedures, including the schedule, the way bills get to the floor and other assorted administrative issues. It will consist of six Democrats and six Republicans appointed by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) and will require bipartisan support to issue its final report of proposals that the full House could take up. Rep. Derek Kilmer (D-Wash.), the committee's chairman, is the only member named so far. The committee will have until the end of 2019 to issue a report of recommendations to the full House before it disbands. And if it works, it could change the way Congress does business.\\n\\nHow Congress Got Here\\n\\nSusan Walsh/ASSOCIATED PRESS Rep. Derek Kilmer (D-Wash.), at a ceremonial swearing-in on Jan. 3 with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, will chair the new Select Committee to Modernize Congress.\\n\\nThis isn't the first time Congress has tried to modernize itself. The two major congressional reorganizations in the past century occurred in 1946 and 1970 in response to the revolutionary expansions of the executive branch for President Franklin Delano Roosevelt's New Deal and President Lyndon Baines Johnson's Great Society. Later modernization efforts undercut the authority of committee chairmen, made committee hearings open to the public, expanded subcommittee staff, streamlined committee jurisdiction and implemented new ethics rules.\\n\\nThe last time Congress convened a committee to study how to make Congress a better place was in 1993. The committee's proposals failed after House Democratic Party leadership balked at suggestions that would have undermined their power. Then Democrats lost control of Congress. The new Republican majority, led by Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.), implemented some of the commission's modernization reforms but, more important, slashed Congress' budget, dramatically reduced staff levels, eliminated entire research support agencies and centralized power more than ever in party leadership offices.\\n\\nIn the last 25 years, the Government Accountability Office has shed 2,000 employees. The Congressional Research Service is down 100. The Office of Technology Assessment and its 150 experts were entirely eliminated in 1995 — two years after the invention of the World Wide Web. House congressional committees have shed around 700 staff over the same period of time, while the House overall has seen a slight decline in staff. This underfunding has also left Congress to deal with an antiquated technology system and no team of experts to update and innovate. This capacity decline occurred as the U.S. population rose by 80 million.\\n\\nStaff pay has stagnated over the same period — and in recent years has even fallen. From 2009 to 2013, the median pay for House counsels dropped 20 percent, and for House legislative directors and assistants, pay fell 13 percent. Senate staff saw similar percentage drops in median pay. This happened just as the cost of living in Washington, D.C., and the surrounding suburbs soared. The median home price in Washington is now above $600,000.\\n\\nAt the same time, power in Congress has been centralized in leadership offices. This has made it almost impossible for lawmakers to work on legislation independently of leadership and get a vote on the floor. This centralization began in the 1980s under Democratic Speaker Tip O'Neill but accelerated under Gingrich and his successor, Speaker Dennis Hastert (R-Ill.), who refused to bring any bills to the floor that did not have majority support within his own Republican Party caucus. This has meant any legislation that might have cross-partisan support but is not supported by leadership has no chance of getting a vote on the floor. This is how former Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) blocked the Yemen War Powers resolution, a bill to end U.S. support for the Saudi war in Yemen that had backing from Republicans and Democrats.\\n\\nThat some bills with broad bipartisan support can't even get a vote is very frustrating, said Kevin Kosar, vice president for policy at the R Street Institute, a libertarian think tank that supports the select committee. Members of Congress ― they want to come [to Washington] and they want to work on bills, and then they want to see those bills voted on.\\n\\nThe Problems\\n\\nRICHARD ELLIS via Getty Images Former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) dramatically cut Congress' budget when he took office in 1995.\\n\\nStagnant pay and reduced staff are ethics and corruption problems. The lobbying, consulting and corporate-funded think tank industries boomed over the past three decades as Congress gutted itself. Corporations actually spend more money on lobbying in Washington than Congress spends total, according to a study by New America fellow Lee Drutman.\\n\\nThe reason why the lobbyists are powerful is because Congress is weak, Daniel Schuman, policy director at Demand Progress, a progressive nonprofit, said.\\n\\nStagnant pay and fewer options for advancement, combined with student loan debt and the high cost of living in Washington, pull staffers into the private sector.\\n\\nYou take all your experienced staff and you drive them off the Hill, Schuman said. They hit 30 and they don't want to live in a row house, and, you know, they want to be able to have enough money to pay for day care or they meet a special someone and they can't afford to stay on the Hill. It takes the people who are experienced and it drives them off.\\n\\nAnother problem with underpaying staff and letting them flee to K Street or elsewhere is the loss of institutional knowledge and experience. With persistent turnover, Congress is left without strong institutional capacity to do its job of overseeing the executive branch. An executive branch agency may have dozens of staff ready and able to deal with congressional requests while a congressional committee or member office is limited to a handful of staff, many of whom may have limited experience. This dynamic has enabled the executive branch to seize more and more power over the past four decades.\\n\\nPower always drifts towards the executive and away from the legislature, Mark Strand, president of the Congressional Institute, an educational nonprofit affiliated with Republicans in Congress, said. So, Congress has to fight to keep its power in that system.\\n\\nThe centralization of decision-making in leadership offices receives criticism from the left, right and center. The left and the right argue that making leadership the sole arbiter of what gets a vote on the floor makes it impossible for their ideas to get heard. Centrists, meanwhile, argue that it suppresses the existing bipartisan agreements that could succeed if only members could vote on them. It also drives a wedge between members and their constituents as a lot of their work will simply be to vote on leadership's priorities.\\n\\nNobody feels any ownership of it, Kosar said. And then [members] have to go back and tell the voters, like, why they voted for it and defend themselves against criticisms.\\n\\nThis week I went to dive spot in DC for some late night food. I chatted up the staff.\\n\\n\\n\\nSEVERAL bartenders, managers, & servers *currently worked in Senate + House offices.*\\n\\n\\n\\nThis is a disgrace. Congress of ALL places should raise MRAs so we can pay staff an actual DC living wage. — Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) December 3, 2018\\n\\nHow The Committee Came About\\n\\nThe new committee is a victory for a cross-partisan coalition of outside advocacy groups and academics who have pressed Congress to fix itself for the past five years and for the lawmakers who responded by pressing leadership to include it in the House rules package. The committee was approved in a separate floor vote by a 418-12 margin.\\n\\nThe outside coalition includes libertarian and right-leaning voices at the Congressional Institute and R Street Institute, progressive and liberal-leaning nonprofits like Demand Progress and New America Foundation, centrists at the Bipartisan Policy Center and a range of other groups from the good government Issue One to the government technology-focused OpenGov Foundation.\\n\\nAcademics at the Harvard Negotiation Project, in partnership with Issue One, interviewed dozens of members of Congress as part of the outside effort to build support for congressional modernization to see what they thought could be done to increase deliberation and make the legislature work better.\\n\\nWhat was interesting in all these meetings is that when you went in to talk to members ― they just feel that the institution was not performing well, people are just dissatisfied with their job, Issue One Executive Director Meredith McGehee said.\\n\\nEach group has its own concerns where disagreement could emerge — particularly on updating the budget process and the enactment of reforms solely in pursuit of the always-elusive bipartisanship. But there is strong agreement among these groups of varying ideology on many of the big issues, such as staff pay and retention, updating congressional technology, increasing Congress' independent research capacity, devolving some power from congressional leadership to committees and individual members, and changing procedure to make it easier to bring legislation to the floor. That is where these groups believe the committee could make the quickest progress.\\n\\nSome of the ideas that could come out of the committee that have already been floated, argued or almost enacted in the past include providing new mechanisms for lawmakers to get legislation with broad support to the floor, bringing back the Office of Technology Assessment or some similar body, establishing a Congressional Digital Service to update Congress' digital infrastructure and increasing funding for support agencies, such as the GAO, CRS and congressional staff.\\n\\nWhat these advocates are now watching is who will be appointed to the committee and how much funding it will get.\\n\\nThis is going to require a lot of research and thinking, Kosar said. And so they're going to need smart, trustworthy people that the committee can rely upon.\\n\\nThe rules for the committee state that two members must be on the Rules Committee, two must be on the Committee on House Administration and two will be freshmen. How much funding it gets will determine how effective it will be at producing recommendations with broad consensus. And which members are appointed would signal how seriously leadership will take those recommendations when they are presented.\\n\\nWhether the committee's eventual recommendations go anywhere will come down to whether the leadership of both parties like what they see and feel enough pressure from their members and the public to make Congress suck just a little less."}

It proved to be a bust, bringing in approximately $93 million for just shy of 400,000 acres, the smallest total for an offshore auction since 2016.\\n\\nBy the day's end, the Interior's Bureau of Land Management approved a nearly 500-acre expansion of a gold and silver mine on public lands near Bullhead City, Arizona.\\n\\nJonathan Ernst / Reuters President Donald Trump addresses his administration's daily coronavirus task force briefing at the White House on Friday.\\n\\nThursday brought the promise of another oil and gas auction, a step forward for a rule likely to increase the deaths of protected bird species, and approval for a new gas pipeline as the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 doubled and mass layoffs spiked.\\n\\nThe Bureau of Land Management announced plans to auction off 45,000 acres in southeast New Mexico and West Texas for oil and gas development. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, meanwhile, closed the public comment period on a proposed rule to permanently weaken protections for migratory birds, despite calls from environmentalists to extend that and other comment deadlines because of the pandemic. The rule would codify a 2017 policy change that legalized all unintentional killing of migratory bird species, opening the door for gross negligence by fossil fuel, chemical and agricultural interests.\\n\\nOver at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, a panel voted 2-1 to rubber-stamp construction of both the Jordan Cove liquefied natural gas export terminal in Oregon's already-polluted Coos Bay, and the 230-mile Pacific Connector Pipeline.

Kate Brown (D), who warned that the state had not yet approved permitting in the midst of a national emergency.\\n\\nThis week, Trump and his team also quietly appointed Anna Seidman, a longtime lawyer at the trophy hunting advocacy group Safari Club International, to lead the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's international affairs program, as HuffPost reported Friday. Seidman repeatedly sued FWS and other federal agencies during her 20 years at SCI, an organization with more than 50,000 members that has close ties to the Trump administration.\\n\\nThe U.S. death toll from the coronavirus topped 241, with 18,170 confirmed cases as of Friday, according to a CNN tally.

{"original": "Social Media/Reuters Protests in Iran have spread to scores of towns and cities in a matter of days.\\n\\nThousands of Iranians have taken to the streets over the past week in massive, widespread demonstrations against Tehran's political elite. The rare protests are reminiscent of the country's last major uprising in 2009, but almost a decade apart, the movements are vastly different in scale and direction.\\n\\nMillions of people descended upon Iran's capital in June 2009 after hardliner President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad secured a second term in an election marred by damning claims of vote-rigging.\\n\\nThe explosive uprising, led in part by defeated candidate Mir-Hossein Mousavi, was the largest since the Iranian Revolution in 1979. State forces cracked down violently, opening fire on protesters who chanted Where is my vote? and making scores of sweeping arrests.\\n\\nThe current anti-government clashes erupted in the city of Mashhad and have now spread across the country and stretched into a second week. Incensed Iranians are expressing their frustrations with socioeconomic issues including rising inflation and unemployment, and allegations of widespread corruption.\\n\\nPresident Donald Trump has tweeted his support for the demonstrations against the brutal and corrupt Iranian regime. His administration also criticized former President Barack Obama's shameful inaction during the 2009 unrest (while simultaneously banning Iranians from entering the U.S.).\\n\\nAs with the Green Movement, the Iranian government is retaliating with mass arrests and restrictions on dissent. Both demonstrations created enormous challenges for Tehran, but unlike the 2009 revolt, experts say, today's protests are an extension of Iran's civil rights movement fueled by longstanding grievances, rather than a coordinated revolution. Several factors highlight the key differences.\\n\\nThe Protesters\\n\\nGreen Movement protesters were mainly middle-class professionals rallying alongside Mousavi's reformist supporters. But now, the unfolding protests are largely being driven by lower- and middle-class Iranians who are disappointed by the limited economic improvement the nation experienced as a result of its historic 2015 nuclear agreement, among other grievances.\\n\\nAfter decades of diplomatic friction between Tehran and the West, Iran agreed to curb its nuclear program in exchange for relief from stifling economic sanctions. President Hassan Rouhani, a key architect of the deal who was re-elected in May, promised it would revive the economy and create millions of jobs.\\n\\nThe vast majority of people who have been arrested in the past few days are under 25 years old, Iranian authorities claim.\\n\\nOrganizers of the Green Movement have been completely taken by surprise by the present demonstrations, according to Trita Parsi, founder and president of the National Iranian American Council. They're on the sidelines. They had no idea this was coming. They were not part of this. And to a certain extent, they've even kept a calculated distance from these protests because they're not entirely clear of what the direction is going, he told NPR on Wednesday.\\n\\nToday's protesters are much poorer, much less hopeful, and ― in a way that one person described it to me ― they feel they have absolutely nothing to lose, he added. That's why you have these calls for the complete overthrow of the government. That's very different from the Green Movement.\\n\\nThe number of protesters is also drastically different; there were millions in 2009, compared with thousands over the past week.\\n\\nLeaderless Resistance\\n\\nWithout a clear leader, the current demonstrations likely lack the coordination needed to begin a revolution, according to NIAC research director Reza Marashi.\\n\\nIn 2009, mass discontent and leadership emerged, but state monopoly on violence played a key role in preventing the other pillars from taking root in a sustainable fashion ― by way of cracking down on protesters, and imprisoning opposition leaders, he wrote in a HuffPost blog post earlier this week.\\n\\nAs things stand in Iran today, mass discontent remains clear, but protesters have been less coordinated. They currently lack a discernible organizational network. No shared ideology has emerged beyond general disdain for the government. And the protests have thus far been devoid of any leadership. The government has temporarily restricted access to certain social media channels, including Instagram and Telegram, a messaging app. Unlike in 2009, social media platforms and smartphones have reportedly been critical tools to organize protests, in the absence of actual leaders. By contrast, the protest leaders in 2009 played a really important role, according to Iran expert Suzanne Maloney of the Brookings Institution. They effectively legitimized the protests as something that was politically sanctioned. We haven't seen an episode like that, where someone who's part of the system called upon their followers to go to the streets.\\n\\nNationwide Movement\\n\\nWhereas the Green Movement was mainly concentrated in Tehran, the recent protests have rapidly spread in smaller numbers to scores of cities and towns nationwide, in some ways making it more difficult for state forces to suppress them.\\n\\nIran's supreme leader, ultra-conservative cleric Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, blamed the chaos on Iran's foreign rivals.\\n\\nIn recent days, enemies of Iran used different tools including cash, weapons, politics and intelligence apparatus to create troubles for the Islamic Republic, Khamenei, the country's highest-ranking authority, said in a statement on Tuesday.\\n\\nRouhani, in a pre-recorded speech broadcast on state media Sunday, urged restraint on all sides: We are a free nation. And according to the constitution and citizen rights, the people are free to express their criticism and even their protests. He also cautioned that criticism should not be accompanied with violence or vandalizing public property.\\n\\nThe protests' rapid escalation is of particular concern, according to Maloney.\\n\\nThis began in Mashhad as opposed to Tehran, and really percolated at least in the first 24 to 36 hours outside the capital. That's a very important distinction in that Tehran has always been the center of political gravity for the Islamic Republic and contemporary Iran, she said. That quick escalation is a real point of concern for the regime, because it suggests that this is no longer about one individual or faction versus another, this is very much about a sense of alienation at a basic level.\\n\\nWhere the protests are headed or what the outcome will be remains unclear, Maloney added, but there is a feeling of simmering rage that can't be resolved by quick fixes or short-term changes.\\n\\nI think this represents one of the most serious challenges to the Islamic Republic since its inception, she said, precisely because of the passion of those on the streets and the extent to which they appear to be ready to effectively jettison the entirety of the system rather than focus their ire on one particular individual or policy."}
{"original": "By Peter Cary, Allan Holmes and Pratheek Rebala\\n\\nThere's no shortage of agenda items for the new Congress that's just been seated in Washington. But lost among the anguished cries to reopen the government and enact ethics reform will be a lesser-advertised but crucial item: addressing major problems in the 2017 tax bill that President Donald Trump signed into law a year ago.\\n\\nThat the law needs fixing is not in dispute. Why it needs fixing is most vividly illuminated by contrasting it with another massive piece of tax legislation, the Reagan-era Tax Reform Act of 1986.\\n\\nThe Reagan-era bill was crafted with lengthy deliberation through its entire process. The 2017 tax act was drafted in such haste that there was no substantive deliberation on its contents, resulting in confusing language and numerous errors that need to be fixed. But newly-empowered Democrats are unlikely to help Republicans repair their faulty bill, with the result that it may generate even more than the $1.5 trillion ten-year deficit it was designed to create.\\n\\nIn the months leading up to passage of the 2017 tax act, Trump administration officials and Republican leaders in Congress giddily compared the scope of their bill to Reagan-era law. House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady (R-Texas) called their new bill, The first action in 31 years since President Reagan's reforms in 1986. Then-National Economic Director Gary Cohn said the legislation represented the most significant tax reform legislation since 1986.\\n\\nMeasured by the magnitude of changes to the tax code, that is true. But in terms of how the bills were developed, deliberated and drafted by Congress — not to mention their substance — the bills could not be less alike. And therein lies an illuminating — some would say frightening — story.\\n\\nTo wit, the 1986 bill took two years to create, with lawmakers holding dozens and dozens of hearings and taking testimony from thousands of witnesses. The process was a classic reminder, almost like those How a bill becomes law charts in school textbooks, of how Congress, with fits, starts and seemingly endless deliberation, inches its way toward final legislation.\\n\\nContrast that with the Trump tax bill, which, driven by threats from big GOP donors, was rushed from introduction to passage in just 51 days, leaving no time for substantive deliberation or negotiation — nor even a full understanding of how much debt it would create. Even some Republican tax experts are dismayed by the speed at which the legislation galloped through Capitol Hill — people like Dana Trier, a highly-respected tax tactician from the Reagan and George H.W. Bush administrations whom the Trump administration recruited in spring 2017 to work on the bill.\\n\\nPratheek Rebala (Center for Public Integrity)\\n\\nIf you are like me and experienced the 1986 act, you really realize nobody can get tax legislation close to right anyway, Trier said. But this [2017 tax bill] is worse — there is no question about it in my view — than the 1986 act.\\n\\nThe Trump bill was created in secret, and many legislators never saw some of its provisions, much less debated them, until it was introduced. The measure contained multiple provisions that don't do what was intended and may take years to fix — if they can be fixed at all, experts say.\\n\\nBecause the measure was passed on a purely partisan basis (not one Democrat voted for the bill), it is unlikely that Democrats will be inclined to repair it, policy experts say. And, because of its errors, the tax legislation likely will add far more to the U.S. deficit over ten years than the $1.5 trillion the bill was designed to cost, jeopardizing the nation's credit rating and fueling fears of cuts in Social Security and Medicare. Indeed, after spending more than a year insisting that the law must not run up the nation's debt, Republicans added more to the debt with this legislation than any single tax bill in the past three decades, records show.\\n\\nWe know the more quickly Congress tries to move on something, the more prone they are to making mistakes and to writing a bill that has unintended consequences, said Molly Reynolds, an authority on congressional procedure at the Brookings Institution.\\n\\n(AP Photo/Bob Daugherty) Lawmakers watch closely as Pres. Ronald Reagan signs into law a landmark tax overhaul on the White House South Lawn, Oct. 22, 1986, Washington, D.C. From left, are: Senate Majority Leader Robert Dole of Kansas, Rep. Raymond McGrath, R-N.Y.; Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., Rep. Frank Guerini, D-N.J.; Sen. Russell Long, D-La.; Rep. William Coyne, D-Pa., and Rep. John Duncan, R-Tenn.\\n\\n'We have hit rock bottom'\\n\\nThe 1986 and 2017 tax acts also differ in more substantive ways. The main thrust of the 1986 legislation was to end the tax breaks that had tilted the playing field toward corporations and the rich, while cutting tax rates for all. And the 1986 bill did all this in a way that did not create more federal debt.\\n\\nThe 2017 law does modestly cut taxes for the lower and middle classes, but its main beneficiaries were the rich and corporations. And the law actually created more loopholes and tax breaks, experts say, favoring those who can afford pricey accounting help. Ed Kleinbard, former chief of Congress' nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation, which assesses tax legislation Congress proposes, called the law a Christmas present to the donor class and an abomination.\\n\\nMany academics fear what the tax law will create. Many of the new changes fundamentally undermine the integrity of the tax code and allow well-advised taxpayers to game the new rules, wrote 13 professors of tax law in a December 2017 critique as the law sped toward approval. We must aim to learn from this recent historical episode, wherein a rushed and secretive process resulted in deeply flawed legislation.\\n\\nDemocratic lawmakers howled their protests. I must say that with the passage of [the bill], we have hit rock bottom. No hearings. No witnesses. No amendments accepted by majority party or the minority offering. No regular order. No bipartisanship, said then-Rep. Joe Crowley (D-N.Y.) during a House Ways and Means Committee markup of a follow-up bill in 2018. The 2017 tax bill, he said, was rammed through this committee and rammed through the House of Representatives.\\n\\nNo hearings. No witnesses. No amendments accepted by majority party or the minority offering. No regular order. No bipartisanship. Former Rep. Joe Crowley, D-N.Y.\\n\\nTo counter accusations that their bill was passed on speed-dial and was strictly partisan, Republicans say the bill was six years in the making. They relied on bipartisan research and hearings, they say, conducted from 2011 to 2014 by Democratic Sen. Max Baucus of Montana and Republican Rep. Dave Camp from Michigan. Back then, Baucus chaired the Senate Finance Committee and Camp headed the House Ways and Means panel, yet they could not persuade a divided Congress to take up their tax reform ideas.\\n\\nBrady, who by then chaired Ways and Means, told CNBC in April 2016 that Camp made tax reform inevitable, in the sense that he showed you could broaden the base and lower the rates and simplify the code and be competitive around the world. When an interviewer pointed out that Camp's own party killed his legislation, Brady replied, I don't think it got the oxygen it deserved at the time.\\n\\nOne proponent of the six-year-in-the-making argument is Mark Prater, who was chief tax counsel to the Senate Finance Committee until he left in May 2018 to join professional services firm PricewaterhouseCoopers. In a recording of a tax seminar last summer obtained by CPI, Prater said his committee had relied on dozens of hearings, lots of reports, lots of joint committee activity, lots of production there over that six years.\\n\\nBut others claim the Republicans just cherry-picked a few GOP-backed ideas from the Baucus-Camp work. Baucus said in an interview with the Center that the 2017 tax law has some elements of the legislation he and Camp proposed, such as cutting the corporate tax rate, only taxing domestic corporate profits, and reworking taxes on the profits of multinationals to get them to return their money to the United States.\\n\\nBut that was as far as the similarities went, Baucus said.\\n\\nTheir claim is accurate as far as the beginning, Baucus said, but then [the legislation] went off the tracks.\\n\\nBaucus said he has four overriding concerns with the 2017 bill: It was written in private, no hearings were held on its substance, it gave too much of the tax cuts to the wealthy, and it adds more than $1.5 trillion to the deficit over 10 years.\\n\\nWhen contacted by phone, Camp, now a senior policy advisor with PricewaterhouseCoopers, said he wanted to be interviewed for this article, but days later the company's public relations firm said in an email that Camp would have to decline because he couldn't make the time.\\n\\nIn an interview with The Washington Post in early 2017, when tax reform talk was heating up in Congress, Camp rejected the idea that his 2014 bill, numbered H.R. 1 just as the 2017 legislation was, should have been necessarily relied on.\\n\\nI think there's a number of alternatives and decision points throughout a process like this, and it doesn't have to be all like H.R. 1 or all like other proposals that have been discussed in the past, Camp said. Obviously, the kinds of assumptions I made in putting together H.R. 1 aren't necessarily the same assumptions you might make today.\\n\\nPrater declined a request for an interview. Dozens of lawmakers and party leaders, both Republicans and Democrats, as well as lobbyists, declined requests for interviews or didn't respond to requests to comment.\\n\\nThousands of witnesses, scores of reports\\n\\nTo be sure, the political climate was different in the mid-1980s. Tax reform had been percolating in Congress for years, and in 1982 Democratic Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey and Rep. Richard Gephardt of Missouri sponsored a bill that proposed to close loopholes for the rich and cut marginal tax rates for all income brackets. Though that measure never made it to a vote, President Ronald Reagan, in his state of the Union address in January 1984, pledged to reform the tax code. The following year, Reagan reiterated his pledge and Democrats thought it wise to join in.\\n\\nSoon, Congress — where the GOP controlled the Senate and the Democrats owned the House — was abuzz with hearings on taxation. Seventy-one hearings were held in 1985, by 13 different committees, including House Banking, Small Business, Public Works, and Senate Energy, and Labor. Some went on for three, four or five days, and some were held far from the Capitol — in Oklahoma City, Cincinnati, or South Bend, Indiana, for example. The witness lists were exhaustive: two or three dozen witnesses per hearing were not unusual.\\n\\nSubjects ran from the general (Fundamental Tax Reform) to the arcane (Carryover of Net Operating Losses). Politicians delved into sensitive social issues, holding hearings on how tax reform would affect low-wage workers and the poor.\\n\\nDrafting the tax reform bill was messy. Bills were introduced and rejected, deals were cut, and leaders tried again and again to find something that would pass. Finally, on Dec. 3, 1985, 11 months into the 99th Congress, H.R. 3838 was introduced in the House. After several setbacks, it passed the House on Dec. 17 on a voice vote. Off it went to the Senate, which scheduled 12 more hearings to work up its own bill.\\n\\nThe Finance Committee kicked off a series of five get-togethers specifically on the bill's provisions. In one marathon session, held April 21, 1986, titled Proposals Related to Excise Taxes, 27 witnesses —limited to five minutes each—testified in one day. A House Ways and Means subcommittee, not satisfied even though that chamber had already passed its bill, held a hearing on miscellaneous tax provisions. Ninety-two witnesses were called.\\n\\nThe final scorecard? Over two years, the 99th Congress held 89 hearings on tax reform and heard from nearly 2,600 witnesses, according to the Center's review of hearing records.\\n\\nOther groups weighed in — massively. The Joint Committee on Taxation — a nonpartisan congressional team of experts that assesses tax topics for Congress — supplied politicians with 62 reports over 21 months. The Congressional Budget Office and the Congressional Research Service wrote 10 more. One report was titled Blacks and Tax Reform: Possible Impacts on Blacks of Selected Proposals of HR 3838.\\n\\nOn June 24, 1986 — 189 days after the House passed its bill — the Senate approved its version. It took three more months of work in conference to create a bill the two houses could agree on. Reagan signed the bill on October 22, 1986 – 11 months after the bill was first introduced.\\n\\n(AP Photo/Bob Daugherty) Lawmakers watch President Ronald Reagan sign into law the 1986 Tax Reform Act on the White House South Lawn on Oct. 22, 1986. From left, are: Senate Majority Leader Robert Dole of Kansas, Rep. Raymond McGrath, R-N.Y.; Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., Rep. Frank Guerini, D-N.J.; Sen. Russell Long, D-La.; Rep. William Coyne, D-Pa., and Rep. John Duncan, R-Tenn.\\n\\nThe new law — 878 pages long — was designed to simplify the tax code, make it fairer, and incentivize growth. But its main thrust was true reform – cleaning out many of the special loopholes and breaks that had crept into the code over the years. It raised the tax on capital gains, but also cut the top individual rate from 50 percent to 28 percent. It pulled in $24 billion from corporations by adjusting tax shelters, while cutting corporate taxes from 46 percent to 34 percent. (The rate later crept up to 35 percent). And it shrank the number of individual tax brackets from 15 to five.\\n\\nIn short, said Gene Steuerle, coordinator of Treasury's reform effort from 1984 to 1986 and now a fellow at the non-partisan Tax Policy Center in Washington, individuals got a modest tax cut and corporations got a modest tax increase. Perhaps most important, the measure did not increase the national debt.\\n\\nA road less traveled\\n\\nRepublicans chose a different approach for their 2017 bill. That year congressional Republicans were under tremendous pressure from Trump, his base, and their wealthiest donors to do two big things: repeal Obamacare and enact tax cuts by the end of the year. Their first legislative effort failed. On July 28, the effort to repeal Obamacare died with a no vote by Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz.\\n\\nU.S. Congress The late Sen. John McCain's defining 'no' vote on the Republican bill to repeal Obamacare on July 28, 2017. (U.S. Congress)\\n\\nThat left the tax bill, whose passage was dubious at best. One senior Republican senator lamented it would make repealing Obamacare look like a piece of cake. Republicans were panicking. They believed they had to notch a big legislative win if they were going to survive the coming midterm elections — and even future ones.\\n\\nYou have to understand the pressure these staffs were under, said one lobbyist close to the process. The fate of the Republican party rested with them. Indeed, they faced the seemingly impossible: research, write, debate, and pass tax legislation that would satisfy donors, corporate supporters, and the party's conservative ideologues — all in five months.\\n\\nRepublicans didn't have time for the normal legislative process — Democrats say it was hard to call it a process at all. The House Ways and Means Committee held only four hearings — two in May and two in July. But because the bill had not yet been drafted, the hearings were limited to the broadest subjects. How Tax Reform Will Grow our Economy and Create Jobs was one. How Tax Reform Will Simplify our Broken Tax Code was another.\\n\\nThe subjects of the Senate Finance Committee's hearings were just as vague: Comprehensive Tax Reform, Individual Tax Reform and International Tax Reform. The hearings totaled 11 in the House and Senate. Forty-five witnesses were called, never more than five per hearing. Nearly half came from inside the Beltway. None dealt with specifics because the tax bill was still being drafted — in secret.\\n\\nThat was it for hearings. After the House bill was introduced Nov. 2, 2017, that chamber scheduled no hearings. In 1986, even after its tax reform bill was passed, the House scheduled two more hearings with 131 witnesses. In 2017 the Senate didn't hold one hearing on the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act after it was introduced. In 1986, after the Tax Reform Act went to the Senate, that chamber held 12 hearings with 197 witnesses.\\n\\nHearings play a vital role in the passage of laws, experts say. If done well, they elicit reactions to legislative proposals from the people who would be affected — but also from people who have no skin in the game. If you don't have hearings, if you don't bring the experts in, if you don't hear many sides to the issues, if you don't allow for that input, then you don't really have legislation, Rep. Bill Pascrell (D-N.J.), a senior member of the House Ways and Means Committee, told The Hill last week.\\n\\nHearings also increase responsibility, said Brookings' Reynolds. You're getting views clearly on the record, from outside groups and from experts, she said. If we've brought these witnesses to testify, you're saying, 'Congress, you made this choice having heard these witnesses.'\\n\\nA rosy estimate\\n\\nNormally, Congress also relies on the nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation to assess how much money its tax proposals will either add to or take away from the treasury. In 2017 the JCT issued 27 reports, but Republicans eschewed the panel's advice on the big question of whether the proposed tax cuts would generate any economic growth to partially offset the trillions of dollars in lost revenue.\\n\\nIt's not that the JCT couldn't do the work, known as a macroeconomic analysis. But the House bill was moving so fast that the JCT couldn't get an analysis out in time for the vote. (JCT finished its report on the House bill 25 days after that chamber voted on it.) So, the JCT focused on assessing the Senate version, which came later. That report made it to senators Dec. 1, 2017 — just one day before they voted on their bill. The report concluded that even with the economic growth the tax cuts would generate, the Senate bill would still cost the nation more than $1 trillion over 10 years.\\n\\nThe JCT crashed a final report on the conference bill, concluding the final version would add nearly $1.1 trillion to the national debt. But, the report was finished the day Trump signed the bill into law, on Dec. 22, 2017, so lawmakers never got to use it.\\n\\nStill Republicans did have at their fingertips other research on the cost of their bill. One report in particular was released Dec. 18, 2017, by the Tax Foundation, a conservative think tank in Washington. It published a rosier estimate that found the tax bill would add only $448 billion to the national debt over 10 years, less than half what the JCT would report four days later. Indeed, the Tax Foundation had issued numerous reports on Republicans' proposed tax policies and bill ideas throughout 2017, many of which carried weight among Republicans on the Hill, Washington tax experts and lobbyists said.\\n\\nThe House majority did not wait for a JCT staff macroeconomic analysis and instead relied on any private estimate that suited its fancy, wrote the former JCT chief Kleinbard. The Senate essentially did the same.\\n\\nSome believe that if Congress had held hearings on the bill, wiser minds could have sounded alarm bells about the debt it would create. The hearings, they say, might have steered the bill more toward helping low- and middle-income families, and minorities. Hearing witnesses also might have warned that the increase in the debt threatens Social Security and Medicare, and even national security.\\n\\nBut others argue Republicans were going to do what they were going to do, no matter what official studies showed. I think, generally, the interest of the members of Congress pushing for the bill was a tax cut that was fairly regressive, said Lily Batchelder, a former Senate Finance Committee chief tax counsel and now a tax law professor at New York University. That's what they put forth, and I think that aligned with their views of what's best for the economy.\\n\\nOne thing is certain, tax researchers say. The bill will need major repairs so that taxpayers can understand it, tax preparers can interpret it, and the legislation can have its intended effects. Many of the needed fixes will require new legislation, of the sort House Republicans unveiled in a 297-page bill on Nov. 26. House Democrats immediately signaled their unwillingness to cooperate without concessions, and the bill was unable to pass the Senate where it needed 60 votes.\\n\\nNow, with Democrats in charge of the House, it will be even harder for Republicans to make needed fixes in their bill. And because Republicans control the Senate, Democrats will find their way blocked to changing or repealing parts of the law. Instead, they promise to hold hearings on the parts of the tax bill they say are confusing – or they just don't like.\\n\\nThat leaves grizzled tax policy veterans like Trier pessimistic about the future of changes in this Congress, or for many to come. This legislation, in significant parts, it could be fixed; it would not be that hard, he said. The problem is that with all the partisanship, it won't occur."}
{"original": "European financial markets are already betting on the victory of centrist French presidential candidate Emmanuel Macron in the country's May 7 second-round election.\\n\\nAre investors right to believe that the eurozone – the monetary union of countries that have incorporated the euro as their national currency – will gain new momentum with Macron in the Élysée Palace?\\n\\nAfter all, Macron, who is strongly pro-European Union, has affirmed several times over the past year that the Euro will fail in ten years without reform, adding he would promote more and better eurozone governance.\\n\\nThe importance of the parliamentary elections\\n\\nUltimately, the political stance of the new French president vis-a-vis Europe will be heavily influenced by parliamentary elections in June, which will also determine the prime minister.\\n\\nAccording to polls, some 40% of the French voters today take an anti-European stance.\\n\\nMacron's rival, the National Front's Marine Le Pen, advocates unconditional rejection of Europe and the euro - even if she appears to have softened her stance on the common currency.\\n\\nOn the campaign trail, left-wing candidate Jean Luc Mélenchon and his supporters were also quite lukewarm towards the single currency even if they seemed at least willing to renegotiate in favour a different Europe.\\n\\nIf both the far-right and the far-left do well in the parliamentary elections in June, Macron, if elected, would face the task of imposing his views. Will he be able to initiate substantial reform of the euro area?\\n\\nIn the past, he has repeatedly advocated fiscal unity, and during his short term as economy minister he said that he would like to set up a common eurozone treasury with a single finance minister.\\n\\nMacron would have to deal with the strong anti-European nationalistic backlash and the Germanophobia of Le Pen and Mélenchon's supporters.\\n\\nWhether he can achieve his vision will depend also on his ability to win support across Europe. His idea of a fiscal union may meet resistance there, especially when it comes to cross-border risk sharing, which Germany and other northern countries fear will leave them footing the bill.\\n\\nAn asymmetric monetary union\\n\\nThe current situation is informed by what happened to the eurozone as a result of its 2010 crisis. To deal with the sovereign debt crises of Greece and several other member countries, the EU arranged financial rescue packages conditioned on austerity measures and policy reforms.\\n\\nUnintentionally, these actions changed the character of the eurozone – and ultimately also that of Europe – from a union of equals to an asymmetric currency area dominated by creditor-debtor relationships.\\n\\nThe creditor nations were perceived as imposing economic hardship on cash-strapped states, even as the former were contemplating transferring their own taxpayers' money to reform-resisting neighbours.\\n\\nThe euro crisis quickly developed into a European political crisis. Today, debtor countries lament their loss of sovereignty and, in healthier nations, support for European solutions has rapidly diminished.\\n\\nThe crisis revealed that the eurozone is an incomplete monetary union and, as such, vulnerable to shocks that hit member countries differently.\\n\\nMost economists agree on what could fix this problem: a central bank that can effectively backstop financial crises; a banking union with the three core elements of single supervision, a single resolution mechanism and single deposit insurance; and a fiscal union to facilitate risk sharing.\\n\\nWith respect to the central bank, the European Central Bank, is now doing what it takes as it pledged in 2012 , but the European banking union is still incomplete. This is largely because of resistance to a single deposit insurance, especially in Germany, which sees this guarantee as a form of debt mutualisation.\\n\\nAs long as European banks remain in peril, it's German insurance contributions that would be transferred to cover bankruptcies of foreign banks.\\n\\nAugmenting the banking union with a fiscal backstop will be a major task in the coming years, but it may be feasible provided Europe's economic recovery continues and the banking sector undertakes sufficient restructuring measures.\\n\\nThis brings me to the crucial point: the fiscal union – the idea of a common European treasury, which could ultimately organise fiscal transfers between member countries.\\n\\nTarget2 and Secret Bailouts: Will Germany be Forced Into a Fiscal Union with Rest of Eurozone?https://t.co/RNkqfyR0B6 pic.twitter.com/t2ZDOaikXr — Mike Mish Shedlock (@MishGEA) April 23, 2017\\n\\nMacron is very much in line on this with what most economists would - at least theoretically - recommend for making the incomplete monetary union work. But unfortunately, the political appetite for more Europe is at best marginal and good intentions could quickly fail in light of harsh political reality.\\n\\nStill, one should not make the best the enemy of the good when feasible solutions are within reach. An alternative to the fiscal union is to give back control over national fiscal policies to the countries themselves and abandon various fiscal pacts altogether.\\n\\nNone of them has ever really worked in practice as the widespread violation of the EU deficit criteria shows. So it would better to let national governments decide on their budgets and give them back decisions on how to spend taxes.\\n\\nAfter all, this is what is being voted on in European elections in general and the French election in particular. And the change would also answer the concerns of those who feel - for right or wrong reasons – that their national sovereignty is being impaired.\\n\\nThe four conditions for a stable Eurozone\\n\\nBut does that not mean that the euro area would remain vulnerable? Not necessarily.\\n\\nAs argued by leading economists Professor Barry Eichengreen (Berkely) and Charles Wyplosz (Geneva), four minimum conditions should be met to guarantee the stability of the monetary union in case of a return to national decision making on fiscal matters.\\n\\nFirst, a central bank backstopping financial crises and, second, a full banking union. Both these conditions would form a good base for insuring against asymmetric shocks. A full banking union in particular, would allow private risk sharing through better integrated financial markets, which could cushion the effects of such shocks.\\n\\nThird, giving back control to national governments also implies giving back responsibility. In other words, a strict no-bailout rule is needed and may even be more effective for imposing more budget discipline.\\n\\nFinally, giving back control to nations requires reducing debt overhang. This may be the hardest part, as moral concerns in some countries may oppose workable debt restructuring schemes – but it would not be impossible either.\\n\\nRe-nationalising fiscal policy could therefore offer a politically feasible alternative to a full fiscal union as a way of stabilising the euro area. It should be noted, though, that this neither implies not engaging in joint European infrastructure projects nor abstaining from assistance programs for individual countries.\\n\\nSuch initiatives may, in fact, be easier to implement once unpopular and ineffective fiscal rules are a thing of the past.\\n\\nA president Macron might thus wish to rethink his earlier view on a fiscal union.\\n\\nReforming the euro area is a real possibility. The ultimate issue is not whether we need more or less Europe but rebalancing eurozone governance in a direction that is both politically palatable and provides much-needed stability for the European monetary union.\\n\\nHarald Sander, Professor of Economics at Maastricht School of Management and Jean Monnet Chair, Technical University of Cologne\\n\\nThis article was originally published on The Conversation.

{"original": "KANSAS CITY, Kan. ― In mid-October, on the last day he could register to vote ahead of the Nov. 4, 2014, midterm elections, Charles Stricker went to the DMV in Wichita. When he checked in, Stricker, who had just moved to Kansas, was told he didn't have all the documents he needed to get a driver's license. So he went home, put all the documents together and rushed back to the DMV. He wanted to make sure he got there in time because at the DMV he could do both: get his license and register to vote in time.\\n\\nHe showed the DMV clerk the folder of documents he brought, including his birth certificate from Missouri, and thought he had successfully registered to vote. The officials at the DMV told him his permanent license and voter information would come in the mail in a few weeks.\\n\\nStricker, who is 37 and works as a hotel manager, went to vote with his wife when the polls opened on Nov. 4. By that time he had gotten his permanent driver's license, but when he went to sign in at the polls, they told him his name wasn't on the list. He thought it was a mistake, maybe because he had registered at the last minute, and he asked to speak with the person in charge to try and figure out what the problem was. Eventually he was given a provisional ballot, but instead of getting a private booth to fill out his ballot like everyone else, he was sent to a white plastic table, where everyone could see how he was marking his votes. He could see who the person next to him was voting for, and he was pretty sure she could see who he was voting for. He said he felt humiliated.\\n\\nSince 2013, Kansas has required anyone who registers to vote to prove they are a U.S. citizen. Even though Stricker had brought his birth certificate to the DMV that day, election officials said they couldn't prove he was a citizen, so they blocked his registration.\\n\\nOn Tuesday, Stricker was one of three Kansans who testified in a closely watched federal lawsuit challenging the law. Stricker and a handful of other Kansas voters are the plaintiffs in the case and contend the law violates a federal requirement that state agencies can only ask people the minimum amount of information necessary to assess their eligibility to vote when they give them the opportunity to register. To justify the law, Kansas officials have to prove that such a restrictive registration policy is justified by a substantial number of noncitizens on the voting rolls. In many ways, that is the same question at the heart of the national debate over voter fraud, which several studies have shown is not a widespread problem.\\n\\nMark Reinstein via Getty Images Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach (R) will have to show that voter fraud is a substantial problem in his state in a lawsuit challenging a requirement that Kansans show proof of citizenship when they register.\\n\\nKansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach (R), who is a defendant in the case and is serving as his own lawyer, questioned how much of a burden it would have been for Stricker to prove he was a citizen to election officials, noting that there was an election office near the hotel where he worked, so he could have taken his birth certificate there during his lunch hour. Stricker said he frequently works nearly 12-hour days and often eats lunch at his desk. Plus, in 2014 he had just started a new job and was wary about taking a lunch hour to go to the election office. He has since refused to register on principle, saying an average Kansan shouldn't have to take legal action to register. The Kansas law has also been blocked since 2016, when a federal judge stepped in and issued a temporary injunction, a decision that allowed 18,000 people who had tried to register at the DMV but failed to prove their citizenship to vote that year.\\n\\nSue Becker, an attorney for Kobach's office similarly pressed Donna Bucci, 59, about how difficult it would have been for her to prove she was a citizen. Bucci, who was born in Maryland, tried to register to vote in 2013, but her name was purged from the rolls because she didn't have a birth certificate or a passport and couldn't prove she was a citizen. Becker asked Bucci how difficult it would have been for her to call the secretary of state's office to explain her situation during a break at work.\\n\\nBucci explained that she works as a cook in a prison from 3 a.m. to noon and can't have her cellphone in the building.\\n\\nA big part of the case will be whether Kobach can show that current federal law is not doing enough to combat voter fraud. The federal form to register to vote requires a person to swear under penalty of perjury that he or she is a citizen, a safeguard Kobach said Tuesday was too weak and like nothing.\\n\\nSince 2000, Kobach's office has identified only 129 noncitizens who registered to vote or attempted to register, but he cites a study by political scientist Jesse Richman that indicated as many as 18,000 noncitizens could be on the rolls in the state. As of October 2016, there were more than 1.8 million registered voters in Kansas.\\n\\nEven though Kobach argued there could be substantial voter fraud in Kansas, he conceded that the court would have to define what substantial meant. The American Civil Liberities Union, which is representing the plaintiffs, said voter fraud was insignificant because it is such a small percentage of the overall voting population in Kansas.\\n\\nKobach said one could also take substantial to mean a small number of illegitimate voters who could end up swinging a close local election. He urged the court to evaluate the proof-of-citizenship law through a kind of intermediate standard and consider whether enough noncitizens were getting around the proof-of-citizenship requirement to render it insignificant.\\n\\nHe spent much of the afternoon questioning Michael McDonald, a political science professor at the University of Florida who is serving as an expert witness in the case about an analysis he prepared showing that over 35,000 people in the state had been affected by the proof-of-citizenship law and that it disproportionately affected first-time voters, who are usually young. But Kobach countered that McDonald had not analyzed how many noncitizens there were among those affected and had not fully examined all the possibilities for why people might be removed from the list.\\n\\nKobach is running for governor of Kansas and has drawn national attention for his staunch conservative views on immigration and voter fraud. The courtroom at the Robert J. Dole federal courthouse was packed with about 100 people for the opening statements in the case, which was filed in 2016. Joe Cheray said she woke up before 6 a.m. and drove from Topeka to make it in time for the opening statements at 9 a.m.\\n\\nThere were a few moments of befuddlement throughout Tuesday.\\n\\nWithin the first hour of the trial, lawyers for the ACLU complained Kobach had sent them a document at 10:45 p.m. Monday and they had not had time to review it. Judge Julie Robinson, a George W. Bush appointee, declined to let Kobach use the documents in court.\\n\\nRobinson also rebuked Kobach and his team throughout the day for not following usual procedures for entering documents as evidence, at one point having to remind them that they should know something because it was Evidence 101. At another point in the afternoon, lawyers and Robinson had to sort through the confusion of a reply-all email thread because the court had incorrect email addresses for Kobach and some of his team and ACLU lawyers had sent documents to those incorrect addresses.\\n\\nKobach also pointed to several of McDonald's tweets in an effort to discredit McDonald's expertise and show McDonald had a personal bias against him (McDonald said he did not). In one of the tweets Kobach pointed to, McDonald had referred to a CNN report in which someone in Vice President Mike Pence's office referred to working with Kobach as a shit sandwich.\\n\\nWhen Kobach asked him whether or not the tweets showed a personal bias, McDonald said they did not.\\n\\nThey're tough, but they're just tweets, he said."}

{"original": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - We are going to walk down Pennsylvania Avenue, President Donald Trump exhorted his screaming supporters before they marched on the U.S. Capitol last week, saying he'd go with them. He did not – and what unfolded was a deadly breach of the citadel of American democracy that has left Trump's world crumbling in the final days of his presidency.\\n\\nTrump had wanted to join the thousands of hardcore followers who assembled at Capitol Hill on Jan. 6. He told aides in the days leading up to the rally that he planned to accompany them to demonstrate his ire at Congress as it moved to certify Democrat Joe Biden's November election victory.\\n\\nBut the Secret Service kept warning him that agents could not guarantee his safety if he went ahead, according to two people familiar with the matter. Trump relented and instead hunkered down at the White House to watch television images of the mob rioting he is accused of triggering.\\n\\nThe storming of the U.S. Capitol left five people dead, including a police officer, and threatened the lives of Vice President Mike Pence and members of Congress, deeply wounding what remained of Trump's presidency ahead of Biden's swearing-in on Jan. 20.\\n\\nTrump's fiery, grievance-filled speech from the Ellipse park on the southern outskirts of the White House was a central focus of this week's hastily arranged proceedings in the House of Representatives that led to his impeachment on a charge of inciting insurrection.\\n\\nWith Wednesday's vote, Trump became the first president in U.S. history to be impeached twice, as 10 of his fellow Republicans joined Democrats in denouncing him. But it appears unlikely to lead to his ouster before his term ends since there are no plans to convene a vote in the Republican-led Senate, which alone has the power to remove him.\\n\\nEven so, the House's unprecedented rebuke capped a week that has been perilously unstable even for a presidency where chaos has long reigned.\\n\\nTrump's last days in the White House have been marked by rage and turmoil, multiple sources said. He watched some of the impeachment debate on TV and grew angry at the Republican defections, a source familiar with the situation said.\\n\\nTrump has suffered a sudden rupture with his vice president, the departure of disgusted senior advisers, his abandonment by a small but growing number of Republican lawmakers, the loss of his cherished Twitter megaphone, and a rush by corporations and others to distance themselves from him and his businesses.\\n\\nReuters spoke to more than a dozen Trump administration officials with a window into the closing act of his presidency. They described a shrinking circle of loyal aides who are struggling to contain an increasingly fretful, angry and isolated president – one seemingly still clinging to unfounded claims of election fraud - and to keep the White House functioning until Biden assumes power.\\n\\nEverybody feels like they're doing the best job they can to hold it all together until Biden takes over, one Trump adviser told Reuters on condition of anonymity.\\n\\nThe White House declined to comment for this story. The Secret Service declined to comment about Trump's purported desire to travel to the Capitol on Jan. 6.\\n\\nFOCUS ON PARDONS\\n\\nEven as Trump has spent time venting to aides and confidantes, one tangible issue he has been focused on is how to apply his power to pardon before his term ends, three White House sources said.\\n\\nThe biggest question is whether he will issue an unprecedented pardon to himself, in addition to family members, before leaving office.\\n\\nWhile Trump has not publicly signaled his intention to take a step that some legal analysts say could be unlawful, one White House official told Reuters: I've been expecting that.\\n\\nThe chances of Trump making such a contentious move may have multiplied due to the uproar over his Jan. 6 speech in which he repeatedly urged his supporters to fight for him. Some legal experts say this could open him up to lawsuits or even criminal charges.\\n\\nAddressing the crowd, Trump suggested several times that he would join in their march to the Capitol and appealed at least six times to Pence to do the right thing and refuse to certify Biden's victory in the formal counting of the electoral vote in Congress that day. Trump and his surrogates had built up a false narrative that Pence, whose role in the certification process was mostly ceremonial, could somehow throw the election to his boss.\\n\\nTrump's speech followed an exasperated conversation with his vice president, a longtime loyalist, earlier on Jan. 6 when Trump called Pence a pussy for not being willing to overturn the vote, a source briefed on the matter said. The exchange was reported earlier by The New York Times.\\n\\nOn the day of the rally, Trump once again expressed his desire to accompany his supporters to the Capitol. The Secret Service told Trump he couldn't go with the crowd – though presidents do have the power to overrule their security details.\\n\\nThey waved him off that day, a source familiar with the situation said of the Secret Service. They said it would be way too dangerous.\\n\\nSo when throngs of flag-waving followers drifted away from the speech site toward the Capitol, Trump retreated to the walled confines of the White House, where aides said he watched the ransacking of the landmark building on television with rapt attention.\\n\\nAmong the mob that battled police, shattered windows and invaded legislative chambers were individuals who waved Confederate flags and wore clothing carrying insignias and slogans espousing conspiracy theories and white supremacist beliefs.\\n\\nIt would be hours before Trump appeared in a video on social media in response to entreaties to say something to rein in his supporters. When he did, he told them he loved them and to go home while repeating his baseless claims of a rigged election.\\n\\nSome of Trump's own aides were left stunned by his conduct.\\n\\nWhen people are storming the Capitol, you walk to the press room and do a press conference and call on them to stop, instead of cutting a video eight hours later, said a long-time Trump adviser.\\n\\nSMASHING GUARDRAILS\\n\\nThe riot of Jan. 6 followed a two-month campaign by Trump to delegitimize the November election with false claims of fraud. It began when what he had vowed would be a landslide victory over Biden turned into a defeat once all mail-in ballots, which skewed heavily Democratic, were counted.\\n\\nTrump's focus on claims of voter fraud, egged on by personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani, consumed most of his days. Two days after the election, said a source familiar with the meeting, daughter Ivanka Trump was in a meeting with senior White House staff and said words to the effect that, We accomplished so much and we had a great run. A representative for Ivanka Trump declined to comment.\\n\\nBut no one in Trump's orbit could convince him to explicitly acknowledge defeat and use his remaining weeks in office to hold events to tout accomplishments that he and his aides are proud of.\\n\\nAdvisers felt Trump could make himself a force in the Republican Party for years to come, a kingmaker, and possibly even win a second term in 2024.\\n\\nHis political future could now be in jeopardy as a result of the Capitol violence. If convicted by the Senate in a trial that would occur after he has left the White House, Trump could be banned from holding federal office again.\\n\\nTrump watched Wednesday's rapid-fire impeachment proceedings on television from the White House, sources said, stepping away briefly to hand out National Medal of Arts awards to country music artists Toby Keith and Ricky Skaggs.\\n\\nEven before the riot, Trump's mood had been darkening as dozens of court cases filed by his legal team and surrogates failed to overturn the voting results in key swing states, people familiar with the matter said.\\n\\nAides who would enjoy dropping by the Oval Office to check on Trump found themselves avoiding him lest he give them an assignment related to voter fraud that they knew was impossible, three sources said.\\n\\nHis mood has only worsened since the Jan. 6 storming of the Capitol. He has fumed in private about the decision by Twitter, his favorite means of communication with his followers, to permanently suspend his account on the grounds that it was concerned he could incite further mayhem, two people familiar with the matter said.\\n\\nWith Trump scrambling to find an alternative platform, his son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner helped head off an attempt by other aides to get him signed up on fringe, far-right social media sites, believing they were not the best format for the president, said an administration official. A representative for Kushner declined comment.\\n\\nPence and Trump did not speak for days after the Capitol riot. The vice president had to be spirited to safety in the Capitol basement after rioters, some chanting Hang Mike Pence, penetrated the building.\\n\\nCurrent and former White House officials say they were aghast at how Trump treated Pence, who has been a steady and loyal lieutenant. They were stung by the president's criticism and false insistence that the vice president could intervene to overturn the Electoral College results. Trump also never called Pence to check on him during his ordeal, an aide said.\\n\\nOn Monday, the two men met alone in the Oval Office, likely following efforts and appeals by Ivanka Trump and Kushner, according to one White House official. The two men walked out of the meeting in good spirits, chuckling together about something. The body language was good, the official said.\\n\\nThe next day, Pence wrote to Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi that he would not exercise the 25th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution to remove the president from office for incapacitation, despite pressure from Democrats.\\n\\nSTAFF EXODUS\\n\\nOther aides have not been as forgiving.\\n\\nDeputy national security adviser Matt Pottinger, a leading aide on Trump's China policy, quickly quit in what two sources said was an act of protest against the president's response to the rioting. Pottinger did not respond to requests for comment. He was followed by at least five other senior foreign policy aides. Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao, who is married to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, and Education Secretary Betsy DeVos also resigned in protest.\\n\\nSome other Trump officials say they have gritted their teeth and stayed put despite anger over Trump's perceived role in the violence.\\n\\nNational security adviser Robert O'Brien and White House counsel Pat Cipollone were among those convinced to remain by others, including lawmakers, former government officials and corporate executives, four sources familiar with the matter said. The White House declined comment.\\n\\nSome who remain in the administration have seized the opportunity to push through significant policy shifts before leaving office, several administration sources said.\\n\\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo, for instance, has pressed ahead with controversial international moves, sometimes, according to two people familiar with the matter, without coordinating fully with the White House.\\n\\nThe timing of one decision caught some National Security Council officials by surprise, the sources said: Pompeo's scrapping of longtime curbs on U.S. government interactions with Taiwan officials, which angered China. The State Department did not respond to a request for comment.\\n\\nOther Pompeo actions over the past week have included returning Communist-ruled Cuba to the U.S. list of state sponsors of terrorism, and designating Yemen's Iran-aligned Houthi movement a terrorist organization.\\n\\nWhile mostly disengaged from policymaking, Trump on Tuesday, at his aides' behest, paid a visit to the U.S.-Mexico border wall near Alamo, Texas. Erecting a barrier across the border was a signature promise of his winning 2016 campaign platform. Only portions got built.\\n\\nDecisions on a final round of presidential pardons are expected to occupy much of Trump's few remaining days in office. He has stirred controversy in recent weeks by pardoning allies convicted in the investigation of Russian meddling in the 2016 election, security contractors convicted of killing Iraqi civilians, and Kushner's father, Charles, a real estate developer sentenced to two years in prison after pleading guilty in 2004 to tax evasion and other crimes.\\n\\nTrump and his family have potential legal exposure of their own, including investigations in New York over tax and business dealings.\\n\\nOne White House official, speaking on condition of anonymity, suggested Trump's final act as president could be a preemptive pardon for family members and for himself just before Biden is sworn in. Presidential pardons apply only to federal crimes, not violations of state law.\\n\\nA self-pardon would be an extraordinary use of power never before tried by a U.S. president, and constitutional lawyers say there is no definitive answer on whether it can be done lawfully.\\n\\nOne thing Trump's staff don't expect: a resignation. I would be floored if that were to happen, another White House official said.\\n\\n(Additional reporting by Alexandra Alper; Writing by Matt Spetalnick; Editing by Mary Milliken and Marla Dickerson)"}
{"original": "Today, The HSUS launched a television advertising campaign to expose a hard-to-stomach and hard-to-comprehend effort in Congress to overturn a federal ban on the most inhumane and unsporting practices seen in the recent history of American wildlife management. This gambit involves the sanctioning, among other deplorable practices, of private citizens going into dens and killing hibernating bears and shooting wolf puppies at point-blank range.\\n\\nSince January, Republican leaders have been pursuing an anti-regulatory agenda, saying that federal regulations are burdening business and a correction is warranted. But repealing this U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service rule, developed by professional wildlife managers to stop despicable practices, won't save one job and won't bring one dime into Alaska. H. J. Res. 69 is a cruel, mean-spirited, and duplicitous legislative maneuver, and masking it as a pro-hunting measure or a regulatory reform effort is a joke.\\n\\nRep. Don Young – Alaska's sole Congressman, formerly a licensed trapper — is seeking to unwind a carefully crafted decision by experts working on the ground and managing our national wildlife refuges in Alaska. His resolution, enabled under the Congressional Review Act, would not only allow killing of bears and wolves in and around their dens, but it would allow trophy hunters to use aircraft to scout and chase grizzly bears and then land and shoot them. It would also allow the use of giant leghold traps and snares to kill grizzly bears and black bears.\\n\\nThese are all outlier practices in American wildlife management, and it's jarring to think they were ever permitted on national wildlife refuges – the one category of federal lands set aside principally for wildlife. Only Maine allows bear trapping, and no other states allow the use of aircraft to chase down grizzly bears. Only Idaho allows shooting wolves around their dens.\\n\\nYet, as I mentioned, the peddlers of this effort in Congress are trying to cast this measure as pro-sportsmen. That's like a chicken farmer defending cockfighting by saying it's part of American agriculture. These are extreme practices, beyond the pale of decency, and no true sportsmen would ever defend or participate in this conduct.\\n\\nOur HSUS television commercial explains what's at stake with this vote, but doesn't show the actual cruelty that bears and wolves endure. If we did show a hunter shooting a wolf puppy at point-blank range, or a grizzly bear thrashing to escape a steel-jawed trap, viewers would recoil and the networks would pull the ads off the air. And that's part of my argument: if you cannot watch it or broadcast it, it certainly shouldn't be allowed on lands labeled as national wildlife refuges.\\n\\nKilling hibernating bears, shooting wolf pups in their dens, and chasing down grizzlies by aircraft and then shooting them on the ground is not the stuff of some depraved video game. It is real, and the policy forbidding or green-lighting these activities is scheduled to come up for debate and a vote tomorrow on the House floor. The National Rifle Association and Safari Club International are pushing for the green-lighting of these practices, to their great dishonor.\\n\\nThe purveyors of this misguided resolution are engaged in all sorts of other phony arguments, including the claim that only the state of Alaska can decide these issues. But they conveniently fail to mention that these are national wildlife refuges, and there are multiple court cases that establish that the federal government is the final decider on wildlife management decisions for federal lands.\\n\\nWhen the wildlife protection rule was made final in August, USFWS director Dan Ashe, himself a hunter, said it best: Over the past several years, the Alaska Board of Game has unleashed a withering attack on bears and wolves that is wholly at odds with America's long tradition of ethical, sportsmanlike, fair-chase hunting, in something they call 'intensive predator management'.\\n\\nH. J. Res. 69 would also block the administration from ever issuing a similar rule, leaving the power to prohibit these outrageous hunting methods solely in the hands of Congress.\\n\\nCongressman Young, who's been in office for nearly a half century, is badly out of touch with the mood in his state. Most Alaskans favor the rule and object to these barbaric practices. A 2016 poll conducted by Remington Research Group showed that Alaska voters strongly support eliminating these cruel and unsporting practices used to kill bears and wolves on national wildlife refuges in their state. Driving down grizzly bear and wolf numbers on refuges is a prescription for tamping down tourism and hurting gateway communities to national wildlife refuges that benefit immensely from visits from people throughout the world who hope to catch a glimpse of a wolf family or a mama bear with her cubs. Wildlife watchers contribute over $2 billion to Alaska's economy.\\n\\nContact your U.S. Representative today and urge him or her to oppose H. J. Res. 69. The Young resolution is indecent in the extreme, and we must raise our voices against this policy change in the loudest way we know.\\n\\nThis article first appeared on Wayne Pacelle's blog, A Humane Nation."}

{"original": "Civil rights groups have filed a suit against Dallas County, Texas, over allegations that officials are running an unconstitutional judicial system that forces defendants, including a transgender woman who has struggled with homelessness and unemployment, to spend days or weeks behind bars before trial simply because they can't afford to pay bail.\\n\\nThat system has allegedly had direct consequences for plaintiff Shannon Daves, a 47-year-old who like many defendants was arrested on low-level charges. After being booked for misdemeanor theft earlier this month, Daves was unable to post $500 bail. As a result, she was indefinitely detained in solitary confinement, due to the county's policy on transgender inmates, while she awaited trial. Daves says she was confined to her cell for 24 hours a day.\\n\\nI never know what time of day it is or when mealtime will be, she wrote in an affidavit filed in the case. I feel that because I am transgender they have allowed me to fall through the cracks.\\n\\nThe federal class action lawsuit, filed this week, details a callous pretrial process in which Dallas County judges file rapidly through arrestees, assigning predetermined bail amounts based solely on the type of charge. As in many jurisdictions in Texas and around the nation, when judges assign bail they don't ask whether individuals can afford to pay the money. They also don't consider other non-monetary conditions that might otherwise allow poorer defendants to be released while awaiting trial. This process leaves many people left to languish in jail, where they may end up losing jobs or shelter, getting stripped of access to public assistance or other support systems, or being separated from their families. Although these defendants are still legally presumed innocent under the law, they are effectively punished long before any determination of guilt.\\n\\nThese practices contribute substantially to the number of people incarcerated in the U.S. At any time, there are nearly 450,000 people who have not been convicted of a crime in jails across the country, with many facing only low-level charges. They account for nearly two-thirds of the jail population, and one-fifth of all people behind bars. Jailing these people costs U.S. taxpayers approximately $38 million each day, or $14 billion annually, according to a Pretrial Justice Institute report published last year.\\n\\nWhat people are fighting against all across the country is the dehumanization of the folks who are processed through the criminal legal system. Civil Rights Corps attorney Elizabeth Rossi\\n\\nThis two-tiered system of justice in Dallas County disproportionately affects people of color and the poor and violates the due process and equal protection clauses of the 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, claims the lawsuit, filed by Civil Rights Corps, the Texas Fair Defense Project and the American Civil Liberties Union. The plaintiffs, six indigent misdemeanor and felony defendants arrested in Dallas this month, are seeking injunctive relief to halt the county's judicial system. The suit names as defendants Dallas County and the county's sheriff, as well as the felony and misdemeanor court magistrate judges who currently assign bail to defendants.\\n\\nThe Dallas County suit is the latest to challenge the use of money bail in jurisdictions around the country. Civil rights groups claim such wealth-based detention practices provide no public safety benefit and come at a high cost to taxpayers, all while forcing many poorer defendants to plead guilty just to get out of jail.\\n\\nFor defendants with money, this money bail system might look less controversial. They put up the cash and get out of jail, regardless of whether they might be considered a threat to the community or a flight risk. If they return for future trial dates, they reclaim that bail money.\\n\\nBut people like Daves fare much worse. She was booked into jail on a misdemeanor theft charge on Jan. 17. Hours later, she went before a judge with about 10 other defendants. Hearings in Dallas County can include more than 20 people. The sessions are not recorded, and there are no defense attorneys, prosecutors or members of the public present, according to the lawsuit.\\n\\nDuring these hearings, each individual is addressed for about 40 seconds or maybe a minute, Civil Rights Corps attorney Elizabeth Rossi told HuffPost. The magistrate judge informs the person of the charge against them but not the factual allegations underlying the charge.\\n\\nA judge ultimately assigned Daves $500 bail, the generic amount under Dallas County's schedule. But she didn't have that kind of money, so she was sent back to jail, where she was set to remain until her trial date.\\n\\nDaves was finally released from jail on Monday along with two other plaintiffs in the lawsuit, as part of a broader effort by Faith in Texas and the Texas Organizing Project, a pair of civil justice organizations, to put up the money to bail out indigent defendants.\\n\\nBail reform advocates have been campaigning to replace this system with one that bases release decisions on individualized assessments that measure a defendant's flight risk and potential threat to community safety. In places like New Jersey and Washington, D.C., pretrial services agencies now conduct these evaluations and provide recommendations to judicial officers. Under this system, many low-level defendants are released without payment, simply on the promise that they'll return for future court dates. Others are subjected to some level of monitoring by the pretrial services agency or held without the option of bail.\\n\\nAlthough Dallas' use of money bail is in some way unremarkable, it also employs some particularly egregious practices. After bail hearings, deputies have a unusually direct way of extracting cash from defendants who can afford bail.\\n\\nThey take those folks who have enough money in a bank account to an ATM that's inside the jail in the booking area, so that person can take that money out and pay cash for that release, said Rossi. Everyone else is housed in jail cells and will stay in jail ― if you're charged with a misdemeanor, for a minimum for four to ten days before going to court, and for felony arrestees, a minimum of two weeks before being taken to court.\\n\\nThis practice highlights just how shameless Dallas County is about its money-based pretrial decision making process, Rossi added.\\n\\nThe lawsuit also claims that deputies often tell arrestees that if they aren't silent during bail hearings, judges may arbitrarily increase the amount required for release. A judge in Harris County, Texas, came under fire for exactly this behavior in 2016, when he was recorded doubling a defendant's bail from $1,000 to $2,000 after she responded to a yes or no question by saying yeah instead of yes. The woman had been arrested for misdemeanor marijuana possession.\\n\\nCivil Rights Corps and other groups are also suing Harris County over its bail system, though unlike their Dallas County suit, that challenge wasn't extended to felony defendants. A federal judge in that case has issued a preliminary injunction banning the county from holding misdemeanor defendants for more than 24 hours if they say they can't afford bail. A final ruling is still forthcoming.\\n\\nDespite the Dallas County lawsuit, officials there have already stated an interest in implementing reform and moving away from their reliance on money bail. That gives people like Rossi hope that they'll be able to find common ground going forward.\\n\\nWhat people are fighting against all across the country is the dehumanization of the folks who are processed through the criminal legal system, she said. One of the key reasons that this system has developed is that the folks running it have stopped seeing the human beings that pass through it as people and have started seeing them as just cases to be processed.\\n\\nRead the entire lawsuit below:"}
{"original": "JERUSALEM (AP) — President Donald Trump's national security adviser said Sunday that the American military withdrawal from northeastern Syria is conditioned on defeating the remnants of the Islamic State group and on Turkey assuring the safety of U.S.-allied Kurdish fighters.\\n\\nJohn Bolton said there is no timetable for the pullout, but insisted the military presence is not an unlimited commitment.\\n\\nThere are objectives that we want to accomplish that condition the withdrawal, Bolton told reporters in Jerusalem before heading to Turkey on Monday, where he will be joined by the chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Joseph Dunford. The timetable flows from the policy decisions that we need to implement.\\n\\nThose conditions, he said, included defeating what's left of IS in Syria and protecting Kurdish militias who have fought alongside U.S. troops against the extremist group.\\n\\nBolton's comments were the first public confirmation that the drawdown has been slowed. Trump had faced widespread criticism from allies about his decision, announced in mid-December, that he was pulling all 2,000 U.S. troops from Syria. Officials said at the time that although many details of the withdrawal had not yet been finalized, they expected American forces to be out by mid-January.\\n\\nWe're pulling out of Syria, Trump said Sunday at the White House. But we're doing it and we won't be finally pulled out until ISIS is gone.\\n\\nTrump's move, which led to the resignation of U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, has raised fears over clearing the way for a Turkish assault on the Kurdish fighters. Turkey considers the Syrian Kurdish People's Protection Units, or YPG, a terrorist group linked to an insurgency within its own borders.\\n\\nBolton said the U.S. is insisting that its Kurdish allies in Syria are protected from any planned Turkish offensive — a warning he was expected to deliver to Turkey's president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, this week.\\n\\nWe don't think the Turks ought to undertake military action that's not fully coordinated with and agreed to by the United States, Bolton said. He said that in upcoming meetings with Turkish officials he will seek to find out what their objectives and capabilities are and that remains uncertain.\\n\\nTrump has made clear that he would not allow Turkey to kill the Kurds, Bolton said. That's what the president said, the ones that fought with us.\\n\\nBolton said the U.S. has asked the Kurds to stand fast now and refrain from seeking protection from Russia or Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's government. I think they know who their friends are, he added, speaking of the Kurds.\\n\\nJim Jeffrey, the special representative for Syrian engagement and the newly named American special envoy for the anti-Islamic State coalition, is to travel to Syria this coming week in an effort to reassure the Kurdish fighters that they are not being abandoned, Bolton said.\\n\\nTurkey's presidential spokesman called allegations that his country planned to attack the U.S.-allied Kurds in Syria irrational and said Turkey was fighting terrorism for national security.\\n\\nIn comments carried by the official Anadolu news agency, Ibrahim Kalin said the Kurdish fighters oppressed Syrian Kurds and pursued a separatist agenda under the guise of fighting IS. That a terror organization cannot be allied with the U.S. is self-evident, he said.\\n\\nU.S. Rep. Adam Smith, the incoming chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, told ABC's This Week that the conditions raised by Bolton were obvious, and Smith criticized the conflicting messages from the Trump administration.\\n\\nWe don't want ISIS to rise again and be a transnational terrorist threat and we don't want our allies, the Kurds, to be slaughtered by Erdogan in Turkey, said Smith, D-Wash.\\n\\nBolton said U.S. troops would remain at the critical area of al-Tanf, in southern Syria, to counter growing Iranian activity in the region. He defended the legal basis for the deployment, saying it's justified by the president's constitutional authority.\\n\\nThe U.S. is also seeking a satisfactory disposition for roughly 800 IS prisoners held by the U.S.-backed Syrian opposition, Bolton said, adding talks were ongoing with European and regional partners about the issue.\\n\\nBolton was to have dinner with Israel's prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, on Sunday to discuss the pace of the U.S. drawdown, American troop levels in the region, and the U.S. commitment to push back on Iranian regional expansionism.\\n\\nBolton was expected to explain that some U.S. troops based in Syria to fight IS will shift to Iraq with the same mission and that the al-Tanf base would remain.\\n\\nBolton also was to convey the message that the United States is very supportive of Israeli strikes against Iranian targets in Syria, according to a senior administration official, who was not authorized to publicly discuss Bolton's plans before the meetings and spoke on condition of anonymity.\\n\\nBolton on Sunday also toured the ancient tunnels beneath the Western Wall in Jerusalem's Old City. He watched a virtual reality tour of the historic site and dined there with his Israeli equivalent, as well as U.S. Ambassador to Israel David Friedman and Israel's ambassador to the U.S., Ron Dermer.\\n\\nVisiting American officials typically avoid holding official meetings in parts of east Jerusalem, which is contested between Israelis and Palestinians. Trump, however, also toured the area in a previous visit.\\n\\nIsrael annexed east Jerusalem after capturing it from Jordan in the 1967 war, a move not recognized by most of the international community. Palestinians seek east Jerusalem as the capital of their future state.\\n\\n___\\n\\nAssociated Press writers Zeynep Bilginsoy in Istanbul and Catherine Lucey in Washington contributed to this report."}
{"original": "Empics Entertainment\\n\\nLabour's Emily Thornberry has categorically ruled out backing a second Brexit referendum, declaring a Jeremy Corbyn government would have to do as instructed by the British people in the 2016 EU vote. In her strongest remarks yet on the issue, the Shadow Foreign Secretary told a private meeting in Islington that the party had to uphold the Leave vote as much as it breaks our heart. Thornberry also said she disagreed with former Cabinet minister Justine Greening, who this week called for a 'People's Vote' with three options -approving the Government's Chequers plan, a 'no deal' Brexit and staying in the EU. Her comments came at a meeting of Corbyn's local Islington North constituency Labour party on Wednesday night, which also rejected pleas from activists for a fresh referendum. Motions calling for a 'People's Vote', backed by an alliance of left wingers and centrists, were tabled but failed to win enough support as supporters of the Labour leader said that any move to shift the current party policy on the issue would be seen as 'anti-JC'. Corbyn, whose Shadow Cabinet have studiously avoided committing the party either way on a new referendum, was present for the entire discussion on Brexit.\\n\\nEmpics Entertainment The People's Vote march in London in June\\n\\nMore than 100,000 people turned out for a 'People's Vote' march in London in June and the idea is gaining support in local Labour parties. Deputy leader Tom Watson repeated last week Corbyn's line that Labour was not calling for a new plebiscite, but could not rule one out. Thornberry, whose own seat neighbours Islington North, made a speech rounding on the idea that the country needed either a cross-party 'Government of National Unity' or a referendum to sort out the UK's exit from the EU. What we need is not a Government of National Unity, what we need is not a second referendum - we need a general election. That's what we need, she said. We need to have a Labour government that will be pragmatic. That will turn up in Brussels and say 'the grown-ups have arrived'. Let's work out what we are going to do. We have to leave, we don't want to leave, we weren't the liars, we weren't the manipulators, we didn't have any lies on the side of buses, we weren't pushing to leave the European Union, we were campaigning to remain in the European Union. We are internationalists and we believe that we are European. The trouble is we went ahead and had a referendum and we lost it and overwhelmingly, above everything else, we are Democrats, so we have to do as instructed - as much as it breaks our heart. Thornberry appeared to take a more flexible approach in January, when she said that at the moment a second referendum would not be appropriate.\\n\\nPA Wire/PA Images Deputy leader Tom Watson\\n\\nLast week Watson told BBC Radio 4 that the current chaos in the Tory party meant that there may be no Parliamentary majority for Theresa May's Chequers compromise plan for Brexit. Even though we'd prefer a meaningful vote in Parliament – and I have said many, many times it's highly, highly, highly unlikely we will support a people's vote, and we have not called for it – we haven't taken that off the table. Because there are a rare set of circumstances where Parliament just can't make a decision on it and, in those circumstances, you'd keep your options open. Demands for a 'People's Vote' on the final Brexit deal hammered out with Brussels have intensified in recent months and Greening has been joined by 'Remainer' Tories Anna Soubry and Dominic Grieve in backing the idea. No.10 firmly dismissed the proposal but the Liberal Democrats, SNP and large numbers of Labour activists want a fresh vote because the original EU referendum did not specify which type of Brexit the UK would get.\\n\\nHuffPost UK The motions tabled by activists in Corbyn's local party"}
{"original": "Professional, highly-trained and highly respected teachers are a key factor in our success: teachers have pedagogical autonomy so they decide by themselves which teaching methods and materials they use. -- Sanni Grahn-Laasonen\\n\\nSanni Grahn-Laasonen says her country's vision for education is a nation that is continuously learning; Finland wants an education system that gives everyone strong, transferable skills, and also allows everyone to return to education when they need it. In the workplace, this requires a culture that allows for continuous professional development, and she believes it is the government's job to encourage people to learn.\\n\\nAs Minister, she is in charge of national education policy and leads all improvement efforts including national legislation, guidelines and strategies. Decision making in the Finnish system, she says, is characterized by a broad consensus rather than dictating things from above. While the government determines how much time is spent on individual subjects, the National Core Curriculum (developed by the Finnish National Board of Education in close cooperation with all stakeholders in education, especially teachers) sets subject-specific guidelines. The bottom line, she notes, is that it's up to teachers to determine what activities take place in classrooms. Finland is renowned for teacher autonomy. They are the ones that are doing the valuable work; we must value and respect their opinions.\\n\\nWe welcome Minister of Education and Culture, Sanni Grahn-Laasonen, to The Global Search for Education.\\n\\n\\n\\nOur vision for Finland is a country that is continuously learning. We need an education system that gives everyone strong, transferable skills, and also allows everyone to return to education when they need it. -- Sanni Grahn-Laasonen\\n\\nMinister, what are the key initiatives of the education ministry at present?\\n\\nFinland is a small nation, which is why our success and prosperity must be based on knowledge, learning and education. We live in a world where everything is changing at an ever faster pace. I believe that learning to learn, being able to acquire new skills, and thinking critically and creatively are some of the key factors for the education of tomorrow. Equal opportunity for everyone is an important value for us Finns.\\n\\nFinnish people want consistent, long-term policy-making. There is a broad commitment to a vision of a knowledge-based society. This vision is widely shared and accepted by the employers and labor organizations, as well as the industry and their interest groups. We recognize the need for continuous improvement of learning environments and practices that take place at the local level. Professional, highly-trained and highly respected teachers are a key factor in our success: teachers have pedagogical autonomy so they decide by themselves which teaching methods and materials they use.\\n\\nOur current big reform deals with renewing our comprehensive education. Key words are the new National Core Curriculum, a new way of thinking - student-centered, phenomenon-based learning that makes use of digital learning environments, and a new culture of collaboration.\\n\\nA second initiative is a total reorganization of vocational education and training. We aim to move from a system that measures time spent studying to a system that measures the skills acquired. Vocational education will increasingly move to work places; this deepens the collaboration between schools and local businesses.\\n\\nWe are also working on facilitating the transitions from secondary education to higher education, and from higher education to working life. Other key projects include bringing more art and culture to school days as extra-curricular activities, and providing school kids with one hour of physical exercise in its various forms every day. We call this 'Schools on the Move'. The idea is to integrate physical activities in the teaching of all subjects, not just specific sports classes.\\n\\nWe are underlining the need for pedagogically trained teachers in ECEC (Early Childhood Education and Care), particularly now that we have, for the first time, a National Core Curriculum for ECEC.\\n\\nOur vision for Finland is a country that is continuously learning. We need an education system that gives everyone strong, transferable skills, and also allows everyone to return to education when they need it. In workplaces, we need a culture that allows for continuous professional development as individuals and as organisations. We feel that it is the government's job to encourage people to learn.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe cross-curricular themes like active citizenship, entrepreneurship, and the world of work provide students with learning experiences that encourage them to take responsibility and to engage in constructive and knowledge-based critical thinking. -- Sanni Grahn-Laasonen\\n\\nWhat kind of input do educators on the ground (teachers/principals) have in policy making? What kind of input do you think they should have?\\n\\nDecision-making at school level is based on a collaborative approach where, by law, also the students must have a voice in the process. The leadership team and teacher teams take part in decision-making in matters concerning educational and practical issues in schools.\\n\\nAt the local level, teachers and principals are a vital part of the planning process, including the crafting of the local adaptation of the National Core Curriculum. Technically, final decisions are made at the local political level. However, generally speaking, politicians don't meddle with school activities and the local curriculum.\\n\\nAt the national level, teachers and principals take part in different working groups. One such group is responsible for preparing the National Core Curriculum. The Teachers' Union is also an important stakeholder, working in collaboration with the government prior to the decision-making on different issues.\\n\\nWhat kind of curriculum changes do you believe are essential for students to succeed in both the future labor market and life?\\n\\nEach and every child must be empowered to find their place as an active member of society. The new National Core Curriculum includes transversal competences, which are embedded in every subject. These competences are thinking and learning to learn, cultural understanding, interaction and self-expression, taking care of oneself and life skills, multi literacy, ICT skills, working life competence, entrepreneurship, participation and involvement in the society and building a sustainable future. These skills are important for young people in their future working life, and consequently, they are part of the new curriculum and integral to our new approach to learning.\\n\\nMultidisciplinary learning modules are required at least once every year. Students' own interests are taken into account when planning these modules. The purpose of this integrative instruction is to enable students to see the relationships and interdependencies of the phenomena under study. This helps students link their knowledge and skills in various fields, and working in interaction with others, to learn about meaningful entities and phenomena.\\n\\nWhat steps are being taken to update and improve teaching skills and methods to accommodate a rapidly changing world?\\n\\nTeachers play a crucial role. I mentioned earlier our comprehensive school reform that aims to develop a new way of thinking. How do we intend to realize this reform? By renovating teacher training. I have nominated a Forum on Teacher Training, consisting of representatives from all universities providing teachers, whose task it is to develop new guidelines and contents for the formation of Finnish teachers. The government will then provide grants to teachers so that they have better access to complementary education so that they, too, may upgrade their skills in, for example, using digital technology at school. We aim to have tutor teachers who instruct their colleagues on new pedagogics and the use of new technology. We encourage teachers to collaborate, to form networks and support one another.\\n\\nA school system is never finished, and teachers are the change makers. The answer to your question lies, I believe, in three steps: First, grasping the need for a fundamental change, then making the right conclusions, and finally putting the conclusions to work. Our current government has realized the need for change. We are now at the stage of getting to the conclusions, as the Teacher Training Forum is finishing the first stage of their work. The next step is starting to implement change, and luckily, we have already set aside the money to do the work. We are going to spend 90 million euros on this, which is a big sum for a country as small as ours that is going through economically tough times.\\n\\n\\n\\nComprehensive global challenges require cultural know-how, communication, interaction and cooperation skills. In my opinion, global learning is a question of learning to be at the same time a Finn, a European and a world citizen.\\n\\n-- Sanni Grahn-Laasonen\\n\\nWhat initiatives are helping ensure that high school graduates have the skills to enter local universities and succeed in the modern workplace?\\n\\nWhile Finnish students already have good subject knowledge skills for further studies, there is room for improvement in generic skills and knowledge of the modern workplace. This is one of the goals in the new National Core Curriculum for General Upper Secondary Education (high school) to be used from 2016. In these guidelines, the cross-curricular themes - which are transversal competences crossing the boundaries of individual subjects - have been updated.\\n\\nThe cross-curricular themes like active citizenship, entrepreneurship, and the world of work provide students with learning experiences that encourage them to take responsibility and to engage in constructive and knowledge-based critical thinking.\\n\\nThe modern workplace also requires skills in sustainable ways of life, safety, understanding different cultures, multi-literacy and technology. The student body has a very important role when it comes to the school culture and the learning community. The law requires decision-makers at the local level to hear the students' voices prior to making important decisions. This is one way to encourage students to take responsibility, learn to take part in the decision-making process in society, and, in the big picture, to become responsible members of society.\\n\\nHow do you make sure today's youth grow up more globally competent than previous generations?\\n\\nToday's world is deeply interconnected, and information communicated by multiple forms of media, networks, social media and peer relationships shapes the moral compass of children and young people. In education, people of varying backgrounds come together and get to know many different customs, communal practices and beliefs. Learning together across the boundaries of languages, cultures, religions and beliefs creates a setting for genuine interaction and communality.\\n\\nGlobal education and sustainable development are integrated both in the National Core Curriculum for Basic Education and the National Core Curriculum for General Upper Secondary Education. They encourage schools to open up to their surroundings.\\n\\nThe curricula are based on the idea that the world is becoming more and more interconnected. The challenges of today's world are often simultaneously both local and global. Their understanding requires broad competences and authentic learning, both of which are contained within the new curriculum. Comprehensive global challenges require cultural know-how, communication, interaction and cooperation skills. In my opinion, global learning is a question of learning to be at the same time a Finn, a European and a world citizen.\\n\\n(Photos are courtesy of the Ministry of Education Finland)\\n\\n\\n\\nC.

In fact, Pelosi ripped up her copy of the address just after Trump finished it.\\n\\nAt the time, Twitter declined to specify if the video would be labeled or removed under its forthcoming policy.

{"original": "At least three states passed laws putting new criminal penalties on protests against fossil fuel infrastructure in just the past two weeks amid the chaos of the coronavirus pandemic. First came Kentucky. On March 16, Gov. Andy Beshear (D) signed legislation that ― while removing some of the original bill's most draconian measures on protest ― designated natural gas or petroleum pipelines as key infrastructure assets and made causing damage that totals more than $1,000 or tampering in a manner that renders the operations harmful or dangerous felony charges of criminal mischief in the first degree. Two days later, it was South Dakota. On March 18, Gov. Kristi Noem (R) signed a bill that expanded the definition of critical infrastructure to include virtually any oil, gas or utility equipment, and raised the charges for causing substantial interruption or impairment of such facilities to felonies. Five days later, on March 23, the governor approved a second measure defining a felony riot as intentional use of force or violence by three or more persons that causes any damage to property. On Wednesday, West Virginia followed suit. Gov. Jim Justice (R) greenlighted legislation assigning the same critical infrastructure status to a wide range of oil, gas and pipeline facilities, slapping fines as high as $20,000 on anyone found guilty of causing damage, destruction, vandalization, defacing or tampering that totals $2,500 or more.\\n\\nPacific Press via Getty Images A defiant Dakota Access pipeline protester faces off against militarized police in 2017 as law enforcement raided their camp.\\n\\nThe wave of legislation came as the United States became the epicenter of COVID-19, the rapidly spreading respiratory disease caused by the novel coronavirus. By Friday, the U.S. death toll topped 1,000, with more than 100,000 confirmed cases, overwhelming hospitals and forcing doctors to publicly beg for basic medical supplies. The economic fallout exceeded even the worst expectations: 3.3 million Americans filed jobless claims this week ― topping both Goldman Sachs' 2.25 million forecast from last week and smashing the previous one-week record of 695,000 reported job losses. Yet, as experts blamed the White House's back-footed response for inflaming the crisis, the Trump administration appeared to ramp up its environmental agenda, ordering the Environmental Protection Agency's enforcement division to temporarily stop policing polluters, approving a slate of mining projects, auctioning off new drilling leases and reviving a dormant fight over auto emission standards. The efforts on both the state and federal level offered jarring real-time examples of what the author Naomi Klein dubbed the shock doctrine: the phenomenon wherein polluters and their government allies push through unpopular policy changes under the smokescreen of a public emergency. While we are all paying attention to COVID-19 and the congressional stimulus packages, state legislatures are quietly passing fossil-fuel-backed anti-protest laws, Connor Gibson, the researcher at Greenpeace USA who tipped HuffPost off to the bills' passage, said by email Friday. These laws do nothing new to protect communities. Instead they seek to crack down on the sort of nonviolent civil disobedience that has shaped much of our nation's greatest political and social victories. The legislation's similarities were no coincidence. As climate change projections grew more dire and the bloody 2016 fight to stop the Dakota Access Pipeline became a new Alamo cry for environmentalists, the fossil fuel industry's political allies began promoting state legislation to restrict protests. Oklahoma passed the first legislation protecting pipelines as critical infrastructure in 2017. Shortly after, the American Legislative Exchange Council, the conservative policy shop funded by big business and right-wing billionaires, drafted a generic bill it called the Critical Infrastructure Protection Act.\\n\\nBRYAN R.

{"original": "WASHINGTON — Utah Gov. Gary Herbert on Thursday signed a controversial bill to lower the state's blood-alcohol limit for drivers to 0.05 percent — the strictest standard in the nation.\\n\\nHerbert said in a statement that the bill is good public policy aimed at reducing the number of alcohol-related deaths on Utah's roads.\\n\\nPublic safety is our focus, he said. This law does not target drinking; it is a public safety law that targets impaired driving.\\n\\nIn passing the legislation, sponsored by Republican state Rep. Norman Thurston, Utah becomes the first state to drop the blood-alcohol limit below the 0.08 percent nationwide standard. The move comes more than three decades after Utah became the first state to adopt the 0.08 BAC limit.\\n\\nHerbert said he plans to call a special session to address unintended consequences of the law and make necessary modifications before it takes effect on Dec. 31, 2018.\\n\\nThis law will save lives, therefore it is good public policy and will move us closer to achieving our goal of 'Zero Fatalities,' he said.\\n\\nUSA Today reports that the bill was backed by the National Transportation Safety Board, which has advocated for states lowering the BAC levels to 0.05 — or even lower.\\n\\nWhen it comes to alcohol use, we know that impairment begins well before a person's BAC reaches 0.08 percent, the current limit in the United States at which a driver is presumed to be impaired, the agency writes in a list of recommendations for improving transportation safety. In fact, by the time BAC reaches that level, the risk of a fatal crash has more than doubled.\\n\\nSafety is a journey, not a destination, reducing BAC limit to .05 is one of many steps to end substance impairment in transportation @wbnstv — NTSB (@NTSB) February 4, 2016\\n\\nJackie Gillan, president of Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety, also applauded the law as a victory, saying it will ensure the safety of Utah residents and visitors.\\n\\nThis law is backed by scientific research, data and outcomes from over 100 countries that have already changed their laws to .05 percent BAC and reduced impaired driving, she said in a statement. Reducing BAC limits will not discourage alcohol consumption, but it will deter dangerous drinking and driving.\\n\\nUT:.05 BAC law will not reduce the beauty of Utah's terrain for tourists or quash a fun night out-It will help to ensure you get home safely — Advocates (@SafeRoadsNow) March 23, 2017\\n\\nOpponents, however, including the Utah Restaurant Association, say the law incriminates those who drink responsibly.\\n\\nIn an op-ed published in The Salt Lake Tribune, Sarah Longwell, the managing director of the American Beverage Institute, noted a 120-pound woman could reach the limit after just a single drink, and be subject to arrest, jail, thousands of dollars in fines and social stigma.\\n\\nIt's clear that the state's unique relationship with alcohol played a significant role in passing this law so quickly and decisively, Longwell wrote. The National Transportation Safety Board — the main advocate for 0.05 laws — saw an easier legislative path in Utah than in other states.\\n\\nAn estimated 10,000 people are killed in the United States each year in alcohol-related vehicle crashes — roughly 28 per day, according to NTSB statistics.\\n\\nDuring a press conference Thursday, Herbert dismissed the idea that the law is a religious issue or that it would make people view Utah as weird.\\n\\nThere's not very many Mormons in Rome and they're doing it there also, he said of implementing a 0.05 BAC limit."}
{"original": "LOS ANGELES ― California is now the largest state in the nation to have legal and regulated recreational marijuana. And while that alone is a blow to the prohibitionist policies of the failed war on drugs, a lesser-known provision in the state's new law, along with efforts in a few local jurisdictions, aims to repair some of the damage that the criminalization of marijuana has done to so many communities.\\n\\nCalifornia's Proposition 64 ballot measure was not only about marijuana legalization, it was one of the most progressive sentencing and criminal justice reforms in the entire country, said Eunisses Hernandez, a policy coordinator at Drug Policy Alliance, a leading drug policy reform group.\\n\\nA year ago, voters approved Proposition 64 to legalize marijuana for recreational purposes and reduce criminal penalties for various marijuana-related offenses for adults and juveniles. It also authorized a new process for individuals in the state to get previous marijuana-related convictions retroactively reduced, reclassified as lesser offenses or dismissed altogether.\\n\\nThe process could end up helping hundreds of thousands of people whose lives have been disrupted or derailed over activities that became legal as of Jan. 1. Criminal convictions can have devastating consequences long after the offense was committed, making it difficult to obtain employment, bank loans and housing.\\n\\nIn many ways, Proposition 64 has already been a success because we've ended the unnecessary and arbitrary criminalization of Californians around this issue, and helped tens of thousands of people who were unjustly unable to seek career and education opportunities due to prior non-violent marijuana offenses, Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom told HuffPost.\\n\\nBut relief is not automatic under the new law. Individuals who want their marijuana convictions reclassified or cleared must submit an application to a court. They may also need to hire an attorney to help them through the process. About 5,000 people have so far applied to have marijuana sentences reviewed for possible relief, according to data compiled by the Judicial Council of California. And while it's encouraging that some are taking advantage of the new process, it's an extremely small fraction of the number of people who have been arrested for marijuana offenses in the state.\\n\\nCalifornia produces vast amounts of marijuana and has done so for years. In 1996, it became the first state to legalize medical marijuana. And despite the passage of more permissive laws, there were still thousands of marijuana-related arrests annually. From 2006 to 2015, there were nearly 500,000 people arrested for marijuana offenses, a recent DPA report found. And Rodney Holcombe, a legal fellow at DPA, said that there may be close to 1 million people in the state who have convictions that could now be eligible for relief.\\n\\nCreating a safe, legal and tightly regulated system for adult-use marijuana is, at its core, about criminal justice reform and fixing a broken system that has disproportionately harmed low-income Californians and communities of color, said Newsom, a proponent of Prop. 64.\\n\\nBeyond sentencing, some local governments are making efforts to further repair damage from criminalization by enacting equity programs that allow for victims of the war on drugs to have application priority during the marijuana business licensing process.\\n\\nAs we know, communities of color have been most negatively impacted by marijuana prohibition throughout the years ― folks have been incarcerated for activity that is now completely legal ― and you have a new demographic now coming in taking over these spaces making millions of dollars through this industry, Holcombe said. These programs can provide a tremendous opportunity for low-income folks, folks of color, folks who have lived in neighborhoods that have been over-policed, especially during the height of the war on drugs.\\n\\nTo that end, Oakland launched the nation's first equity permit program earlier this year. It sets aside half of all medical and recreational marijuana business licenses for applications by individuals hit hardest by marijuana criminalization. In their research during the development of the program, Oakland City Council found that over the past two decades, the black community has been extraordinarily over-represented in marijuana-related arrests in the region. In 1998, up to 90 percent of marijuana arrests involved a black suspect. By comparison, just 3.9 percent of those arrested were white.\\n\\nTo qualify as an equity applicant, individuals must be an Oakland resident whose annual income is less than 80 percent of the average in the region and either have a previous marijuana conviction or have lived in over-policed areas of the city for 10 of the last 20 years. For those who qualify, the application fee is also waived.\\n\\nCity councils in Los Angeles, San Francisco and Sacramento are also considering equity programs.\\n\\nHolcombe hopes that local jurisdictions ― and other states that may legalize one day ― give a leg up in the industry to even more people, especially those who don't have the funds to start a business and who may have a marijuana conviction that makes getting a bank loan difficult. Holcombe said cities could address this through allocating a portion of marijuana sales tax to fund these equity applicants' start-up businesses while also prioritizing women and minority business applicants.\\n\\nThe state's marijuana industry already has a projected value of $7 billion, and, as more marijuana retailers obtain permits, state and local governments are expected to collect $1 billion annually in tax revenue. With such an enormous marketplace, California should prioritize access for those who had been targeted by anti-marijuana laws, Erik Altieri, executive director of marijuana policy reform group NORML, told HuffPost.\\n\\nAs states start dialing back their war on marijuana consumers, Altieri said, it is important that those who were most negatively impacted by our oppressive prohibition are able to see previous harms remedied as best as possible and be given the opportunity to participate in the benefits that come along with legalization and regulation.\\n\\nBill Clark/CQ via Getty Images"}
{"original": "The government shutdown has dragged on for two weeks due to President Donald Trump's insistence on border wall funding. And while Trump is characterizing the barrier as a non-negotiable tenet of border security, immigrant experts told HuffPost it's an ineffective solution that will endanger migrant families.\\n\\nAdvocates say the wall could force people to take dangerous journeys to cross the border or threaten parents and children's health by making them languish in unsanitary shelters near ports of entry. Experts are especially concerned about the well-being of migrant kids after a boy and a girl recently died in Border Patrol custody.\\n\\nFortifying the border is just going to lead to more deaths, said Elissa Steglich, a law professor at the University of Texas at Austin who teaches a clinic for immigrant families. [It's] giving business to sophisticated smugglers who are going to be taking migrants through more perilous and life-threatening circumstances.\\n\\nThe number of migrant families being apprehended at the border reached record-high levels of more than 25,000 last month ― a number that's risen by more than 13 percent since 2013.\\n\\nExperts say Trump's wall, which the Department Of Homeland Security estimated would amount to more than 330 miles of fencing, won't deter families from trying to cross the border even as it makes their journeys more dangerous.\\n\\nYou can't deter away a refugee flow, said Jennifer Podkul, the director of policy for Kids in Need of Defense. If someone thinks they are not going to live if they stay in their country of origin, they will go and try to find safety somewhere else.\\n\\nAssociated Press The U.S. government has made a strategic decision to force people to only cross in areas where death is more likely, said policy analyst David Bier.\\n\\nIn the '90s, the government built fences in border cities such as San Diego, California, and El Paso, Texas, which forced immigrants to make more perilous journeys through the mountains and desert. The number of migrants who died trying to reach the U.S. has skyrocketed and the bodies of nearly 3,000 migrants have been found in southern Arizona since 2000, according to the Pima County Office of the Medical Examiner.\\n\\nThe number of families apprehended by Border Patrol while traveling through the El Paso sector, which includes a part of the Chihuahuan Desert, has risen by more than 1,500 percent over the past year because of policies that dissuade immigrants from using legal ports of entry and an increased military presence at the border. Advocates worry a border wall will only exacerbate the problem and lead to more health issues for children traveling through remote regions that lack access to medical services.\\n\\nIn December, 7-year-old Jackelin Caal Maquin traveled from Guatemala through the New Mexico desert with her father before dying from dehydration and shock in Border Patrol custody. After turning themselves in to Border Patrol agents, Caal and her father traveled three hours by bus to the nearest Border Patrol station in Lordsburg, New Mexico. Jackelin was later transported by helicopter to a children's hospital after having seizures.\\n\\nThe U.S. government has made a strategic decision to force people to only cross in areas where death is more likely, said David Bier, an immigration policy analyst at the Cato Institute's Center for Global Liberty and Prosperity. [A wall] will create more deaths in the desert and more people suffering on their way here.\\n\\nFortifying the border is just going to lead to more deaths. Elissa Steglich, University of Texas at Austin\\n\\nImmigration experts say a border wall will also drive migrant families to use smugglers to navigate precarious border crossing routes. Some smugglers are involved in human trafficking or the drug trade, putting children in extremely dangerous situations. Steglich's child clients have told her stories of being forced into prostitution, made to carry drugs across the border or being locked in hotel rooms for weeks.\\n\\nAnytime you make it more difficult to cross, you empower cartel and smugglers and organized criminals who control the crossing points and the border, said Bier.\\n\\nExperts also worry that a wall will cause further backlogs at legal ports of entry, where some migrants have been waiting for months to cross the border due to the Trump administration's crackdown on asylum-seekers. As a result, thousands of immigrants who arrived in Tijuana, Mexico, with a migrant caravan last month are languishing in sometimes unsanitary shelters for their turn to legally cross the border.\\n\\nOthers have tried to enter the U.S. between ports of entry, which can be especially dangerous for children. Last month, two Guatemalan teens injured themselves after climbing the border wall separating Arizona from Mexico and falling 18 feet. Other migrants, including children, have been tear-gassed or hit with rubber bullets while trying to cross the border illegally.\\n\\nImmigration experts say the money Trump is requesting to build a wall would be better spent on more Border Patrol agents to process migrants, a more efficient immigration court system and technology to detect drugs and weapons at the border.\\n\\nSteglich says that in addition to forcing people into physically dangerous situations, the wall enforces a dangerous mentality that migrants should be treated like criminals instead of humans.\\n\\nIf you are looking at a migrant as a national security threat, you're going to be more callous, she said. You're not going to be as attentive to the humanitarian needs of a mother or child before you."}

{"original": "President Donald Trump spoke for about an hour and 20 minutes before the U.S. Congress on Tuesday and largely stuck to the script, successfully avoiding any tirades about the ongoing Senate impeachment trial.\\n\\nBut even on message, the president's State of the Union speech was all over the place.\\n\\nHe boasted about achievements in promoting peace between Israelis and Palestinians even though his plan makes fighting between them even more likely. He claimed he is protecting preexisting conditions in health care, even though he has repeatedly tried to kill the Affordable Care Act. He bragged about the healthy economy as a strong indicator of the success of his presidency, when much of the economy's success is due to factors outside of Trump's control.\\n\\nLike most Trump speeches, the address was chock-full of statements that misrepresented his record and policy positions. Here are some of the highlights.\\n\\n'We Will Always Protect Patients With Preexisting Conditions'\\n\\nI have also made an ironclad pledge to American families: We will always protect patients with preexisting conditions ― that is a guarantee, Trump said.\\n\\nHe's been making versions of that claim since he first became president. But it was a lie then and it is a lie now. He spent most of 2017 working with the Republican Congress to repeal the Affordable Care Act, including with legislation that would have undermined or eliminated entirely the key parts of the law ― including a requirement that insurers charge everybody the same premiums, regardless of medical status, and that all policies include comprehensive benefits.\\n\\nThe repeal effort failed, but Trump has kept at it by using his executive authority. In 2018, his administration allowed the sale of limited duration plans that would allow insurers to charge higher premiums, or deny coverage altogether, to people with preexisting conditions.\\n\\nAnd things could get worse. The administration is backing a lawsuit that, if successful, would wipe out the Affordable Care Act. Most legal experts think the case is a joke, but it's now won support in two federal courts. A hearing before the Supreme Court could be next.\\n\\nBeyond general comments on health care, Trump returned to a specific lie from last year: the claim that he's tackling the prevalence of AIDS. We will eradicate the AIDS epidemic in America by the end of the decade, he said. In fact, the president's efforts to stop reproductive health providers from talking about abortion by cutting off government funding are making it harder to prevent the transmission of AIDS both within the U.S. and abroad.\\n\\n'Prey Upon The Public'\\n\\nTrump's comments on immigration were typically misleading and incendiary.\\n\\nHe provided an especially flagrant misrepresentation on so-called sanctuary cities that restrict cooperation with Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\\n\\nIn sanctuary cities, local officials order police to release dangerous criminal aliens to prey upon the public, instead of handing them over to ICE to be safely removed, Trump said.\\n\\nThat's not actually how it works. There's no set definition for a sanctuary city ― some referenced under the term, like California, aren't actually cities at all ― but it broadly means one with policies that allow people to be released from police custody whenever they otherwise would be, even if ICE has requested they be held longer. Dangerous people remain locked up if they're convicted or denied bail or bond. Some federal judges have ruled it unconstitutional to keep people longer than they would be on only an ICE request.\\n\\nWhile there are examples of people being released and going on to commit other crimes ― as Trump noted ― multiple researchers have found there is no link between sanctuary policies and crime.\\n\\n'Blue-Collar Boom'\\n\\nTrump gave himself and Republicans sole credit for the economy, again calling it a blue-collar boom. If we hadn't reversed the failed economic policies of the previous administration, the world would not now be witnessing this great economic success, Trump said in the speech.\\n\\nWhile it's true the economy has grown stronger since the Great Recession, improvements predate Trump. Much of the blue-collar wage growth he boasted about in his State of the Union speech most likely results from state minimum wage increases rather than Trump's policies. And in the first annual comprehensive review of Trump's Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the Congressional Research Service reported that the legislation did not live up to its promises. According to the CRS, the gross domestic product grew at 2.9%, which shows no significant boost to the economy given its positive trend before the bill passed.\\n\\nKamil Krzaczynski/Reuters U.S. manufacturing, one of Trump's favorite industries to mention, has suffered because of his trade wars.\\n\\nThe president also gave himself credit for an initial deal with China that he says will ultimately lead to a better economic relationship between the U.S. and the world's second-biggest economy ― even though it's unclear whether the key element of the bargain that's supposed to benefit American workers will actually be implemented and its effects have yet to be seen.\\n\\nAnd he boasted that people had been lifted off welfare ― which is due to improvements in the economy and stricter eligibility rules initiated by President Barack Obama. Trump's welfare proposals have yet to take effect.\\n\\n'Bold Regulatory Reduction Campaign'\\n\\nTrump bragged Tuesday of having shattered the mentality of American decline and took credit for the United States becoming the number one producer of oil and natural gas in the world, by far. In fact, it was in 2012, under Obama, that the U.S. became the top producer, as CNN's Daniel Dale noted in a tweet ahead of Trump's speech.\\n\\nThe actual effect of what Trump called his bold regulatory reduction campaign has been protecting planet-heating emissions from cars and power plants and ending the U.S. commitment to the climate goals of the landmark international Paris agreement that almost every other nation is still committed to. The president has shortened the review process under the National Environmental Policy Act, clearing the way for new infrastructure projects, particularly those dealing with fossil fuels, to ignore climate change as an issue altogether. And he's stripped federal protections from nearly half the nation's wetlands and hundreds of thousands of streams, proposed making it legal to incidentally kill migratory birds, and cleared the way to approve old, bee-killing pesticides and new, potentially human-killing forever chemicals.\\n\\nThe 'Peace Plan'\\n\\nTrump previewed his 2020 sales pitch about his foreign policy: that he's making Americans safer by taking aggressive steps that his predecessors avoided ― treating foreigners, whom he presents as exploitative or threatening or both, with greater wariness and in some cases outright violence.\\n\\nFirst, he misrepresented the way U.S. allies are addressing Washington's frustrations with their failure to meet expectations on defense spending for members of the NATO alliance, a top issue for him but also a priority for predecessors like Obama. Other countries have raised more than $400 billion already, he claimed ― a lie Dale called out by noting that, per NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg, those countries will be paying that amount by 2024.\\n\\nThen the president gave himself a pat on the back for killing Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the leader of the so-called Islamic State, ignoring the role Obama's administration played in crafting the anti-ISIS strategy he followed, and for last month ordering the assassination of Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani, a dramatic escalation in the confrontation between Washington and Tehran and a move that past presidents considered but decided would be too risky. The move prompted retaliatory strikes by Iran that injured 50 American troops and worsened U.S. relations with Iraq, where the U.S. targeted Soleimani.\\n\\nAnd he promoted another move that inflamed regional tensions: his peace plan for Israelis and Palestinians ― a framework that infuriated the Palestinians and their supporters and emboldened Israeli hard-liners eager to advance policies like settlements and annexation that violate international law and human rights standards.\\n\\nTrump's continued failure to explore serious diplomacy made it harder for him to make good on a 2016-era promise that he's continued to talk about: bringing back American forces and winding down the country's foreign wars.\\n\\nWe are working to end America's wars in the Middle East, Trump claimed Tuesday night. Since May, the president has sent more than 20,000 additional American troops to the Middle East, including deploying some to Saudi Arabia for the first time since 2003. He's simultaneously complicated the alliances that Washington could lean on for support instead of investing its own resources, most notably with his high-profile abandonment of a crucial U.S. partner in the counter-ISIS fight, the Syrian Kurds, last year."}

At the same time, Trump encouraged his supporters to show up in force for Georgia's Tuesday contests.\\n\\nYou've got to swarm it tomorrow, Trump told thousands of cheering supporters, downplaying the threat of fraud.\\n\\nMANDEL NGAN via Getty Images Republican incumbent senator Kelly Loeffler speaks as President Donald Trump listens during a rally in support of Republican incumbent senators Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue ahead of Senate runoff at Dalton Regional Airport, Georgia on January 4, 2021.

In that scenario, the Senate would be equally divided 50-50 with Vice President-elect Kamala Harris serving as the tie-breaker for Democrats.\\n\\nThe Democrats secured a narrow House majority and the White House during November's general election.\\n\\nGeorgia's January elections, necessary because no Senate candidates received a majority of the general-election votes, have been unique for many reasons, not least because the contenders essentially ran as teams, even campaigning together sometimes.\\n\\nSANDY HUFFAKER via Getty Images Voters enter and exit a polling station at the Gwinnett County Fairgrounds on January 5, 2021 in Lawrenceville, Georgia. (Photo by SANDY HUFFAKER/AFP via Getty Images)\\n\\nOne contest features Democrat Raphael Warnock, who serves as the senior pastor of the Atlanta church where slain civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. grew up and preached. The 51-year-old Warnock was raised in public housing and spent most of his adult life preaching in Baptist churches.\\n\\nWarnock is facing Republican Sen. Kelly Loeffler, a 50-year-old former businesswoman who was appointed to the Senate less than a year ago by the state's Republican governor. She is only the second woman to represent Georgia in the Senate, although race has emerged as a campaign focus far more than gender. Loeffler and her allies have seized on some snippets of Warnock's sermons at the historic Black church to cast him as extreme. Dozens of religious and civil rights leaders have pushed back.\\n\\nThe other election pits 71-year-old former business executive David Perdue, who held the Senate seat until his term officially expired on Sunday, against Democrat Jon Ossoff, a former congressional aide and journalist. At just 33 years old, Ossoff would be the Senate's youngest member if elected. He first rose to national prominence in 2017 when he launched an unsuccessful House special election bid.\\n\\nJIM WATSON via Getty Images Democratic candidates for Senate Jon Ossoff (L), Raphael Warnock (C) and President-elect Joe Biden (R) stand on stage during a rally outside Center Parc Stadium in Atlanta, Georgia, on January 4, 2021.

But if Democrats lose even one of Tuesday's contests, Biden would have little shot for swift up-or-down votes on his most ambitious plans to expand government-backed health care coverage, strengthen the middle class, address racial inequality and combat climate change. A Republican-controlled Senate also would create a rougher path for Biden's Cabinet picks and judicial nominees.\\n\\nGeorgia, the whole nation is looking to you. The power is literally in your hands, Biden declared at his own rally in Atlanta on Monday. One state can chart the course, not just for the next four years, but for the next generation.\\n\\nDespite fears among some Republicans that Trump's baseless claims of voter fraud could depress turnout, the two GOP candidates strongly support him. Perdue on Tuesday said that Trump would of course deserve credit if the Republicans won.\\n\\nWhat the president said last night is, even if you are upset about all of that, you've got to stand up with us and fight, Perdue told Fox & Friends. We'll look back on this day if we don't vote and really rue the day that we turned the keys to the kingdom over to the Democrats.\\n\\nLoeffler pledged Monday to join a small but growing number of GOP senators protesting Congress' expected certification of Biden's victory Wednesday.\\n\\nMegan Varner via Getty Images Voters stand in line before the doors open at Cobb County Community Center on January 5, 2021 in Atlanta, Georgia. (Photo by Megan Varner/Getty Images)\\n\\nDemocrats have hammered Perdue and Loeffler, each among the Senate's wealthiest members, for conspicuously timed personal stock trades after members of Congress received information about the public health and economic threats of COVID-19 as Trump and Republicans downplayed the pandemic. None of the trades has been found to violate the law or Senate ethics, but Warnock and Ossoff have cast the Republicans as self-interested and out of touch.\\n\\nPerdue and Loeffler have answered by lambasting the Democrats as certain to to usher in a leftward lunge in national policy. Neither Warnock nor Ossoff is a socialist, as Republicans allege. They do, however, support Biden's agenda.\\n\\nThis week's elections mark the formal finale to the turbulent 2020 election season more than two months after the rest of the nation finished voting. The stakes have drawn nearly $500 million in campaign spending to a once solidly Republican state that now finds itself as the nation's premier battleground.\\n\\nIt's really about whether an agenda that moves the nation forward can be forged without significant compromise, said Martin Luther King III, the son of the civil rights icon. There are a lot of things that are in the balance.\\n\\nThe results also will help demonstrate whether the political coalition that fueled Biden's victory was an anti-Trump anomaly or part of a new landscape.\\n\\nBiden won Georgia's 16 electoral votes by about 12,000 votes out of 5 million cast in November.\\n\\nDemocratic success will likely depend on driving a huge turnout of African Americans, young voters, college-educated voters and women, all groups that helped Biden become the first Democratic presidential candidate since 1992 to win Georgia. Republicans, meanwhile, have been focused on energizing their own base of white men and voters beyond the core of metro Atlanta.\\n\\nSANDY HUFFAKER via Getty Images Republican incumbent senator David Perdue speaks via video monitor during a rally ahead of a Senate runoff in Dalton, Georgia on January 4, 2021.

{"original": "Actress Constance Wu called out the fetishization of Asian women at the Women's March last weekend, and once again the internet lit up with defensive men saying that we should actually be flattered that they have a preference for Asian women.\\n\\nMen will defend their fetish for Asian women as an innocent preference. I just like what I like is really code for I have sexualized my racism and bought into the stereotype of Asian women. The objectification of Asian women as exotic lotus blossoms isn't just confined to modern media depictions of Asian women saying me so horny to U.S. military men. It links to a longer, more problematic Western subjugation of Asian women that dates all the way back to the Silk Road.\\n\\nDo a simple Google search for Asian women and you'd think we were on sale. I'm not condemning Asian women for being sex positive, but the pervasiveness of unrealistic and hypersexualized images of Asian women feed the stereotype that Asian women are sexually available to Western men. These images aren't just dehumanizing, they put us at risk for violence. As Rachel Kuo writes: These stereotypes leveraged against East Asian women have been normalized, just like rape culture. These tropes can be found in representations in media, comments that harass us sexually and racially, and ways we're constructed via laws and policy.\\n\\nHere are six reasons why Asian women must finally give into being fetishized:\\n\\n1. Scary neo-Nazi alt-right dudes are into us which is slightly better than... getting killed?\\n\\nWhen I used to see footage of the Ku Klux Klan carrying nooses and chanting Jews Will Not Replace Us! I was like omigod, are these racist freaks going to hurt me just for being alive?\\n\\nAccording to this New York Times op-ed, it turns out they actually want to bed me! Perhaps in the same exact sheets with the eye holes in them! Even that white nationalist guy who ruined the Macklemore haircut for everyone, Richard Spencer, has a noted history of Asian girlfriends. And what woman doesn't want to be a human consolation prize to a loser who says dumb sh*t only to get sucker punched?\\n\\n2. Why work on having a personality, integrity or humanity when you can just be a category?\\n\\nI used to have things like aspirations or desires for people to see my depth of character. Turns out that if I don't even try, dudes will just see me as an exotic, submissive lotus blossom who doesn't threaten or challenge their power. White supremacy needs allies if its antiquity is to survive the global majority (memo: White people are outnumbered by people of color on this planet). And what better way to fan the flames of structural racism and inequality than to literally allow yourself to be viewed as the perpetual foreigner who will never be considered fully American until you are white?\\n\\n3. No matter how bad things get, there's a white dude out there who'll treat you to Sizzler.\\n\\nAre you doubled over in bed with period cramps, unemployed and depressed? Has your borrowed Netflix password stopped working? Perhaps you just hit menopause and feel old and unloveable? No problem! An Asian woman of any age can always count on some Asian fetish dude at the bottom of the Tinder barrel to see past all your misgivings and look straight to your black hair and brown eyes with a false perception of who you are. Besides, it saves him all the trouble of having to import a mail-order bride from Asia! Yes, you have to endure the fact that he literally thinks the last Asian woman he dated has reincarnated into your body... but hey... free dinner!\\n\\n4. Isn't it easier to just go through life as a rare Pokémon to be collected?\\n\\nFace it, Asian sisters. Our destiny is not to have goals, aspirations or dignity. It's to be like Soon-yi Previn and marry our neurotic white stepfather. And who doesn't want a husband who claims to have saved you, as Woody Allen basically said of Soon-Yi in Vanity Fair:\\n\\nShe had a very, very difficult upbringing in Korea: She was an orphan on the streets, living out of trash cans and starving as a 6-year-old. And she was picked up and put in an orphanage. And so I've been able to really make her life better. I provided her with enormous opportunities, and she has sparked to them.\\n\\nYeah, it's paternalistic, but HELLO, Annie Hall was a brilliant work of cinema so can we just give that alleged child molester just one pass? But don't worry, if love with a guy who is only in love with the idea of you doesn't pan out, he will just move onto some other Asian woman after he's done with you. So it's not like permanent or anything.\\n\\n5. And who wants to break a freakin' nail trying to smash the glass ceiling?\\n\\nThe unfortunate aftermath of being seen as part of a monolith of passive, soft-spoken Asian women is that it becomes much more difficult to be taken seriously when we actually want to move up in the ranks. Give up! It's too much work to try to get ahead and change structural inequity; just keep working twice as hard as your mediocre male peers to get half as far. It makes for good cardio. It also keeps up that pesky model minority stereotype ― the one that says that Asian-Americans are inclined to higher levels of socioeconomic success, and therefore no action needs to be taken to reduce the real socioeconomic disparities that exist.\\n\\n6. We need to stop buying into this racial and gender equality thing and accept a dominant white male power structure. Why? I don't know, because I'm making this list! That's why!\\n\\nAs Asian-Americans, we have benefited from the work of black and brown activists who literally died so that we could reap the rewards of the Civil Rights movement. And unfortunately, while we have benefited from their work, those communities are consistently left behind. Some would say this is incredibly unfair and as Asian-Americans, we owe it to them to not leave them behind. But hey! We're basically enabling white supremacy when we allow white power structures to view non-whiteness as pleasurable or interesting. We also allow them to control the consumption and appropriation of us! It's like we can bring all non-white people down by accepting this BS as a compliment! Efficiency!\\n\\nNOTE: A lot of people are bad with reading sarcasm online. It should be emphasized that this essay is written with sarcasm, and I don't actually believe the Asian fetish is a good thing. But do what you do internet — drag my name across the web for the next 24 hours then forget about me until I pump out the next clickbait essay on Yellow Fever in a year when you will get mad at me again!\\n\\n____\\n\\nHave a compelling first-person story you want to share?

She shared it with the Facebook group, Pantsuit Nation, and the popular page, Love What Matters, where it reached over 14,000 and 9,000 likes, respectively.\\n\\nHowton told The Huffington Post she was inspired to share her experience after hearing what Mick Mulvaney, the director of the Office of Management and Budget, said about after-school programs. Mulvaney stated at a press briefing:\\n\\nThey're supposed to be educational programs, right. That's what they're supposed to do, they're supposed to help kids who can't ― who don't get fed at home, get fed so they do better at school. Guess what? There's no demonstrable evidence they're actually doing that.\\n\\nThat phrase, 'There's no demonstrable evidence' just stuck with me, Howton said. It really bothered me that an adult would say that children have to perform some trick to be fed. But mostly I felt that Mulvaney really doesn't know what is happening in the nation's schools.\\n\\nThe teacher said she wrote her Facebook post to expose the reality of what's happening in American classrooms so that people like Mulvaney can't comfortably make those kinds of assertions. Prior to sharing her post, she'd never discussed the fact that she feeds her students with anyone because it is such a common practice among teachers.\\n\\nI think that in the micro world of the individual classroom it's not that interesting, but taken in its totality, the macro view that this is happening all over the country in thousands of classrooms is interesting, Howton said. Mulvaney can only say what he said because those of us in schools have been quietly filling in the gaps. He has been allowed to stay ignorant because we are providing an invisible safety net."}
{"original": "The more things change, the more they stay the same. This year promises to be a busy one in Washington, with a new administration and Congress promising plenty of action and reform. Confirmation hearings, budget negotiations, tax and regulatory reform and a rumored infrastructure package all dot the map.\\n\\nSomewhere in there, perhaps later in the year, is the appointment and confirmation of two new leaders to the Surface Transportation Board (STB). Putting nominee prognostications aside, two things are clear: the STB will soon have five members for the first time ever - with a 3-2 Republican tilt - and the Board, even though the rail industry has asked for a freeze to all major rulemakings, will pick up where it left off in considering a bevy of regulatory proposals.\\n\\nTo begin the year and this conversation, I'd like to showcase a pointed 2014 rebuttal of the most troubling of the wayward proposals - forced access - from former STB Chief of Staff Frank Wilner. It is a must-read for all current and potential Board members, dispelling many of the arguments for railroad re-regulation.\\n\\nThe takeaway, as supported from experts across the ideological spectrum, from Brookings to CEI, from labor to UPS, is that deregulation worked - profoundly - and that forced access should be avoided.\\n\\n\\n\\nA recurring and intractable thread tying together railroad history is that when the choice has been between economic liberty and government intrusion, selecting the latter has repetitively discouraged capital investment, diminished service quality, adversely affected safety, and sooner than later caused hand-wringing among those most dependent on rail transportation.\\n\\nUndeniably, policymakers have ample precedent for the detrimental effects of government dictating rail routes and pricing. So too, as Wilner notes, do the most vocal proponents of forced access.\\n\\n\\n\\nIndeed, shippers with first-hand or studied knowledge of history understand painfully the flight of investment capital and rail service deterioration in the pre-1980 Staggers Act era when regulators substituted their decisions for arms-length negotiations between those buying and selling rail transportation.\\n\\nThe questionable efforts from the small sect of rail shippers is puzzling on multiple levels, particularly given the outsized role freight rail has in safely delivering their generally hazardous goods.\\n\\nThese hazmat shipper groups' assault on railroad rates and profits defies explanation, as it is railroad profits that make possible safety enhancing renewal of plant and equipment, which includes the costly design, development and implementation of Positive Train Control, and improved handling of the dangerous cargoes their members tender railroads.\\n\\nWhich is why Mr. Wilner rightly concludes the mission not only lacks an understanding of basic economics or past precedent, but also in the high fixed-cost nature of railroads. It disregards that there is ample competition - both within the rail sector and among other modes of transportation - and that imposing new regulations, as forced access supporters misleadingly advocate in the name of a free market, is in fact oxymoronic.\\n\\nNo matter how the shipper arguments are chopped, cubed, diced, minced, sliced, shredded or otherwise presented, the substitution of government fiat for market-based solutions will adversely affect traffic flows, swell the number of time-consuming and costly interline and yard switches of freight cars, reduce network reliability, and cause an overall reduction in service quality. Any immediate price reduction will be transient, at best.\\n\\nThe year ahead offers much excitement, and freight rail will be a part of much of the action. We hope that discussions can be more productive, focusing on how to make businesses and the tax code more competitive or improving a beleaguered regulatory system; not on advancing questionable policy at the direct behest of narrow yet powerful interests.\\n\\nMr. Wilner's column is a good place to start. Because while things may change, bad policy will always be bad policy."}

There's a long list of 'accomplishments,' far beyond these lowlights.\\n\\nA Legacy Of Lies\\n\\nWhile Trump frequently claims he has done more than any previous president ― In less than two years, my administration has accomplished more than almost any administration in the history of our country, he told the United Nations just 20 months into his term ― in reality, he leaves office with among the thinnest portfolios of policy successes of any president in modern times.\\n\\nWhile establishment Republicans managed to achieve their decadeslong goals of large tax cuts for corporations, the rollback of environmental and worker safety regulations, and the appointment of more than 200 pro-business judges to the federal bench, Trump himself checked almost nothing off the agenda he pushed at the start of his 2016 presidential campaign.\\n\\nTrump promised he would renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement to benefit U.S. workers. Instead, it was renamed the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement but remains functionally nearly identical, with the exception of some small tweaks lifted directly from the Trans-Pacific Partnership ― another trade pact Trump pulled out of and called the worst deal ever.\\n\\nHe promised a large middle-class tax cut, but instead went along with a plan from congressional Republican leaders that gave the biggest benefit to the richest Americans. Although he again promised a middle-class tax cut heading into the midterm elections of 2018, Trump did nothing to enact one afterward.\\n\\nThere were similar results with an infrastructure plan to rebuild the nation's highways, bridges and airports and a health care plan to replace the Affordable Care Act: Trump repeatedly promised to push through these tremendous proposals but never even released a single word of either.\\n\\nAP Photo/Susan Walsh Trump meets with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un at the border village of Panmunjom in the Demilitarized Zone, South Korea, on June 3, 2019.\\n\\nTrump's creation of a Space Force, which he appears to believe was a major accomplishment, was merely a bureaucratic renaming of the Air Force's Space Command, which had existed since the Reagan presidency, with no change in mission or staffing. Democrats, however, were able to trade that Trump win for paid family leave for federal workers, a longtime priority of theirs.\\n\\nIn foreign policy, Trump claimed he would get tough with China to help U.S. manufacturers. Instead, he launched a fruitless trade war that devastated American farmers and manufacturers both, while hurting consumers through higher prices ― all while he turned a blind eye to China's escalating human rights abuses against its Muslim minority and increasingly totalitarian measures against all its citizens.\\n\\nHe claimed he would remove the threat of a nuclear-armed North Korea, but in the end did nothing ― apart from trading love letters with its dictator, Kim Jong Un. In Western Europe, Trump accused traditional allies of ripping off the United States through the NATO military alliance and European Union trade policies. The attacks strained those relationships, inuring to the benefit of Russian dictator Vladimir Putin, who has long sought to drive a wedge between the trans-Atlantic allies and who helped Trump win election in 2016.\\n\\nEven Trump's signature promise, that he would build a massive concrete wall along the 2,000-mile southern border of the U.S. and force Mexico to pay for it, was a failure. After four years, he managed to build only 80 miles of steel fencing in areas where there had been no barrier at all, using money he raided from the Pentagon's construction budget meant for, among other things, schools and housing for military families. Mexico has not paid anything.\\n\\nYet on that and any number of other issues, Trump would claim huge success, typically making assertions that were completely the opposite of the actual facts ― with those lies then amplified by Trump's aides and allies.\\n\\nThat, said longtime Florida Republican consultant Mac Stipanovich, was perhaps the most useful piece of Trump's legacy: Ruining the reputations of people who might otherwise have continued in public life with the extent of their moral bankruptcy still unknown, Stipanovich said, offering as examples: Bill Barr, Mike Pompeo, Lindsey Graham.\\n\\nNo Intention Of Fading Away\\n\\nDespite failing to deliver on his promises, despite a botched coronavirus response that began with months of denial, despite tens of thousands of lies to the public on any number of topics, and despite funneling many millions of dollars from domestic and foreign lobbyists, Republican donors large and small, and American taxpayers into his own pockets over his four years in office, Trump nevertheless received nearly 11 million more votes in 2020 than he had in 2016.\\n\\nThere are 74 million Americans who know exactly who Donald Trump was and voted for him anyway, said one former White House official who spoke on condition of anonymity.\\n\\nWithin days of losing the Nov. 3 election, Trump began capitalizing on that popularity to raise millions of dollars, first with the trumpeted aim of challenging the voters' decision and then under the guise of supporting GOP candidates in two Senate runoff elections. But, in fact, he can use the proceeds of the leadership PAC he created for almost anything he wants, including paying himself an eight-figure salary. He wound up spending nothing at all on the Georgia Senate races. Trump has also vowed to remain involved in Republican politics by attacking incumbents who have not shown him sufficient loyalty and has hinted at another White House run himself in four years.\\n\\nWin McNamee via Getty Images A pro-Trump mob invades the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, bent on violence, destruction and halting the certification of Joe Biden's election victory.\\n\\nThose threats have kept Republicans largely muted in their criticisms since the election. A recent Axios-Ipsos poll showed that, even after his incitement of the mob attack on the Capitol, 64% of Republicans said they supported his recent behavior, and 57% said they would like to see him as their 2024 nominee. Indeed, in the House impeachment proceedings against him a week after the attack on the Capitol, only 10 of the 211 Republican lawmakers voted with the Democrats in favor of the resolution.\\n\\nAt a Republican National Committee gathering in Amelia Island, Florida, Trump called into a breakfast meeting the morning after the violence he had incited. A lot of members sat quietly, while others cheered him, said one member on condition of anonymity. There were a lot of RNC members who were hesitant to say anything.\\n\\nYet that desperation to hang onto power, even if it meant shredding the Constitution and endangering the lives of his own vice president and hundreds of lawmakers, may finally bring an end to Trump's political career. While Trump remains popular among Republicans, that support is less than it used to be, while his support among independent voters has plummeted.\\n\\nIf enough Republican senators vote with Democrats to reach the two-thirds supermajority needed for conviction in his second impeachment trial, a subsequent simple majority vote in the Senate could then prevent him from holding any federal office for the rest of his life.\\n\\nAnd even if the conviction vote fails, the former White House official said, Trump likely will never recover from Americans' searing memory of the insurrection itself, particularly as more details emerge and more prosecutions are filed in court. It'll be next to impossible because he'll be saddled with it, the official said. He'll be saddled with Jan. 6 forever."}

{"original": "WASHINGTON ― None of this would have happened if only someone in the government had picked up the phone.\\n\\nAnnette Cowen manages 50 properties in Arkansas, mostly apartment buildings for low-income tenants with government-subsidized rent. She said her usual federal contact got furloughed when several agencies shut down last month, so she had nobody to tell her if the government would pay its share this month.\\n\\nSo last week she sent her tenants some upsetting letters.\\n\\nDue to the shutdown of the federal government, your rental assistance portion of your rent is not being paid, Cowen said in her letter. As of now, you have no rental assistance and your rent must be paid prior to January 20th or eviction procedures may begin against you.\\n\\nIt turned out to be a false alarm. This week Cowen said she finally talked to an official who said she would still receive payments for the government's portion of her tenants' January rent. She said they would all get new, more reassuring letters.\\n\\nBut the eviction threat may be a picture of what's to come if the shutdown continues.\\n\\nCowen's tenants are beneficiaries of a little-known U.S. Department of Agriculture housing initiative that is essentially a rural counterpart to the Department of Housing and Urban Development's much larger programs. And those programs could be severely affected if the shutdown goes on for months or years, as President Donald Trump has said it might.\\n\\nThe housing agency has already said it's unable to renew some contracts with landlords in its Section 8 project-based rental assistance program, which supports 1.4 million households. Under the program, HUD contracts with private building owners to set aside at least 40 percent of their rental units for low-income families, including seniors and people with disabilities. The shutdown has prevented the agency from renewing 1,150 contracts, affecting more than 40,000 households.\\n\\nAn additional 2.2 million households use a different kind of Section 8 voucher that is portable, meaning families use it to find landlords on their own. That program is funded until March.\\n\\nSpokespersons for HUD have not responded to requests for comment about whether it would be legal for landlords to evict tenants because of the government's failure to pay. The department has asked landlords to dip into their own reserve funds to meet expenses if necessary. It has said shutdown evictions have never happened before. But it has not informed tenants about how the shutdown could possibly affect them.\\n\\nFor the tenant-based voucher program, HUD regulations do not allow for landlords to evict tenants in the event that the government fails to pay its share. And the regulation doesn't allow landlords to charge tenants for what the government isn't paying.\\n\\nDuring the term of the lease the owner may not terminate the tenancy of the family for nonpayment of the [public housing authority's] housing assistance payment, the regulation says.\\n\\nThere's no way that they can evict anybody. Rep. Collin Peterson (D-Minn.)\\n\\nSection 8 beneficiaries are typically required to devote 30 percent of their income to rent, with the subsidy making up the rest.\\n\\nIf the shutdown drags on, and landlords start going broke, it's possible they could try to justify evictions based on another part of the regulation. It says owners can evict tenants for business or economic reasons, such as sale of the property, renovation of the unit, or desire to lease the unit at a higher rental.\\n\\nThe partial government shutdown, in its fourth week, is already the longest in history. Housing policy experts say landlords can only hold on for so long before they run out of money too.\\n\\nThis is uncharted territory, Michael Kane, executive director of the National Alliance of HUD Tenants, told HuffPost. He said the Section 8 system will start to break down as the shutdown continues, and building owners will be forced to eventually shift costs to tenants.\\n\\nIt's not clear if the regulation prohibiting landlords from evicting tenants with portable Section 8 vouchers also applies to project-based vouchers or to USDA's rural housing assistance programs. Some members of Congress said they didn't think any evictions would be legal.\\n\\nThere's no way that they can evict anybody, Rep. Collin Peterson (D-Minn.), the chairman of the House committee that oversees the USDA, said in reference to the Arkansas situation.\\n\\nThe USDA told HuffPost this week that rural rental assistance is fully funded for January, but didn't say anything about the following months.\\n\\nPanic and confusion over a given program's status are the essential byproducts of a government shutdown. In 2011, for instance, the mere threat of a shutdown prompted a social services agency in Washington, D.C., to warn more than 100 elderly residents that they would lose their next home-delivered meal. The shutdown ultimately didn't happen.\\n\\nPanic and confusion over a given program's status are the essential byproducts of a government shutdown.\\n\\nThe Arkansas situation got resolved thanks partly to media attention. Local TV stations did stories on the eviction threat, and HuffPost and NBCNews followed up. One resident, a 76-year-old retiree named Jerald McLelland, said he had no idea how he would pay his full rent.\\n\\nI'll have to call the finance people that my finances my car and see if they will extend my payment and I will have to take that money to pay the rent ― that's the only way I can do it, McLelland told the local ABC affiliate.\\n\\nCowen said that because the government had shut down, she believed her agreement with USDA to house subsidized tenants was no longer in effect. There was nobody to tell her otherwise.\\n\\nThese complexes are not designed to make money, only to try to break even on a yearly basis. This is done in order to keep the rents as low as possible, Cowen said in an email. If the government does not open soon, my management company will have to send my employees home and my maintenance people that maintain these complexes because there will not be funds to pay the employees.\\n\\nThe USDA official who contacted Cowen this week, Cowen said, did so because there had been several inquiries from members of Congress, and presumably the news coverage had something to do with it.\\n\\nWe wouldn't allow that to happen, Rep. Rick Crawford (R-Ark.) said Thursday of the eviction threats.\\n\\nSen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) walked away from a request for comment in a Senate hallway.\\n\\nThe partial shutdown isn't anywhere near a resolution, and the threat to housing assistance is just one of many mounting problems. An estimated 800,000 federal employees have already missed paychecks. More than half of them have been deemed essential and have to keep working without pay.\\n\\nBut President Donald Trump has been steadfast in his demand that Congress appropriate $5 billion for 200 miles of wall (or fence) along a border that already has nearly 700 miles of barriers. Democrats haven't budged an inch, pointing out that Trump has repeatedly promised Mexico would pay for the wall.\\n\\nIf the shutdown goes on for another several weeks, it will begin to interfere not only with housing assistance but also the tax filing season and food benefits for tens of millions. And Cowen will be right back where she was last week.\\n\\nThe president says he's prepared for the shutdown to go on months, even years, Cowen said. My concern is, where am I going to get money?\\n\\n\\n\\nHuffPost readers: Are you affected by the government shutdown? Email us about it.

{"original": "Canada's federal budget is just a few short days away. On the foreign policy front, I'm not hopeful.\\n\\nWe are living in particularly troubling times. We are facing serious humanitarian crises in Yemen, South Sudan, Somalia, Syria, the Lake Chad region and many other places. A few days ago we learned that United States President Donald Trump has instructed State Department officials to find ways to cut contributions to the United Nations by 50 per cent. This means serious cuts to peacekeeping, providing vaccines for children, monitoring rogue nuclear weapons programs and promoting peace talks from Syria to Yemen. The United States is the number one contributor to the United Nations.\\n\\nIn this context, it is even more important that Canada steps up and increases our efforts on the international stage. The status quo just won't do.\\n\\nOf course, the Liberals are fond of saying Canada is Back -- but one and a half years into their mandate, their promises aren't backed up by action. For example, we are still waiting for the Liberals to fulfill their electoral promise and table legislation to accede to the Arms Trade Treaty.\\n\\nIf the Trudeau government really wants to be back, we need to begin by meeting our international obligations. The first step would be to increase Canada's Official Development Assistance (ODA), which sits at an embarrassing 0.26 per cent of GNI. The international goal is 0.7 per cent, and many other donor countries have reached this, but the Liberal government has given no indication that it will even attempt to make an increase at any point in this mandate. Frankly, that's unacceptable. Canada should set a timetable to reach the 0.7 per cent goal. If the Liberal Budget doesn't include an increase in ODA, that will be a massive disappointment to Canadians who believe we need to do better on the world stage.\\n\\nIt is especially important that we walk the talk on feminism and provide the necessary funding.\\n\\nNew Democrats believe that the federal government must invest more to eradicate poverty in all its forms. The NDP are strong supporters of the Sustainable Development Goals. But to achieve the SDGs, we need to invest in them. We need to ensure we are meeting our obligations, even surpassing our obligations. But without an increase in ODA, we have much less chance of achieving the Sustainable Development Goals.\\n\\nThere have been some positive steps from this government. The recent announcement on sexual and reproductive rights and health was a welcome shift in priorities. But a closer look at the details reveals that the money announced to great fanfare on International Women's Day is actually not new money: it will be taken from the existing Canadian aid budget. That's not good enough.\\n\\nA truly feminist government would also fund the Women, Peace and Security Agenda. Over the last decade, the issue of women, peace and security was largely neglected by the Canadian government, despite Canada's leading role in achieving United Nations Security Council Resolution 1325. Reports on Canada's National Action Plan were frequently late, and the Agenda was underfunded. The scarcity of funds has been one of the key challenges of implementing the WPS agenda at both the national and global level.\\n\\nRecently, the House of Commons Foreign Affairs and International Development Committee recommended the government increase its efforts. But the response from the government has been disappointing. At a time when the Government of Canada is expressing renewed support for the United Nations and multilateralism, and campaigning for a temporary seat on the UN Security Council, it is especially important that we walk the talk on feminism and provide the necessary funding to the WPS agenda.\\n\\nAnd then there is the question of where our aid money is going -- or, more importantly, where it's not going. Few Canadians know that less than 0.03 per cent of Canada's aid budget goes to women at the grassroots. There is an excellent proposal by Match International and Nobel Women's Initiative to create a new funding mechanism for grassroots organizations led by women. Women are the most important changemakers in their communities. If we really want to support women and really want to be known as a feminist nation, then we need to work hand-in-hand with women and fund their work.\\n\\nThe NDP strongly supports this initiative. We would welcome an announcement for this in the federal budget this week. But for this to happen, it would take courage and vision -- not just rhetoric.\\n\\nFollow HuffPost Canada Blogs on Facebook\\n\\nAlso on HuffPost:"}
{"original": "SAVANNAH, Ga. ― The Rev. Raphael Warnock, a Democrat who has become just the second Black man elected to the U.S. Senate from the South since the end of Reconstruction, came back to his hometown on Sunday morning to canvass ― and to acknowledge that he was about to make history.\\n\\nJust not that piece of history.\\n\\nHere's the thing. It's been about 150 years since Georgia had a United States senator from Savannah, he said, as the crowd whooped. I think it's about time.\\n\\nIn the final days of the race, Warnock did little to directly acknowledge the seismic event his victory would represent. But win or lose, Warnock helped create a new political era for the Democratic Party, one where the party is unafraid and even eager to nominate Black candidates for statewide offices after decades of often confining ambitious Black politicians to safe House seats and big city mayorships.\\n\\nOver the course of the past two election cycles, Black candidates for Senate and governor have managed to provide potent counterpoints to most of the traditional reasons the Democratic machinery has given for not backing them in the past.\\n\\nIf you're looking at the campaigns that have generated the most grassroots activism, the most volunteers, the most small-dollar donors, they have been campaigns run by Black candidates, said Jaime Harrison, the Democrat who ran for Senate in South Carolina this cycle and the favorite to become the next chair of the Democratic National Committee.\\n\\nIn Georgia, Warnock and former gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams have shown that a Black candidate can appeal to white suburban voters, even in the South. Warnock and Harrison have smashed fundraising records, proving that Black candidates can go dollar for dollar with well-funded Republicans. Some Democratic operatives are even arguing that Black candidates could play a key role in improving the party's slipping performance among working-class voters.\\n\\nThree Black Senate candidates this cycle ― Harrison, former Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy in Mississippi and Republican business executive and veteran John James in Michigan ― were able to run meaningfully ahead of their party's presidential candidate, even if all three fell short of winning. All three were also able to raise more money than the incumbent senators they ran against.\\n\\nThere's never been as large a turnout for any election that's ever been held in Mississippi, said Espy, noting that a number of liberal policy goals passed in referendums in the state on Election Day. Although he outraised incumbent Republican Cindy Hyde-Smith, Espy said the $15 million he raised arrived too late for his campaign to make the best use of it.\\n\\nThat money came in late, Espy said. It did not come in until about late August, early September. And I wish it had come in in March and we could've knocked on more doors.\\n\\nThe need for earlier investments in Black candidates is necessary, Democratic operatives said, as a way to capitalize on their abilities to increase turnout among Black voters.\\n\\nYou needed to start doing it during the summertime, especially in places where they're not used to always being engaged and given a reason to go vote because they've been living in the not-best conditions politically for years before, said Chris Scott, the national political director of the Collective PAC, which supports Black candidates. So you have to give them extra reasons to go vote, and you can only do that if you have the money to reach out to them early on.\\n\\nSeveral Black candidates could be in a position to benefit from that early cash in 2022: Abrams is all but certain to make a second bid for governor in Georgia. Former Education Secretary John King is expected to run for governor in Maryland. Wisconsin Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes is seen as a likely Senate candidate against GOP Sen. Ron Johnson. Democrats could try to sway former Charlotte Mayor Anthony Foxx into joining the North Carolina Senate race, and Kentucky Rep. Charles Booker could challenge state Sen. Rand Paul. The Democratic Governors Association and the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee are both likely to recruit Rep. Val Demings, a former Orlando police chief, to run statewide in Florida.\\n\\nThere are also three Black candidates in Virginia's 2021 Democratic gubernatorial primary, though former Gov. Terry McAuliffe, who is white, is heavily favored.\\n\\nSuccessful runs could revolutionize the makeup of the nation's highest-ranking politicians. There are currently no Black governors and only two Black members of the Senate. The number of Black senators over the course of U.S. history can be counted on two hands, and the number of Black governors on just one.\\n\\nWarnock's campaign reflects lessons learned from previous statewide runs like Abrams' and Andrew Gillum's bid for Florida governor. Both Abrams, a mainstream Democrat, and Gillum, a progressive, were attacked as hopelessly radical.\\n\\nTo counteract these attacks, Warnock went up at the start of the runoff with a series of ads designed to portray him as an everyday Georgian about to be slandered. One ad shows him walking a suburban neighborhood with his dog and ends with him comparing Republican Sen. Kelly Loeffler's incoming attack ads to, well, dog poop.\\n\\nI told you the smear ads were coming, but Georgians will see Sen. @Kloeffler's ads for what they are. pic.twitter.com/0sgU8ndC63 — Reverend Raphael Warnock (@ReverendWarnock) November 24, 2020\\n\\nThe ad's aim was clear: to make white voters more comfortable with Warnock, whatever attacks Loeffler threw at him.\\n\\nThat's not an ad for me, said Christina Greer, a political science professor at Fordham University who studies Black politics. It's not an ad for Black people. It's an ad for white Southern voters. He's not in downtown Atlanta, he's in what is perceived as 'their neighborhood.'\\n\\nSome Democratic operatives are also hopeful that nominating Black candidates with more humble backgrounds ― Harrison grew up in poverty, while Warnock grew up as the 11th of 12 children ― can alleviate the party's ongoing struggles with working-class and rural voters by increasing the salience of economic and class issues.\\n\\nWe've stopped talking about those issues, we've stopped fighting on those issues, Harrison said. People in those parts of the country, and those parts of our state, need to know that we see them, we hear them, and that ultimately, we will fight for them when we are in elected office. But it's going to take some time in order to regain their trust because we haven't talked to them in so long, and so many of them just don't think we see them and we can relate to them.\\n\\nOn the campaign trail in Georgia, Warnock regularly invokes his family's working-class background, telling stories about how his father used to rouse him from bed early in the morning and noting he was only able to attend college because of scholarships. During his event in Savannah on Sunday, he spoke about his mother's work picking somebody else's cotton and somebody else's tobacco in the 1950s.\\n\\nBut the other day, the 82-year-old hands that used to pick somebody else's cotton picked her youngest son to be a United States senator, he said."}
{"original": "In November 2013, I found out that a handful of my New York condo neighbors were renting out their units through Airbnb. This was unacceptable and I wrote an article in a major New York newspaper that helped fan a movement.\\n\\nWe made presentations to city council and the legislature and, three years later, the State of New York has essentially banned short-term rentals by Airbnb or others.\\n\\nI've also kept Airbnb out of my Toronto building and have written about the so-called sharing economy (which includes Uber) and the public concerns they raise.\\n\\nMany others ― San Francisco, Berlin, Barcelona, to name a few ― have followed New York by restricting or banning both Airbnb and often Uber too.\\n\\nThe central issue is not economic. It's that these platforms enable users to get lower cost services by bypassing laws, zoning, regulatory, insurance, taxation and safety requirements. Such restrictions are there for good reason, notably those involving safety.\\n\\nIn Canada, the conversation about this business model is just beginning. This week, the Institute for Hospital and Tourism Research at Ryerson U's Ted Rogers School of Management held a symposium about Airbnb. Its figures show that 1,121 units and 1,305 units each night are booked in Vancouver and Toronto respectively, according to Assistant Professor Chris Gibbs.\\n\\nThe potential is enormous. In Toronto, some 28% of dwellings are condos, up from 5% a few years ago.\\n\\nThe discussion involved pro and con but everyone agreed that all levels of government and condo boards plus landlords must address the issues. This doesn't mean a ban necessarily, but better financial and legal arrangements can be forged as is the case in some cities.\\n\\nMost importantly, however, both companies as constituted represent public safety threats. Strangers in buildings are a hazard because of access to residents, children, corridors, stairwells, gyms, pools, playgrounds, garages, storage areas, and lounges.\\n\\nSome unscrupulous owners have rented space out short-term to prostitutes, for orgies and noisy parties. In Toronto, about three years ago, a meth lab blew up in a condo building in Liberty Village due to the activities of someone who shared an apartment. Other egregious examples of damages or bad behavior have occurred.\\n\\nBut Airbnb doesn't protect guests either by not vetting hosts. Recently, Las Vegas police arrested a host for filming with hidden cameras the bedrooms of his Airbnb rental for purposes unknown, possibly blackmail or pornography. Guests also have no knowledge as to who else has keys to their space.\\n\\nThen there's Uber. In Toronto, it poses a safety risk because drivers are not thoroughly vetted nor are their cars routinely subjected to safety checks. It is nothing more than digitized hitchhiking and in Toronto recently one of its drivers was charged with sexually assaulting a passenger. There have been multiple incidents around the world, including assaults and rapes.\\n\\nAnother concern is tax evasion.\\n\\nThe Canadian Revenue Agency should force Airbnb, Uber and others to issue T4 income slips to all Airbnb hosts or Uber drivers so they pay taxes on their income. These T4s should also be sent to landlords or condo boards so they know what's going on as well as with other levels of government.\\n\\nOther obligations are dodged. Airbnb hosts commercialize their units and, as such, should pay higher mortgage rates, condo fees, and property taxes. (In New York, longer-term tenants must be approved and are assessed at least 25% more in condo fees for wear and tear to the building caused by their rentals. Insurance and mortgages are more expensive for rental units too.)\\n\\nAnother issue is that about 52% of the Airbnb rentals in Toronto are hosts who are doing this for multiple units, said Ryerson's Professor Gibbs.\\n\\nThis points out that they are simply running illegal hotels and, as a result, San Francisco and other cities have demanded that Airbnb impose a one home, one host rule.\\n\\nThen there are the rights of other owners or neighbors in multiple unit dwellings where short-term rentals occur. Condo boards that allow or don't deal with short-term stays endanger or inconvenience other residents due to noise, pet, smoking or other violations.\\n\\nThen there are squatters' rights. In one New York case, one guest refused to leave the apartment on the basis he was disabled. Eviction was almost impossible. The same could happen in Canada.\\n\\nOntario is reviewing its Condominium Act and should insist that condo boards have tools to deal with this problem. A board should be forced to have a policy on short-term rents, stipulate conditions, and levy higher fees, but only if 80% of owners approve. Conversely, they should be allowed to ban Airbnb and their competitors and enforce that.\\n\\nAs for Uber, cities should require drivers to meet identical taxation, licensing, insurance, maintenance and training requirements as must traditional taxi and limo drivers.\\n\\nPeople have a right to rent out their residence (apartment), but not to afflict their neighbors, the public, or to bypass laws. People have a right to hire someone to drive them around, but not if those people are untrained, untaxed and uninspected and can harm the public.\\n\\nGovernments must catch up to these proliferating websites to stop abuses.\\n\\nFirst published National Post March 11, 2017"}
{"original": "A windfall from the new federal tax law gives many states the flexibility to comprehensively rewrite their own tax codes, something not seen for decades.\\n\\nRick Bowmer, The Associated Press Utah House Speaker Greg Hughes, a Republican, at the Utah Taxpayers Association 2018 Legislative Outlook Conference this month. On the heels of a sweeping rewrite of the nation's tax laws signed into law in December, many states are considering big changes to state tax codes.\\n\\nThe federal tax overhaul has caused a lot of angst in some state capitals, but leaders in many states also see a rare opportunity to substantially revamp state tax codes, many of which haven't been significantly changed in years.\\n\\nThe opportunity comes because the 36 states that use the federal code as a starting point for their own personal income taxes are in a position to realize a generous windfall since the federal law eliminates many tax breaks that states might not adjust.\\n\\nThat unexpected extra money has given states the flexibility to rewrite their tax codes without creating as many losers — and the accompanying political hardship — as most tax revamps entail.\\n\\nLawmakers in Iowa, which last changed its overall tax structure in 1997, are looking at broad rate changes and other rewrites. Colorado has been looking at sweeping tax changes since at least 1984, mostly directed at sales taxes, but broader changes are getting a push this year from the federal rewrite. Idaho considered significant tax changes in 2015, but fell short, and now lawmakers and the governor are talking up those changes again. Big tax overhauls also are on the table in Michigan and Missouri.\\n\\nAnd in New Mexico, GOP Gov. Susana Martinez this week said it's time for her state to tackle the big one — comprehensive tax reform.\\n\\nLet's finally tackle comprehensive tax reform this session, she said in her state of the state address, seizing on tax reform in the wake of the federal overhaul, like a number of other governors.\\n\\nBut while many governors and legislators are looking to revamp tax codes in a big way, the temptation is not universal. While most Republican governors are at least looking at lowering taxes, some GOP legislators say they are hesitant due to uncertainty about revenue forecasts for the new tax law.\\n\\nSome Democrats want to fund their own priorities but also are holding back due to worries about underfunded pensions, cuts to federal government programs such as Medicaid, the federal-state health plan for low-income Americans, and the Children's Health Insurance Program, and other concerns.\\n\\nBut the issue that will be uppermost on lawmakers' minds this legislative year is how to deal with tax and budget changes.\\n\\nFor years, there have been quite a few states that have talked about a desire to create a more neutral and more pro-growth tax code, but have been limited by revenue availability, said Jared Walczak of the right-leaning Tax Foundation, a Washington, D.C.-based tax analysis group. Now, with the federal overhaul signed by President Donald Trump in December, there is an opportunity for states to consider serious tax reform.\\n\\nA majority of states will see a revenue increase if they do nothing, but their taxpayers also will pay more. That's because the new federal law eliminated many tax breaks, meaning federal taxes are assessed on more income. The federal tax code, however, tried to help taxpayers out by also increasing the standard deduction, lowering their tax liability. If states use the income line from the federal form as a starting point, but don't adjust the deductions underneath, state residents would pay more.\\n\\nAfter the sweeping Reagan-era federal tax overhaul in 1986, many states that tied their state income taxes to the federal code changed their laws in 1987, in some cases due to a similar windfall or to align their tax brackets with the federal code. And just like federal tax laws, state codes have changed incrementally over the past three decades, so that neither resemble what they looked like in 1986. But sweeping tax overhauls in the states have been rare since then.\\n\\nKansas cut taxes drastically in 2012, counting on economic growth to make up the difference. But despite vast budget cuts, the state's revenue never caught up, creating a roughly $300 million budget hole and prompting a backlash among residents and lawmakers.\\n\\nNorth Carolina revamped its tax code in 2013, and, like the recent federal rewrite, lowered individual rates, cut corporate taxes, and doubled the individual standard deduction. Republicans leaders hailed the overhaul as the key to 300,000 new jobs in the state, but Democrats and liberals maintained that the job increases were due to a national wave of economic activity, not the state's action.\\n\\nThis time around, in addition to wholesale rewrites, some states are weighing whether to use the newfound millions to augment their rainy day funds, give state taxpayers a break, or fund new or languishing priorities such as education, transportation and pensions.\\n\\nIn Colorado, Democratic Gov. John Hickenlooper has proposed increasing the state's rainy day fund to 8 percent of the general fund, due to better-than-expected state revenue and an estimated $300 million boost from the federal rewrite. But some in the Legislature want the money for highway construction instead.\\n\\nMeg Wiehe, deputy director of the Washington-based Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, a left-leaning group, urged states to proceed cautiously, especially if they are looking at big, permanent, rate cuts. That's because the federal rate changes and other modifications are temporary, and could disrupt states again when they expire in 2025.\\n\\n'A Comprehensive Look'\\n\\nToday, as 2018 sessions begin in statehouses across the country and with budgets at the top of the to-do list, tax writers and analysts say the windfall from the federal rewrite already is playing an outsized role in those discussions. But any lucky break also creates competing constituencies.\\n\\nFor about a year, for example, Utah lawmakers have discussed how to change state taxes, which have not been changed significantly since 2008. Greg Hughes, the Republican speaker of the Utah House, estimated the state stands to gain between $75 million and $150 million this year due to the federal tax changes, which has given the state's comprehensive overhaul effort new impetus.\\n\\nHughes tried last year to go for what he called the big lift of comprehensive tax reform, but he was stymied. He thinks the extra revenue gives more momentum to his efforts in 2018. But Senate President Wayne Niederhauser, also a Republican, said he wanted to wait for deeper analysis of the impact of the tax overhaul from state financial officials.\\n\\nIowa stands to gain $106 million next year and $138 million in 2020 from the federal tax changes if nothing is done to the state tax code, according to Iowa's Department of Revenue. That's about 2 percent of the state's $7.3 billion budget.\\n\\nOur goal is to give that money back to Iowans and to do so as part of a plan to take a comprehensive look at taxes in Iowa, said Iowa Senate President Jack Whitver, a Republican.\\n\\nWhitver and other Republicans argue that revamping the state tax code and lowering tax rates would result in economic growth. But even in the best of cases, that growth can take years to materialize, and, Whitver says, the windfall from Washington could help tide the state over during the adjustment.\\n\\nWiehe noted that Iowa has wanted to lower tax rates for a long time. They haven't been able to figure it out, she said. Now, it's pretty convenient to have a couple hundred million dollars so they can do what they want.\\n\\nIn Idaho, State Tax Commissioner Ken Roberts told the Legislature to expect a net gain of $97.4 million in revenue this year if no changes to the state tax code are enacted.\\n\\nGov. C.L. Butch Otter, a Republican, took a look at the estimated tax gain and pledged in his state of the state address this month to propose a plan that would blunt the increased levies on Idaho taxpayers. He said he would work to substantially retool the state tax code to conform with the federal one, but he left wiggle room to accept some of the new revenue for his priorities, which include beefing up the state's reserves and putting funds into education and health care.\\n\\nBy leaving room for negotiation, Otter opened the door to a more complex rewrite of the state's tax code, and Democrats jumped on Otter's plan, calling for a refundable tax credit for larger families and an expansion of Medicaid.\\n\\nCompeting Priorities\\n\\nIn Michigan, Gov. Rick Snyder, a Republican, Jan. 8 called for an increase in the state's personal exemption to offset the potential $1.5 billion in increased taxes that Michigan taxpayers would have to pay without action. That proposal opened the door to more comprehensive tax change proposals by both Republicans and Democrats.\\n\\nWe are putting Michigan families first, by working to enact a simple and fair solution to fix the unintended consequences of the federal tax plan, Snyder said in a statement, referring to the higher taxes the state will collect absent any tax law changes.\\n\\nSnyder, a fiscal conservative, earlier had condemned the GOP tax plan as fiscally irresponsible because it adds to the federal deficit. But Republican members of the Michigan Legislature already are clamoring for deeper cuts to state taxes, beyond Snyder's simple solution to lower taxes just enough to make up for the federal windfall.\\n\\nArlan Meekhof, the Senate majority leader, and a fellow Republican, said Snyder's plan was merely a good start. I think there's more we can do to put people's money back in their pockets, he told the Detroit News. Michigan's last big tax change was a cut in corporate taxes in 2011.\\n\\nAny time there's extra money around, competition is fierce. In Maryland, for example, Republican Gov. Larry Hogan has pledged to rewrite the state tax code to lower rates in an effort to blunt the $400 million in higher state taxes residents could otherwise expect.\\n\\nBut Democrats in the state Legislature, including Senate President Thomas V. Mike Miller Jr., say some of the money should be kept in reserve to cover the costs of CHIP, the federal health insurance program for low-income children, or Medicaid.\\n\\nMiller even suggested the changes could be so sweeping and controversial that he would favor an extended session or special session to deal with it."}
{"original": "When business owners and executives attending my latest business transformation workshop instantly shouted their response to a question I posed, it reassured me that I had hit a nerve.\\n\\nMy session attendees swiftly answered Not making decisions! when asked What is the #1 biggest mistake decision makers make when trying to transform? Think about it. It rings true, doesn't it? Barry Schwartz warned in the classic The Paradox of Choice to, beware of choice overload: it can make you question the decisions you make before you even make them.\\n\\nSo, how can we quiet the noise and constant feedback that throws us off course and undermines our confidence to make good decisions? The answer to moving forward lies in maintaining a good balance.\\n\\nIn my experience working with organizations in limbo, I've encountered five recurring factors that affect the balance within an organization and slow or totally halt its progress.\\n\\nFive Factors That Throw Progress Off-Balance\\n\\n\\n\\n#1 - Assumptions vs. Fresh Facts. Isaac Asimov once said, Your assumptions are your windows on the world. Scrub them off every once in a while, or the light won't come in. As a leader, you are no doubt used to gathering data, swiftly digesting it and then quickly making day-to-day decisions based on preconceived notions and assumptions.\\n\\nHowever, if you truly aim to effect organizational change and are in the right mindset to begin this process, your next step may feel counterintuitive. You must be willing to scrub the windows and throw away all knee-jerk, preconceived notions that affect your decisions. Stop yourself from jumping to quick conclusions, simply because it is easy.\\n\\nRather, you must push yourself to collect fresh data, possibly even from some new sources, for enhanced perspective. By analyzing those inputs from a more unbiased perspective, you will find creative new ways to make impactful changes. The key is to find the balance between solid assumptions and new facts.\\n\\nIn the real world: At annual sales meetings, most companies review sales figures in the same way they have for the last several years. They fall into a repetitive routine, using old information and outdated assumptions. A transformational company must balance past assumptions with new inputs, such as new technologies, new target demographics, new product offerings, new trends and other competitive factors to shake things up. Leadership author, communicator, and coach, Michael McKinney summed it up well when he said What we know often blocks us from what we need to see.\\n\\n#2 - Constructive Criticism vs. Self-Doubt. This applies not only to your co-workers, processes and products, but to you, too! We need to find balance in our criticism. Paralysis from self-doubt and perfectionism leads to total lack of progress. However, constructive criticism pushes us towards positive change and achievement. Again, this can be a difficult balance to find, especially if you've been in business for a long time, doing things the way they've always been done. You may want to seek out an external resource to help evaluate and constructively critique your people, your processes and your business model.\\n\\nIn the real world: A major goal for my team and I is to produce videos answering business transformation questions for executives. Vlogging is a new endeavor for us and the initial videos have been far from perfect. The fact is that we could have scrutinized and re-shot it many times and still not achieve perfection. However, we value the message as more important than the actual delivery. We trust that over time, with practice, our process and end-result would organically improve. By finding the balance between criticism and acceptance, we are able to move forward. One of Sheryl Sandberg's favorite mottos (which is prominently displayed on the walls at Facebook) is, Done is better than perfect... Aiming for perfection causes frustration at best and paralysis at worst.\\n\\n#3 - Listening vs. Tuning Out Distractions. Do you tune out distractions, like co-workers, client and partners, in your rush to get things done? How about your own gut instinct? Don't! These distractions could contribute to your next big breakthrough. Don't forget to listen to the market, either. Like it or not, social media also plays a very important role in market trends. Be receptive to the conversation about your company and its products and services. Listen when people are telling you what they want. Writer and columnist Harvey Mackay wrote, You learn when you listen. You earn when you listen--not just money, but respect.\\n\\nIn the real world: My company has been implementing a significant change to our own business model based on feedback from the market. In past years, our main focus was to provide software and services directly to the federal government. However, by heeding feedback obtained via networking, social media and other sources, we found that things are changing and we should too. It's no longer solely about delivering directly to the government end user, but also helping IT manufacturers and vendors enter the government market. This input led us to solidify our Government Reach Program.\\n\\n#4 - Exceeding Expectations vs. Over-Delivery. We are all trained that customer service is of the utmost importance. However, business owners and corporate executives struggle to find the balance of meeting customer's expectations while still remaining within the scope of the project. By over-delivering and providing way more than promised, the relationship may receive a short-term boost, but possibly at the detriment of the long-term picture.\\n\\nIn the real world: A small shipping store in a tiny community was noticing a steady decline in customer traffic and assumed that it was due to poor customer service. In order to remedy this, they went overboard by providing excessive attention, discounted rates for existing services and making it a policy to never say no to any reasonable request. Although the customers were very pleased with the changes, business owners not only failed to see an increase in sales, but, in fact, only realized a rise in costs. In this case, the attempt to over-deliver outside the scope of the core business actually had a negative impact. By making assumptions and acting too quickly, the business did not first discover the root cause of the traffic decline. The reality had nothing to do with customer service, and everything to do with technological advances (like mobile apps) making some of their preexisting services obsolete. As Peter Drucker has pointed out, efficiency is doing the thing right. Effectiveness is doing the right thing. Our mission is to find the right thing.\\n\\n#5 - Customer Focus vs. Internal Focus. Oliver Cromwell once intoned, he who stops being better stops being good. We're often so busy trying to help our customers improve their products and services that we forget to focus internally on our own business transformation. Areas that may suffer could be morale, overall organization, or failing to look for growth opportunities. The challenge is to continue to look out for your customers while simultaneously keeping your own house in order and growing. Internal growth can and should be encouraged for yourself, your support team, your partners, and your products. It all depends on what works best for your own business model.\\n\\nIn the real world: I struggle with this as a small business owner when trying to play multiple roles for my key clients. As leaders and executives, we must always look to find that delicate balance between internal and external focus. H. Jackson Brown, Jr., author of Life's Little Instruction Book, once said that, Talent without discipline is like an octopus on roller skates. There's plenty of movement, but you never know if it's going to be forward, backwards, or sideways. By scheduling time into every week where I brainstorm new opportunities with my team, we emerge energized, ready to serve our customers better.\\n\\nThe Challenge of Leadership\\n\\nBy the end of my workshop, I was overwhelmed by the number of attendees who had experienced aha moments. They now understood more clearly how business transformation is significantly related to maintaining balance. Like a difficult yoga pose or that perfect backhand, it just takes practice and action to sustain the control necessary to balance on the tight-rope of the business world.\\n\\nBusiness philosopher Jim Rohn succinctly believed that, the challenge of leadership is to be strong, but not rude; be kind, but not weak; be bold, but not bully; be thoughtful, but not lazy; be humble, but not timid; be proud, but not arrogant; have humor, but without folly. In essence, you must find the right balance.\\n\\nLearn more about her programs and how to work with her http://www.valehnazemoff.com and her company http://www.acolyst.com\\n\\nTake action by connecting and following her on http://www.twitter.com/valehnazemoff and/or www.facebook.com/officialvalehnazemoff"}
{"original": "Sen. Bob Casey (D-Penn.) was one of President-elect Joe Biden's earliest supporters, endorsing him immediately upon his entrance into the presidential race and repeatedly predicting Biden would triumph both nationally and in Casey's crucial home state.\\n\\nWhen Biden unveiled his $1.9 trillion coronavirus recovery proposal last week ― complete with billions to boost vaccine distribution, a $15 minimum wage and a $1,400 check sent to most Americans ― Casey was ecstatic.\\n\\nIt's incredibly encouraging that they went big, he said of Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris. Sometimes we Democrats are really good at negotiating against ourselves before we invite Republicans into the negotiation.\\n\\nStill, even Casey has a tough time believing Biden can achieve one of his earliest stated goals: passing the package through Congress with the support of the 10 Republican senators necessary to avoid a filibuster.\\n\\nWhen it comes to that particular piece of legislation, getting 60 votes is going to be hard, Casey said Tuesday in an interview.\\n\\nCasey's judgment isn't a reflection of Biden, or his deal-making skills. It's a reflection of a Congress ― and especially a Senate ― that is almost universally regarded as broken, riven by partisanship, allergic to compromise, in hock to donors on both sides of the aisle and incapable of passing all but the most essential pieces of legislation. Casey blames this decay on an extraordinarily right-wing Republican Party, an analysis backed up by many nonpartisan analysts of the legislative branch.\\n\\nAlthough Americans would not necessarily agree on the cause of Congress' dysfunction, they are united in their loathing for the institution. In the latest round of Gallup polling, approval for Congress was just 15%. A whopping 82% of Americans disapprove of the body's job performance.\\n\\nBiden and his aides regularly discuss what they call the four crises afflicting the U.S.: the coronavirus pandemic, the associated economic slowdown, racial injustice and climate change. At least for now, Biden is placing his presidency, and his ability to resolve those crises, in the broadly distrusted hands of Congress. He has insisted, again and again, that he'll be able to work with Republicans on major issues. While he plans a blitz of executive action to reverse Trump administration policies, he throws cold water on bold executive actions pushed by progressives.\\n\\nBut his hopes of making Congress work again may be dashed sooner rather than later.\\n\\n'You're Going To Be Surprised'\\n\\nDemocrats won control of both chambers of Congress — though they squeaked out control of the Senate after winning a pair of runoff elections in Georgia earlier this month and actually lost seats in the House of Representatives in November — which means Biden has options. Provided the Democratic Party sticks together, he can pass some legislation through a Senate process called reconciliation. The party could also decide to reform the filibuster, which forces most legislation to earn 60 votes for passage.\\n\\nAt a certain point, Democrats agree, Biden will have to decide whether to pursue a more aggressive strategy, both on coronavirus relief legislation and the rest of his agenda. The question is how long he can afford to put off that decision.\\n\\nJoe Biden is exceedingly patient. He's more patient than I would ever be with these guys, Casey said. But if you look at his career, he's not going to be a doormat.\\n\\nFormer Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, a Democrat, said Biden can't afford to fiddle away months of political capital attempting to negotiate with Mitch McConnell, who is about to be Senate minority leader. Reid views McConnell as hopelessly obstructionist and said Democrats should eventually move to end the filibuster.\\n\\nI think he's going to give it some time. How much time? Two months? Three months? Reid said in an interview. Then, he's going to have to make a decision. The filibuster is on the way out.\\n\\nAP Photo/Evan Vucci, File Former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.), pictured here in 2016, told HuffPost that Democrats should eventually move to end the filibuster.\\n\\nBiden has suggested a much longer timeline for Republican cooperation.\\n\\nI predict to you, and I may eat these words, I predict you as Donald Trump's shadow fades away, you're going to see an awful lot of change, Biden told a virtual gathering of supporters last month. I think you're going to be surprised. It's going to take six to eight months to get it underway, but I think you're going to be surprised.\\n\\nThere's debate among Democrats over how much Biden actually believes Republicans are willing to work with him ― especially considering his experiences as Barack Obama's vice president ― and how attached he remains to the Senate he joined in 1972. At that point, the filibuster was a privileged tool for senators to rarely deploy rather than an everyday partisan weapon.\\n\\nThere is growing consensus in the party for at least some reforms to the filibuster ― House Majority Whip Jim Clyburn has reiterated his support for its elimination in recent days ― but it may prove difficult to convince reluctant moderate Democrats like Sen. Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona or Joe Manchin of West Virginia to support completely ending the 60-vote threshold.\\n\\nCasey suggested Democrats may need to wait for the right political moment to reform the filibuster, noting few Americans are well-versed in Senate procedure.\\n\\nAt what point do you take that step? Do you do it in a vacuum or do you do it in the context of [Republicans] blocking something that the overwhelming majority of Americans want to see happen? he said. It's going to be a tough call.\\n\\n'A Moment Of Profound Crisis'\\n\\nThe incoming Biden administration has pointed to a slew of executive actions set for the first 10 days of his presidency as proof Biden is aggressively working to solve the four crises.\\n\\nPresident-elect Biden is assuming the presidency in a moment of profound crisis for our nation, incoming White House chief of staff Ron Klain wrote in a memo to staffers earlier this week. President-elect Biden will take action — not just to reverse the gravest damages of the Trump administration — but also to start moving our country forward.\\n\\nStill, many of the executive orders are aimed primarily at reversing President Donald Trump's actions: ending the ban on travel from Muslim-majority countries; returning the U.S. to the World Health Organization and the Paris Agreement; ending Trump's attempts to eliminate undocumented immigrants from the census count. Others are extensions of coronavirus relief measures, including lengthening a pause on student loan payments and a moratorium on evictions. Biden also plans on revoking the permit granted to the Keystone XL pipeline.\\n\\nI don't think there will be another opportunity to work with Republicans if he doesn't get this right. Michael Steel, former spokesperson for former House Speaker John Boehner\\n\\nBut if there's something Congress can handle instead of the executive branch, Biden would prefer Congress do so.\\n\\nI've spent most of my career arguing against the imperial presidency, Biden told a group of columnists in December. We got three equal branches of government.\\n\\nFor example, Biden has unveiled legislation raising the minimum wage and supports eliminating some student loan debt, but he has so far declined to take steps toward either on a unilateral basis. Progressives, including Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), have pushed for both a $15 minimum wage for federal contract workers and eliminating a significant amount of student loan debt without congressional approval.\\n\\nIt's arguable that the president may have the executive power to forgive up to $50,000 in student debt, Biden said in December. Well, I think that's pretty questionable. I'm unsure of that. I'd be unlikely to do that.\\n\\nThe Incremental Option\\n\\nThere is another option: Biden can stick with his plans to work with Republicans, provided he's willing to significantly limit his ambitions on key issues and risk the wrath of the Democratic Party's left wing.\\n\\nWhen the Obama administration was willing to unshackle him, he was able to fairly quickly reach sensible agreements, said Michael Steel, who was a spokesperson for then-House Speaker John Boehner during the Obama administration. The left didn't like those agreements, because the policy that represents genuine common ground with Republicans is not what they're in favor of.\\n\\nSteel said a fully bipartisan path would require Biden and Democrats quickly establishing warm relationships with the GOP, working with them on the coronavirus package and likely delaying Trump's impeachment trial.\\n\\nI don't think there will be another opportunity to work with Republicans if he doesn't get this right, he said.\\n\\nEven Reid, who has worked to warn Biden of McConnell's obstruction, was capable of crafting a scenario where the Kentuckian became more willing to cut deals.\\n\\nI think it would be to McConnell's advantage to no longer be the Grim Reaper, Reid said, referring to a nickname McConnell once gave to himself. A number of his senators want to try to get things done rather than just oppose everything. … He wants to make the Republican Party not the party of Donald Trump.\\n\\nCasey, for his part, imagined the possibility of a significant bipartisan deal on infrastructure spending, while Steel said he could see incremental progress on infrastructure, energy and immigration. But he predicted that convincing the GOP to sign up for Democrats' sweeping plans on climate change or immigration would be a fool's errand.\\n\\nI can't imagine a broad restructuring of anything, frankly, Steel said."}

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) to finance the plan by introducing a marginal tax rate of up to 70 percent for the nation's wealthiest people. Doing so would have dreadful effects on the very rich, Hannity said Tuesday in an at-times nonsensical rant on his radio program.\\n\\nIf wealthy Americans were taxed more ― or, in Hannity's words, if their wealth were confiscated ― rich people are not going to remodel their homes, they're not going to build new homes, he claimed.\\n\\nThe contractor, the electrician, the plumber, the carpenters ― they're the ones that benefit when rich people spend money on their homes, continued Hannity, who has been linked to shell companies that spent tens of millions investing in residential real estate over the last decade.\\n\\nThe idea that wealth trickles down from the richest to those less privileged has been bashed by none other than billionaire investor Warren Buffett, who has argued that people like him should pay more in taxes.\\n\\nOcasio-Cortez has floated the tax hike only on income in excess of $10 million.

{"original": "Sean Kilpatrick/CP A Canadian flag flies near the Peace Tower on Parliament Hill in Ottawa on Oct. 23, 2019.\\n\\nOTTAWA — The federal government is looking for a marketing firm to help launch a Buy Canadian campaign to educate more people about where their food comes from.\\n\\nAgriculture and Agri-Food Canada will oversee a new multimillion-dollar campaign to instill pride in the country's food system, according to a government tender published Monday. It's the latest movement in the government's national food policy announced in last year's budget.\\n\\nThe campaign is intended to promote Canadian products on the domestic market by addressing the sentiment that people feel increasingly disconnected from food production.\\n\\nCanadians generally prefer to buy Canadian food products when they are available, believing that food produced in Canada is of good or excellent quality, the notice reads, citing research that concludes Canadians have trouble identifying domestic food products in stores.\\n\\nWatch: Saskatchewan farmers pull together to help grieving family.

{"original": "IOWA CITY, Iowa ― The political fortunes of former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders could hinge on how many young voters show up to next week's Iowa caucuses, which are historically dominated by older voters with the ability to dedicate a full night to participating in the lengthy, labor-intensive process.\\n\\nPolling in recent days has shown wildly divergent results for Sanders and Biden, who are competing with Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg to win Iowa. The victor will receive a major boost to their efforts to claim the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination and the right to challenge President Donald Trump in November.\\n\\nAge has emerged as the crucial dividing line ahead of the Democratic caucuses here, neatly dividing the coalitions of the two septuagenarians in a way education, class and geography do not. Sanders, whose bold agenda includes aggressive plans to wipe out student debt and battle climate change, disproportionately draws support from millennials and members of Generation Z. Biden, who has unveiled more cautious policy proposals, is heavily reliant on the gray-haired. Each is struggling with the opposite demographic. (The coalitions for both Warren and Buttigieg are more consistent across age groups.)\\n\\nThe Sanders campaign bluntly warned their chances of victory are reliant on college students, in particular, showing up to caucus.\\n\\nNone of these polls mean anything unless we actually achieve our goal of turning out a record number of college students on Monday, said Bill Neidhardt, the campaign's deputy Iowa director.\\n\\nA New York Times/Siena College poll released Saturday morning found Sanders jumping to a substantial lead, earning 25% of the vote, while Buttigeg draws 18%, Biden 17% and Warren 15%. No other candidate earned double-digit support. John Anzalone, the pollster for the Biden campaign, immediately suggested the poll's sample leaned too young. Nate Cohn, the Times reporter responsible for the poll, noted Sanders would have led even without the inclusion of any 18-to-29-year-old voters.\\n\\nThis sample has only 24% over the age of [65], Anzalone wrote. There could be up to 30% over the age of 65 going to the Iowa caucuses.\\n\\nMeanwhile, a poll released last week from the advocacy group Focus on Rural America found Biden with a healthy lead, earning 24% of the vote to Warren's 18%. Buttigieg drew 16%, Sanders warranted 14% and Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar 11%. Sanders allies have suggested that poll's sample skewed older.\\n\\nThere are also contrary pictures of whether or not a surge of young voters could happen. A CIRCLE/Suffolk University poll found 35% of Iowans under the age of 35 planned to participate in the caucuses, which would amount to a massive surge from 2016, when just 11% of the same age group caucused.\\n\\nWin McNamee via Getty Images Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont speaks to Iowa voters at the Ames City Auditorium in Ames, Iowa, on Jan. 25, 2020.\\n\\nSuch a surge would substantially benefit Sanders, who has consolidated younger voters in the state after many considered Warren and Buttigieg earlier in the cycle. The same poll finds him winning the support of 39% of Iowa Democrats under 35, compared to 19% for Warren and 14% for Buttigieg. Biden earns the support of just 7% of younger Democrats, even trailing entrepreneur Andrew Yang.\\n\\nBut J. Ann Selzer, who conducts the state's definitive poll for the Des Moines Register, said she has yet to see evidence of a surge of new voters.\\n\\nWe're not seeing, at this point, a big number of first-time caucusgoers, she told WNYC's Politics with Amy Walter podcast. It's about what it was in 2016. Selzer did note her poll didn't pick up on a surge of first-time caucusgoers backing then-Illinois Sen. Barack Obama in 2008 until the final survey, released the weekend before the caucuses.\\n\\nThe generational divide was visible as Sanders and Biden campaigned across Iowa this weekend. Sanders, accompanied by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, drew a 1,200-person crowd on Saturday night in Ames, the home of Iowa State University. Even without Sanders, Ocasio-Cortez and left-wing filmmaker Michael Moore drew 800 people to the University of Iowa's campus in Iowa City.\\n\\nOn Monday, Biden held events at two different college campuses ― at Iowa and at the University of Northern Iowa in Cedar Falls ― and drew much smaller crowds. His event at Northern Iowa, in particular, had almost no students in attendance.\\n\\nAt the event, a voter questioned Biden about his lack of support from young people: What's an old guy like you going to do to get their support?\\n\\nBiden responded by noting that while youth turnout may have jumped in 2018, turnout also spiked among voters over the age of 40.\\n\\nYour generation is a situation where you're the least prejudiced, the most open, you're the best educated, but until recently ― and then thank God, this has changed ― you haven't been very interested in politics, generally, he said. And so now you're engaged and I'm looking forward to you voting and voting in big numbers. But everyone is voting in bigger numbers as well.\\n\\nCarlos Barria / Reuters Vice President Joe Biden speaks at the University of Iowa on Monday night ahead of the all-important Democratic caucuses in the state.\\n\\nThe fact is you've got to be able to represent anyone, he continued, before finishing with a joke: It's also, I've found, very difficult to get people to show up on a college campus before 4 o'clock.\\n\\nAt the event in Iowa City, Biden specifically took questions from students in the crowd, who quizzed him on his plans for climate change and the economy.\\n\\nSanders, meanwhile, has continued to remind voters of his long-standing support for expanding Social Security and his plans to bring down prescription drug prices. The Sanders campaign has spent more than $700,000 on a television ad highlighting his willingness to battle pharmaceutical companies, according to data from Advertising Analytics. And Alex Lawson, a Sanders supporter who runs the advocacy group Social Security Works, has made two trips to Iowa this month to pitch seniors in small towns on Sanders' agenda. (While Lawson has endorsed Sanders, the group he runs has not.)\\n\\nAlthough Sanders has been engaged in a high-profile fight in the national press with Biden over their respective Social Security records, J.D. Scholten, an unaligned Democrat making a second bid to challenge Rep. Steve King for a U.S. House seat in Northwest Iowa, is not sure if his particular message on Social Security was breaking through the noise to ordinary voters.\\n\\nIt's hard to say because it gets lumped in with so many other issues, said Scholten, a Sioux City native who is also a former minor league baseball pitcher.\\n\\nScholten has seen some signs that the coalition Sanders has promised to awaken of young, working-class and otherwise disengaged voters is starting to tune in as the caucus approaches. He was impressed with the 1,100-person turnout for a rally with Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez in Sioux City on Sunday night.\\n\\nI have never seen a political event like that in Sioux City, he said, noting Ocasio-Cortez helped draw in the area's growing Latino population.\\n\\nThe Sanders campaign's strategy of relying on younger and more independent voters, who typically show up less at the polls, carries risks. The number of registered Democrats in Iowa declined relative to this time in 2019, according to data released by the office of the Iowa secretary of state. That means the campaign will have to recruit that many more people to register as Democrats on the day of the caucus.\\n\\nBiden, meanwhile, had deployed his own millennial congresswoman to campaign in the state. Rep. Abby Finkenauer, who represents the state's union-heavy northeast, was among a trio of swing-seat Democrats traveling across the state to tout Biden's ability to win over independent voters and Republicans.\\n\\nFinkenauer, who is the second-youngest woman ever elected to Congress — Ocasio-Cortez is the youngest — indicated she wasn't too worried about Biden's struggles with young voters. After all, Biden had won over a college-age Finkenauer during his last campaign in 2008.\\n\\nMy grandfather was a big fan of his, Finkenauer told reporters during a stop in Cedar Rapids. I went and I listened because I trusted my papaw. And he loved Joe Biden, and so there I was listening to him, and it hit me that this guy gets it, that he actually understands families like mine."}

{"original": "WASHINGTON ― Democrats newly in control of the House of Representatives unveiled the first part of their legislative agenda Friday, but they left out one thing: President Donald Trump's tax returns.\\n\\nWhile a sweeping new legislative package would require presidential candidates to disclose a decade's worth of tax information ― and would also reform campaign finance and election laws ― Democrats have not said when they plan seek copies of Trump's tax info, which they had previously promised to do.\\n\\nWe're going to be reasonable. We're not going to have a knee-jerk reaction, Rep. Bill Pascrell (D-N.J.), a top Democrat on the House Ways and Means Committee, told HuffPost. We got enough experts to testify. We want have hearings and put more pressure on.\\n\\nThe chairman of Ways and Means has the legal authority to request copies of anyone's tax records from the IRS, which the committee can then vote to make public. But the incoming Democratic chairman, Rep. Richard Neal (D-Mass.), has indicated he might wait more than a month to do so, drawing criticism from some tax and policy experts.\\n\\nA spokesperson for Neal did not respond to a request for comment on Friday. The congressman previously said he would seek Trump's tax returns if Democrats won the House in November.\\n\\nOne problem with the idea that Democrats need to put more pressure on Trump is that Trump has already been under pressure to release his tax returns for two and a half years. In 2016, he flouted decades of precedent by keeping secret the kind of tax information that presidential candidates traditionally disclose, to reveal personal details such as their sources of income, how much tax they pay and how much they give to charity.\\n\\nThe New York Times reported in October that in the past, Trump has dodged taxes through outright fraud. There's also the question of whether Trump, who hasn't divested from his business, is receiving income from individuals or organizations trying to influence the government.\\n\\nStill, just because the Ways and Means chairman can ask the IRS for a person's tax returns ― and the law says the Treasury Department is required to hand them over ― doesn't mean the Trump administration will obey the law. A spokesperson for the department previously said any such request would be reviewed for legality, meaning Democrats could be in for a court battle if they make their request. The possibility of a long legal fight may be another reason not to waste time now.\\n\\nWays and Means and other committees have not even named their new members since Democrats assumed control of the House this week, said Rep. John Sarbanes (D-Md.), one of the main authors of the bill Democrats introduced Friday. Sarbanes said Neal and other committee leaders would want to meet with their new members to set priorities for oversight and legislation.\\n\\nI don't regard that as foot-dragging, Sarbanes said. The public is worn out. They're fatigued with this kind of shoot-from-the-hip way of governing up here in Washington."}

ICE, an ACLU lawsuit that required the Trump administration to reunite separated children with their parents, the organization also criticized the government for failing to properly keep track of separated families, which forced immigration advocates to find the locations of hundreds of deported parents themselves.\\n\\nAccording to the inspector general's report, 159 children who were separated under zero tolerance are still in ORR care. More than half of these children's parents were deported and opted to keep their kids in the U.S. because of the life-threatening situations they fled back in Central America.\\n\\nThis report reaffirms that the government never had a clear picture of how many children it ripped from their parents, said Lee Gelernt, lead attorney and deputy director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project in a statement. We will be back in court over this latest revelation.\\n\\nBrané says the fact that the Trump administration both takes children from their parents and then fails to properly track those separations shows a cruel indifference to immigrants.\\n\\nIt shows an extreme disregard for people's rights and for the safety of children, she said. This administration doesn't see these families and children as people who deserve consideration.\\n\\nThis story has been updated with a statement from a DHS spokeswoman."}
{"original": "Passenger Dr. David Dao being dragged off a United Airlines flight, April 9, 2017\\n\\nRecently, I mused with Cheryl Snapp Conner, PR guru and contributor over at Forbes, about the string of Uber and United Airlines PR disasters. We discussed my article about Leggings-gate, (Step Aside Uber—United Airlines Just Made You Look Good) and she reminded me of another UA blunder which I'd nearly forgotten about; we called it…\\n\\nGuitar-gate\\n\\nIn 2008, singer/songwriter Dave Carroll was on a flight from Halifax, Nova Scotia to Omaha, Nebraska, with a layover at Chicago's O'Hare airport. As he was disembarking, another passenger cried out, My God! They're throwing guitars out there!\\n\\nCarroll and his band members looked out onto the tarmac: In a state of horror and disbelief, they recognized their own guitars being thrown around like rubbish into a skip.\\n\\nShortly thereafter, Carroll discovered that his $3,500 Taylor guitar's neck had been broken. What followed was a customer service nightmare. Over a period of nine months, Carroll tried to get a claim processed with United. The response was a firm and consistent no. They claimed he was out of luck because he'd waited longer than 24 hours to process a claim.\\n\\nHe tried e-mails, phone calls, suggestions that instead of money, United give him $1,200 in flight vouchers. United held firm. They said No.\\n\\nDave Carroll\\n\\nWhat did this clever singer-songwriter do? He wrote a song and produced a music video. The song was titled United Breaks Guitars. He put it up on YouTube and it went viral.\\n\\nUnited spent days running around like chickens, trying to peck up as much spilt corn as they could. In the end, after 150,000 views, United caved and offered Carroll payment to make the video go away. But it was no longer about the money and he turned them down flat. In fact, he suggested they donate the money to a charity. As Archie Bunker used to say, whoop-dee-do!\\n\\nAnd then along came Leggings-gate. Surely, we thought, now United Airlines would learn their lessons. I had intended to share some of Snapp Conner's PR lessons for them to consider. But before I could put pen to paper, they rolled out yet another PR disaster—could we call it dragging-gate?\\n\\nA Drag For United Airlines\\n\\nIn what United has referred to as an involuntary de-boarding situation, a passenger's refusal to give up his seat on an overbooked United Airlines flight on Sunday led to a disturbing scene which several passengers recorded on their phones and posted those videos to their social media platforms.\\n\\nThe videos show three Chicago Department of Aviation security officers dragging Dr. David Dao down the aisle by his arms and legs as other passengers shout in protest. Continuing to resist after being removed, he ran back into the airplane, his face bloodied from the encounter.\\n\\nIt was very traumatic, said passenger Jade Kelley, who did not witness the entire event but said the sound of the screams haunts her. It was horrible. I had trouble sleeping last night and hearing the video again gives me chills.\\n\\nWhat Gives PR Nightmares Legs\\n\\nIn all, United's string of PR missteps seems to be exacerbated by the defensive tone that permeates their responses and in this case, their actions. And it's a pattern they seem either unable or unwilling to break.\\n\\nGuitar-gate took on such energy, said Snapp Conner. Anybody can make a mistake. But the corporate position of defensiveness appears to be a culture issue that magnifies the company's missteps in the eyes of consumers and press.\\n\\nCheryl Snapp Conner\\n\\nAs Snapp Conner pointed out, United PR disaster is now an auto response option in Google. What does Snapp Conner think the Twitter rep have said in reply during leggings-gate?\\n\\nPotentially anything could have been better. Noting that it's been a long standing policy and tradition to encourage pass travelers to dress as representatives of the brand, but perhaps it's time to take a new look at the current recommendations. A Thanks for the response. We are listening or an explanation of the legacy of the policy with a we will continually re-examine and address would be better than the official this is policy door.\\n\\nWhen it comes to massive public outcry, Snapp Conner suggests that acknowledging the situation and provided something of value in some way, such as Given the unusual energy around this topic, we invite you to send your thoughts to XXXX@United.com to allow us to properly evaluate this situation and respond, could have gone a long way to easing the situation.\\n\\nOverall, some salient takeaways re: how to handle these kinds of PR disasters would be great if United was willing to listen.\\n\\nIn every PR situation, says Snapp Conner, the characteristics of patience, listening, consideration for another point of view and a sincere desire to serve will go very far, even if someone in your employment has made a mistake. Respect their intent and effort to uphold the company policy and also respect the customer's right to disagree. Look to further understanding and progressive improvement as opposed to who is wrong or right in a fight. In other words, a little more EQ and emotional maturity can go a very long ways in PR.\\n\\nYou can read Snapp Conner's full take on the latest United brouhaha here.\\n\\nWhat Can United Do Now?\\n\\nApologize, said. Snapp Conner. But sticking to the guns, even if it doesn't create an undue loss of customers or share value, will certainly diminish the emotional attachment that customers have to the company brand."}
{"original": "I've been thinking a lot about death lately, and what lessons might be learned from the passing of a loved one. I try to remember all the advice my mom gave me over the years--some spoken and a lot that I picked up by observing her. She left enough good lessons to fill a book, which I mentioned to a friend the other day. Imagine my shock upon hearing she was reading a book called The Top Ten Things Dead People Want to Tell YOU.\\n\\nI volunteer as the president of a small fine art photography organization, so I have living breathing board members, regular members and people who think someday, if I do A, B and C, they might then become members telling me stuff all day long. (Weekends and nights included.) Add to that my dad, who is the leading authority on most stuff as he reminds me constantly that he is very old and therefore very wise, various family members possessing various degrees of perspicacity, tons of friends, business associates, editors, readers, a massage therapist, medical professionals, my mom's friends, strangers on Facebook and a waitress at our local fish fry joint who all want to tell me what to do, how to do it, why I need to do it, where to do it, with whom I should do it and what will happen if I don't do it. And now I should add dead people to the list of folks who have something to tell me.\\n\\nIn a super condensed nutshell, here's a sampling of author Mike Dooley's top ten list of items the dearly departed wish to tell us:\\n\\nWe were ready; you are not.\\n\\nThere's no such thing as a devil or hell.\\n\\nYour pets are just as crazy, brilliant, and loving here as they were there.\\n\\nMy eyes are rolling so far back in my head I can see the guy at the table behind me pretending to write a script at Starbucks, and all I can think is why the hell didn't I come up with this first? (The same thought I had upon glancing for the first time at the cover of Chicken Soup for the Soul, a favorite of my dear Aunt Grace who also collected Wizard of Oz Franklin Mint plates and Shirley Temple memorabilia.)\\n\\nI don't know if dead people really want to tell us our pets are as crazy there as they were here, but it's a lovely thought--Delgado and Thelma stealing hamburgers and ripping skunks in two. I'm just not 100% convinced the deceased are dying to tell us anything now that they're gone. Given my experience, people are plenty happy to do it while they're alive and can literally text, yell, email or phone in their advice, critiques, comments, arguments, opinions and #fakenews. Sure, you can't talk back to someone who's met her maker, but the dead also can't keep arguing with you until you bang your head on the table and ask the waiter for an order of cyanide pancakes so you can be dead and not have to be told anything further by anyone, including other dead people.\\n\\nNah, I don't think the dead have a big long list of stuff they want to tell us, unless it's the combination to a safe that contains a few million in unmarked Benjamins, or that there was a large insurance policy they never told you about, naming you beneficiary, or most importantly, that I am actually an aristocrat with a title and land holdings in Worchesterchestshiresham. You'd hope, if they were able, that the people who precede us in death would make a sincere effort to communicate important information such as I just mentioned. Otherwise, I'm not feeling it from them.\\n\\nLiving people, however, sometimes have good suggestions. Here are a few I've collected:\\n\\n1. Park inside the lines.\\n\\nIt is perfectly acceptable to color outside the lines, but just because you've got a shiny F150, or a Maserati, does not make it cool to park on an angle, taking two spots, because you don't want your doors dinged. Even though a dead person allegedly said there is no devil or hell, I promise you there is a special place for people who take two parking spots, and it is completely uninhabitable like the Gobi desert or Flint, Michigan.\\n\\n2. Go easy on the perfume and cologne.\\n\\nI recently got into an empty elevator, well not exactly empty--it was filled with sweet, sweet baby Jesus oh-so-sweet Giorgio perfume. It's eau d' offensive when you're not even there and I end up smelling like you for the rest of the day.\\n\\nMen, same goes for you. I used to work with a man who wore a copious amount of Brut aftershave. If you used the telephone on his desk for any reason, or he used yours, the fulminating power of Brut clung to the handset like the specter of death itself, making it impossible to make a call or answer one without gacking.\\n\\n3. You never need to buy paperclips.\\n\\nI shouldn't share this one with you because once you start taking my advice I will be screwed. The deal is, look down, look around, sweep up all the loose paperclips. They are everywhere. I use many paperclips daily and haven't bought one since 1988.\\n\\n4. Trust your instincts.\\n\\nI've said this before, but it bears repeating. Go with your gut. Do not second guess yourself. I should have listened to the voice in my head when it said don't marry that one, for sure don't marry that one, the mussels do smell funny, buy Apple, and go to Froedtert Hospital; they'll know what to do.\\n\\nThe voice in my head has never been wrong. The part of my brain that thinks it's smarter than the voice in my head has rarely been right (and has been divorced twice).\\n\\nWe've been developing and sharpening our instincts in constant human evolution. Google sense and thinking what would a Kardashian do are relatively new tools in our quest to thrive and remain alive, and may not be as rock solid as a skill set nature itself has been honing on our behalf for the past two million years. Seriously, trust your gut.\\n\\n5. Wear purple.\\n\\nMy mom kept this poem on the fridge for as long as I can remember.\\n\\nWhen I Am An Old Woman I Shall Wear Purple by Jenny Joseph When I am an old woman I shall wear purple With a red hat which doesn't go, and doesn't suit me. And I shall spend my pension on brandy and summer gloves And satin sandals, and say we've no money for butter. I shall sit down on the pavement when I'm tired And gobble up samples in shops and press alarm bells And run my stick along the public railings And make up for the sobriety of my youth. I shall go out in my slippers in the rain And pick flowers in other people's gardens And learn to spit. You can wear terrible shirts and grow more fat And eat three pounds of sausages at a go Or only bread and pickle for a week And hoard pens and pencils and beermats and things in boxes. But now we must have clothes that keep us dry And pay our rent and not swear in the street And set a good example for the children. We must have friends to dinner and read the papers. But maybe I ought to practice a little now? So people who know me are not too shocked and surprised When suddenly I am old, and start to wear purple."}

{"original": "Joshua L. Jones/Athens Banner-Herald via AP Demonstrators march in Athens, Georgia, after undocumented immigrants there were arrested in July for driving without a license. A 2011 state law permits law enforcement officers to stop anyone they deem to be suspicious and ask for their papers.\\n\\nBy Teresa Wiltz\\n\\nDECATUR, Ga. — Over the past few years, statehouses around the country have tried to rein in cities deemed too friendly to undocumented immigrants. But Georgia is the only state that's created an independent board with one specific mission: Punishing cities that aren't doing enough to crack down on illegal immigration.\\n\\nTypically, that responsibility falls to state attorneys general. But in Georgia, residents can file a complaint against any city or county they judge to be breaking state immigration law.\\n\\nUntil a recent case against the small liberal town of Decatur, though, all but one of the complaints had come from one private citizen, an avowed anti-illegal immigration activist who's made this his life's calling.\\n\\nThen the lieutenant governor, Republican Casey Cagle, filed a complaint accusing Decatur of violating state immigration law last year as he was running for governor. And on Facebook, he threatened to yank its state funding.\\n\\nLiberal politicians in the City of Decatur are trying to put the interests of criminal illegal aliens ahead of our safety — and I will not allow it! Cagle wrote. (He did not respond to repeated requests from Stateline for comment.)\\n\\nFew locals have heard of it, but Georgia's Immigration Enforcement Review Board was created seven years ago, when the state passed one of the nation's strictest immigration laws. Trying to keep track of the legal comings and goings of the IERB, as the board is known, can be dizzying.\\n\\nMost of its members are not attorneys or immigration experts. All are volunteers — and all are political appointees, which in this red state makes it a majority Republican board.\\n\\nAnd while technically not a court, the board has been given many of the powers of a court: It investigates alleged wrongdoing, subpoenas witnesses and hears testimony.\\n\\nThe board has the power to recommend sanctions against municipalities found to be in the wrong — and ultimately, withhold millions in state funding from them as punishment.\\n\\nSo far, though, it has levied just one lasting fine, for $1,000 against Atlanta. A handful of small cities, though, have been forced to spend time and money defending themselves against accusations.\\n\\nTwo of the immigration board members refused to step down years after their terms ended, and did so only in 2018, when they were sued by a Decatur resident and accused of violating Georgia law.\\n\\nThe Georgia board is an example of what not to do, rather than a model for something effective, said Jessica Vaughan, director of policy studies for the Center for Immigration Studies, a national research and advocacy group that favors limited immigration to the United States.\\n\\nIt's troubling, Vaughan said, to have that authority go to a politically appointed group that lacks expertise in the subject matter.\\n\\nThe city of Decatur has filed two lawsuits against the board, saying it has violated public meetings and public records laws; the Georgia First Amendment Foundation and the Southern Poverty Law Center joined one of the suits in December. (Under James Balli's tenure as chair, he has made efforts to make the board more transparent, including releasing records to a reporter.)\\n\\nBalli said it is just complying with state immigration law in its work, and until that law is changed, it'll continue with its charge.\\n\\nThe 2011 law the board is focused on, HB 87, permits law enforcement officers to stop anyone they deem to be suspicious and ask for their papers. The law also requires cities and counties, and many businesses, to use E-Verify to ensure workers are in the country legally; and punishes those who use fake identification to get work.\\n\\nThe goal is compliance, not punishment, Balli said.\\n\\nWe're not anti-immigration, Balli said, adding that his grandmother was an immigrant from Mexico. We don't want that to be the picture of this board.\\n\\nAtlanta's hippie cousin\\n\\nDecatur's been described as a speck of blue in a sea of red, and that is true — up to a point. There have always been specks of blue in Georgia, and the state is increasingly trending purple. In November, Democrat Stacey Abrams narrowly lost to Republican Brian Kemp in the race for governor.\\n\\nBut Decatur, as the Atlanta Journal-Constitution puts it, is renowned as a bastion of Southern liberalism. It's Atlanta's hippie cousin — population 23,800 — 4 square miles of bungalows, yoga studios and farm-to-table fare. In 2016, 86 percent of voters here cast their lot with Hillary Clinton.\\n\\nBoth Decatur and its next-door neighbor Atlanta issued directives in 2017 ordering local police not to detain immigrants, barring a court order. Decatur doesn't even have a jail — and has few immigrants.\\n\\nBut for the past year, it is Decatur, not Atlanta, that has been in battle with the state, fighting accusations that it is a sanctuary city.\\n\\nAnd even though the IERB has yet to yank state funding in any of the cases it's heard, Decatur officials say they worry the city could lose millions in funding if the board tried to take action.\\n\\n'Kangaroo court'\\n\\nMany critics of the board, who fall on both sides of the immigration battle, have said it should be disbanded.\\n\\nIt's a court that operates in very strange, mostly nontransparent ways and yet has a tremendous amount of power, said Naomi Tsu, who oversees the legal and advocacy work on behalf of immigrants in the Deep South for the Alabama-based Southern Poverty Law Center. The center has profiled the IERB on its Hatewatch blog.\\n\\nThen there's Marietta, Georgia, resident D.A. King, who's filed 20 of the 22 complaints that have come before the board. He called the IERB a parody of a kangaroo court.\\n\\nKing, a Detroit native, describes himself as a nationalist along the lines of a George Washington, but says that he's not a white supremacist. Nor is he against legal immigration. My adopted sister is from Korea, he said.\\n\\nI'm trying to educate people about immigration. It's about the law and what's good for America and Americans.\\n\\n21 minutes\\n\\nOriginally, Georgia lawmakers wanted to create a court for dealing with complaints against cities and counties that were allegedly violating the law, said Rusi Patel, senior associate general counsel at the Georgia Municipal Association, a membership and advocacy organization representing Georgia's cities and counties.\\n\\nBut local governments, worried about long, expensive court hearings, pushed for an alternative, Patel said. The IERB was created as a compromise.\\n\\nPersonally, I've been hedging back and forth for a while, whether we've done the right thing, Patel said.\\n\\nI don't know if we have.\\n\\nThe board meets quarterly. Some meetings have wrapped up in three minutes. Others have stretched on for hours, with tempers flaring. In June, for example, Bryan Downs, the Decatur city attorney, asked then-board member Phil Kent why he was participating in the meeting when Kent had already recused himself from the Decatur case.\\n\\nKent refused to answer, Downs said, and when pushed, demanded that the two men step outside to settle their differences, Downs recalled.\\n\\nIt was kind of a macho thing, 'Step out in the hall, mano a mano,' Downs said. It was weird.\\n\\nKent did not respond to a request for comment.\\n\\nOn a recent December morning, though, three of the six board members were in attendance, and a fourth board member called in. It's not clear where the other board members were.\\n\\nOne by one, the board went down a list of seven complaints against seven local school districts, all filed by King.\\n\\nBut he was nowhere to be found. That's because, he said later, no one told him his complaints would be heard that day.\\n\\nIt likely wouldn't have mattered if I was there, he said, because the last time they heard my complaints, they refused to allow me to speak.\\n\\nNevertheless, King's presence was felt.\\n\\nKing accused the school districts of teaching English to the immigrant parents of schoolchildren in violation of a Georgia law that says anyone receiving public benefits, including adult education classes, must document that they are in the country legally.\\n\\nFederal law prohibited schools from asking students their immigration status, Balli said in the meeting, so the adult education classes weren't breaking any laws. Plus, he said, children benefit when their parents can help with homework.\\n\\nFrom a policy standpoint, this is the right thing to do, Balli said. We want children to learn.\\n\\nThe board dismissed all the complaints. (On Jan. 1, King appealed the board's decision.)\\n\\nThe board then decided to make a policy change and only hear two complaints a year from the same person — a change clearly targeted against King.\\n\\nIt might prohibit some of the unnecessary filing, Balli said. He turned to the representative from the Attorney General's Office.\\n\\nCan we do that?\\n\\nYes, the representative said. You must hear all complaints, but it doesn't matter when you hear them.\\n\\nAnd after 21 minutes, the meeting was adjourned, with little or no comment from the other board members. (The board is scheduled to meet again Jan. 8, ahead of schedule, through a conference call. Critics have complained the board is too secretive and schedules meetings on a whim without much notice.)\\n\\nThe Pew Charitable Trusts The Georgia Immigration Enforcement Review Board meets quarterly in Atlanta. Few were in attendance at its December meeting.\\n\\nRight as the meeting wrapped up, a Woodstock, Georgia-based lawyer, Karen Sacandy, arrived, looking flustered and a little out of breath.\\n\\nShe said she makes a point of making the 45-minute drive down to attend every meeting she can.\\n\\nLike King, she's driven by her strong belief that immigration should be checked.\\n\\nShe said the IERB isn't doing nearly enough to crack down on immigration, both legal and illegal. She'd like to see all immigration curtailed, because, she said, all immigrants — the Latins and the Indians — do is drain government resources and take jobs away from American citizens.\\n\\nAren't you worried about the blacks and unemployment? she asked a reporter. Well, I am.\\n\\nThe IERB, she said, needs to be destroyed because it provides a facade that something's being done when really, nothing is being done.\\n\\nIt would be hilarious, she said, if it weren't so tragic.\\n\\nShowing some muscle\\n\\nThese battles will likely get more heated, immigration experts say, unless Congress takes steps to fully define the authority of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the role of local law enforcement agencies.\\n\\nClashes between cities and states over cooperating with ICE have been occurring with greater frequency with the Trump administration, said Randy Capps, director of research, U.S. programs, for the Migration Policy Institute, a research group based out of Washington, D.C.\\n\\nIn his complaint against Decatur, Cagle, the lieutenant governor, alleged that city officials had violated the state's prohibition against local governments adopting, enacting, implementing, or enforcing an immigration sanctuary policy. They issued an order which threatens the city's law enforcement officers with disciplinary action for fully communicating and cooperating with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and federal law enforcement.\\n\\nDecatur is not a sanctuary city, Mayor Patti Garrett said, because it doesn't harbor immigrants who've been convicted or charged with crimes.\\n\\nThe lieutenant governor's complaint raised eyebrows for two reasons: Georgia law specifies that private citizens, rather than public officials, can file complaints against municipalities. And two of the board members were his appointees.\\n\\nDecatur is known as a progressive city, Garrett said. And the lieutenant governor wanted to show some muscle on this issue. We were held up as an example.\\n\\nCity officials vow to keep fighting.\\n\\nWe're not going to be bullied, Downs said."}
{"original": "The spread of coronavirus, which causes the disease COVID-19, is creating an unprecedented unemployment situation. In some states, nonessential businesses have been ordered to cease operations, and workers across the country are losing their jobs and income.\\n\\nA new Ipsos survey commissioned by Newsy found that about a third of workers have lost income in the past week. A similar number (37%) feel they will lose income in the next month. And according to the Economic Policy Institute, 14 million jobs could be gone by summertime.\\n\\nIf you suspect a layoff is imminent, it's important to prepare for that possibility while you still have an income. Losing a job is scary and stressful, but you can mitigate the damage by taking as much control of the situation as possible now.\\n\\n1. Slash your budget.\\n\\nYour first step should be to examine your expenses and look for any nonessential spending you can cut right now.\\n\\nWork with a bare-bones budget, said Kumiko Love, an accredited financial counselor and founder of The Budget Mom. Establish the expenses you need to live and focus on cutting spending. Obviously, you have to keep the lights on and feed your family. But you should aim to pause any discretionary spending you can.\\n\\nYou need to figure out how long you can go if your job is cut back or terminated. Then you can make decisions accordingly, said Ande Frazier, a certified financial planner and CEO of MyWorth. She suggested pausing gym memberships, canceling streaming services not in everyday use, pausing transportation costs (such as train passes), stopping auto refills or subscriptions, and cutting down on shopping for things you don't absolutely need.\\n\\nAnd don't feel bad if you need to slow down on your savings goals for the time being. Making sure you can cover your basic living expenses should take precedence over funding your 401(k) or saving up for the holidays.\\n\\n2. Prioritize your bills.\\n\\nAccording to a survey by LendingTree, 44% of Americans are worried about their ability to pay their rent or mortgage during the coronavirus pandemic. Twenty-three percent are concerned about affording their monthly credit card bills. If you lose your job, you may have to make some tough decisions about which bills actually do get paid.\\n\\nSo once your budget is pared down, take a look at the expenses you have left and decide which ones are most important to continue paying if money gets tight.\\n\\nFood and housing expenses are essential to cover if you have limited funds, so prioritize allocating your funds to those expenses first and foremost, said Brittney Castro, the in-house certified financial planner for Mint and Turbo, and founder and CEO of Financially Wise Inc.\\n\\nNext, Castro said you should call your service providers (cell phone, internet, cable, etc.) and find out what sort of options you have to reduce or pause your payments temporarily.\\n\\nBeyond that, you want to protect your credit for the future, so try to keep credit expenses low, and pay your minimum debt payments so you don't default, Castro said.\\n\\n3. Deal with your debt.\\n\\nSpeaking of debt, this is an area of your budget where you may be able to find temporary relief in light of the coronavirus pandemic. Many local governments and individual financial institutions have placed moratoriums on late fees, interest and other penalties for missing payments. In some cases, you may also be able to put your loan into forbearance.\\n\\nIf you are currently facing or anticipating a reduced income during this time, as a first step you should reach out to your lenders, providers and landlord to preemptively discuss temporary payment relief options, said Adrian Nazari, founder and CEO of Credit Sesame. This means that you have the option to delay paying these bills without a negative impact on your credit score or losing service, and allowing you to prioritize paying for necessities like groceries and pharmaceuticals. Be sure to explain that you're facing financial hardship due to income loss related to the coronavirus.\\n\\nEven if you aren't able to pause payments or get penalties waived, there are a few options for at least reducing the monthly bill.\\n\\nFor example, if you own a home, you may consider refinancing your mortgage. Now is actually a great time to refinance since interest rates are so low ― as long as the math works out, of course. If you qualify to refinance to a lower rate, and you're able to keep closing costs to a minimum, you could reduce your monthly mortgage payment and save money over the life of the loan. Just be wary of extending the term length, as this will likely wipe out your savings in the long run.\\n\\nAs part of the coronavirus stimulus package, federal student loan payments will be suspended through September 30, 2020. Interest won't accrue during this time, so you don't have to worry about your balance growing. However, it doesn't apply to private student loans.\\n\\nAfter that date, another option for handling federal loans is to apply for income-driven repayment. Depending on the program, you can have your loan payments reduced to 10 to 20% of your income. You need to re-certify your income every year on IDR, so if you lose your job in the meantime, your payments should adjust accordingly. In fact, it's possible to qualify for payments of $0 (though you will still accrue interest). And keep in mind that if you have private loans, your lenders may have similar loan hardship programs available.\\n\\nFinally, if you're carrying credit card debt but have a decent credit score, look for a balance transfer deal. In order to attract new customers, credit card companies will offer 0% interest for around 12 to 18 months if you transfer your balance over from a competitor. Though there is usually a fee involved ― around 3% to 5% of the balance ― it's usually worth it to avoid accruing interest for a year or more. During this time, your payments will go 100% toward the principal, allowing you to pay it off faster.\\n\\n4. Funnel extra cash to your emergency fund.\\n\\nSaving money might be out of the question right now, especially if your hours have been cut. But if you have any savings from reducing spending and lowering loan payments, try to squirrel it away into an emergency fund. If you do end up getting laid off, you'll probably need some cash to float you until unemployment benefits kick in or you find a new job.\\n\\n5. Start networking like crazy.\\n\\nThe coronavirus is rapidly changing the job hunting landscape. Not only are there fewer jobs available as businesses continue to shutter, you're now competing against all the other workers who've recently been let go or furloughed. Not to mention, in-person networking and interviews aren't a possibility.\\n\\nThat's why now is a good time to get ahead on your job search and reach out to some of your trusted contacts to let them know you may be making a career change soon, according to Christy Noel, a career expert and author of Your Personal Career Coach: Real-World Experiences for Early Career Success. This allows you to line up references you'll need as you begin interviewing for new positions.\\n\\nIt can be easier to secure references when you are employed, Noel said. Plus, it alerts your network that you might be job hunting soon, so they'll keep you top of mind as they come across open positions.\\n\\nHowever, Noel warned against hitting up your connections for jobs right away. Reach out to say 'hi,' send articles that may be of interest, comment on their LinkedIn posts ... Get back in touch so you can reach out to them and they'll be receptive when the time is right, she said.\\n\\n6. Find a side hustle or ramp up the one you have.\\n\\nBecause the working world is changing in the face of coronavirus challenges and becoming more competitive, it may be some time before you're able to secure full-time income again. One of the best ways to prepare for losing your job is to start a side-gig that allows you to replace the income that you may soon lose due to an impending job loss, said Roy Morrison, digital marketing and growth strategist for Meaningful Profits.\\n\\nThough it's unlikely that your side gig will replace your full income in the beginning, it's a great way to beef up your emergency fund. And over time, it might be able to replace your current income or even surpass it. It is very risky to depend on a single source of income, as it can vanish any day, Morrison said. For that reason, I believe working on a side gig to develop a second source of income is the best way to prepare for potentially losing your job. It will give you some peace of mind knowing you have options.\\n\\n7. Have your unemployment application ready to go.\\n\\nWhen facing job loss, it's important to use all the resources available to you. That means you should be prepared to file for unemployment as soon as possible.\\n\\nIn light of the coronavirus pandemic, many states have waived the one-week waiting period to receive benefits. Plus, thanks to a new stimulus package, you can expect to receive a larger benefit for a longer period of time.\\n\\nIn the meantime, find out where to submit your claim and have your documentation ready. Castro said if you are laid off, you should file for unemployment insurance through your state. That can be done online; just use the Department of Labor's list to find your state's website. There may also be a phone option.\\n\\n8. Use your health insurance benefits.\\n\\nWhile it's best to avoid visiting the doctor's office if at all possible right now, there are opportunities to use your health benefits while practicing social distancing. And now is a good time to take care of any pressing health concerns that could turn into more expensive problems if you lose your health insurance and can't afford your own policy."}

Kurdish fighters appeared to control most of the Syrian border town of Kobane Thursday amid continued US air strikes on Islamic State jihadists, the US military said.AFP PHOTO / ARIS MESSINIS (Photo credit should read ARIS MESSINIS/AFP/Getty Images)\\n\\nIn the Republican and Democratic presidential debates, President Barack Obama's ultimate rejection of using force against Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad for using chemical weapons against his own people, keeps being raised as an issue. In all cases, the debate moderators have been pushing the candidates to call out the president for being weak. In the Democratic debate, the candidates avoided this characterization, but of course the Republicans bring up the episode second only to the equally overstated and unimportant episode of the Obama administration's response to the attack on diplomatic facilities in Benghazi, Libya--principally because current candidate Hillary had a bigger role in Benghazi simply because she had left her post as Secretary of State eight months before Obama made the decision not to use force against Assad.\\n\\nBut what of Obama's of weakness and appeasement of Assad? Otto von Bismarck, the Iron Chancellor of Germany in the late 1800s and a master of international Machiavellian diplomacy, would have been appalled at these characterizations. So likely would have Napoleon Bonaparte, one of the greatest military commanders of all time. Obama's threat eventually led to Russia's pressure on Assad, its ally, to get rid of his chemical weapons entirely. Happy ending, right? Not according to the Republican candidates. In 2016, the Republican candidates, and occasionally Hillary -- to show how tough they are -- would have the United States behave like a dim-witted body builder at the beach who goes around punching people for no reason. Apparently, according to Republican thinking on the Assad matter, the world thought Obama was a wimp for not following through on his threat to use force, no matter how good the outcome attained without it. Obviously, the Russians took Obama's threat to use force seriously, because they pushed their ally Assad to get rid of his chemical weapons. So the choice was between punitive, purely symbolic, and likely ineffectual U.S. military retaliation and an even better outcome -- an Assad stripped of his chemical weapons.\\n\\nBismarck probably would have thought the latter outcome to be very satisfactory. In fact, back in the old days when Bismarck was tromping around, appeasing enemies by paying them off instead of fighting them -- as General David Petraeus adroitly did in Iraq, disguised as a macho American troop surge -- was considered smart. Similarly, to get better press, maybe Obama should have made a deal with Russia to bomb a few empty buildings in the Syrian desert to make the whole thing look macho. Bismarck might have even gone further and advised that when a nation's enemies are fighting -- as U.S. adversaries are in Syria -- it should stay out of a bloody war and conserve resources, while the adversaries expend theirs beating each other to a pulp. Then-President Ronald Reagan was largely able to carry out such a restrained strategy during the long and bloody Iran-Iraq War in the 1980s. George H. W. Bush, Reagan's successor, was then able to handily defeat a weakened Iraq in the subsequent and brief Desert Storm campaign in 1991.\\n\\nNapoleon also probably would have been perplexed at the criticism of Obama over the Syrian episode. Napoleon, certainly no wimp, thought that the ultimate achievement for any military commander was to get an adversary to capitulate without ever having to use force. In other words, why waste lives, ammunition, and other resources fighting when smart maneuvering could achieve the same result.\\n\\nAmericans, raised on action movies, seem to think the nation will be seen as weak internationally if it is not constantly bombing someone, leading presidential candidates, in a democracy, to give the public what it demands -- macho hot air. Of course, this disease among the people leads the nation to an exhausting state of perpetual war for no good reason. Many other empires have gone into the graveyard of history because of such exhaustion -- both financial and psychological -- all the while believing that they were special and that it could never happen to them. Unfortunately, with a nearly $19 trillion national debt, promises to defend many nations all over the world, a costly far-flung worldwide military apparatus, and ubiquitous armed interventions in unimportant places such as Syria, the American Empire, without a major retraction and renewal, will likely travel down the same road to ruin."}

Your heating bill may be a little higher, but you could avoid a costlier repair job if your pipes freeze and burst.\\n\\nIn addition to the above suggestions, you should consider winterizing water pipes by wrapping them in insulation (newspaper can also work in a fix) or self-regulating heat tape. These items are available at most home improvement stores. If you suspect your pipes are going to freeze, consider closing the inlet valve on your toilet and then flushing it to prevent damage.\\n\\nIf the pipes freeze, open the faucets to allow for expansion of frozen water. If you are a renter, contact your landlord. Do not use a blowtorch or a kerosene or propane heater to unfreeze your pipes, due to risk of fire. If a pipe breaks, shut off the valve controlling the water to your home.

Wear hats (the body loses between half and three-quarters of its heat through the head), scarves, gloves and layered clothing.\\n\\nIf you have a well-maintained working fireplace and use it for heat and light, be sure to keep the damper open for ventilation. Never use a fireplace without a screen.\\n\\nDo not use your oven or fuel-burning space heaters to heat your home. These can release carbon monoxide, a deadly gas that you cannot see or smell. (For these same reasons it is inadvisable to sleep in a running vehicle.)\\n\\nUse only portable heating equipment that is approved for indoor use. Space heaters should only be used for a limited time each day. Plug them directly into a wall outlet. Never use an extension cord or power strip. Keep combustible materials away from the heat source and never leave running space heaters unattended, especially around children.\\n\\nMake sure you have a working smoke alarm in every room.\\n\\nElectric blankets should only be used if they have an automatic safety shut-off and are less than 10 years old. Avoid tucking them in at the sides of the bed.\\n\\nIn addition to the above suggestions, you should contact your utility provider to ensure they are aware of your power outage. In some instances, your provider may be able to provide an estimate of when power might be restored.\\n\\nIn the event you have electricity but no heat, check your breaker switches. If you use propane or fuel oil, check the levels.

Doing so can expose you to several safety hazards. Here are some tips to stay safe, adapted from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention:\\n\\nIf you must go outside, inform a friend or relative of your proposed route and expected time of arrival.\\n\\nDress in layers of light warm clothing. Choose a tightly woven, wind-resistant coat or jacket. Wear a hat, scarf, gloves and waterproof boots.\\n\\nBe aware of the weather conditions.\\n\\nCarry a fully charged cellphone.\\n\\nWork slowly when doing outside chores.\\n\\nSprinkle cat litter or sand on icy patches.\\n\\nIn addition to the above suggestions: Limit your alcohol intake, as it increases the risk of hypothermia and frostbite. Shivering is an indication your body is losing heat. Seek shelter to warm up.\\n\\nThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has assembled some great tips for winter motorists.\\n\\nKeep pets safe\\n\\nPets are happiest and healthiest when kept indoors, especially during extreme cold.\\n\\nAmos Chapple via Getty Images Don't let pets fall victim to the cold.\\n\\nFollow these tips, adapted from the Humane Society, to keep animals safe and comfortable:\\n\\nKeep your pets inside with you and your family. Under no circumstances should pet cats be left outdoors, even if they roam outside during other seasons.\\n\\nIf your dog is outdoors much of the day for any reason, they must be protected by a dry, draft-free shelter that is large enough to allow them to move comfortably, but small enough to hold in body heat. The floor should be raised a few inches from the ground and covered with cedar shavings or straw. The doorway should be covered with waterproof burlap or heavy plastic.\\n\\nPets who spend a lot of time outdoors need more food in the winter because keeping warm depletes energy. Routinely check your pet's water dish to make certain the water is fresh and unfrozen. Use plastic food and water bowls; when the temperature is low, your pet's tongue can stick and freeze to metal.\\n\\nWindchill can threaten a pet's life. Exposed skin on noses, ears and paw pads are at risk for frostbite and hypothermia during extreme cold snaps. For this reason, short-haired dogs often feel more comfortable wearing a sweater ― even during short walks.\\n\\nDogs are at risk of salt poisoning in winter due to the rock salt used in many areas ― often when licking it from their paws after a walk. Store de-icing salt in a safe place and wipe your dog's paws, even after short walks. If your dog ingests rock salt, call a veterinarian immediately.\\n\\nBe sure your horses have access to a barn or a three-sided run-in, so they can escape the wind and cold. While not all horses will need to be blanketed, blankets will help horses keep warm and dry, especially if there is any rain or snow. If you've body-clipped your horses, keep them blanketed throughout the winter. Also, be sure to feed your horses more forage ― unlimited amounts, if possible ― during extreme cold. This will help your horses create heat and regulate their body temperatures.\\n\\nThe freezing start to 2018 continues\\n\\nAccording to the National Weather Service, wind chill advisories and freeze warnings have been issued from South Texas to Canada and from Montana to New England. It's below freezing in many locations, and states of emergency have been issued in Georgia and North Carolina. An estimated 47 million people live within the affected areas.\\n\\nIf the cold persists and you find yourself without heat or shelter, call family, neighbors or friends to see if you can stay with them. Or consider getting a room at a hotel or checking with local officials to find the closest warming shelter.\\n\\nSend David Lohr an email or follow him on Facebook and Twitter."}
{"original": "UPDATE: Jan. 16 — An Arkansas property manager has reversed her previously stated position that because of the government shutdown, her tenants would have to pay the full amount of their rent or face eviction.\\n\\nThey will be getting a letter today letting them know that we would be funded and that they will continue paying the amount that they have been paying, Annette Cowen, the manager, told HuffPost.\\n\\nShe said an official with the U.S. Department of Agriculture assured her on Wednesday that the rental subsidies she gets for her low-income tenants will still be distributed for this month's rent. She manages about 50 properties across Arkansas and said 80 percent of her tenants benefit from a rural housing assistance program that pays most of their rent.\\n\\nShe had been unable to reach her USDA contacts since the shutdown started in December and had assumed the program had lapsed.\\n\\nPREVIOUSLY:\\n\\nSome renters in Arkansas are already facing eviction, thanks to the partial government shutdown.\\n\\nA property manager told tenants at properties in Alma and several other towns that the shutdown has cut off a federal rental assistance program that covers a portion of their rent.\\n\\nUntil the government opens again, you are responsible for ALL of your rental amount, the letter said, threatening eviction if tenants don't pay up by the 20th.\\n\\nThe shutdown is creating financial stress for hundreds of thousands of furloughed federal workers. If the shutdown continues, low-income renters could also feel the sting.\\n\\nTens of thousands of low-income households relying on the federal government to help them pay rent could lose that assistance if the shutdown persists. Many of those households include seniors and people with disabilities.\\n\\nDiane Yentel, the director of the National Low Income Housing Coalition, called it appalling that a landlord has already threatened to evict tenants because of the shutdown. But she said it's ultimately on Congress and President Donald Trump, who said he won't sign a government funding bill that doesn't include $5.7 billion for his proposed border wall.\\n\\nIt is incredibly reckless to risk the homes of some of our country's poorest seniors, people with disabilities and families with children as perceived leverage for a fight that has nothing to do with them, she said.\\n\\nThe Department of Housing and Urban Development said it can't renew some contracts with private landlords in its project-based rental assistance program, known as Section 8, which contracts with private building owners to reserve at least 40 percent of their rental units for low-income families.\\n\\nProject-based affordable housing supports 1.4 million households. An additional 2.2 million households use portable rental vouchers, which are funded until March.\\n\\nAbout 1,150 housing contracts under the program were up for renewal but expired in HUD's system after parts of the federal government closed Dec. 22. Those contracts include 500 expiring this month and affect roughly 40,000 households, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, and two-thirds of those affected are elderly or are people with disabilities who, on average, have an annual income of less than $13,000. HUD expects an additional 550 contracts to expire in February.\\n\\nThe National Low Income Housing Coalition created an interactive map showing where the expiring contracts are in the U.S. The only states that don't have households with Section 8 contracts that have expired or may soon expire are Delaware, Hawaii, Rhode Island and West Virginia.\\n\\nHUD has suggested that the rental contract expirations likely won't lead landlords to start evicting residents anytime soon. The department has asked landlords not to evict tenants and to dip into reserve funds to meet expenses, if necessary.\\n\\nBut the low-income renters in Alma are apparently subsidized by a U.S. Department of Agriculture program for rural areas, not HUD. The property manager did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\\n\\nThe longer the shutdown goes on, the more untenable it becomes for owners to keep scraping by without the federal funds they're expecting ― and the more likely it becomes that those owners will start resorting to rent hikes or evictions of these lowest-income renters, as we are now seeing, Yentel said.\\n\\nA spokesperson for the USDA said the agency's rental assistance contracts with multi-family properties are funded through the end of January, but that a small number of owners may have faced a delay for December's payments. It's not clear what the problem is with the contract in Alma or the other Arkansas properties managed by ASC Property Management, the firm that sent the eviction threats.\\n\\nThe shutdown is now in its 25th day — the longest shutdown in U.S. history. If the government doesn't reopen before the end of February, Section 8's tenant-based voucher program will no longer have any funding. That means housing authorities won't make voucher payments to landlords nationwide when March rents are due, possibly leading to evictions.\\n\\nAdditionally, the USDA's Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program can guarantee food stamps only through February, leading many low-income families to face the prospect of losing both housing and food assistance. Food banks nationwide are pitching in to help as many furloughed workers as possible, and they're bracing for an influx of visitors if SNAP benefits halt.\\n\\nThe partial shutdown doesn't appear to be anywhere near a resolution. An estimated 800,000 federal employees will not be paid until funding resumes; about 420,000 of them have been deemed essential and must continue to work.\\n\\nThis story has been updated to include a response from the USDA and Annette Cowen's revised position.\\n\\nHuffPost readers: Are you affected by the government shutdown?

American Progressive reforms of domestic and foreign policy the early 20th century, 4.the Great Depression/ WW II/ the early Cold War, and 5. 9/11 and the subsequent War on Terror. All were powerful turning points in American history.\\n\\nFor Suri, no events occur in a vacuum. A knowledge of history is essential, not only to understand the present, but to form a vision of the future. As he took us through the five turning points, it was clear how each of these set the stage for what was to follow.\\n\\nFor example, the Civil War wasn't about slavery. It was, instead, a war over three economic systems that were not able to function together. The South: labor-surplice economy, in which people were the currency. The North: an industrializing economy, in which money was the currency. The West:a natural resources economy, in which land was the currency. And the victory of North over South (i.e. the victory of industrialization over labor-surplice) put in motion all of the events that occurred for decades after.\\n\\nWe are now in a reactive, fear-driven time in our history. Suri was asked what will have to take place, in order to change the fear-driven course we are on now. The answer was 1. the millennials-a new generation, with a new perspective 2. creative leaders 3. getting money out of politics.\\n\\nThe very best instructors are those who make things make sense. They also ignite our own thought processes, in addition to conveying the information that they have. Suri did exactly that.\\n\\nFive Musical Masterworks that Changed America, Anna Celenza, Professor of Music and Head of the Music Department at Georgetown University.\\n\\nMusic does not simply reflect culture. It changes it. The five musical masterpieces that Celenza analyzed had a profound impact on our country. And the history of each of these pieces was fascinating.\\n\\nFrancis Scott Key wrote the Star Spangled Banner, not as a national anthem, but in homage to the defense of Ft McHenry in the War of 1812.. The song was a parody, meaning it used the tune of another song and superimposed new lyrics. Parodies were very popular at the time. In this case, Kay used the tune of an old drinking song, from a men's club in London. It wasn't until 1931 that the song became the official national anthem of the US.\\n\\nOther songs were instrumental in fueling the need for nature conservation, as well as the civil rights movement. Paul Simon, in his 1986 album Graceland, broke the barrier for African music and had a real impact on American foreign policy.\\n\\nThe presentation was accompanied by videos or soundtracks of the songs being performed. Not only did the music come alive, it came alive in a new and powerful way when accompanied by the back story and the subsequent influence it would have on the country.\\n\\nEight Books that Changed America, Joseph Luzzi, Literature and Italian Professor at Bard College\\n\\nLuzzi is a true Renaissance man. In addition to teaching Italian and Literature, he is also a prolific writer and has an amazing grasp of history, culture, and politics. The breadth of his knowledge is mind-boggling. Added to that is his sense of humor. Luzzi is the eldest child of a working class immigrant Italian family, who placed little value on reading (Get your nose outta dat book! You'll ruin your eyes! Whatsa matter wit dih TV? We paid good money for it!)\\n\\nLuzzi reviewed eight books that had a profound impact on US culture: the Bible, Homer's Odyssey, Dante's Divine Comedy, Shakespeare's Hamlet, Virginia Woolf's To the Lighthouse, Ralph Ellison's Invisible Man, Harper Lee's To Kill A Mockingbird, and Joseph Heller's Catch 22.\\n\\nIt doesn't take much to get LBL's attention, when books are being discussed. Luzzi took LBL's interest to a new level.\\n\\nLBL once again strongly encourages you to sign up for a One Day U near you. Just visit One Day U for schedules of all 55 cities.

{"original": "For the last 16 years Afghanistan celebrates April 28th by honoring its Mujahidins, an Afghan term which somewhat translates to Warriors of Religion or Warriors of God, depending who you ask. The celebrations, a vigorously enforced public propaganda in the form of a national holiday, was made much more significant than usual this year with the return of Gulbudin Hekmatyar, the man responsible for the deaths of over 60 thousand innocent Afghan civilians.\\n\\nDuring the 90's civil war, Hekmatyar nicknamed the butcher of Kabul by Afghans, unleashed a massive barrage of artillery and rockets on the capital while laying siege to it. Thousands either died because of the shelling or succumbed to famine.\\n\\nThis past weekend, after 20 years of banishment, Hekmatyar reappeared in eastern Afghanistan in the province of Laghman. Early images and videos show a lineup of Afghan men in military uniform and turban kissing Hekmatyar's hands. Whether it is a sign of allegiance to the returned warlord or a sign of respect to the so-called Warrior of God, remains to be determined.\\n\\nSo why is this Canada's problem?\\n\\nWell for starters, since 2001, from his hideout in Pakistan, Hekmatyar has guided his own legion of wannabe Warriors of God to the path to heaven, by sending them to Afghanistan to indiscriminately inflict maximum damage. Many of our fallen Canadians have likely been the victims of these heaven-bound passengers.\\n\\nIn early September 2016, the failing regime of Afghanistan signed a truce with Hekmatyar, granting him and his party the Hizb-i-Islami -- which ironically translates to Party of Islam -- full immunity, a Warrior of God`s welcome and financial compensation for ...his years of struggle for the peace and freedom of Afghanistan...\\n\\nNow that Hekmatyar is in Afghanistan he will be enjoying that wealth, fortified villas and around the clock military protection.\\n\\nAgain, why is this Canada's problem?\\n\\nSpeaking to a packed room at the University of Ottawa, the US Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR), John F. Sopko, delivered the raw picture of the disappointing reality on the ground. Sopko was invited by the university's Centre for International Policy Studies in early April 2017 to share his agency's (SIGAR) 16 years of observations and lessons learned in Afghanistan.\\n\\nIn July 2016, the Trudeau government extended this country's financial aid to Afghanistan by another 150 million dollars per year until 2020. That is a little over half a billion dollars of Canadian tax payer's money to a country that has already received exponentially more funds than the U.S. Marshall Plan, which resuscitated Europe after World War II.\\n\\nIn their 2016 report, SIGAR unveiled an elaborate scheme nicknamed Ghost Soldiers in which scores of non-existent soldier names were listed on official Afghan government paper trails to collect higher funding. According to SIGAR, Afghanistan, a country the size of Texas, has more generals than the entire United States military, with over a thousand generals. Most of whom bought their stripes through ethnic or family patronage ...an insidious combination of poor leadership and corruption is the reason for the Afghan military's failure...\\n\\nJust a week ago, the Afghan minister of defense Abdullah Habibi and Army Chief of Staff Qadam Shah Shahim, both resigned over a growing outcry because of their roles in the terror attacks on the country's 209th Shaheen Army corps mosque in the province of Mazar-e-Sharif where over 300 men have lost their lives. Both men have been conveniently and swiftly relocated to ambassadorial roles to Jordan and Kazakhstan, effectively avoiding any formal judicial inquiry or accountability.\\n\\nThe moral of the story is that no amount of wealth in the universe will fix the incompetence of the Afghan regime. In their failure to defeat the enemy and maintain its territorial sovereignty -- it sought to mask its shortcomings by bribing them with foreign aid, land and honorary titles.\\n\\nCanadians should make no mistake that their tax dollars has/is and will be paying for Hekmatyar's lavish retirement.\\n\\nIf our American neighbour's longest military engagement has taught anyone anything -- it is that until the Afghan regime and those in position of power in Afghanistan are not held accountable and meticulously monitored, not only will there not be any gains, but both the Afghan people and the international community will suffer great losses, Hekmatyar being one of those incomprehensible failures."}
{"original": "WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration is asking states to speed delivery of COVID-19 vaccines to people 65 and older and to others at high risk by no longer holding back the second dose of the two-dose shots, officials said Tuesday.\\n\\nHealth and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said that the administration in the states has been too narrowly focused.\\n\\nAs a result, he said, the Trump administration is now asking states to vaccinate people age 65 and over and those under 65 with underlying health conditions that put them at high risk. He said the vaccine production is such that the second dose of the two-shot vaccine can be released without jeopardizing immunization for those who got the first shot.\\n\\nWe now believe that our manufacturing is predictable enough that we can ensure second doses are available for people from ongoing production, Azar told ABC's Good Morning America. So everything is now available to our states and our health care providers.\\n\\nEach state has its own plan for who should be vaccinated, based on recommendations from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The CDC recommendations give first priority to health care workers and nursing home residents.\\n\\nBut the slow pace of the vaccine rollout has frustrated many Americans at a time when the coronavirus death toll has continued to rise. More than 376,000 people have died, according to the Johns Hopkins database.\\n\\nAzar said it was now time to move to the next phase on the vaccine program and expand the pool of those eligible to get the first dose.\\n\\nThat also means expanding the number of places where people can be vaccinated by adding community health centers and additional drug stores.\\n\\nWe've already distributed more vaccine than we have health care workers and people in nursing homes, Azar said. We've got to get to more channels of administration. We've got to get it to pharmacies, get it to community health centers.\\n\\nHe said the federal government will deploy teams to support states doing mass vaccination efforts if they wish to do so.\\n\\nU.S. Surgeon General Jerome Adams said hundreds of thousands of people are getting vaccinated every day across the nation, but the pace of inoculations needs to improve.\\n\\nWe're in a race against this virus and quite frankly, we're behind, Adams told Fox & Friends. The good news is that 700,000 people are getting vaccinated every single day. We're going to hit 1 million people and we need to continue to pick up that pace.\\n\\nPresident-elect Joe Biden is expected to give a speech Thursday outlining his plan to speed vaccines to more people in the first part of his administration. His transition team has vowed to release as many vaccine doses as possible, rather than continuing the Trump administration policy of holding back millions of doses to ensure there would be enough supply to allow those getting the first shot to get a second one.\\n\\nThe Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine requires a second shot about three weeks after the first vaccination. Another vaccine, this one produced by Moderna, requires a second shot about four weeks afterward. One-shot vaccines are still undergoing testing."}
{"original": "When politicians take money from megadonors, there are strings attached. But with the reclusive duo who propelled Trump into the White House, there's a fuse. (From left to right) Rebekah Mercer, Robert Mercer, Stephen Bannon When politicians take money from megadonors, there are strings attached. But with the reclusive duo who propelled Trump into the White House, there's a fuse. Last December, about a month before Donald Trump's inauguration, Rebekah Mercer arrived at Stephen Bannon's office in Trump Tower, wearing a cape over a fur-trimmed dress and her distinctive diamond-studded glasses. Tall and imposing, Rebekah, known to close friends as Bekah, is the 43-year-old daughter of the reclusive billionaire Robert Mercer. If Trump was an unexpected victor, the Mercers were unexpected kingmakers. More established names in Republican politics, such as the Kochs and Paul Singer, had sat out the general election. But the Mercers had committed millions of dollars to a campaign that often seemed beyond salvaging. That support partly explains how Rebekah secured a spot on the executive committee of the Trump transition team. She was the only megadonor to frequent Bannon's sanctum, a characteristically bare-bones space containing little more than a whiteboard, a refrigerator and a conference table. Unlike the other offices, it also had a curtain so no one could see what was happening inside. Before this point, Rebekah's resume had consisted of a brief run trading stocks and bonds (including at her father's hedge fund), a longer stint running her family's foundation and, along with her two sisters, the management of an online gourmet cookie shop called Ruby et Violette. Now, she was compiling lists of potential candidates for a host of official positions, the foot soldiers who would remake (or unmake) the United States government in Trump's image. Rebekah wasn't a regular presence at Trump Tower. She preferred working from her apartment in Trump Place, which was in fact six separate apartments that she and her husband had combined into an opulent property more than twice the size of Gracie Mansion. Still, it quickly became clear to her new colleagues that she wasn't content just to chip in with ideas. She wanted decision-making power. To her peers on the executive committee, she supported Alabama senator Jeff Sessions for attorney general and General Michael Flynn for national security adviser, but argued against naming Mitt Romney secretary of state. Her views on these matters were heard, according to several people on and close to the transition leadership. Rebekah was less successful when she lobbied hard for John Bolton, the famously hawkish former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, to be deputy secretary of state. And when Bolton was not named to any position, she made her displeasure known. I know it sounds sexist, but she was whiny as hell, says one person who watched her operate. Almost everyone interviewed for this article, supporters and detractors alike, described her style as far more forceful than that of other powerful donors. Rebekah Mercer is rarely photographed. However, occasionally she can be found in the background of news photos, uncredited in the captions. Here she is arriving at Trump Tower on December 8, with Nick Ayers and Kellyanne Conway. DREW ANGERER/GETTY IMAGES But then the Mercers aren't typical donors in most senses beyond their extreme wealth. (The exact number of their billions is unknown.) Robert Mercer is a youthful-looking 70. As a boy growing up in New Mexico, he carried around a notebook filled with computer programs he had written. It's very unlikely that any of them actually worked, he has said. I didn't get to use a real computer until after high school. Robert went on to work for decades at IBM, where he had a reputation as a brilliant computer scientist. He made his vast fortune in his 50s, after his work on predicting financial markets led to his becoming co-CEO of Renaissance Technologies, one of the world's most successful quantitative hedge funds. A longtime colleague, David Magerman, recalls that when Robert began working at Renaissance in 1993, he and his wife, Diana, were grounded, sweet people. (Magerman was suspended from Renaissance in February after making critical comments about Robert in The Wall Street Journal.) But money changed all that, he says. Diana started jetting off to Europe and flying to their yacht on weekends. The girls were used to getting what they wanted. At Renaissance, Robert was an eccentric among eccentrics. The firm is legendary for shunning people with Wall Street or even conventional finance backgrounds, instead favoring scientists and original thinkers. Robert himself, by all accounts, is extremely introverted. Rarely seen in public, he likes to spend his free time with his wife and three daughters. When, in 2014, Robert accepted an award from the Association for Computational Linguistics, he recalled, in a soft voice and with quiet humor, his consternation at being informed that he was expected to give an oration on some topic or another for an hour, which, by the way, is more than I typically talk in a month. Sebastian Mallaby's account of the hedge-fund elite, More Money Than God, describes him as an icy cold poker player who doesn't remember having a nightmare. He likes model trains, having once purchased a set for $2.7 million, and has acquired one of the country's largest collections of machine guns. For years, Robert has embraced a supercharged libertarianism with idiosyncratic variations. He is reportedly pro-death penalty, pro-life and pro-gold standard. He has contributed to an ad campaign opposing the construction of the ground zero mosque; Doctors for Disaster Preparedness, a group that is associated with fringe scientific claims; and Black Americans for a Better Future—a vehicle, the Intercept discovered, for an African-American political consultant who has accused Barack Obama of relentless pandering to homosexuals. Magerman, Robert's former colleague at Renaissance, recalls him saying, in front of coworkers, words to the effect that your value as a human being is equivalent to what you are paid. ... He said that, by definition, teachers are not worth much because they aren't paid much. His beliefs were well-known at the firm, according to Magerman. But since Robert was so averse to publicity, his ideology wasn't seen as a cause for concern. None of us ever thought he would get his views out, because he only talked to his cats, Magerman told me. Robert's middle daughter Rebekah shares similar political beliefs, but she is also very articulate and, therefore, able to act as her father's mouthpiece. (Neither Rebekah nor Robert responded to detailed lists of questions for this article.) Under Rebekah's leadership, the family foundation poured some $70 million into conservative causes between 2009 and 2014.[1] 1. According to The Washington Post, the family donated $35 million to conservative think tanks and at least to $36.5 million to individual GOP races. The first candidate they threw their financial weight behind was Arthur Robinson, a chemist from Oregon who was running for Congress. He was best known in his district for co-founding an organization that is collecting thousands of vials of urine as part of an effort it says will revolutionize the evaluation of personal chemistry. Robinson didn't win, but he got closer than expected, and the Mercers got a taste of what their money could do. In 2011, they made one of their most consequential investments: a reported $10 million in a new right-wing media operation called Breitbart. I don't know any of your fancy friends, Robert Mercer told Sheldon Adelson, and I haven't got any interest in knowing them. That the family gravitated toward Andrew Breitbart's upstart website was no accident. The Mercers are purists, says Pat Caddell, a former aide to Jimmy Carter who has shifted to the right over the years. They believe Republican elites are too cozy with Wall Street and too soft on immigration, and that American free enterprise and competition are in mortal danger. Bekah Mercer might be prepared to put a Democrat in Susan Collins' seat simply to rid the party of Susan Collins, a family friend joked by way of illustrating her thinking. So intensely do the Mercers want to unseat Republican senator John McCain[2] 2. Some have speculated that McCain may have angered the Mercers in 2014, when the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, on which McCain was the ranking member at the time, asserted that Renaissance had used complex financial methods to underestimate its taxes by $6 billion. Renaissance has told The New York Times its tax practices are lawful. that they gave $200,000 to support an opposing candidate who once held a town hall meeting to discuss chemtrails—chemicals, according to a long-standing conspiracy theory, that the federal government is spraying on the public without its knowledge. In short, unlike other donors, the Mercers are not merely angling to influence the Republican establishment—they want to obliterate it. One source told me that, in a meeting with Sheldon Adelson and Robert Mercer a few years ago, the casino mogul asked Robert if he was familiar with certain big Republican players. According to the source, Robert shut him down. I don't know any of your fancy friends, he replied, and I haven't got any interest in knowing them. And so it seemed almost inevitable that their paths converged with Bannon's when he took over Breitbart in 2012. The Mercers recognized Bannon as an ideological ally. They also appreciated how quickly he improved the website's finances. Unlike many people in their orbit, Bannon wasn't obsequious: According to one person who often spends time with them, he made zero effort to dress up around his benefactors, often appearing in sweatpants and looking almost like a homeless person. Bannon was respectful around Robert, says this person, but with Rebekah he was more apt to say precisely what he thought: He worked for Bob; he worked with Rebekah. Although the Mercers had initially been persuaded to back Texas senator Ted Cruz in the Republican primary, Bannon preferred Trump, and by the time of the Republican National Convention the Mercers were with him. Rebekah made her move last August, at a fundraiser at the East Hampton estate of Woody Johnson, the owner of the New York Jets. According to two sources, one who strategized with the Mercers and another who worked closely with Trump, Rebekah insisted on a 30-minute face-to-face meeting with Trump, in which she informed him that his campaign was a disaster. (Her family had pledged $2 million to the effort about a month earlier, so she felt comfortable being frank.) Trump, who knew her slightly, was willing to listen. He had been disturbed by recent stories detailing disorganization in his campaign and alleging ties between Trump's campaign manager, Paul Manafort, and pro-Russia officials in Ukraine. Rebekah knew of this and arrived at her meeting with props, says the source who strategized with the Mercers: printouts of news articles about Manafort and Russia that she brandished as evidence that he had to go. And she also had a solution in mind: Trump should put Bannon in charge of the campaign and hire the pollster Kellyanne Conway.[3] 3. Conway had worked for the Mercers' super PAC. By the following morning, Rebekah was breakfasting at Trump's golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey, with the two people he trusts most, Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner, to talk through the proposal in more detail. Within four days, Trump did exactly as Rebekah had advised. Manafort was out. Bannon was in charge. Trump also brought on David Bossie, the president of Citizens United, with whom the Mercers and Bannon had been close for years. Less than four months later, Mercer's handpicked team had pulled off one of the greatest upsets in American politics. Through a bizarre combination of daring and luck, the insurgents had won. Now, they were Trump's version of the establishment—which is to say, a very volatile one.\\n\\n(From left to right) Patrick Caddell, Stephen Bannon, Lee and Alice Hanley On July Fourth weekend in 2014, members of the Mercer clan (Robert, Rebekah and her husband, Sylvain Mirochnikoff) went to visit some new friends. They traveled on Robert's 203-foot luxury superyacht, the Sea Owl, and anchored just off the WASP enclave of Fishers Island in New York's Long Island Sound. Their destination, a medieval-style granite castle called White Caps, towered over the shoreline. This was the summer home of Lee and Alice Hanley, Reagan conservatives who'd made their fortune in Texas oil and gas but lived mostly between Greenwich, Connecticut, and Palm Beach, Florida. Like the Mercers, the Hanleys were convinced that the American political establishment was rotten to its foundations. Unlike the Mercers, though, they were popular and vigorous socialites. They loved to entertain and to act as connectors between politicians and donors in their assorted properties, even on their private jet. That holiday weekend, Lee Hanley revisited the subject of a poll he'd commissioned in 2013 from Pat Caddell, a longtime friend. Hanley had wanted to truly understand the mood of the country and Caddell had returned with something called the Smith Project. The nickname alluded to the Jimmy Stewart movie Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, because its results were so clear: Americans were hungry for an outsider. It didn't matter whether the candidate came from the left or the right; voters just wanted somebody different. They had lost all faith in the ruling class—the government, the media, Wall Street. It showed the entire blow-up of the country coming, Caddell told me. A whole new paradigm developing. No Republican had yet emerged as a front-runner in the 2016 primary, but the Hanleys believed Ted Cruz could take Caddell's insights and ride them all the way to the White House. They saw Cruz as a unicorn: a dedicated fiscal and social conservative who had broken with his party repeatedly. They were dismissive of Trump. He doesn't understand politics or geopolitics or anything about the running of the government, Alice Hanley told me recently. Rebekah Mercer saw the Koch network as hopelessly soft on trade and immigration and was hungry for a way to promote her own more hard-line ideology. Robert Mercer and Cruz had met before during a conference in February 2014, when Lee Hanley had invited them to the five-diamond Breakers resort in Palm Beach for a grilling session. Robert was impressed by Cruz's intellect, according to a person at the meeting, but worried that the 43-year-old senator was too young and might struggle to capture voters' imaginations. Still, Robert warmed to him over the course of many weekends at various Hanley homes. Apparently, Cruz can hold his alcohol (his preference is cabernet), which is a prized attribute in the Hanleys' circle. As the Mercers weighed whether to get involved in a presidential race, their calculus was quite different from that of other megadonors, most of whom run massive corporate empires. Various people who have worked with the Mercers on campaigns told me they didn't pressure their candidates to adopt policies that would benefit the family's financial interests, such as favorable regulations for hedge funds. Instead, their mission was a systemic one. Steve Hantler, a friend of Rebekah's, says she was determined to disrupt the consultant class, which she saw as wasteful and self-serving. She wanted to disrupt the conservative movement, too. Rebekah saw the Koch network as hopelessly soft on trade and immigration and was hungry for a mechanism to promote a more hard-line ideology. According to Politico and other sources, she was frustrated at the time that no one was taking her seriously. As it happened, however, the family owned what seemed to be an ideal vehicle for achieving her goals. Around 2012, Robert Mercer reportedly invested $5 million in a British data science company named SCL Group. Most political campaigns run highly sophisticated micro-targeting efforts to locate voters. SCL promised much more, claiming to be able to manipulate voter behavior through something called psychographic modeling. This was precisely the kind of work Robert valued. There's no data like more data, he likes to say. Robert had made his money by accumulating piles of data on human behavior (markets might move in a certain direction when it rains in Paris, for instance), in order to make extremely precise and lucrative financial bets. Similarly, SCL claimed to be able to formulate complex psychological profiles of voters. These, it said, would be used to tailor the most persuasive possible message, acting on that voter's personality traits, hopes or fears. The firm has worked on campaigns in Argentina, Kenya, Ghana, Indonesia and Thailand; the Pentagon has used it to conduct surveys in Iran and Afghanistan. Best of all, from the Mercers' perspective, SCL operated entirely outside the GOP apparatus. (A source close to Rebekah said she wanted a results-oriented consultant.) As Rebekah saw it, SCL would allow the Mercers to control the data operation of any campaign they supported, giving the family enormous influence over messaging and strategy. For more stories that stay with you, subscribe to our newsletter. SIGN UP And it would be Rebekah who would actually carry out this plan. Robert preferred to focus on his work at Renaissance, often operating from his Long Island mansion, Owl's Nest. He wouldn't look under the hood, because that's not what he does, says Bob Perkins, one of Caddell's associates who worked on the Smith Project. Besides, Rebekah was the political animal in the family. (Her older sister Jenji has practiced law; her younger sister Heather Sue is, like Robert, a competitive poker player). This was a relatively new phenomenon. Rebekah isn't known to have been particularly political earlier in adulthood, while gaining a master's degree in management science and engineering from Stanford, or in early motherhood. (She has four children with her French-born husband, who became an investment banker at Morgan Stanley.) But, after the Supreme Court's Citizens United decision in 2010, which significantly loosened restrictions on political spending, Rebekah decided it was time to save America from becoming like socialist Europe, as she has put it to several people. She started attending Koch events and donating to the Goldwater Institute, a right-wing think tank based in Arizona. The family's political advocacy accelerated rapidly. It was in 2012 that she really attracted attention in GOP circles when, not long after Mitt Romney lost the presidential race, she stood up before a crowd of Romney supporters at the University Club of New York and delivered a scathing but detailed diatribe about his inadequate data and canvassing operation. Who is that woman? people in attendance asked. With SCL, Rebekah finally had the chance to prove she could do better. The company's American branch was renamed Cambridge Analytica, to emphasize the pedigree of its behavioral scientists. And Rebekah started flying Alexander Nix, the firm's Old Etonian CEO, around the country to introduce him to her contacts. Nix, 41, is not a data scientist (his background is in financial services), but he is a showy salesman. Dressed in impeccably tailored suits, he is in his element on stage making presentations at large conferences. He can, however, come across as arrogant. (I love the fact that you're telling your story, but I'm the one giving the interview, he told me in a conversation.) Alexander Nix at Cambridge Analytica's New York office. Rebekah Mercer was impressed by Nix's command of data and artistry on the polo field. JOSHUA BRIGHT/THE WASHINGTON POST/GETTY IMAGES According to Perkins and Caddell, Rebekah and Nix met with them a few times to discuss how CA could use the Smith Project. Rebekah was clearly impressed by Nix. In one meeting, according to Perkins, she gushed about his polo prowess and asked him to show off cellphone photos of himself on horseback. (Nix says he doesn't recall this meeting or others with the three. He also doesn't remember displaying such a picture and can think of no good reason why Bob or Pat would be interested in horses.) The political veterans were skeptical. I didn't understand what Nix was talking about, Perkins told me bluntly. Caddell says he was perplexed when Nix wouldn't show him the instruments CA used to predict voter behavior. He also thought the firm didn't grasp the seismic shift underway in American politics. And yet to his great surprise, Bannon vouched for CA, telling Caddell its scientists were geniuses. Caddell knew that Bannon was beholden to the Mercers—they were, after all, Breitbart's part-owners. According to The New York Times, however, Bannon was also vice president of CA's board. Even if he did not have a financial investment, he intellectually owned it, which was invaluable, says a fellow political strategist. After he learned of Bannon's involvement, Caddell stopped asking Bannon questions about CA. In the end, Bannon helped seal the deal between the Mercers and Cruz, with CA as the glue. In the fall of 2014, Toby Neugebauer, a garrulous oil-and-gas billionaire from Texas, took Cruz and his campaign manager, Jeff Roe, to the Breitbart Embassy, the website's Washington headquarters near the Capitol. Bannon flitted in and out. Nix, as usual, did most of the talking. After Neugebauer and Roe visited SCL's London headquarters, the Cruz team agreed that CA could play a key role in their operation, running models and helping with research. However, it was made clear to Rebekah and Nix that the entire data analytics operation would be supervised by Chris Wilson, CEO of the research firm WPA. A source close to Cruz told me that Wilson's operation had played a crucial role when Cruz ran for the Senate with only 2 percent name recognition in Texas and defeated a far better-known opponent. Why, then, was CA necessary at all? No one ever said directly that the quid pro quo for hiring CA was that the Mercers would support Cruz, says someone close to Roe. Nevertheless, after CA was engaged, Neugebauer took a private jet to the Bahamas to meet Robert Mercer on the Sea Owl. When Neugebauer asked him to donate to Cruz's bid, Robert was matter-of-fact. The family would start with $11 million.\\n\\n(Clockwise, starting top right) Jeff Roe, Ted Cruz, Alexander Nix All modern political campaigns have to balance their need for exorbitant sums of money with the obsessions of the people who want to give them that money. Roe, the straight-talking manager of the Cruz operation, has observed that running a campaign is like trying to solve a Rubik's cube of complicated personalities and uncomfortable dependencies. He has also told people that he is careful not to get too close to the donors who make his campaigns possible, because they can be so easily annoyed by the most trivial of things—his laugh, for instance, or the way he eats a bread roll. In the case of the Cruz campaign, the donor obsession in question was Cambridge Analytica. And it wasn't long before Roe and his team suspected that Nix had promised them a more impressive product than he could deliver. On March 4, 2015, Cruz, Roe, Wilson and others gathered in the Hyatt in Washington D.C. for an all-day meeting with Nix and a group of CA senior executives. Wilson took notes on his computer. According to multiple members of the Cruz team, Wilson was dismayed to learn that CA's models weren't fully ready for his focus groups the following week. As far as the team could tell, the only data CA possessed that the campaign didn't already have appeared to be culled from Facebook. In addition, they recalled, CA hadn't set itself up with Data Trust, the Republican National Committee's repository of voter information. At one point, they recall, Nix explained that the National Rifle Association's database of members would be a valuable way to target donors. Wilson typed an emoji with rolling eyes next to the statement because it was so obvious. He told people that he came away thinking, Red flag, red flag, red flag. In response to an extensive set of questions, Nix disputed this account of the meeting. He denied that Cambridge Analytica had obtained any data via Facebook—a source of controversy for the firm ever since The Guardian reported in 2015 that CA based its data on research spanning tens of millions of Facebook users, harvested largely without their permission. Nix also claimed that it was the Cruz team that didn't have access to the RNC's Data Trust for much of the cycle and that all data used for the majority of the campaign was provided by Cambridge Analytica. However, Mike Shields, then the RNC's chief of staff and Data Trust's senior adviser, told me the Cruz campaign was in fact the second to sign an agreement with Data Trust, in 2014. Meanwhile, the red flags kept coming. Wilson found the data scientists that CA sent to Houston to be highly efficient at the day-to-day work of his research operation. But according to Cruz staffers, when he began to test CA's specialized models, he found that they were notably off, with, for example, some male voters miscategorized as women. In phone surveys, staffers said, CA's predictions fell short of the 85 percent accuracy the campaign expected. (Different models have differing levels of accuracy, Nix said in his response. I suspect these numbers have been taken out of context to make us look bad. In many previous articles the Cruz campaign have highly rated the quality of our data scientists.) By September, CA's first six-month contract was up. A CA employee in the campaign's Houston office accidentally left the invoice in the photocopier, and Wilson happened to fish it out. The invoice totaled an eye-popping $3,119,052 for work that Wilson estimated to be worth $600,000 at most. I can't fucking believe it, Wilson told Roe, who concurred. Jeff Roe (left) with Ted Cruz (right), who ultimately fell out of Rebekah Mercer's favor. We felt to some extent she was being manipulated by Bannon, a Cruz adviser said. ETHAN MILLER/GETTY IMAGES Nix disputed this account too, noting that the firm's fee was clearly stated in our statement of work and contract. However, a former consultant for the campaign, Tommy Sears, attended budget meetings for two if not three days over the matter. There was an understanding between both parties that the totality of the contract through March 2016 would be $5.5 million, he says. The heartburn felt by the Cruz team was that over $3 million had already been spent by September 1, 2015. When the Cruz team decided not to pay the full $3 million, bedlam ensued. A phone call was scheduled with Rebekah, Bannon and CA's attorney. I understand she's a nice lady, Wilson says politely of Rebekah. According to multiple people on the call, she accused Wilson of undermining CA. Bannon, meanwhile, unleashed a torrent of profanities at the Cruz team. Someone on the call gave me a censored version of his outburst: The only reason this campaign is where it is right now is because of our people and I. My recommendation to the Mercers is just to pull them out of there and we'll have them on another campaign by Monday. Bannon's language was so foul it was difficult to listen to, says one person on the call who had never met him before. Another of the political pros, who knew Bannon well, wasn't shocked. That's Steve doing business, he says. The Cruz team was taken aback by Rebekah's reaction. Some even wondered if she'd been given all the facts. One person who was close to the campaign says, She is somewhere between the daughter of a brilliant hedge fund manager and mathematician and somebody who runs a bakery in New York. She clearly has a skill set, but the skill set we're discussing here regarding the understanding of the value of data and analytics doesn't fall into that area. She is operating under the information she's been given. If Rebekah Mercer was broke and wasn't a major donor in the Republican party, says a Cruz adviser, nobody would spend two seconds trying to know her… She's not fun. She's just like a series of amoeba cells. The two sides were also diverging ideologically. In the summer of 2015, according to two sources, Rebekah reprimanded Cruz for an April article he'd co-authored with House Speaker Paul Ryan in The Wall Street Journal in support of free trade. She and Bannon told Cruz that he should adopt the positions of Jeff Sessions, whose views on trade and immigration were more in line with the conservative base. By this time, Cruz and his team were becoming increasingly concerned about Bannon's relationship with Rebekah. Bannon (who declined to comment for this article) was now blatantly pro-Trump. Over the course of the primary, Breitbart would publish around 60 pieces disputing that Cruz was eligible to be president because he had been born in Canada. Cruz repeatedly called Rebekah to complain, but she insisted that she had to be fair and impartial. One of his advisers says, We felt to some extent she was being manipulated by Bannon. A person close to Bannon counters: There's absolutely no way anyone could manipulate Rebekah Mercer. After the first debate in South Carolina, Rebekah gave Cruz a dressing down on his performance, according to three sources. Given what was going on around him—and what he must have truly felt—he behaved like an absolute gentleman, says a person close to Cruz. Rebekah was incensed that Trump had a tougher immigration policy than Cruz did—she particularly liked Trump's idea for a total ban on Muslims. Subsequently, Cruz proposed a 180-day suspension on all H1-B visas. Meanwhile, even though the Cruz staffers generally got along well with their CA counterparts—they sometimes took the visitors country-western dancing —the firm remained a source of friction. In retrospect, Wilson told people, he believed that Nix resented the campaign for allocating work through a competitive bidding process, rather than favoring CA. Two weeks before the Iowa caucuses, Wilson assigned a contract to a firm called Targeted Victory. CA then locked its data in the cloud so it couldn't be accessed by Roe's team. The data remained unavailable until, a Cruz campaign source said, it was pretty much too late to be useful. Cruz won the Iowa caucuses anyway. The Cruz operation became so fed up with Nix that they pushed back, hard, on CA's bill for its second six-month contract. Wilson was able to negotiate the fees down after, as Cruz staffers recalled, a CA representative accidentally emailed him a spreadsheet documenting the Houston team's salaries. (Nix said CA had intended to send the spreadsheet.) Still, the campaign wound up paying nearly $6 million to CA—which represented almost half of the money the Mercers had pledged to spend on Cruz's behalf. The acrimony lingered long after Cruz exited the race in May. When he decided not to endorse Trump at the GOP convention, the Mercers publicly rebuked him. In a statement, Cruz was diplomatic: We were delighted to work with Cambridge Analytica, they were a valuable asset to my campaign, and any rumors to the contrary are completely unfounded. (The source close to Rebekah added, I was with Rebekah the other day and Ted Cruz was falling all over her. It's not fair to blame CA's methodology for Cruz's loss.) Others from Cruz's team, however, remain bitter about the whole experience. If Rebekah Mercer was broke and wasn't a major donor in the Republican Party, says one, nobody would spend two seconds trying to know her. … She's not fun. She's just like a series of amoeba cells."}

{"original": "VATICAN CITY, Jan 2 (Reuters) - Pope Francis has told bishops around the world they must adhere to a policy of zero tolerance for clergy who sexually abuse children and begged forgiveness for a sin that shames us.\\n\\nIn a letter sent on Dec. 28 but released by the Vatican only on Monday, Francis said: I would like us to renew our complete commitment to ensuring that these atrocities will no longer take place in our midst.\\n\\nSince his election in 2013, Francis has taken some steps to root out sexual abuse in the Church and to put in place practices to protect children. But victims' groups say he has not done enough, particularly to hold to account bishops who tolerated sexual abuse or covered it up.\\n\\n(The Church) recognizes the sins of some of her members: the sufferings, the experiences and the pain of minors who were abused sexually by priests. It is a sin that shames us, Francis wrote in the letter.\\n\\nI would like us to renew our complete commitment to ensuring that these atrocities will no longer take place in our midst. Let us find the courage needed to take all necessary measures and to protect in every way the lives of our children, so that such crimes may never be repeated. In this area, let us adhere, clearly and faithfully, to 'zero tolerance', he said.\\n\\nThe comments, included in a letter about the plight of vulnerable children in general, were some of his most comprehensive on abuse.\\n\\nFrancis, who has met victims of sexual abuse several times, both in the Vatican and on some of his foreign trips, said: We join in the pain of the victims and weep for this sin - the sin of what happened, the sin of failing to help, the sin of covering up and denial, the sin of the abuse of power.\\n\\nIn 2015, Francis ordered the trial and defrocking of a Polish archbishop accused of paying for sex with minors in the Dominican Republic.\\n\\nThe year before, he set up a Vatican commission, including some victims, to advise local Churches on how to prevent abuse. But some members have complained about the slow pace of change in the Vatican.\\n\\nFrancis also approved the establishment of a Vatican tribunal to judge bishops accused of covering up sexual abuse or failing to prevent it, but the proposal has so far stalled.\\n\\nChurch sexual abuse broke into the open in 2002, when it was discovered that U.S. bishops moved abusers from parish to parish instead of defrocking them. Similar scandals were later discovered around the world and tens of millions of dollars have been paid in compensation."}
{"original": "A battle over efforts to call a constitutional convention is currently taking place throughout the country. Occurring below the national radar screen, the fight has enormous consequences.\\n\\nProponents are attempting to pass resolutions in 34 state legislatures that call for a constitutional convention to adopt a federal balanced budget constitutional amendment.\\n\\nMost experts agree, however, that once a constitutional convention is called, the actions of the convention could not be limited in advance to any particular issue and the delegates would be able to consider any other constitutional amendments they wish to adopt. (Amendments adopted by the convention would then go to the states for ratification.)\\n\\nAs the late Supreme Court Chief Justice Warren Burger explained, [T]here is no way to effectively limit or muzzle the actions of a constitutional convention. The convention could make its own rules and set its own agenda.\\n\\nThis means that calling a constitutional convention would open the door to a runaway convention in which all of the constitutional rights provided to the American people would be up for grabs. This includes constitutional protections for civil rights and liberties, freedom of speech and religion, and voting and privacy rights, among others.\\n\\nThe late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia made clear his concerns about having a constitutional convention by stating, I certainly would not want a constitutional convention. Whoa! Who knows what would come out of it?\\n\\nProponents of a constitutional convention are led by ALEC, an organization that includes conservative state legislators and major corporations. Local tea party groups are also active in the states.\\n\\nAt the start of 2017, proponents claimed to have resolutions passed in 28 of the 34 states needed to call a constitutional convention. More than half of these states passed their resolutions more than three decades ago.\\n\\nWyoming and Arizona have added their names to the list this year, and Wisconsin is also considered likely to pass a call for a constitutional convention later this year.\\n\\nBut there is also a national coalition working to prevent a constitutional convention. Groups providing leadership for the coalition effort include the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, Common Cause, AFSCME and Democracy 21.\\n\\nThe coalition has been joined in some states by local conservative organizations, including gun rights groups and the Eagle Forum, who also do not want to see the Constitution opened up for revision.\\n\\nThe coalition this year has successfully lobbied state legislatures in New Mexico and Maryland to rescind previously passed resolutions that called for a convention. And in Nevada, the State Senate has passed a rescission resolution and the House is expected to act on it soon.\\n\\nIf Wisconsin and Nevada go as currently expected, we will be back to the 28 states with which we started 2017.\\n\\nProponents of the convention have targeted six additional states in which the legislatures are fully controlled by Republicans: Idaho, Kentucky, Minnesota, Montana, South Carolina and Virginia, and two states with split legislatures: Maine and Washington.\\n\\nIf they succeed in the six Republican-controlled state legislatures, proponents will then claim to have the 34 states needed to call a convention.\\n\\nHowever, in Idaho this year, an outside coalition of conservatives and liberals defeated the call for a convention by a 24 to 11 vote in the Senate. And in Kentucky, local citizen opposition generated in part by the group Indivisible blocked the resolution in committee.\\n\\nThis ongoing battle will continue to be fought during the remainder of the 2018 election cycle and beyond, if necessary.\\n\\nA constitutional convention would wreak havoc in the country. It would open up the nation's charter and all of the constitutional rights and protections it provides for the American people to fundamental change in a political environment of great divisiveness and polarization.\\n\\nOur first and only constitutional convention took place in 1787. George Washington, Benjamin Franklin, James Madison and Alexander Hamilton will not be available to serve as delegates if a second constitutional convention is called. It needs to be prevented."}
{"original": "Photo: http://401kcalculator.org\\n\\nBy Marisabel Torres, Senior Policy Analyst, Wealth-Building Policy Project, NCLR\\n\\nAn upcoming vote in the Senate will determine whether states can help their residents prepare for a time that all workers should have the right to enjoy: retirement. While that seems like a goal Congress should support, the House and Senate already voted to block the Department of Labor (DOL)'s rule allowing cities to establish their own retirement plans. Now, they're looking to put state plans in jeopardy with a vote on S.J. Res 32.\\n\\nMany workers recognize that pensions, which used to be a common employee benefit in supporting a robust retirement, are not a guarantee in today's labor market. And increasingly, neither are employer-sponsored retirement plans like a 401k. Currently, more than 45 percent of working-age households in the United States do not have access to a retirement savings plan through their employer. For Latinos, 60 percent do not have access to an employer-sponsored retirement plan. The city and state plans proposed would provide auto-enrollment Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs) for private sector workers who tend to be lower-income, and don't have access to such benefits through their employers. This would also benefit employees of small businesses, where 50 percent of employers don't offer retirement plans. Workers who participate are automatically opted into a retirement savings account that takes out a predetermined amount from their monthly paychecks and saves it in an IRA. Workers also have the option to opt out at any time.\\n\\nCurrently, more than 45 percent of working-age households in the United States do not have access to a retirement savings plan through their employer.\\n\\nState-established retirement plans for workers who otherwise don't have access to a retirement savings account make sense for millions of individuals. In states like Pennsylvania and Nevada, where nearly 50 percent of Latino workers don't have access to an employer-sponsored plan, these accounts could be a lifeline to an economically secure future. In California, Secure Choice, a state retirement program which was passed into law last year could give nearly four million Latino workers access to a retirement account—but only if Congress doesn't vote to jeopardize the implementation of the program by blocking the DOL rule.\\n\\nIt's not just individual workers who would benefit from the establishment of these plans—many smaller nonprofits without the infrastructure to offer an employer-sponsored plan could also remain competitive in attracting employees if workers could access a retirement plan through their state. Eastmont Community Center in Los Angeles is a nonprofit that fully supported passage of the California Secure Choice Retirement Program. Teresa Palacios, Executive Director at Eastmont, says that, having a low-risk and low-cost retirement plan accessible to all employees would benefit everyone in our community. It is not uncommon to see children taking care of their elder parents because they cannot support themselves with their fixed Social Security benefit.\\n\\nSecure Choice would provide the opportunity for younger people to start thinking now about the future and how to better plan for their retirement. Currently, we don't have that opportunity. While she would like to offer retirement accounts to her own employees, their budget is currently only able to support allocating funds to programming expenses. Secure Choice was the perfect solution for our organization to provide access to a low-cost retirement savings plan that would help employees save for their future. It would also secure my own retirement.\\n\\nAs many households continue to live paycheck to paycheck, opportunities to save for a secure retirement are crucial. Congress should not jeopardize the long-term economic security of millions of workers, and should oppose S.J. Res 32.\\n\\nThis was first posted to the NCLR Blog."}
{"original": "level17 via Getty Images\\n\\nOffice romances may be an HR nightmare, but they happen nonetheless.\\n\\nIn a 2017 CareerBuilder survey, 41 percent of workers 'fessed up to dating a co-worker, and 30 percent of those relationships led to marriage. Regardless of how common it is, asking your work crush out on a date requires a lot of tact, especially with all the workplace sexual harassment scandals that have unfolded over the last year.\\n\\nHow do you go about it without being a creep? Below, human resources and dating experts share six things to keep in mind before asking someone out at work.\\n\\n1. Check what HR policies are in place.\\n\\nYour workplace is just that: a workplace, not a bar or a dating app for download. None of the HR experts we spoke to encouraged actively looking for love at the office, but they acknowledged it happens. And while it's less common for businesses to enforce or even have a non-fraternization policy, it's still important to determine if your company has one, said Teresa Marzolph, founder of Culture Engineered, a human capital consulting firm in Phoenix.\\n\\nThe few policies still in existence often focus on relationships that put the company as risk, such as a romantic relationship between a manager and their employee, or one that runs contrary to the checks and balances that exist within the company ― like quality assurance and customer service or finance and sales, Marzolph told HuffPost.\\n\\nIf no guidelines exist, Marzolph recommends gauging the workplace culture around you: Have you heard of other office relationships developing in the past? Does the company encourage after-hours camaraderie among the staff?\\n\\nA company that sponsors or hosts non-work events and activities may be an example of a culture that's much more tolerant or even supportive of relationships in the workplace, Marzolph said.\\n\\n2. Be friends first.\\n\\nAvoid going from zero to 100 by establishing a friendship first, said Lynn Taylor, a workplace expert and author of Tame Your Terrible Office Tyrant: How to Manage Childish Boss Behavior & Thrive in Your Job. This way, you'll find out early on whether you have anything in common besides mutual disgust of your boss' Tupperware lunches.\\n\\nEstablish a foundation and find out if you're compatible, personality-wise, Taylor said. Then, take cues. Gauge your next actions off the responses you generally receive from the person.\\n\\n3. Suggest getting coffee.\\n\\nTake some of the stress out of the situation by suggesting a casual location for your date, said Neely Steinberg, a dating coach and image consultant.\\n\\nCoffee is usually a good suggestion because it's low key and really, who doesn't like coffee? Steinberg said. Plus, it may be perceived as a friend thing as opposed to an actual 'date.' If you're not getting a good romantic vibe, you can always just chalk it up to a friendly co-worker coffee.\\n\\n4. When you do ask, don't make it weird.\\n\\nIn the 12 years Marzolph has worked in human resources, sexual harassment complaints have almost always been about how someone went about asking, not the fact that they had asked.\\n\\nThe common theme is that the interaction left one person feeling uncomfortable, she told us. Whether intended or not, most filing a claim or complaint describe the pursuing employee's approach as awkward or inappropriate.\\n\\nTo avoid becoming an office-wide pariah, be mindful of your surroundings and your body language when floating the idea of a date, Marzolph said.\\n\\nDon't come on too strong or corner the person, and ideally, approach them outside of work or in the communal area, Marzolph said. Try to keep your approach light; be ready to give the person an easy out if they're not interested, so you both can continue working together without tension.\\n\\n5. If they say 'no,' maintain professionalism throughout the experience.\\n\\nDon't take it personally if your crush is just not that into you, Taylor said.\\n\\nIf the person declines, remember that this is a risky proposition, she explained. Your co-worker might have otherwise said 'yes' if you hadn't met at work. Many are averse to dating co-workers as a personal policy.\\n\\n6. If they say 'yes,' still maintain professionalism throughout the experience.\\n\\nFrom the beginning, recognize that this is an imperfect dating situation. Asking a colleague out isn't simply about two people getting together ― it almost always complicates the workplace dynamic, said S. Chris Edmonds, a human resources expert and founder of The Purposeful Culture Group.\\n\\nLuckily, some work relationships work out great, Edmonds said. I met the woman who became my wife at work and we've been married 38 years now. You just need to be diligent in keeping work separate from your outside relationship. PDA or arguing at work will only increase tension and discomfort by other team members and observers.\\n\\nWhatever happens, Edmonds recommends keeping your personal policy on interoffice romances as simple as possible."}
{"original": "Events like the foreign influence debate and now the coronavirus have made me realise for us Chinese-Australians it doesn't matter how Australian and integrated into Australian society we are. As soon as a crisis relating to China appears, we are treated differently and seen not as Australian but Chinese who are nothing more than outsiders, who are disloyal and untrustworthy.\\n\\nChinese-Australians cannot seem to catch a break. The growing distrust of Chinese-Australians within Australian institutions and society resulting from China's assertive rise and the escalating allegations of its improper influence in our affairs is increasing anxiety among those of us caught in the crossfire.\\n\\nFirst it was the foreigners from China taking over our businesses, buying farmland , houses and milk powder . This was followed by the foreign influence and interference debate that accused some Chinese-Australians, including myself, of being spies and foreign agents . Now, with the new coronavirus, those who appear Chinese, are of Chinese ancestry and, in some instances, are of Asian descent, are seen as disease carriers who have dirty eating habits.\\n\\nThe xenophobic narrative and the negative reactions we Chinese-Australians have been receiving since the latest coronavirus outbreak are all too familiar.\\n\\nBeforethe coronavirus crisis, the foreign influence and interference debate had a deep and profound effect on the reputation of Chinese-Australians. Propelled by a 2017 joint ABC/Fairfax Media investigation , the topic of foreign influence became an instant news item. Topics that have come under the scope of foreign influence, bringing intense public discussion and scrutiny, include research collaboration between institutions, foreign students studying in Australia, foreign investment and political donations. Despite the overarching theme of foreign influence, the only country that consistently gets a mention in Australian media and public commentary is China.\\n\\nI have heard anecdotal evidence from Chinese-Australians working in major corporations and the Australian public service of creeping distrust, being left off meeting invitations and emails, and with some senior executives thinking twice about recruiting and promoting us.\\n\\nDeeply concerning are recent revelations about foreign influence in our democracy and political system, including suspicions around political donations from people with Chinese backgrounds and allegations of a state-sponsored attempt to infiltrate the federal parliament using an Australian citizen of Chinese heritage to contest the 2019 federal election. Though questions need to be asked and allegations assessed, not all Chinese-Australians should be painted with the same brush, and these cases should not be used as a catalyst to discourage Chinese-Australians participating in our democratic and public institutions.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen it comes to obtaining leadership positions in both the public sector and at major businesses, although Asian-Australians generally face a degree of bias, whether conscious or unconscious, Chinese-Australians in recent years have had to deal with the added complexities of anxiety and distrust generated by China's growing international role.\\n\\nIt is not uncommon to see anti-China headlines splashed across the media these days. Even in 2020, it is disappointing to see the casual racism and the normalisation of Sinophobic narratives that appeared before and during the White Australia Policy still exist. The Daily Telegraph took such casual racism to a new level with a front-page headline, China Kids Stay Home, while its Victorian equivalent, The Herald Sun, carried a headline that said, China Virus Pandamonium. These messages are intended to create a perception to fuel anti-Chinese sentiment to appeal to certain parts of the population.\\n\\nIt is one thing to be vigilant, stay informed and take precautions. It is another to take advantage of this unfortunate situation to put up Sinophobic signs and online slurs to promote fear, anxiety and public prejudices.\\n\\nChinese-Australians, like all Australians, are concerned about the spread of COVID-19, the new coronavirus. Some of them who have returned to Australia after Lunar New Year celebrations in China have chosen to self-quarantine while community groups and associations have taken up the unprecedented measure of putting on face masks, closing businesses and cancelling Lunar New Year events across Australian cities. Chinese culture and philosophy always emphasise the importance of prioritising the needs of others over our own.\\n\\nWhat Chinese-Australians and those affected in China need right now is not hate but empathy and compassion. And the best way we can help is to acknowledge the past, publicly condemn racism and put an end to Sinophobia once and for all.\\n\\nI should not have to convince my fellow Australians of the unwavering loyalty and commitment of Chinese-Australians to Australia every time a crisis strikes, but that is what I have done for the majority of my adult life. Growing up in Australia, it was never easy being a Chinese-Australian, but recent events have made it harder.\\n\\nJieh-Yung Lo is a Chinese-Australian advocate and writer."}
{"original": "With election season well underway, education is sure to come up as a hot topic. Politicians make big promises but come up with nothing more than empty bromides. Who can argue with a policy called No Child Left Behind or Every Student Succeeds? But it takes more than political promises to truly inspire children, show them the gift of their own potential and prepare them to tackle life's many challenges.\\n\\nIt takes really great teachers.\\n\\nIn my life, I have had a number of good teachers, plenty of mediocre ones and a few who were truly exceptional. In the sixties, rote learning and duck and cover were de rigueur. Like the all-important cursive, to succeed in elementary school, you needed to stay within the lines. I was generally pretty good at that. Years before I began to question authority (the mantra of my generation), I was an obedient, rule-abiding kid. I liked school, even though I had a series of teachers who were more like Glee's irascible Coach Sylvester than kindly Will Schuester. My expectations were low.\\n\\nAnd then I entered fourth grade. My teacher, Mrs. Gerlip, was a young dynamo who integrated art, music, theatre and other forms of creative expression into a lively curriculum. I blossomed. I formed an all-inclusive Fun Club with other girls in my class which was all about, well, having fun. I wrote a book I called Through the Forest about the misadventures of Polly and Jack who disobeyed their parents and had to fend off wild animals and misguided hunters. As one of the only Jewish kids in the school, I had the chutzpah to sing a Chanukah song -- in Hebrew -- at our annual Christmas assembly. Much of the joy and self-confidence I experienced that year was attributable to a great teacher whom I never forgot.\\n\\nSo you can imagine my surprise when fifty years later I receive a letter in the mail. My father had passed away a few months earlier and there had been an obituary in the local paper. Upon hearing the news, Mrs. Gerlip thought to write a personal note which found its way to me via my mother, who still lives in my hometown. After months of correspondence, a reunion was planned at Mrs. Gerlip's home in Western Massachusetts. My 86-year-old mother was excited to join us and see the teacher she remembered so fondly. Reconnecting with Mrs. Gerlip was a journey back in time. Five decades had passed, but my teacher's memories revealed a remarkable connection to each and every student. Pointing out faces from the class photo, Mrs. Gerlip recalled Suzy's sweet nature, Matt's studious reserve, and Patty's chatty sociability. She hadn't forgotten the class bully who used to pelt me with ice balls (and anti-Semitic slurs) on my way to school. In an era when bullying was considered a rite of passage, Mrs. Gerlip knew better and put a stop to it.\\n\\nThen Mrs. Gerlip brought out a photo from the local newspaper she had saved for all these years. There I was, sitting side by side with my teacher, working on a mural for the Christmas assembly. I wore a broad beaming smile -- one of the most joyful photos I have ever seen of myself. I was still just a child, before the storm of adolescence, with its accompanying self-doubt and muted pleasures. In that moment, the photo captured the gift my teacher had given me. Not only did I feel safe and protected, but I was able to truly be myself.\\n\\nNow, in my mid-fifties, I appreciate even more the gifts I was given in fourth grade. I am writing a book about caring for aging parents -- the first such effort since Through the Forest. I care less about how others judge me and more about how they make me feel. As life doles out its sorrows and joys, what is really worth cherishing seems abundantly clear. While I've had to say goodbye to those I love, like my dad, his loss somehow reconnected me to my beloved teacher. I am deeply grateful. Not only that I had the benefit of a remarkable teacher who inspired my capacity for joy and creativity, but that I was able to tell her after half a century, the impact she had on my life. It's never too late to reach out and express thanks to that extraordinary teacher in your life. I hope you were fortunate enough to have had one, like Mrs. Gerlip, who not only developed your mind but nurtured your soul."}
{"original": "AP Photo/Al-hadji Kudra Maliro Protesters walk past a burning tire in Beni on Dec. 28, 2018, as they demonstrate against postponed voting in the Congolese election.\\n\\nCitizens of the Democratic Republic of Congo, site of an expanding Ebola outbreak, are set to hear the results of their long-delayed presidential election on Sunday. Violence and instability in the lead-up to the Dec. 30 voting has already interrupted efforts to rein in what is the second-largest Ebola outbreak ever.\\n\\nNow global health leaders are concerned that controversy and chaos in response to the election results could significantly undercut the response to what the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is now calling an epidemic that so far has produced 613 cases and claimed 371 lives in the DRC.\\n\\nThe DRC, home to over 80 million people, has never had a peaceful democratic transition of power. President Joseph Kabila had delayed last month's election to choose his successor for two years. The election commission has put off releasing the voting results until at least Jan. 6. In the meantime, both the ruling party and the opposition forces are claiming victory.\\n\\nMultiple irregularities undercut the integrity of the vote, the opposition and observers say. The ballots from the northeastern cities of Beni and Butembo, both hot spots of the Ebola outbreak as well as opposition strongholds in the northeastern province of North Kivu, will not even be counted until March ― months after the new president is expected to take office. The threat of Ebola was the reason given for officially delaying the vote there, although the citizens then organized their own vote.\\n\\nElectoral protests turned violent in Beni, with people burning an Ebola transit center and scattering the patients waiting for test results there on Dec. 27, as well as vandalizing several other health facilities. That violence and other election protests, which focused on Ebola facilities after the government blamed the epidemic for the voting delays, led several non-governmental organizations to temporarily stop operations in the region over the last two weeks. At least five international NGOs that had been offering critical assistance to the World Health Organization and the DRC Ministry of Health ― Mercy Corps, Médecins Sans Frontières, International Medical Corps, Oxfam and the International Rescue Committee ― have at least partially pulled their personnel out, according to the IRC's new field director for Beni, Dalia Al-Awqati. (HuffPost was able to independently verify all but the IMC by press time.)\\n\\nThe WHO's operations were notably affected from Dec. 24 through Jan. 1, said Mike Ryan, the agency's assistant director-general for emergency preparedness and response. He told HuffPost that responders were significantly limited in their ability to get into the field and to track contacts and administer vaccinations.\\n\\nLindsay Mackenzie/WHO The city of Butembo is home to one million people and another hot spot in the Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo.\\n\\nWhile the WHO is essentially back up to speed now, other NGOs like the IRC and MSF are still ramping their operations back up. And now they're working without internet or SMS, since the government has cut them both country-wide, allegedly to preserve public order, since Dec. 31. The IRC's departing Beni coordinator, Nora Love, said the internet and texting suspension had severely hampered data collection and contact efforts.\\n\\nReports of new Ebola cases have been lower in the last couple of days, but Ryan said that was most likely due to the absence of medical personnel, rather than any real turn in the outbreak. The last time there was an extended interruption to the Ebola response ― this September in Beni ― the number of cases surged dramatically afterward.\\n\\nRebel attacks in the Ebola-afflicted region and community resistance to outside help have impeded the medical response from the start. Now, the elections have been the third wave of destabilization, said J. Stephen Morrison, director of the Global Health Policy Center, a program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, D.C. I think [the responders] are hanging on by a thread.\\n\\nFighting Ebola in a war zone is hard enough without the threat of electoral chaos.\\n\\nIf there's anything we need, it's stability, Ryan said. It's just important we stay the course and that we don't lose confidence we can finish this.\\n\\nA senior U.S. government official actively involved in the Ebola response, who requested anonymity in order to be candid, also raised the alarm. Personally, we're all incredibly concerned what we're seeing now and what the potential impact is going to be over the next weeks for additional transmission of disease, the official said.\\n\\nAnd while the current case count is a fraction of the devastation of the 2014 West Africa Ebola outbreak ― which killed 11,300 people and infected over 28,600 ― the threat of surging numbers or cross-border spread continues, Ryan said.\\n\\nIt's on the epidemiological knife's edge at the moment.\\n\\nFighting Without 'Your Best Allies'\\n\\nThere's no question that the WHO and the medical workers still on the ground are working around the clock to stop the outbreak, said Ron Klain, the former Ebola czar under President Barack Obama. But he argues, and many global health experts HuffPost spoke to agree, that they need more help.\\n\\nThe U.S. has come under fire for its decision to pull CDC personnel from Beni back to the DRC capital of Kinshasa many hundreds of miles away in August, citing security concerns. On Dec. 14, the U.S. State Department evacuated all non-essential government employees from the DRC due to the threat of election violence. Only two CDC workers remain in country.\\n\\nThe CDC is currently making preparations to set up a training center for DRC Ministry of Health workers in Goma, the capital of North Kivu south of Beni and Butembo. Vaccination of frontline health care workers has begun in the heavily populated area, which lies on the Rwandan border. The CDC said the Ministry of Health is also considering moving its Ebola response operations there. However, the U.S. agency would need clearance from the State Department to re-enter North Kivu. It's unclear when ― or if ― that will happen.\\n\\nClearly we'd love to have CDC. It's difficult to fight a war without your best allies in the field, Ryan said, noting however that the U.S. has offered massive financial and technical aid.\\n\\nSome wonder if the Ebola outbreak would have been smaller if the CDC's vast knowledge of epidemic surveillance and related activities had been brought to bear more fully.\\n\\nI think many of us feel that if more people had been in the area earlier that we could potentially be in a better place today, the anonymous U.S. official told HuffPost. But I don't do security assessments; I do public health assessments.\\n\\nIt's an imbalance between what is needed for this far-flung, difficult-to-control outbreak and what's available. Dr. Thomas Inglesby, director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security\\n\\nRegardless of what could have been done before, more resources are needed now, said Dr. Thomas Inglesby, director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security.\\n\\nIt's an imbalance between what is needed for this far-flung, difficult-to-control outbreak and what's available, Inglesby said, especially in light of the current NGO pullouts and possible mass disruptions due to the election. The only obvious new source of resources and finance and people for the response will come from countries ― including the U.S.\\n\\nIn a STAT interview published Friday, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the criticism of the U.S. wasn't entirely warranted given that other countries had also cited security as a reason for not sending government employees. And Morrison said that he doubted the CDC's on-the-ground presence would have been a total show-changer.\\n\\nThe bigger picture is that in the era of Brexit and the era of EU disarray and the era of Trump Washington, there's not a lot of leadership at the major power level that's focused on anything like this, Morrison said. WHO is out there alone.\\n\\nUnder Rising Pressure\\n\\nFor Ryan, the trouble in the DRC has highlighted a broader problem: an escalating rise in the most dangerous kinds of disease outbreaks in the most insecure of situations. At the WHO, he's in talks to expand the outbreak response team, as well as fortify in-country surveillance systems and increase in-country expert training.\\n\\nWe need to scale this up for the future as the pattern of high-impact outbreaks is intensifying, Ryan told HuffPost. We are constantly at full operational level and we need to be able to leverage a much larger workforce to be able to [expand more] than we are currently.\\n\\nThat constant deployment is taxing on response workers, as they're going nonstop 24/7 with little relief, said Jeremy Konyndyk, a senior policy fellow for the Washington-based Center for Global Development who led parts of the 2014 Ebola response for the Obama administration.\\n\\nMorrison points to the two recent Ebola outbreaks in the DRC as powerful examples of large-scale health crises amid significant security threats. [The world has] asked WHO to play a major role along with other UN agencies but none of them are fully able to deal with security or high diplomacy demands, so what's the strategy going to be for the future? he asked.\\n\\nFor four years, I have been advocating the creation of a 'white helmet' battalion of security forces that could operate globally to protect infectious disease responders.

Ron Klain, the former Ebola czar under President Obama\\n\\nThe increasing number of worst-case crises is also driving NGOs to pull back, citing the costs and dangers to their own staff, Morrison warned ― and leaving other NGOs and the WHO to shoulder a greater burden.\\n\\nThe global health community may need a new security solution, Klain said. While Ryan argues that the United Nations security force, known as MONUSCO, has been protecting WHO workers and other responders on top of its peacekeeping mission in the area, Klain is pushing for a separate force dedicated solely to protecting public health responders.\\n\\nFor four years, I have been advocating the creation of a 'white helmet' battalion of security forces that could operate globally to protect infectious disease responders. What is going on now in the DRC shows the need for such a force, Klain said.\\n\\nAfter The Election\\n\\nFor now, global health leaders are waiting to see what the DRC election results could set off. Community reaction in North Kivu will be key, with a special eye on what happens to the self-run voting from Beni and Butembo.\\n\\nIt's hard to predict how they will react if people feel like their voices are not heard, Konyndyk said.\\n\\nMeanwhile, the Ebola outbreak's other challenges rage on, Ryan said. While rebel attacks have subsided, he stressed they don't know how long that respite could last. Community resistance persists, especially in new areas of the outbreak. A vaccination team was violently set upon in the past week. Patient contacts are still resisting follow-up, and the outbreak is being fought on widespread fronts.\\n\\nAnd the threat of a WHO pullout, which could be triggered by targeted attacks on or killings of the organization's workers, remains. That would be an utter humanitarian disaster, said Morrison.\\n\\nThank God that Tedros is out there in the thick of all of this and doing what he's doing to rally his troops and put himself in the midst of all of this, Morrison said, citing a trip that the director-general made to the outbreak area over the new year. That's pretty extraordinary leadership and evidence of how imperiled and vulnerable they feel.\\n\\nLindsay Mackenzie/WHO WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus (center) visits a WHO Ebola vaccination team in Butembo on Jan. 1, 2019.\\n\\nThe global health response will have cost an estimated $129 million by the end of January, and with the outbreak expected to last months after that, they will need tens of millions more.\\n\\nUnless the disease is checked, the risk of an explosive turn in the outbreak remains: spread to a larger city in the region, or to other countries, or to refugee camps in Sudan, or even to Kinshasa, Klain said. That would be a catastrophe.\\n\\nThe WHO will see this through, Ryan said.\\n\\nThere's no other option. We stay and deliver and support the vulnerable people that are affected by this outbreak, but we also stay and deliver as the world has to be protected from disease like this.\\n\\nAn earlier version of this story indicated per the International Rescue Committee's field director for Beni that Medair was one of the NGOs that pulled at least some of its people out of the Ebola conflict zone in late December. Medair has since told HuffPost that none of its personnel were pulled out."}

{"original": "By Jim Smith, UCF Forum columnist\\n\\nImagine going to any public event and a fight breaks out over saving seats. This was just the case recently in Memphis, TN, at the Arlington High School graduation ceremony held at a church. The embarrassing story and video went national.\\n\\nIt seems one family was saving seats for someone, but when another family tried to sit in them there were angry words and fists flying before security stepped in. This was all happening while the Arlington senior class was walking in and the ceremony had already started.\\n\\nSaving seats is a long-standing practice and normally does not cause a problem of this magnitude for either party involved. But there is always the awkward feeling when some of your party are not there and you are trying to save them seats ― and those you have informed that you are saving seats angrily move to another area to sit.\\n\\nAnd then there is the situation when you have saved seats for your friends or family and they do not even bother to show up or call.\\n\\nCan't we as adults stop these situations from happening?\\n\\nWhen you coordinate a group for anything there will be differences of opinion on what is meant by arriving early, arriving on time and arriving late. Even when you spell it out in advance there can be a different understanding of the time schedule.\\n\\nFor example, my family gathers for vacations once or twice a year and we plan to leave together from one location for the trip. Invariably, there are early risers who sit and wait for everyone else to arrive. Then there are those who arrive with a few minutes to spare, as well as those who arrive right at the time we plan to leave. Finally, there are some who arrive late and we have to wait on them before departure.\\n\\nOf course, the price for those who arrive late is that everyone reminds them of their tardiness at every opportunity during the trip. Ah, yes… family fun!\\n\\nAre there remedies to this problem? Do you give those who chronically run late an earlier time to meet? Or do you wait to go in to an event until everyone in your party arrives?\\n\\nI have experienced group dinners at restaurants where you are not seated until your entire party arrives. Perhaps this could be the solution. What if these families in Memphis were not admitted to the graduation ceremony until everyone arrived? Would that help or make the situation more difficult? Would the tardy family have arrived earlier if they knew of this type of policy?\\n\\nShow some maturity. Before you gather for special occasions of any kind, try to work on communication and cooperation by all parties involved so there is no reason for arguments when someone is saving seats for others who could not arrive on time.\\n\\nPlan ahead. Enjoy the event and savor the memory – not the black eye from a fistfight or ripped clothes from a shoving match that could have been avoided."}

The two hosts, personal injury lawyer Bill Bone and longtime Democratic donor Cynthia Friedman, have been fixtures on the Democratic fundraising circuit for years.\\n\\nBoth also frequented Mar-a-Lago for decades and maintained their ties to Trump's private club well into his presidency.\\n\\nButtigieg's campaign is facing a cash crunch, and he is racing around the country to high-dollar fundraisers like these in order to refill his coffers ahead of Super Tuesday.\\n\\nJoe Raedle via Getty Images President Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort on April 3, 2019, in West Palm Beach, Florida.\\n\\nThe events have become fuel for criticism that Buttigieg is beholden to wealthy elites and is their preferred candidate, with rivals like Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) assailing billionaires in wine caves for trying to pick the next president. When a Buttigieg fundraiser explicitly dangled the potential to influence the former South Bend, Indiana, mayor in exchange for donations, even some donors were critical.\\n\\nThis particular fundraiser takes Buttigieg not just to one of the country's wealthiest enclaves, but to a place where the president has made wealth, influence and access interchangeable — and that goes for Buttigieg's own boosters.\\n\\nAP Photo/Chris Carlson, File On Dec. 19, 2019, Sen. Elizabeth Warren lit into Pete Buttigieg on the debate stage in Los Angeles for attending a fundraiser at a wine cave in Napa Valley, California.\\n\\nA trip to Mar-a-Lago can entail unrestrained access to the president, which visitors have leveraged to privately advance their personal causes and powerful business interests.\\n\\nNothing suggests that Friedman or Bone have met Trump at Mar-a-Lago since he became president, or that either visited the resort to advance any special interests. And there's no comparing Buttigieg's high-dollar fundraisers with the corruption scandals erupting out of Mar-a-Lago, where the line between Trump's business interests and his policies is virtually nonexistent.\\n\\nIn the most infamous case, a gang of three Mar-a-Lago members that included Marvel CEO Ike Perlmutter used their perch to make policy for the Department of Veterans Affairs.\\n\\nBut it's a testament to how insular and overlapping the world of ultrawealthy movers-and-shakers can be, especially in the kind of luxe havens where major donors live and mingle.\\n\\nThe stakes in this election are clear and stark and in order to win back the White House, we need to be able to build as big of a tent as possible. That's why whether you can give $3 or $300, whether you are a Democrat, Independent, or a future former Republican who is disgusted by what's going on in this White House, we welcome you to our campaign, campaign spokesman Sean Savett told HuffPost after publication. We are proud to have more than 800,000 donors on our campaign and the only promise any of them will ever get from Pete is that he will use their donation to defeat Donald Trump.\\n\\nBone was an Obama donor and a Hillary Clinton supporter in 2016. It is not clear if he's still a dues-paying member of Mar-a-Lago. His affiliation dates back to at least 2005, when the Palm Beach Post noted he had an active membership.\\n\\nAt an April 2011 Mar-a-Lago bash, Bone reportedly introduced Trump as the next president of the United States.\\n\\nAt the time, if Trump came up in political conversations at all, it was because of the outlandish Fox News appearances he used to spread the conspiracy theory that President Barack Obama was Muslim and had no U.S. birth certificate.\\n\\nJust days before Bone hailed Trump as the next president, the reality TV star argued on Bill O'Reilly's show that Obama's real birth certificate would show that he was Muslim. A lot of these birthers are just really quality people that just want the truth, Trump said. What they do to the birthers is unbelievable.\\n\\nAs recently as 2018, Bone helped stage an event at Mar-a-Lago where the host committee presented an award to Trump's commerce secretary, Wilbur Ross. The 700-person event was a fundraiser for the Palm Beach Police Foundation; Bone conducted a charity auction.\\n\\nFriedman is a longtime Democratic donor who bundled more than $100,000 for Hillary Clinton's campaign. She is the co-founder of the Women's Leadership Forum, a network of female Democratic activists.\\n\\nHer personal interactions with Trump appear more limited and include a 2012 party she hosted for Susan G. Komen for the Cure that Trump attended with his wife, Melania.\\n\\nFriedman, a onetime tennis partner of Marla Maples, Trump's second wife, was a member of Mar-a-Lago for a quarter-century until December 2018.\\n\\nAfter Trump said the 2017 white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, featured very fine people on both sides, Friedman actively contemplated leaving Mar-a-Lago, in the words of author Laurence Leamer. She decided against it, Leamer reported, in order to avoid losing her initiation fee. The fee runs between $100,000 and $200,000.\\n\\nShe rationalized that if she left she would no longer be able to observe Trump's actions.

{"original": "WASHINGTON ― A growing number of Democrats are pledging to block the consideration of all other legislation on the Senate floor until Republicans allow a vote on appropriations bills passed by the House last week.\\n\\nThe hardball tactic aims to put added pressure on Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) as the partial federal government shutdown enters its third week. He has said that he will not allow a vote on the spending bills because they would not receive a signature from President Donald Trump, who is demanding that Democrats agree to fund construction of a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border.\\n\\nSen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), who represents a state with a large number of federal employees, urged Senate Democrats to adopt the strategy in a tweet over the weekend. Since then, it has been endorsed by several progressive groups and nearly a dozen of his Democratic colleagues in the Senate.\\n\\nSenate Democrats should block consideration of any bills unrelated to opening the government until Sen. Mitch McConnell and Senate Republicans allow a vote on the bipartisan bills the House passed to open the government. Mitch, don't delay. Let's vote! — Chris Van Hollen (@ChrisVanHollen) January 5, 2019\\n\\nHe will need nearly all Democrats on board, however, in order to prevent Republicans from clearing the chamber's 60-vote threshold to bring a measure to the floor.\\n\\nThe first test will come Tuesday afternoon, when the Senate is scheduled to vote on a motion to proceed to open debate on a Republican Middle East policy package that includes Syria sanctions and a measure that aims to block boycotts of Israel. The latter has been endorsed by some Democrats, but critics say it violates the First Amendment right to free speech.\\n\\nA senior Senate Democratic aide said Monday that Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) would join the opposition to taking up the foreign policy legislation, known as S.1, before the Senate votes on the House-passed spending bills.\\n\\nSenate Republicans should instead bring to the floor the House-passed bills to reopen the government, the aide said Monday.\\n\\nSchumer is a prominent ally of Israel in the Senate, and he has backed similar measures that would have made it a felony for Americans to support the international boycott, divestment and sanctions movement against Israel.\\n\\nSen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), an author of the anti-boycott bill, argued that the shutdown is not really the reason Democrats are coming out against the foreign policy package.\\n\\nA huge argument broke out at Senate Dem meeting last week over BDS. A significant # of Senate Democrats now support # BDS & Dem leaders want to avoid a floor vote that reveals that, Rubio tweeted Monday.\\n\\nBut Sen.

A public lands bill that was held over from the last Congress is expected to get a vote next week, for example ― and it has support from a number of Western Democratic senators.\\n\\nFor now, though, the tactic seems to be Democrats' best hand before Trump's national address and trip to the border later this week.\\n\\nSenate Republicans should not treat this legislative work period like it's a time to catch up on miscellaneous items.

{"original": "The partial government shutdown has now gone on for 22 days, making it the longest such closure in U.S. history.\\n\\nMany of the affected federal employees had missed at least one paycheck as of Saturday, when the shutdown hit record length. The financial stress is leading some workers to look for other jobs, ask relatives for money, apply for unemployment or even go without essentials like medication. Meanwhile, other Americans are facing a host of inconveniences and hardships, from shuttered museums to delayed farm loans.\\n\\nWe've dipped into our savings account already. If it keeps going, my husband said he'll call his parents and see if they'll lend us some money, said DeCarann Speaks, a mother of two and the wife of a Border Patrol agent in Vermont who is working without a paycheck. Some days I just want to sit and cry. But I have to stay positive for my children.\\n\\nPresident Donald Trump is insisting that Congress give him $5.7 billion to build a wall on the border with Mexico, a proposition Democrats describe as a costly and immoral boondoggle. With talks at a standstill in Washington, the president headed to the border on Thursday to make his case for the wall. He said he is considering declaring a national emergency to get the funding Democrats have denied him, a maneuver all but certain to be challenged in court.\\n\\nThe impasse has meant that roughly a quarter of federal government functions are no longer funded, with agencies including the Department of Homeland Security, the Interior Department and the Internal Revenue Service largely shut down. Approximately 380,000 federal employees have been furloughed and are out of work, while another 420,000 are still working as essential personnel but are not being paid.\\n\\nIt's just ridiculous that people have to suffer and go through hardship and be stressed out. Larry Howard, worker at the National Zoo\\n\\nThe shutdown, which began Dec. 22, was technically the third to take place in 2018, although the first lasted a mere three days, and the second lasted just a few hours and did not result in any furloughs. There have been 21 similar funding lapses since 1976, but only a handful of major shutdowns in which workers went without pay. Until now, the longest one had been a 21-day shutdown starting in December 1995, amid a deadlock between then-President Bill Clinton and congressional Republicans.\\n\\nThe current closure had only marginal impact on the general public at first, when many people were on vacation for the holidays and government offices were closed anyway. But as the shutdown drags on with no obvious end in sight, Americans are growing more aware and more annoyed by the disruption. More than four in 10 Americans now consider the partial shutdown a very serious problem, according to a HuffPost/YouGov poll conducted Jan. 4 to 7.\\n\\nThe Trump administration has tried to mitigate some of the most noticeable effects of the shutdown to avoid public backlash. For instance, the National Park Service kept many parks open but with reduced staff, leading to piled-up trash and damaged vegetation in parks like Joshua Tree.\\n\\nWith the shutdown bleeding into tax season, the Internal Revenue Service is calling some employees back from furlough in order to process refunds after a change in policy from the White House. And the Agriculture Department announced a complicated plan to continue food assistance for the poor into February, to keep people fed and avoid further economic damage.\\n\\nGovernment shutdowns are costly affairs. Federal agencies must spend time and energy developing contingency plans in the runup to a closure, then have to make up missed work once the government finally reopens. As the messy situation in national parks has demonstrated, the government's work does not stop just because funds haven't been appropriated for that work. Agencies will face a backlog of responsibilities to handle once they are fully operational again.\\n\\nShutdowns can also hurt the broader economy, as workers tighten their budgets due to missed paychecks and consumer confidence dampens. The Bureau of Economic Analysis estimated that the 2013 shutdown of 16 days reduced GDP for the fourth quarter of that year by 0.3 percentage points.\\n\\nCongress has already appropriated funding for roughly three-quarters of the federal government, leaving many agencies unaffected by the shutdown. House Democrats, who assumed the majority last week, passed bills that would reopen shuttered agencies other than DHS, which is at the center of the funding dispute. But Republican leaders in the Senate have refused to take up those bills and stood alongside the president, who threatened to veto any legislation without full wall funding.\\n\\nThe House and Senate approved a bill to pay all federal employees who have been missing paychecks, including those who were furloughed. But Trump still has to sign the bill. If he does, the workers would not receive any pay until the government reopens and payroll is processed.\\n\\nMeanwhile, workers must still figure out how to pay their bills without a regular paycheck. Many are turning to interest-free loans or applying for unemployment benefits, which workers must return if they eventually receive backpay.\\n\\nTrump's threat that the shutdown could go on for years rattled many workers unsure of how they'll cover their mortgage and car payments. The shutdown is a particularly raw deal for employees working under federal contracts, as they are not directly employed by the government and typically don't get backpay.\\n\\nSome days I just want to sit and cry. But I have to stay positive for my children. DeCarann Speaks, wife or a border patrol agent working without pay\\n\\nOne such worker is Larry Howard, a 62-year-old guest services associate at the National Zoo in Washington. The zoo is part of the sprawling Smithsonian network, which closed on Jan. 2 as a result of the shutdown. Howard said he is employed by a non-profit contractor, the Friends of the National Zoo, earning $13.50 per hour in his part-time position. His last payday was Jan. 4, and he doesn't expect to receive a check next week as he normally would.\\n\\nHoward had to ask his landlord for leniency on his January rent, paying only $400 of the $800. He also asked for more time to pay his electric bill ― an indignity he says he shouldn't have to suffer.\\n\\nThe way this situation is, there's no other choice but try to persuade them that they'll get that money ... when I can get it to them, said Howard, who is an activist with Good Jobs Nation, a union-backed group pushing for higher pay for federal contractors. It's just ridiculous that people have to suffer and go through hardship and be stressed out.\\n\\nSome Democrats are supporting a bill that would provide backpay for people like Howard who work under federal contracts and lost wages because of the shutdown. Such a bill has not made it into law in the past. I hope that Congress will step up to the plate and pass some kind of bill for the contractors who aren't getting anything, Howard said.\\n\\nSpeaks, whose husband works for the Border Patrol along the U.S.-Canadian border, said both she and her husband have student loans to repay. She recently earned a degree in medical assisting and her loan repayments began just before the new year, right around the time her husband received his last paycheck.\\n\\nFor now, they are getting by on Speaks' salary at her hospital. Although their two children are just 8 and 9 years old, They understand that we have to budget really well right now, Speaks said. The family halted their Netflix and Hulu subscriptions and put other non-necessities on hiatus, including a 10-year anniversary trip planned for this year.\\n\\nSpeaks said she found it particularly galling that members of Congress continue to get paid as federal employees work with their paychecks on hold.\\n\\nI just really wish they would focus on the people they're affecting, Speaks said. Workers like her husband and his colleagues are out there risking their lives, she added, and they're not getting paid. It's not fair."}

But many of those heads, once likely to be thrown back in dismay, are now bestowing nods of approval.\\n\\nGone is the pugnacious partisanship and populist rhetoric that opponents once used to compare Ford to U.S. President Donald Trump. The premier's regular briefings have instead drawn widespread plaudits for their calm, collegial tone as well as their comparatively progressive content.\\n\\nSuch an approach, political observers say, differs not only from that demonstrated by like-minded politicians south of the border but from his own past conduct.\\n\\nChris Young/ The Canadian Press Ontario Premier Doug Ford holds a bottle of hand sanitizer at the Ontario Legislature, in Toronto on March 28, 2020.\\n\\nI'm a Liberal, but I'll give Doug Ford a lot of credit — he's handling this really well, said Dan Moulton, vice-president at Crestview Strategy and former senior staff member in the previous Liberal government. He's being transparent, responsive, engaging. Ontarians are really seeing him in action.\\n\\nPraise from the centre or left of the spectrum has been rare through Ford's unorthodox and colourful political career.\\n\\nDuring his time as Toronto city councillor, Ford drew heavily on his experience running the family label-making business and his well-honed populist instincts to carve out a reputation for staunch conservatism and straight talk.\\n\\nThose traits remained on full display when he became premier in June 2018 and throughout a tumultuous first year in office that saw his Progressive Conservative government reverse course on a host of core policies and promises.\\n\\nFord was rarely conciliatory, whether discussing hydro rates, environmental policy or labour negotiations with Ontario teachers.\\n\\nChris Young/ The Canadian Press Ontario Premier Doug Ford is pictured during a press briefing in Toronto, on March 28, 2020.\\n\\nHe arbitrarily slashed the size of Toronto city council half-way through a municipal election campaign, then threatened to invoke the rarely used notwithstanding clause to overturn a court decision that found his actions unconstitutional. The case will now be heard by the Supreme Court of Canada.\\n\\nHe led a coalition of provincial premiers who took the federal government to court over its carbon tax and rarely missed an opportunity to level partisan broadsides at real or perceived political foes.\\n\\nAll that changed earlier this month, and Ford's near-daily public appearances during the COVID-19 crisis have been free from political attacks.\\n\\nIn an interview with The Canadian Press, Ford said unprecedented times called for a fresh approach.\\n\\nWe put differences aside and we moved together because people expect that, Ford said of his current, friendly relationship with federal and municipal officials.\\n\\nFord's reference to the will of the people is more familiar to political analysts, as is the clear communication style that's characterized most of his speeches since the pandemic took hold and prompted him to be among the first provincial leaders to declare a state of emergency.\\n\\nChris Young/ The Canadian Press Ontario Premier Doug Ford talks about small business suppliers in Toronto on March 28, 2020.\\n\\nPolitical communications consultant Tim Abray said clear messaging has long been one of Ford's political strengths, noting that aspect of his performance to date has not come as a surprise.\\n\\nMore striking, he said, has been Ford's willingness to give equal prominence to credible scientists and public health officials, ensuring reliable information is readily available in one of the provinces hardest hit by the outbreak.\\n\\nMoulton agreed, crediting Ford for showcasing some of his strongest cabinet performers during a slew of multibillion-dollar spending announcements made to safeguard the province during the pandemic.\\n\\nSome trademark measures remain, such as significant corporate tax breaks, and Ford's populist appeal was on full display during a recent, impassioned rant against a high-end store selling disinfectant wipes for $30.\\n\\nBut the new announcements have also included measures that depart radically from his government's usual agenda, such as boosting income for some poor residents and jettisoning the party's oft-stated goal of balancing the province's books.\\n\\nThe approach has not gone unnoticed, even drawing praise from traditional political adversaries well outside of Ontario.\\n\\nWhile I can't say I have historically been a fan of [Ford,] I have to say he is doing an incredible job on the COVID-19 file, wrote B.C. Green party Leader Andrew Weaver on Twitter. He has shown strong, decisive and compassionate leadership at a critical moment in Ontario's history.\\n\\nSuch praise marks a reversal for Ford, whose popularity had plummeted to new lows in the months preceding the outbreak.\\n\\nThe main thing that has been driving the animosity around this government is an apparent lack, during normal times, of the ability to listen to non-aligned voices, Abray said, noting Ford has previously demonstrated an ability to adjust his position in the face of new information. What I think he's done is he's stepped up and is behaving more like Doug Ford the person rather than Doug Ford the partisan Tory.\\n\\nFord, for his part, said the experience of steering Ontario through the pandemic has produced lessons that will be applied once the crisis passes.\\n\\nThere are so many things that we can agree on, he said There's so much opportunity for governments to get a lot more done if we all work together."}

{"original": "Around two million students in the class of 2018 have taken the SAT, according to the College Board. Miami high school senior Kamilah Campbell was one of them.\\n\\nLike many students, Campbell took the test more than once in an effort to improve her scores. While she scored a 900 the first time she took it, she improved her score by 330 to 1230, a score high enough to earn a scholarship for students graduating from Florida high schools. But rather than celebrating, Campbell has been battling the Educational Testing Service (ETS), a nonprofit organization that administers the SAT on behalf of the College Board.\\n\\nAccording to a letter that ETS sent to Campbell, the organization flagged her new scores due to the increase and substantial agreement between...answers on one or more scored sections of the test and those of other test takers. The testing company notified her it intends to cancel her scores and has not released her score reports, which meant she was unable to submit her higher scores in time to apply for her top-choice college, Florida State University (FSU).\\n\\nThe letter noted that Campbell had one opportunity to send us any information that addresses our concerns, after which a review board would decide whether there is substantial evidence to question your test scores. If the board concluded the evidence showed irregularities, she would have the option of canceling her scores herself, retaking the test to prove her scores, or pursuing arbitration. Instead, Campbell found civil rights attorney Ben Crump, who has subsequently sent a letter to ETS requesting that her scores be released within 14 days.\\n\\nStudents of color, and in particular low-income students, already face an uphill battle on college admissions tests that have a long history of implicit bias. And it poses an additional barrier to higher education even for students who have done everything their college counselors have told them to do, like taking a standardized test earlier in high school to establish a baseline result.\\n\\nStudents of color, and in particular low-income students, already face an uphill battle on college admissions tests that have a long history of implicit bias.\\n\\nThe process ETS has initiated in Campbell's case subverts due process: Rather than putting the onus on the testing bodies to prove that students cheated, it requires students to prove that they didn't.\\n\\nAccording to an email from the College Board, out of 2 [million] students in the class of 2018, close to 2,000 SAT students' scores were flagged for further review. Another 1.9 million students in the class of 2018 took the ACT, the SAT's main competitor. While the ACT doesn't release statistics about flagged scores, its policies and procedures regarding testing irregularities are similar to those of the SAT.\\n\\nNeither ACT nor SAT needs hard evidence that a student has cheated to cancel a student's scores. A document detailing procedures for investigating questioned scores notes that ACT reserves the right to cancel test scores when there is reason to believe that scores are invalid. Proof of misconduct is not required to cancel scores. In other words, testing agencies can cancel scores even if a student didn't actually cheat.\\n\\nThe blame doesn't rest entirely on the standardized testing companies, however; the vast majority of higher education institutions rely on high stakes tests for admissions purposes. While standardized tests do provide a metric to measure student achievement across a range of high school contexts, a growing body of research has shown that they are a better predictor of where students live than of what they know.\\n\\nIn response to the limited uses of standardized tests, more than 1,000 higher education institutions have already adopted test-optional policies. Research has shown that universities that allow students to choose whether or not to submit their scores have the same graduation rates and are able to recruit more diverse student bodies. Test-optional policies, would provide an alternative for the thousands of other students whose standardized scores, like Campbell's, are called into question every year.\\n\\nRather than putting the onus on the testing bodies to prove that students cheated, it requires students to prove that they didn't.\\n\\nBut Abby Kuhnell, a high school senior in Walton, Kentucky, received a letter from ACT in August 2018 invalidating scores from tests she had taken in December 2017 and March 2018 ― scores she had used in her application to Morehead State University, which awarded her $32,000 in scholarships based on her 3.8 GPA and test scores.\\n\\nKuhnell had taken the test twice as a sophomore, scoring a 16 and 17 composite score, respectively, out of 36 possible points. After participating in an intensive ACT boot camp offered to all juniors at her high school, Kuhnell improved her scores on two subsequent sittings to 28 and 26. In its letter, the ACT said its decision was based on unusual response similarities with another examinee, seating proximity, mathematics computation and an unusual score increase.\\n\\nThe process of how questionable scores are flagged is opaque, and often based on statistical analysis that is hard for students and families to parse. Many students, like Kuhnell, are unaware that it's even possible for their scores to be invalidated in the absence of blatant cheating. I didn't know that canceling scores is an actual thing, Kuhnell said. Me and my mom both thought it was a joke. Nobody's ever said anything about it.\\n\\nKuhnell was surprised, but not worried, when she received the initial letter from ACT. She thought the investigation would be closed after she submitted a letter explaining that she had taken test prep classes at her high school, which accounted for the score increase. When ACT sent her a second letter stating it was proceeding with the cancellation, Kuhnell chose to take an independent retest to confirm her 28 and 26 rather than pursue arbitration, a process her family believed would be too expensive.\\n\\nI didn't know that canceling scores is an actual thing. Me and my mom both thought it was a joke. Abby Kuhnell\\n\\nFor Kuhnell, the process has had very real consequences. When she took the retest, she needed to earn at least a 23 in order for her 26 to stand. She earned a 22 ― only one point off ― and her higher scores were canceled. As a result, she says, her $8,000 per year scholarship was reduced to around $1,500.\\n\\nStudents like Campbell and Kuhnell feel like they're being punished for working hard to improve their scores. When they defend themselves, they receive the implicit message that they are not good enough ― a message that the millions of students who struggle with standardized tests have already received. The result is that our college campuses are less diverse than they might be and disparities in access to higher education are perpetuated.\\n\\nOf course, we must take test security seriously and ensure the legitimacy of scores. But the current process of how scores are flagged and investigated needs to be more transparent. Kuhnell said the whole process made her feel like the ACT were not only questioning her scores, but also her character and integrity. It makes you feel bad about yourself, she said. When you're being questioned on something this big, it makes you feel like crap.\\n\\nCharlotte West is a Seattle- and Denver-based freelance journalist who covers education, housing policy, juvenile justice and politics."}
{"original": "When Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez was sworn in to Congress, she wore a suit of suffragette white. Fashion was an important part of the suffragette movement, a way to push back against stereotypes of women who sought liberation as unfashionable and unattractive. White clothing symbolized the purity of their motives.\\n\\nOcasio-Cortez's other sartorial choices ― bright-red lipstick and hoop earrings ― were worn, she said, in homage to Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who was advised to appear at her confirmation hearing with neutral-colored nail polish, and had refused, keeping her red.\\n\\nWatching Ocasio-Cortez being sworn in, I couldn't help but think of a similar outfit ― an all-white pantsuit ― worn by Hillary Clinton, when she officially became the Democratic nominee for president in 2016. Like Ocasio-Cortez, Clinton intentionally set out to echo the suffragettes' struggle for the vote, and to imbue her clothing choice with an appropriate nod to the historical significance of her achievement.\\n\\nASSOCIATED PRESS Hillary Clinton takes the stage at the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia on July 28, 2016.\\n\\nThis week, it was thrilling to watch a new class of House members sworn in, a class that contained more women, a substantial minority of whom were women of color, than ever before in United States history. Nancy Pelosi retook the gavel of the speakership. The unprecedented diversity of the Democratic freshman class was unmissable. Detroit's Rashida Tlaib inspired Palestinian-Americans to exult on social media by wearing a traditional thobe, and Ilhan Omar, the first Somali-American in Congress, matched an elegant black hijab with a black manicure.\\n\\nThis isn't just an idle fixation on fashion, a legislative who-wore-it-best. These outfits were selected with evident attention to historical detail, cultural resonance and symbolism. Ocasio-Cortez and others have used historical detail as inspiration for sartorial choices to intentionally echo women who came before them, women who strove for power and attained it. It's a concrete manifestation of the way representation in the halls of power inspires future generations of leaders. Women in power provide visible, compelling encouragement to other women. They are the evidence, our well-dressed and symbolically accessorized proof, that achieving power is possible.\\n\\nWatching Congress edge toward fuller representation of half the country's population is exhilarating. But for me, it's only created a hunger for more representation. Our nation's legislature is far from achieving gender parity. Even as the Democrats do a better job of electing leaders who look like the people they'll lead, the Republican caucus became even whiter and more male in the 2018 midterms. And as the long, long process of the 2020 election begins to rumble into being, I've found myself returning to a longing I felt acutely during the agonizing contest of 2016: I want my next president to be a woman.\\n\\nWomen in power provide visible, compelling encouragement to other women. They are the evidence, our well-dressed and symbolically accessorized proof, that achieving power is possible.\\n\\nI felt it with Clinton's candidacy: I wanted a member of my gender, for the very first time, to sit behind the Resolute Desk, to guide our nation's policy, to sign bills into law. I wanted a woman to take her place in the halls of power, and put an end to nearly 250 years of male rule.\\n\\nOver the long, hotly contested 2016 Democratic primary, I had many occasions to doubt that such a desire was valid. Clinton's candidacy sparked an unparalleled degree of animus among many on the left. Her cautious, technocratic policies and stiff mannerisms became subjects not only of mockery, but of genuine loathing.\\n\\nThe debates between Clinton's supporters and those who backed Bernie Sanders became a policy battleground, one in which my natural affinity drifted toward the eminently sensible policies of single-payer health care and free college education. But gender was the undercurrent of all those arguments, the acrid aftertaste I couldn't shake. Throughout it all, I still wanted a woman president.\\n\\nIn arguments with friends and relatives, I was made to doubt that desire again and again. Wasn't it shallow? Wasn't I a vagina voter? Wasn't it, paradoxically, sexist to consider gender in my selection of a future president?\\n\\nI've found myself returning to a longing I felt acutely during the agonizing contest of 2016: I want my next president to be a woman.\\n\\nThe arguments revolved on themselves, quickly devolving into bitter tedium. I recognized the real stakes behind the policy arguments ― the accurate diagnosis that, under Obama, progress had been too slow, and Democrats too eager to seek compromise, leaving millions bereft of health care and slipping through the cracks of a slashed social safety net.\\n\\nBut I recognized too a fierce longing in myself, a nearly wild desire to see the highest, hardest glass ceiling shattered at last. In Clinton's general election platform, the lack of ambitious, visionary policies that could measurably better the lives of Americans was palpable. But at the moment she took to the podium at the Democratic National Convention, swathed in white, standing before the nation with the force of centuries of history and longing behind her, I was struck by the undeniable power of the moment. I felt a shiver to my core.\\n\\nIn the last two years, the indignities of that deferred dream have impressed themselves on me with a vengeance. The miasmic swamp we now call our politics is not only the era of Donald Trump, whose treatment of women has always been abhorrent. It's the era of Brett Kavanaugh, with his blackout beers and the specter of sexual assault. It's an era of unrelenting assault on women's health care at home and abroad, with abortion protections hanging in the increasingly precarious balance of the Supreme Court. The near miss of the Clinton loss is all the more painful in an era of the male grotesque.\\n\\nASSOCIATED PRESS Brett Kavanaugh testifies before the Senate Judiciary Committee in September.\\n\\nAs the potential for an end to the Trump era ticks closer, female candidates for the presidency are already subjects of buzz and speculation. Elizabeth Warren has announced her candidacy and has already set out to charm the inhabitants of Sioux City, Iowa. Other potential female 2020 Democratic contenders, like Kamala Harris, Amy Klobuchar and Kirsten Gillibrand, have begun, cautiously, exploring runs.\\n\\nAnd I've found that my desire for representation has not dimmed in the slightest, despite a growing chorus of skeptical voices who wonder if a woman can beat Trump. Its return has surprised me with its ferocity. To see a female president in my lifetime is not an idle wish; it is a hunger, an insatiable desire. Watching the 116th Congress being sworn in was a swelling reminder of what it is to feel represented in my government, but it was also a reminder of how partial those gains have been, and how dear. In a country that has never been led by a woman, how can anyone claim that gender equality is at hand ― or even possible?\\n\\nI've had three years to mull over the 2016 primaries, a subject I never particularly wanted to revisit, but which has a habit of recurring in political conversation like a stench. Questions of centrist versus leftist policies remain complex, and fraught with real consequence for the lives and livelihoods of Americans. But this time, I can't be talked out of my desire for a woman president. I can't be gaslit out of it, or told it's trivial, unnecessary, too much to ask, unimportant. I know in my soul that it is important. Looking down the pale, male corridors of past power, I reflect on centuries of stymied hopes with sorrow, but I look to the future with a terrible and frightening hope in my chest.\\n\\nTalia Lavin is a writer and researcher based in Brooklyn."}
{"original": "DENVER ― Environmental activists here were dealt a blow Monday when the Colorado Supreme Court ruled against a closely watched case that would have required the state to prioritize health and environmental concerns in oil and gas permitting.\\n\\nBut with a newly Democratic legislature and governor in the state promising to take another look at the fracking debate, environmentalists are optimistic that they can pursue a successful strategy in the statehouse.\\n\\nThis decision really validates everything that we've been saying, that this state is not prioritizing public health and safety, and that regulations are not sufficient, said Anne Lee Foster of Colorado Rising, a group opposed to the hydraulic fracturing drilling technique known as fracking. We've shown that this is a real issue impacting Coloradans every day, and we're going to keep fighting until the end.\\n\\nIt's in the hands of the legislators now, she added.\\n\\nMonday's decision caps a five-year legal fight brought by six youth activists from Boulder County. The activists, led by Xiuhtezcatl Martinez, filed a petition with the state's oil and gas regulatory body in 2013 asking that new permits be suspended until a comprehensive scientific study could show that new activity would be safe. When the petition was denied, the activists sued and ultimately won a favorable decision in the Martinez case in the state's Appeals Court last spring.\\n\\nBut Monday's Supreme Court ruling overturns that interpretation, leaving existing policy in place. The state, the court found, was right to continue to interpret permits by weighing cost-effectiveness and technical feasibility against adverse effects on health and the environmental.\\n\\nThe case was closely watched along Colorado's Front Range, where the fracking boom has put wells near playgrounds, parks and schools (Extraction Oil and Gas infamously installed a fracking site just 1,360 feet from the largely minority Bella Romero Academy in Greeley.) Concerns about worsening air quality and health effects, such as increased cancer risks, have led to lawsuits and community actions, including an unsuccessful ballot measure in November to increase well setbacks, requiring that they be located at least 2,500 feet from occupied buildings.\\n\\nHelen H. Richardson via Getty Images Anti-fracking protesters in Colorado rally earlier this month for a moratorium on new oil and gas wells.\\n\\nThe advent of hydraulic fracturing ― which involves shooting pressurized liquid into shale formations ― in the early 2000s allowed companies to reach untapped reservoirs of oil and gas. Colorado now has more than 56,000 active oil and gas wells, producing more than 1.7 million cubic feet of natural gas, the sixth most in the country.\\n\\nThe oil and gas industry applauded the Martinez case decision. The ruling will continue to allow for development, while also protecting our environment, Dan Haley, president and CEO of the Colorado Oil & Gas Association, said in a statement.\\n\\nThose who filed this lawsuit have said they want to ban oil and natural gas development in Colorado, so we're happy to see the Supreme Court strike down this extreme effort and shortsighted agenda, he added.\\n\\nBut the relief may not last long. A blue wave in the November midterm elections hit Colorado especially hard, installing Democratic majorities in the statehouse and throughout the administration. New Democratic Gov. Jared Polis campaigned on giving communities a larger voice in fracking decisions, a promise he reiterated in his State of the State address last week.\\n\\nIt's time for us to take meaningful action to address the conflicts between oil-and-gas drilling operators and the neighborhoods that they impact, Polis said. We will work to make sure that every community has clean air and water. And this is a vital quality-of-life issue for Colorado families.\\n\\nIn a statement Monday, Polis said that he was disappointed in the court's ruling and that it only highlights the need to work with the Legislature and the Colorado Oil & Gas Conservation Commission to more safely develop our state's natural resources and protect our citizens from harm.\\n\\nPolis had previously pushed a number of anti-fracking ballot measures, including a 2,000-foot setback (while running for governor this year, Polis did not endorse the larger setback) and an environmental bill of rights. In a compromise with then-Gov. John Hickenlooper in 2014 that took the measures off the ballot, Polis helped create a task force to weigh local control and environmental impacts.\\n\\nCommunities in every corner of our state want to know that their health and safety are being prioritized when it comes to oil and gas operations. Democratic State House Speaker KC Becker\\n\\nActivist groups like Colorado Rising have asked Polis for a moratorium on new drilling, which is unlikely to happen, but they say they're encouraged that Democrats could reinvigorate that debate. Democrats have discussed a number of potential bills that would codify the demands of the Martinez case or give local communities more power to say no to drilling (a state Supreme Court decision in 2016 barred townships and counties from passing fracking bans). As with the 2014 commission, any new debate is likely to be closely watched by states like Texas and Pennsylvania, which are dealing with their own fracking booms.\\n\\nState House Speaker KC Becker, a Democrat from Boulder, said that the court ruling puts the decision back into the hands of lawmakers to take action, and we are committed to addressing this concern in this legislative session.\\n\\nCommunities in every corner of our state want to know that their health and safety are being prioritized when it comes to oil and gas operations, she added.\\n\\nIn an interview, Martinez, now 18, said the court ruling reaffirmed that newly elected Democrats needed to listen to community concerns. If these politicians don't recognize their responsibility to work with us and the people affected by this crisis, we'll vote you out, he said.\\n\\nEven though Colorado politicians have usually been hesitant to regulate the lucrative fossil-fuel industry, Martinez said the rising tide of health concerns should elevate the debate.\\n\\nIt's getting fucking personal. It's coming into Boulder County, where my family lives, where my little brother and my little sister go to school, Martinez said. This isn't about the environment and air and water; this is about the health of our people and protecting what we love."}
{"original": "Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) on Thursday issued a new call for action from both the president and Congress to combat the coronavirus pandemic.\\n\\nWarren, who suspended her presidential candidacy last week, had during her campaign laid out a detailed agenda that included public health measures to deal with the disease itself as well as measures to boost the economy and help people affected by the crisis in one way or another.\\n\\nThe most recent iteration, a plan she released early last week, was a proposal for $400 billion in new spending that included aid to safety net providers, paid sick leave, and a broad stimulus package.\\n\\nThe agenda was meant, in part, to showcase her abilities as a potential president. But even with that bid over, Warren remains an influential senator and, with this newly revised call to action, she hopes to influence fellow members of Congress who are hastily putting together emergency legislation, and even the White House.\\n\\nWarren also is still somebody with power to shape the presidential campaign. The new agenda includes one item that looks a lot like a message to former Vice President Joe Biden, front-runner for the Democratic nomination, about who he might be contemplating as members of a future administration.\\n\\nWhat Warren Is Proposing Now\\n\\nThe most urgent items on Warren's coronavirus agenda, which aides shared with HuffPost prior to its announcement, are for quick executive action to ramp up the federal government's public health efforts.\\n\\nThat includes making sure money from last week's emergency spending package reaches public health authorities right away, so that they can rapidly stand up testing capacity nationwide.\\n\\nIn addition, Warren wants President Donald Trump to make an official disaster declaration under what's known as the Stafford Act, which would immediately make money available to local and state agencies and clear away some bureaucratic restraints on action. Trump has resisted calls to do that, according to Politico, because he fears it would undermine his attempts to claim that the outbreak is under control and no worse than the flu.\\n\\nPublic health experts are more alarmed, in part because they fear a surge in patients with COVID-19 infections will overwhelm health care systems, creating shortages of intensive care beds, ventilators and personnel ― something that reportedly is already happening in Italy and forcing harrowing choices over who gets treatment and who doesn't.\\n\\nTo prevent that from occurring here, Warren thinks the administration should direct hospitals in affected regions to delay or cancel elective surgeries. She also wants the administration to explore ways of ramping up ventilator production, whether by guaranteeing purchases in advance from existing manufacturers or working with the Defense Department to identify new ones and then signing contracts.\\n\\nTo help the economy and the inevitably large numbers of people who will lose jobs as activity slows, Warren is renewing her calls for paid leave, enhanced unemployment benefits and funding to safety net providers. Legislation that House Democrats formally introduced Thursday and hope to pass includes many of these measures.\\n\\nBut Warren wants Congress to do more, now that the full scope of the crisis is coming into view.\\n\\nFor that reason, she is proposing several additional steps, including a call for student debt cancellation like she proposed during her campaign and a $200 monthly increase in Social Security benefits, which by helping the elderly and physically disabled would target groups especially threatened by coronavirus.\\n\\nNot all of the steps in her new agenda are strictly short term. Warren is proposing an investment of $200 billion in vaccine research and development over the coming years.\\n\\nThe features together would bring her package to around $750 billion, a sum that would have seemed eye-popping to many just a few weeks ago. But interest rates have plummeted, which most economists would say make this the ideal time to borrow large sums of money, especially for the sake of addressing a public health and economic crisis.\\n\\nThe last item in Warren's new agenda is about personnel. She says the large number of former financial industry figures in the Trump administration helps explain why its proposed economic responses to the coronavirus pandemic have focused so heavily on helping industries and not workers who might be suffering.\\n\\nBut a conspicuously worded passage in her new message, to be released on her political social media channels, says that past Democratic administrations, like Republican ones, have leaned too heavily on Wall Street veterans to provide policy advice ― and says let's hope it's the last time.\\n\\nEarlier this week, Axios reported that Biden aides thinking ahead to staff for a future administration were contemplating Jamie Dimon, the chair and CEO of JPMorgan Chase, as well as Anne Finucane, vice chair of Bank of America.\\n\\nAlthough Warren was on the list, too, the inclusion of the bank executives drew sharp rebukes from progressives who have long worried that Biden was too close to the financial industry."}
{"original": "ATLANTA, Ga. (AP) — President-elect Joe Biden on Monday told Georgia Democrats they had the power to chart the course for a generation as President Donald Trump urged Republican voters to swamp the polls ahead of runoff elections that will determine control of the U.S. Senate.\\n\\nTrump made his final-hours pitch to voters at a nighttime rally in north Georgia, where Republicans were banking on strong voter turnout Tuesday to reelect Sen. Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue and hold control of the chamber.\\n\\nBiden campaigned with Democrats Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock in Atlanta, hoping he could recreate the coalition that secured him a narrow victory in the presidential race in November.\\n\\nFolks, this is it. This is it. It's a new year, and tomorrow can be a new day for Atlanta, for Georgia and for America, Biden said at a drive-in rally. Unlike any time in my career, one state — one state — can chart the course, not just for the four years but for the next generation.\\n\\nThe stakes have drawn hundreds of millions of dollars in campaign spending to a once solidly Republican state that now finds itself as the nation's premier battleground. Biden won Georgia's 16 electoral votes by about 12,000 votes out of 5 million cast in November, though Trump continues pushing false assertions of widespread fraud that even his now-former attorney general and Georgia's Republican secretary of state — along with a litany of state and federal judges — have said did not happen.\\n\\nThe president's trip came a day after disclosure of a remarkable telephone call he made to the Georgia secretary of state over the weekend. Trump pressured Republican Brad Raffensperger to find enough votes to overturn Georgia's election results ahead of Wednesday's joint session of Congress that will certify Biden's Electoral College victory. The call highlighted how Trump has used the Georgia campaign to make clear his continued hold on Republican politics.\\n\\nAngry after the Raffensperger call, Trump floated the idea of pulling out of the rally but was persuaded to go ahead with it so he would have a chance to reiterate his claims of election fraud. Republicans were wary as to whether Trump would focus only on himself and fail to promote the two GOP candidates.\\n\\nA top Georgia election official said hours before Trump's rally that he wanted to scream after hearing audio of the president's call with Raffensperger.\\n\\nDo not self-suppress your own vote, said Gabriel Sterling, Georgia's voting system implementation manager.\\n\\nBut Trump, at the rally in Dalton, Georgia, spent much of his address on message, making an impassioned case that Loeffler's and Perdue's races were among the most important Georgia voters would ever face and made the case that the fate of our country is at stake.\\n\\nTo be sure, he also spent a fair amount of time rehashing false claims that the November election was rigged. He fumed that Republican Gov. Brian Kemp was incompetent and replayed many of the same debunked claims that he raised days ago in his call with Raffensperger.\\n\\nThe Democrats are trying to steal the White House, you cannot let them, Trump said. You just can't let them steal the U.S. Senate, you can't let it happen.\\n\\nBiden on Monday took aim at Trump's scheme by declaring that politicians cannot assert, take or seize power by undermining legitimate elections.\\n\\nBiden said he needs a Senate majority to pass legislation to combat the coronavirus, and he blasted Perdue and Loeffler as obstructionist Trump loyalists. Loeffler says she will join other Republican lawmakers in objecting to the Electoral College certification of Biden's victory by Congress on Wednesday.\\n\\nYou have two senators who think they've sworn an oath to Donald Trump, not the United States Constitution, Biden said.\\n\\nJonathan Ernst / Reuters Democratic U.S. Senate candidates Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock rallied with President-elect Joe Biden in Atlanta ahead of Tuesday's vote.\\n\\nEarlier Monday, Vice President Mike Pence told a crowd of conservative Christian voters at a campaign event in Milner, Georgia, to stop a Democratic takeover in Washington. We're going to keep Georgia, and we're going to save America, Pence said at Rock Springs Church in Milner.\\n\\nPerdue addressed the church crowd in Milner by telephone while quarantining over coronavirus exposure, claiming that the very future of our republic is on the line and declaring the duty to vote a calling from God.\\n\\nTrump amplified the sentiment, warning that Ossoff and Warnock wins would lead to a sharp leftward swing in American policy making.\\n\\nThese Senate seats are truly the last line of defense, Trump said. He added, It's really fight for our country, not a fight for Trump.\\n\\nRepublicans need just one victory to maintain Senate control and force Biden to contend with divided government. Democrats need a sweep for a 50-50 split, giving the tiebreaking vote to Vice President-elect Kamala Harris, who will succeed Pence as the Senate's presiding officer. That would give Democrats a Senate majority to go along with their control of the House and executive branch.\\n\\nBrian Snyder / Reuters Trump campaigned with Sen. Kelly Loeffler on the eve of the runoff election to decide both of Georgia's Senate seats, in Dalton, Georgia.\\n\\nPence, who will preside over Wednesday's congressional joint session, sidestepped Trump's denials Monday until a man yelled out that he must do the right thing on Jan. 6. Pence promised that we'll have our day in Congress, though he offered no details about what that might mean. Scores of Republicans in Congress have pledged to protest the Electoral College count, but Pence has no legal authority to override Biden's win.\\n\\nFacing those passions from the Republican base, Perdue, whose first Senate term expired Sunday, and Loeffler, an appointed senator trying to win her first election, have run as unabashed Trump Republicans and spent the two-month runoff blitz warning of a radical and dangerous lurch to the left.\\n\\nOssoff and Warnock have countered with warnings that a Republican Senate will stymie Biden's administration, especially on pandemic relief.\\n\\nWarnock pushed back at the deluge of Loeffler television ads casting him as a socialist. Have you noticed she hasn't even bothered to make a case, Georgia, for why you should keep her in that seat? Warnock said, speaking ahead of Biden. That's because she has no case to make.\\n\\nA closely divided Senate — with the rules still requiring 60 votes to advance major bills — lessens the prospects of sweeping legislation regardless. But a Democratic Senate would at least assure Biden an easier path for top appointees, including judges, and legitimate consideration of his legislative agenda. A Senate led by McConnell would almost certainly deny even an up-or-down vote on Biden's most ambitious plans.\\n\\nMore than 3 million Georgians already have voted. Monday's push focused on getting voters to the polls Tuesday. Democrats ran up a wide margin among 3.6 million early votes in the fall, but Republicans countered with an Election Day surge, especially in small towns and rural areas.\\n\\n___\\n\\nAmy reported from Milner, Ga.

On Monday, German media described that study and another involving human subjects. Volkswagen, BMW and Daimler, the owner of Mercedes, financed the group that commissioned the studies, according to the reports.\\n\\nThe since-dissolved European Research Group on Environment and Health in the Transport Sector commissioned the tests, which took place in Germany and the United States. According to the Times, the EUGT received all its funding from the auto companies.\\n\\nIn one of the studies, at Germany's Aachen University in 2013 and 2014, 25 human subjects were exposed to nitrogen dioxide for three straight hours once a week, over four weeks.\\n\\nThe study noted that among all nitrogen oxides, nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is the most toxic one, but that it had obtained written consent from its test subjects and was approved by the university's ethics committee.\\n\\nLike the study undertaken at Aachen University, the EUGT also commissioned an experiment that forced monkeys to inhale car exhaust in 2014, according to the Times' report.\\n\\nScott Olson via Getty Images According to The New York Times, scientists placed 10 monkeys in airtight containers and forced them to inhale fumes from a running Volkswagen Beetle.\\n\\nAt the Lovelace Respiratory Research Institute (LRRI) in Albuquerque, New Mexico, researchers reportedly placed 10 cynomolgus macaque monkeys in airtight containers and fed them fumes from a running diesel Volkswagen Beetle to compare the fumes' effects to those from a 1999 Ford diesel pickup. To keep the animals calm, researchers said they gave them cartoons to watch.\\n\\nLRRI's president and CEO, Robert W. Rubin, said in a statement to HuffPost that the study was ultimately derailed because LRRI's researchers didn't know that Volkswagen had rigged its vehicles to produce emissions that were cleaner in laboratory emissions tests than on the road ― a larger scandal that has cost the company billions and has resulted a seven-year prison sentence for a former Volkswagen executive.\\n\\nRubin said the study had in effect been compromised by Volkswagen's modified engine and it did not meet our standards for peer-reviewed publication.\\n\\nWe understood that the EUGT organization was financially supported by automobile manufacturers, but we believed the goal of the study was to advance the scientific understanding of the effects of diesel fumes on our lungs, including the effects of new vehicle technologies that are designed to produce less pollution, he said.\\n\\nHo New / Reuters The animals used in the experiment in New Mexico were cynomolgus macaque monkeys.

The German government has also spoken out against the testing.\\n\\nChristopher Berry, an attorney with the California-based nonprofit Animal Legal Defense Fund, told HuffPost on Wednesday that potential legal issues revolve around the engine used in the experiment.\\n\\nUnder the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Animal Welfare Act, researchers are required to provide a detailed report of their precise activities involving animals to the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. That means the researchers would have had to report that the engine being used in the experiment was rigged to release cleaner emissions, instead of what was reported, he said.\\n\\nDeviating from this protocol without approval would be a violation of the Animal Welfare Act, Berry said.\\n\\nThere's also the issue of the experiment appearing to have no scientific purpose since the engine was rigged to produce skewed results, he said.\\n\\nDeviating from [the] protocol without approval would be a violation of the Animal Welfare Act. Christopher Berry, attorney\\n\\nUnder the federal law, experiments using animals must make sure that there is scientific value to the experiment, Berry said. They also must prove that any pain experienced by the animal is necessary for that scientific pursuit.\\n\\nThe state law is similar, he said.\\n\\nThe New Mexico animal cruelty law prohibits inflicting unjustified injury on animals, however, while there's an exemption for animal research, that exemption does not apply if the person knowingly operated outside out of a provision in research protocol, Berry said.\\n\\nBerry said his organization ― which files lawsuits to protect animals from harm and offers free legal assistance and training to prosecutors nationwide ― is looking into the case and that more needs to be done to strengthen laws that protect animals.\\n\\nRegulatory agencies like the USDA often do nothing at all or at best give those organizations a slap on the wrist, he said.\\n\\nGoogle Maps The Lovelace Respiratory Research Institute in Albuquerque has defended its work with animals, saying it follows animal welfare laws.\\n\\nRubin defended LRRI's work with animals in a statement, saying that in addition to the lab being certified with the USDA, all of the facility's work involving animals is conducted under the supervision of an attending veterinarian to ensure compliance with the Animal Welfare Act and its regulations.\\n\\nLRRI is committed to the humane and ethical treatment of animals involved in research, he said.\\n\\nOne critic of the lab and its work, however, is Dr. Catherine Willet, director of science policy at The Humane Society of the United States, who expressed alarm not only over the experiment with the Volkswagen fumes ― which she called absolutely pointless ― but with the number of safety incidents reported at the facility in recent years.\\n\\nSince March of 2015, the facility has been written up for eight noncritical incidents and five critical incidents involving animals, including dogs, pigs and non-human primates, according to inspection reports released by the USDA and reviewed by HuffPost.\\n\\nWhen you're using somebody else's life, you need to carefully consider what it is that you're doing with that life.\\n\\nThe incidents include employees failing to report medical issues, failing to provide proper medical treatment, failing to report procedure changes to the IACUC, and a beagle getting left outside overnight. There were also incidents of primates escaping cages, primates injuring fingers in their enclosures and being given unapproved drug combinations.\\n\\nThere were also reports about instances that resulted in death:\\n\\n- In April 2016, a monkey died after the facility's staff failed to convey its health status to a clinical veterinarian in a timely manner, according to one report.\\n\\n- In March of 2016, six guinea pigs died during transportation. It was later determined that they had been left too long inside an enclosure that was too densely packed and likely had a decreased air flow.\\n\\n- In May of 2015, an unanesthetized dog was killed when its lungs were overinflated by a technician who was neither trained to do the procedure nor directed to connect the device to the animal's lungs.\\n\\nWhen you're using somebody else's life, you need to carefully consider what it is that you're doing with that life, Willet said. Especially in the case of primates that are very aware of what's happening and very aware of their suffering and their pain. There's a higher bar.\\n\\nKathleen Conlee, vice president of animal research issues for The Humane Society of the United States, echoed that assessment.\\n\\nLovelace clearly has a poor track record, she told HuffPost by email. We have continually pressed for stronger enforcement of the Animal Welfare Act. Animal suffering can't be seen as a normal cost of doing business."}

{"original": "BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI via Getty Images Sen. Bernie Sanders (left) shares a moment with Sen. Elizabeth Warren before the Democratic presidential debate in Detroit in July. The two have been co-endorsed by Common Defense.\\n\\nCommon Defense, a group representing progressive military veterans, announced Monday that it is issuing a co-endorsement of the presidential campaigns of Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.).\\n\\nThe group cited the two senators' decision to sign its pledge to end the Forever War. The pledge calls for Congress to re-assert its authority over U.S. foreign policy and take measures to bring the country's open-ended conflicts to a close, particularly in the Middle East. The group said the other major contenders in the Democratic presidential primary ― former Vice President Joe Biden; former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg; and Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) ― have not signed the pledge or met with the group's activists to discuss it.\\n\\nBoth Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders have campaigned extensively and unapologetically on bringing our fellow troops home, and have stood up for the majority of veterans despite the skepticism and smears of the hawkish foreign policy establishment and the political media who have too often been uncritical cheerleaders of these failed wars we were sent to fight, the group said in a statement.\\n\\nCommon Defense also said it was looking for presidential candidates who have a plan to enact Medicare for All and a Green New Deal.\\n\\nCommon Defense is distinct from other Democratic Party-aligned veterans groups, like VoteVets, in that it unabashedly supports the party's progressive wing. VoteVets has endorsed Buttigieg and is blanketing the airwaves in early states with ads promoting his candidacy.\\n\\nCommon Defense, by contrast, measures its strength in its ability to mobilize what it estimates as 150,000 members. The endorsement ensures its New Hampshire members will know about the group's decision ahead of the Democratic primary on Tuesday where polls show Sanders ahead.\\n\\nThe organization came into being after the 2016 election as a vehicle for veterans opposed to President Donald Trump. It subsequently became an outspoken source of calls to impeach the president, including by successfully pressuring moderate House Democrats with military or national security backgrounds to get behind impeachment.\\n\\nDual endorsements are rare in politics. But Common Defense's announcement mirrors actions taken by other progressive groups in January in response to a public spat between Sanders and Warren that the left feared would empower moderates. Democracy for America and 17 other groups launched a unity initiative ― accompanied by a smaller ad campaign ― encouraging the candidates and their supporters to set aside their differences in the interest of blocking an establishment win.\\n\\nStill, the endorsement carries proportionally greater weight for Warren, who trails Sanders and Buttigieg in New Hampshire polls and is neck and neck with Klobuchar. Up until Monday, Sanders had largely swept up a host of key progressive endorsements that Warren had also sought.\\n\\nWarren has a less-established record of opposing foreign interventionism than Sanders does.\\n\\nRather than paper over those differences, Common Defense said it was trying to represent the views of its membership. When surveyed, about 75% of its members support Sanders or Warren, but there was not a clear mandate for either candidate, according to the group.\\n\\nWhile Warren and Sanders have meaningful differences in their record and strategic approach, their supporters have much in common with each other, including a shared assessment that the status quo is broken and bold change is needed to fix it, the group said in its endorsement."}
{"original": "On the other side is political economy planning, which is to change a feature or features of the social-political environment to produce a certain movement of actors. Creating certain programs and offering benefits to something or someone is political economy planning. Firstly, a policymaker must ensure that they understand the social-political environment of their country, for each country is similar to different types of terrains. There are your actors, an established belief system, political structure, and so on. Once the terrain is understood, they must evaluate what they want to add to the terrain and what it may cause to the terrain and other terrains. There are many examples of this in The United States of America: the H-1B Visa program, the federal visa program, EB-5, and the recent move of General Electric (GE) to Boston. The H-1B program was designed to fulfill job shortages in specialized industries and it attracted numerous employees; whereas, the EB-5 attracted foreign investors by exchanging an investment in property for a fast track to a green card. Then GE was attracted to Boston because of their employees' preferences and the tax relief package it had received for relocating to Boston. But, despite the usefulness of political economy, it has it limits for it can increase investment too much to make a city unaffordable or it can place foreign workers into a tough living situation. The cost of political economy is what it does to a terrain, as previously described.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe importance of knowing both sets of tools available to policymakers can ensure that one is aware of what may be a result of certain decisions that is taken by government. In addition, this is helpful for policymakers to understand that an effective policy deals with all tools, and not solely one. A policymaker that uses economic planning and political economy planning will be able to ensure that his or her policy can be more effective because it allows one to try to manipulate certain outcomes by using history as a guidebook."}
{"original": "The term circular economy, which shows up more and more at political agendas, is precise but does not express the deep mental change that it implies. We live in a time when machines and labor are used not only to produce jeans, but also to consume them before selling. Actually, the idea of a circular economy is just the opposite. It's meant to extend the life of products and materials, thus making them 'circulate' longer in the economy and reducing the amount of raw materials and newly produced goods, as well as their environmental impact. 'The EU action plan for the Circular Economy' and the Chinese policy for a circular economy are just two examples of the proliferating initiatives in this direction.\\n\\nWalter Stahel, the Swiss architect and industrial adviser, has been since the '70s one of the fathers of the idea of a circular economy, for which he argues with a 'river and lake' metaphor. Thus far, the economy is conceived as a river, in which we should try to double the flow rate per capita every ten or twenty years no matter whether in this eternally doubling flow the content of beneficial nutrients or detrimental toxins grows faster. Instead, a circular economy would be rather like a lake. Citizens and policy makers would rather preserve and improve the quality and accessibility of this lake, without increasing the affluent and effluent river more than absolutely necessary.\\n\\nSo why does this 'economy of common sense' fail to catch on? Let's take gold as an example. Its stock above ground is estimated at 180.000 tonnes, equivalent to a cube with sides of just 21 m. A portion of the world's worked gold has been circulating for millennia, melted and re-melted into countless artifacts. Thereby, relatively little material generated a great deal of usage value over time. Another portion of the world's worked gold is instead extracted from mines, at cost of great environmental damage and consumption of energy, returning quickly back underground to the vaults of banks - producing no technical usage value.\\n\\nA further portion of the extracted gold also soon returns underground in landfills, where remains of cellphones and other devices are dumped, each containing small amounts of gold. Again, a lot of materials and energy wasted to generate very brief usage value. In its first iteration, gold is the prototype of a circular economy, yet in the second and third it's that of a linear economy.\\n\\nCurrent technologies already allow us to put an end to most of the misuse and dissipation of gold and its related environmental damage. Indeed, only our misplaced conceptions prevent us from doing just that; on the one hand, we persist in conventions that give gold an exchange value out of proportion to its technical usage value, on the other hand, in many cases, it is more 'convenient' today to dissipate gold than conserve it as a result of a tax system that discourages what is desirable (employment) and encourages what is not (the use and abuse of nature).\\n\\nIn most industrial countries, labor (which abounds and is in part underused) becomes increasingly expensive through taxation and social insurance costs. Thus we encourage replacing labor with more machines, materials and energy. Yet materials and energy (relatively scarce, thus worth saving) are lightly taxed in comparison, or even subsidized, which stimulates their use, abets joblessness (adding to social costs) and increases waste.\\n\\nIn 1976, Walter Stahel and Genevieve Reday published a report for the European Commission whose title seems a misprint: The Potential for Substituting Manpower for Energy. Hold on there. For thousands of years progress meant substituting machines for manpower, the exact opposite. This much is true. But the success of two centuries of industrial society brought about a problem of scale; human population and its material throughput reached such proportions as to turn what was real progress for billions of individuals into a collective boomerang. Today, consuming and wasting far too much material and energy compromises long-term planetary equilibrium and leads us into a new era that Earth scientists call the 'Anthropocene'; a geological epoch in which human activities began to have a significant global impact on Earth's geology and ecosystems.\\n\\n'Substituting Manpower for Energy' (Walter Stahel) doesn't mean giving up the washing machine, nor giving up technical progress. Instead, it means giving direction to progress, using ingenuity and labor to extend the life of things, rather than reduce it. This is the very purpose of The Product-Life Institute, created in 1982 in Geneva by Walter Stahel and Orio Giarini, both university professors and consultants to companies, governments and international institutions.\\n\\nPerhaps the contribution of Giarini and Stahel to the political economy is no less important than that in industrial ecology. In books such as Dialogue on wealth and welfare (1980) and The performance economy (2010), they redefine the concept of economic value; true value is found in what and how long things really perform, not in the amount of their production and commerce.\\n\\nThis simple concept was formulated by Aristotle in his distinction between oikonomia (care for the house) and chrematistics (care for money). But it was abandoned by many modern economists when the political economy seemed to become subordinated to quantitative economics; because it is difficult or impossible to directly measure the real usage of things, in its place we measure the quantity of their production and purchase.\\n\\nThis misbegotten premise shaped an economy that aims at continuously doubling both the production and destruction of things, rather than optimizing their lifecycle. Abandoning this concept of linear economy promises to instigate an actual counter-revolution. In the present terminal phase of our consumption-centred civilization, the ancient precept of caring for and preserving both nature and manufactured goods would subvert the present established disorder, while alleviating job loss and protecting the planet."}
{"original": "In a landmark infrastructure bill passed in December, Congress finally penetrated the Fed's independence by tapping its reserves and bank dividends for infrastructure funding.\\n\\nThe bill was a start. But some experts, including Congressional candidate Tim Canova, say Congress should go further and authorize funds to be issued for infrastructure directly.\\n\\nFor at least a decade, think tanks, commissions and other stakeholders have fought to get Congress to address the staggering backlog of maintenance, upkeep and improvements required to bring the nation's infrastructure into the 21st century. Countries with less in the way of assets have overtaken the U.S. in innovation and efficiency, while our dysfunctional Congress has battled endlessly over the fiscal cliff, tax reform, entitlement reform, and deficit reduction.\\n\\nBoth houses and both political parties agree that something must be done, but they have been unable to agree on where to find the funds. Republicans aren't willing to raise taxes on the rich, and Democrats aren't willing to cut social services for the poor.\\n\\nIn December 2015, however, a compromise was finally reached. On December 4, the last day the Department of Transportation was authorized to cut checks for highway and transit projects, President Obama signed a 1,300-page $305-billion transportation infrastructure bill that renewed existing highway and transit programs. According to America's civil engineers, the sum was not nearly enough for all the work that needs to be done. But the bill was nevertheless considered a landmark achievement, because Congress has not been able to agree on how to fund a long-term highway and transit bill since 2005.\\n\\nThat was one of its landmark achievements. Less publicized was where Congress would get the money: largely from the Federal Reserve and Wall Street megabanks. The deal was summarized in a December 1st Bloomberg article titled Highway Bill Compromise Would Take Money from US Banks:\\n\\nThe highway measure would be financed in part by a one-time use of Federal Reserve surplus funds and by a reduction in the 6 percent dividend that national banks receive from the Fed. . . . Banks with $10 billion or less in assets would be exempt from the cut. The Fed's surplus capital comes from the 12 reserve banks. The highway bill would allow for a one-time draw of $19 billion from the surplus, which totaled $29.3 billion as of Nov. 25. . . . Banks vigorously fought the dividend cut, which was estimated to generate about $17 billion over 10 years for the highway trust fund.\\n\\nAccording to Zachary Warmbrodt, writing in Politico in November, the Fed registered strong concerns about using the resources of the Federal Reserve to finance fiscal spending. But former Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke, who is now at the Brookings Institute, acknowledged in a blog post that the Fed could operate with little or no capital. His objection was that it is not good optics or good precedent to raid an independent central bank. It doesn't look good.\\n\\nRep. Peter DeFazio (D-Oregon), ranking member on the House Transportation Committee, retorted, For the Federal Reserve to be saying this impinges upon their integrity, etc., etc. -- you know, it's absurd. This is a body that creates money out of nothing.\\n\\nDeFazio also said, [I]f the Fed can bail out the banks and give them preferred interest rates, they can do something for the greater economy and for average Americans. So it was their time to help out a little bit.\\n\\nAn Idea Whose Time Has Come\\n\\nIt may be their time indeed. For over a century, populists and money reformers have petitioned Congress to solve its funding problems by exercising the sovereign power of government to issue money directly, through either the Federal Reserve or the Treasury.\\n\\nIn the 1860s, Abraham Lincoln issued debt-free US Notes or greenbacks to finance much of the Civil War, as well as the transcontinental railroad and the land-grant college system. In the 1890s, populists attempted unsuccessfully to revive this form of infrastructure funding. In the Great Depression, Congress authorized the issuance of several billion dollars of US Notes in the Thomas Amendment to the 1933 Agricultural Adjustment Act. In 1999, Illinois Rep. Ray LaHood introduced the State and Local Government Economic Empowerment Act (H. R. 1452), which would have authorized the US Treasury to issue interest-free loans of US Notes to state and local governments for infrastructure investment.\\n\\nLaw professor Timothy Canova plans to reintroduce this funding model if elected to represent Florida's 23rd Congressional district, where he is now running against the controversial Debbie Wasserman Schultz, current chair of the Democratic National Convention. Prof. Canova wrote in a December 2012 article:\\n\\n. . . Wall Street bankers and mainstream economists will argue that greenbacks and other such proposals would be inflationary, depreciate the dollar, tank the bond market, and bring an end to Western civilization. Yet, we've seen four years of the Federal Reserve--now on its third quantitative-easing program--experimenting with its own type of greenback program, creating new money out of thin air in the form of credits in Federal Reserve Notes to purchase trillions of dollars of bonds from big banks and hedge funds. While the value of the dollar has not collapsed and the bond market remains strong, neither have those newly created trillions trickled down to Main Street and the struggling middle classes. The most significant effect of the Fed's programs has been to prop up banks, bond prices, and the stock market, with hardly any benefit to Main Street.\\n\\nIn a January 2015 op-ed in the UK Guardian titled European Central Bank's QE Is a Missed Opportunity, Tony Pugh concurred, stating of the US and European QE programs:\\n\\nQuantitative easing, as practised by the Bank of England and the US Federal Reserve, merely flooded the financial sector with money to the benefit of bondholders. This did not create a so-called wealth affect, with a trickle-down to the real producing economy. . . . If the EU were bold enough, it could fund infrastructure or renewables projects directly through the electronic creation of money, without having to borrow. Our government has that authority, but lacks the political will. The [Confederation of British Industry] has calculated that every £1 of such expenditure would increase GDP by £2.80 through the money multiplier. The Bank of England's QE programme of £375bn was a wasted opportunity.\\n\\nAccording to IMF director Christine Lagarde, writing in The Economist in November 2015:\\n\\nIMF research shows that, in advanced economies, an increase in investment spending worth one percentage point of GDP raises the overall level of output by about 0.4% in the same year and by 1.5% four years after the spending increase.\\n\\nIn a December 2015 paper titled Recovery in the Eurozone: Using Money Creation to Stimulate the Real Economy, Frank van Lerven expanded on this research, writing:\\n\\nFor the Eurozone, statistical analysis of income and consumption patterns suggests that €100 billion of newly created money distributed to citizens would lead to an increase in GDP of around €232 billion. Using IMF fiscal multipliers, our empirical analysis further suggests that using the money to fund a €100 billion increase in public investment would reduce unemployment by approximately one million, and could be between 2.5 to 12 times more effective at stimulating GDP than current QE.\\n\\nThe Hyperinflation Myth\\n\\nThe invariable objection to exercising the government's sovereign money-creating power is that it would lead to hyperinflation, but these figures belie that assumption. If adding €100 billion for infrastructure increases GDP by €232 billion, prices should actually go down rather than up, since the supply of goods and services (GDP) would have increased more than twice as fast as demand (money). Conventional theory says that prices go up when too much money is chasing too few goods, and in this case the reverse would be true.\\n\\nIn a November 2015 editorial, the Washington Post admonished Congress for blurring the line between fiscal and monetary policy, warning, Many a banana republic . . . has come to grief using its central bank to facilitate government deficit spending. But according to Prof. Michael Hudson, who has studied hyperinflations extensively, that is not why banana republics have gotten into trouble for printing money. He observes:\\n\\nThe reality is that nearly all hyperinflations stem from a collapse of foreign exchange as a result of having to pay debt service. That was what caused Germany's hyperinflation in the 1920s, not domestic German spending. It is what caused the Argentinean and other Latin American hyperinflations in the 1980s, and Chile's hyperinflation earlier.\\n\\nPromising Possibilities\\n\\nAny encroachment on the Fed's turf is viewed by Wall Street and the mainstream media with alarm. But to people struggling with mounting bills and crumbling infrastructure, the development has promising potential. The portal to the central bank's stream of riches has been forced open, if just a crack. The trickle could one day become a flow, a mighty river of liquidity powering the engines of productivity of a vibrant economy.\\n\\nFor that to happen, however, we need an enlightened citizenry and congressional leaders willing to take up the charge; and that is what makes Prof. Tim Canova's run for Congress an exciting development."}
{"original": "Early humans believed in gods that could become angry and that bestowed or withheld favors based on the deference they were shown by humans. Humans needed to propitiate these gods, usually by sacrificing something valuable: depending on the culture, a prized heifer, a prisoner of war or one's own child.\\n\\nOne can understand why early humans held such beliefs. They were ignorant of the causes of natural disasters or of disease outbreaks. If an earthquake or epidemic occurred, someone, some agent, had to be responsible, and as these events were beyond human powers, the gods had to be responsible. And just as we can sometimes soothe the anger of a fellow human by offering a gift and asking for forgiveness, so too one could placate an angry god by the appropriate show of deference and submission.\\n\\nIn more recent times, other forms of deference have replaced ritual sacrifice (for the most part). Instead of cutting the throat of an animal, people take part in worship services, engage in prolonged prayer, or otherwise manifest their deference to a deity. But the root idea that there is a god or gods who bestow favor based on the respect or honor we show them has persisted, at least in the minds of some.\\n\\nAnd one mind in which this idea has persisted is the mind of Justice Antonin Scalia. In an address to a Catholic high school in New Orleans on Saturday, Justice Scalia stated that Americans needed to honor God because doing so was the way to ensure that God would continue to be good to the United States. Scalia specifically attributed American victories in the Revolutionary War and at the Battle of Midway to God's favor, which Americans achieved by honoring him.\\n\\nJustice Scalia is certainly not unique among Americans, and clearly not unique among humans in general, in holding that God responds with favor to those who show him deference -- and with disfavor to those who do not. Of course, this is not to say that such a belief is rational or justified. To the contrary, it seems to me that any deity who demands worship and attention doesn't deserve to be worshiped. But if some people think that supplicating a deity will increase their chances of getting what they want -- fine. This doesn't particularly concern me.\\n\\nThe problem is that Scalia interprets the supposed desire of God for worship as requiring the United States to favor religious belief as its official policy. It's not enough for individual believers to worship God as they see fit -- a right which I and most Americans are happy to acknowledge and protect. According to Scalia, the government must place its thumb on the scale and promote and advance religion over non-religion. So Scalia's God is not only a God who craves worship, he's also a God who doesn't respect freedom of conscience and he wants the government to nudge, if not compel, atheists and agnostics into becoming believers.\\n\\nNeutrality between religion and non-religion is for Scalia not only something that lacks constitutional warrant, but, disturbingly, he also maintains that such neutrality risks incurring the wrath of God or, at best, his indifference. Apparently, the United States cannot expect to prevail in any future conflicts if we show equal respect to theist and atheist alike.\\n\\nIn the past, such attitudes were used to justify the persecution of nonbelievers and religious minorities. Their lack of respect for the true god or gods endangered the community.\\n\\nI doubt if Justice Scalia favors imprisoning atheists. But it is clear that he thinks government should promote religion by school prayer, Ten Commandments monuments, nativity scenes in the courthouse, crosses planted liberally on government property, and so forth.\\n\\nMoreover, in principle, it would be difficult for Justice Scalia to criticize those who would want to take stronger measures against nonbelievers. The theocrats in Iran and Saudi Arabia also maintain that if their citizens don't honor God, they are placing their country at risk. They just have a different interpretation of what is due God by way of honor.\\n\\nSo Justice Scalia's remarks are troubling, on more than one level. Perhaps the most disturbing aspect of his remarks is his dismissal of the efforts of those American sailors and soldiers who brought about victory for the United States at Midway. I always thought that the victory of the United States in that battle was due principally to the dedication of those who worked long hours to break the Japanese codes, the skill of the commanding officers, the heroism of bomber pilots who defied withering fire to reach their targets, and the bravery and commitment of the American forces in general -- some of whom undoubtedly were atheists and many of whom were inspired by the American ideal of freedom of conscience for all. Scalia considers their efforts inconsequential compared to the whim of an insecure deity."}
{"original": "SALT LAKE CITY (AP) — After Brigham Young University two weeks ago dropped a section from its strict code of conduct that had prohibited all expressions of homosexual behavior, bisexual music major Caroline McKenzie felt newfound hope that she could stop hiding and be herself. She even went on a date with another woman.\\n\\nThat optimism was pierced this week when administrators at the university owned by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints clarified in a letter posted online Wednesday that same-sex romantic behavior was still not allowed on campus. The letter said the recent revision to what is known as the honor code didn't change the moral standards of the church or the faith's opposition to same-sex marriage.\\n\\nMcKenzie said it made her feel whiplash and that her religion was telling her she was dirty for who she is and unwanted by God. She's reassessing whether she wants to finish her studies at BYU even though she loves her professors and the education she's receiving.\\n\\nASSOCIATED PRESS Several hundred Brigham Young University students protested Friday to show their displeasure with a letter this week that clarified that same-sex romantic behavior is not allowed on campus.\\n\\nIt's psychologically damaging, said McKenzie, 23, of Kaysville, Utah. It has been a roller coaster the last couple of weeks. This last Wednesday pretty much destroyed me. It felt like I was drowning again.\\n\\nShe was one of several hundred people who protested Friday afternoon outside church headquarters in Salt Lake City to cap off a week of fury and heartbreak for LGBTQ students and their straight allies. They sang hymns and chanted have no fear, God loves queers as they held rainbow flags. They held signs that read Love one another, Jesus loves everyone and Bigotry wrapped in prayer is still bigotry.\\n\\nMcKenzie held a sign that said, My family doesn't want me, now my school? BYU is home. It referenced a lack of support from her family after she came out last summer.\\n\\nAs they chanted loudly, We're here, we're queer, we're done living in fear, many stared up at windows in the church headquarters.\\n\\nThe Utah-based religion of 16-million members worldwide has tried in the last decade to create a more welcoming environment for LGBTQ members, while adhering to its doctrinal opposition of gay marriage. The faith, widely known as the Mormon church, teaches that while being gay is not a sin, engaging in same-sex relationships is against God's commandments.\\n\\nASSOCIATED PRESS Students who attend BYU in Provo agree to adhere to the code of conduct known as the honor code, and nearly all are members of the Mormon church.\\n\\nChurch spokesman Doug Andersen said in a statement Friday: The teachings of the church and the policies of our universities are consistent with eternal principles, and seek to encourage and strengthen relationships that lead to eternal covenants made with God. The church and its leaders continue to teach that though there may be disagreement on an issue or policy, we should treat one other with love, respect and kindness.\\n\\nStudents who attend BYU in Provo, south of Salt Lake City, agree to adhere to the code of conduct known as the honor code, and nearly all are members of the church. Punishments for violations range from discipline to suspension and expulsion. The code bans other things that are common at other colleges, including drinking, beards and piercings.\\n\\nThe letter posted this week and an accompanying Q&A posted online don't provide details about what same-sex romantic behaviors are and aren't allowed. But it seems to shut the door on the idea that gay and lesbian couples will be allowed to kiss and hold hands on campus like their heterosexual classmates.\\n\\nSame-sex romantic behavior cannot lead to eternal marriage and is therefore not compatible with the principles included in the honor code, wrote Paul V. Johnson, commissioner of the church education system.\\n\\nASSOCIATED PRESS We are deserving of love and acceptance, and we are not going away, one student said.\\n\\nChurch members Joey Pierson and Luke Larsen held hands as they chanted and sang along Friday at the rally. The young couple that identify as gay are still in high school, but came out to support fellow gay Latter-day Saints who attend BYU.\\n\\nI'm tired of feeling so suppressed and not feeling the love that God wants us to feel, said Pierson, 18. It's time to show what God's love looks like and that his God is unconditional and infinite and reaches everyone, not just straight people and not just celibate gay people.\\n\\nCaloway Williams, a BYU senior who is gay, called the letter a slap in the face that he interpreted to meant his faith doesn't love or accept LGBTQ people. He called it infuriating to hear top leaders speak of their love for everyone and then see policies that don't match that principle.\\n\\nI want them to know it's not OK what they have done. These are people's lives they are messing with, said Williams, 24, of Minot, North Dakota. We are deserving of love and acceptance, and we are not going away.\\n\\nASSOCIATED PRESS The Mormon church teaches that while being gay is not a sin, engaging in same-sex relationships is against God's commandments."}

{"original": "Ridofranz via Getty Images Boys are more likely to be sexually assaulted than they are to be falsely accused of assault.\\n\\nThe U.S. Department of Education has angered women's rights advocates by proposing an overhaul of Title IX, the landmark law that has been used since the 1980s to hold schools accountable for preventing and responding to sexual violence against students.\\n\\nThe proposed changes would strip away many protections against sexual violence that students have under Title IX. Now these protections are under threat not just for college students, but for child victims in K-12 schools, too.\\n\\nWhile Title IX was intended to protect equal access to education for women and girls, it also protects the men and boys who experience the terrible consequences of sexual violence in schools, from kindergarten through college. To strip them of even these bare protections of the law does no service to boys and men.\\n\\nThe proposed new rules would make it harder to prevent that abuse from happening and harder to hold schools and perpetrators accountable when it does. They would ignore the low-level sexual misconduct like inappropriate comments or groping that research tells us is a precursor to child sexual abuse. They would also create safe spaces for abusers by limiting schools' responsibility to address sexual assaults that happen off-campus, even when a child is assaulted by a classmate or teacher. They would even interfere in the neutral, fact-finding investigative process by subjecting child victims to cross-examination by their abusers, ensuring that the process of seeking justice and support services is as traumatic as possible and discouraging victims from coming forward.\\n\\nOne in 6 men in America is a survivor of sexual assault or abuse, and 1 in 20 boys is a victim of sexual abuse.\\n\\nThe agony of male survivors stalks the halls of the schools we attended as children. It lurks in the locker rooms where we went to football camp. It haunts classrooms where after-school tutorials turned to abuse. It infests the margins of our memories, crowding out the boyhood joys of scouting, of learning or of sports with private pain. That old poison, sexual abuse, leads men and women to despair, depression, drinking and even early death.\\n\\nThe first course of the antidote to this poison is belief — belief in the victims of sexual violence, the acknowledgment of their bravery, and the understanding that they risk so much, and often stand to gain so little, by telling what has happened to them.\\n\\nThe cultural conversation that peaked during the Brett Kavanaugh confirmation fight incorrectly pitted men against women and pitted victims of sexual violence against those who, for whatever reason, believe they may one day stand wrongfully accused. Yet false sexual assault claims are no more common than false reports of other crimes, estimated at 2-10 percent of all reported assaults — and most assaults go unreported.\\n\\nA countermovement arose based on the false premise that false sexual assault claims, which are vanishingly rare, are commonplace. Now, the misinformation and fear-mongering of the #HimToo movement, which frightened parents and school leaders, has metastasized into a harmful federal policy.\\n\\nThe misinformation and fear-mongering of the #HimToo movement, which frightened parents and school leaders, has metastasized into a harmful federal policy.\\n\\nThis misguided policy shift focuses on the extremely rare instances of young men being falsely accused, rather than on the heartbreakingly common experiences of children and adults who disclose experiences of sexual violence with the virtual guarantee that someone important to them won't believe them or will add to their trauma.\\n\\nSurvivors need belief. Their healing begins with the words: I believe you. The countervailing disbelief is at the heart of these heartless Title IX changes.\\n\\nAnother thing survivors need is a fair chance at getting justice and support services when something bad happens to them at school. Is the Department of Education really concerned that there's too little sexual assault in our schools, or that it's too easy for children to find a school leader who believes them and will do the right thing? This, in an era when institutions of all kinds are discovering there's hell to pay for ignoring the truth? When as many as one-quarter of college women are sexually assaulted while in school? Twenty million men — and many, many more women and non-binary people — have been victimized by sexual violence. They don't need fewer protections. They need more.\\n\\nKeeping these protections for our nation's schoolchildren in place is our collective responsibility, and I encourage individuals and institutions to submit comments opposing the rule changes before the Jan. 28 deadline. But in particular, I appeal to the parents who are so worried about their sons facing false accusations that they are in favor of throwing out these victim protections.\\n\\nI can empathize with the many parents who have kept themselves up at night with this question: Who will believe my son if he's accused? Yet if we ignore the crisis of sexual abuse and assault in our schools, we must be prepared to ask ourselves the more tragic question: Who will believe my son if he's the one who gets hurt?\\n\\nBlake Warenik serves as director of communications at National Children's Alliance, the nation's largest network of care centers for child victims of abuse.\\n\\nCORRECTION: A previous version of this story misstated the deadline for submitting comments opposing the rule change.

{"original": "Alex Wong via Getty Images Former Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen is one of the world's most well-known female economists. More women are needed in the field.\\n\\nWomen are missing from economics.\\n\\nWomen make up only 14 percent of full professors in U.S. economics departments. In stark contrast to other social sciences where women typically receive over 60 percent of doctoral degrees, women in economics receive only 35 percent of doctorates.\\n\\nWomen have made significant progress in certain STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) fields, traditionally dominated by men. But economics is not one of them. Startlingly, evidence suggests little progress in bringing women into economics since 2000.\\n\\nSo why does the gender makeup of economists really matter? Would we have more information on the global social impacts of climate change, the root causes of income inequality, and solutions to the gender wage gap if economics were more gender balanced? Might policy questions have been asked or answered differently if more women were economists?\\n\\nThose advocating for gender parity presume that women economists need to be included when research is being conducted and when policy is being debated because they bring a different perspective than men.\\n\\nAs economists, my co-authors and I decided to test this theory. The results show that there are indeed differences in the views of similarly trained male and female economists in both the European Union and in the United States.\\n\\nWomen economists, for example, are more likely to favor government intervention over market solutions. Male economists not only show a greater willingness to rely on markets, they are more likely to see problems from interfering with them.\\n\\nThese differences in views were evident across many policy areas ― on drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, calls to make employers provide health insurance, and income inequality.\\n\\nJoe Raedle via Getty Images Woman marching for equal pay in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, last year.\\n\\nPerhaps not surprisingly, large differences existed in views between male and female economists on matters of gender equality in the labor market. Where men saw issues such as the gender wage gap as largely a case of skills and choice, women were more likely to view outcomes as the result of unequal opportunities.\\n\\nWe begin to see how these differences in views may help influence gender imbalance in economics ― imbalances that are prevalent in universities throughout the world.\\n\\nIf men are the majority of full professors (and they are), younger female academics may find it harder to have their research seen as valuable. If men are the majority of editors of economics journals (and they really are), it is not difficult to understand why, as Erin Hengel has shown, in some of the top journals in economics, it takes women six months longer to go through the review process for publishing in some of the top economics journals. The imbalance also may be a reason why the research topics of women economists don't appeal to those male editors.\\n\\nMore importantly perhaps, we can begin to understand what these gender imbalances in economic research mean for how economic decisions are influenced and made.\\n\\nOf course, even acknowledging the barriers to women's progress in economics, some may be convinced that the arc of history will eventually bring more women into the discipline, along with younger male economists more open to diversity. Unfortunately, there is growing reason to question that assumption.\\n\\nAs Alice Wu's analysis of the Economics Job Market Rumors forum ― a site to discuss jobs in the sector ­― demonstrates, some of the biases that have contributed to the gender imbalance appear alive and well among those entering the profession.\\n\\nWu looked at more than a million anonymous online posts, and what she found paints a disturbing portrait of attitudes that persist at least in some corners of the economics profession. Where users were likely to describe men with words related to academia or their profession ― such as adviser or mathematician ― when it came to women, users focused on appearance, using words like hotter or gorgeous.\\n\\nThe profession must understand that the lack of gender parity in economics is a systemic problem that will not fix itself.\\n\\nThis snapshot of misogyny unfortunately rings uncannily true for a number of women in the field, as well as young women considering whether to make economics their life's work.\\n\\nThe governing board of the American Economic Association, at its January meeting, responded to the issues raised by the job forum and there is some movement afoot to deal with the challenges presented by this disrespectful discourse.\\n\\nBut leaders in the profession and economists throughout the world must begin to reflect upon the many factors that have produced the gender imbalance and how to address it constructively.\\n\\nThe profession must understand that the lack of gender parity in economics is a systemic problem that will not fix itself.\\n\\nAnn Mari May is professor of economics at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln.\\n\\nFor more content and to be part of the 'This New World' community, join our Facebook Group.\\n\\nHuffPost's 'This New World' series is funded by Partners for a New Economy and the Kendeda Fund.

{"original": "As he promised, President Joe Biden spent the first day of his term walking back Donald Trump's legacy and establishing a new order through a flurry of executive actions.\\n\\nHe signed 17 in total, more than half of which reversed a Trump-era policy. Here is the full list:\\n\\nThe 100 Days Masking Challenge\\n\\nIn a 180-degree pivot from Trump's dismissal of the most basic coronavirus safety measures, Biden is asking all Americans to commit to 100 days of mask-wearing. While Biden doesn't have the power to mandate such a thing at the state or local level, this executive action will require masks and social distancing in all federal buildings and lands and by all federal contractors.\\n\\nStopping the withdrawal from WHO\\n\\nBiden is halting the U.S. withdrawal from the World Health Organization, which Trump was in the middle of doing. The former president had announced those plans in May, baselessly accusing WHO of inadequately responding to the coronavirus because China has total control over the organization.\\n\\nCentralizing COVID-19 roles\\n\\nBiden is creating an official COVID-19 response coordinator, who will report to the president on vaccines, testing and other responses to the pandemic. The president has appointed Jeff Zients, who was overseeing the presidential transition team's coronavirus plans, for the role. Biden is also reestablishing an Obama-era position called the directorate for global health security and biodefense, which was first created in the wake of the 2014 Ebola epidemic. Trump had divided the duties of that role among other positions.\\n\\nExtending eviction and foreclosure moratorium\\n\\nThis action extends the current moratorium on evictions and foreclosures through at least March 31, ensuring protections for Americans at risk of losing their homes during the pandemic.\\n\\nExtending pause on student loan payments\\n\\nSimilar to the eviction and foreclosure moratorium, Biden is extending the existing pause on student loan payments through at least Sept. 30.\\n\\nRejoining the Paris climate accord\\n\\nMaking good on one of his biggest campaign promises, Biden is reentering the U.S. into the 2016 Paris Agreement, which the climate-change-denying Trump pulled the country out of in 2017. The U.S. will become a formal party to the global negotiations in about a month, once again joining virtually every other country on the planet in the commitment to cut greenhouse gas emissions.\\n\\nCanceling the Keystone XL pipeline permit\\n\\nBiden is pulling permits from the Keystone XL pipeline, a highly controversial oil pipeline system rejected by former President Barack Obama but brought back to life by Trump. By pulling the permits on the 1,200-mile fossil fuel infrastructure project, Biden is effectively killing the plans.\\n\\nRescinding the 1776 Commission\\n\\nBiden is pulling the plug on Trump's 1776 Commission, a highly controversial panel he established last fall in response to Black Lives Matter demonstrations across the U.S. The commission purported to promote a patriotic education but was widely panned by historians as presenting a pseudo-historical take on America's racist past and erasing truths about slavery and the civil rights movement, all in the name of propping up Trump's own agenda.\\n\\nThis action is also tasking the Office of Management and Budget with analyzing whether federal money is equitably distributed across communities of color.\\n\\nWorkplace protections for LGBTQ people\\n\\nThis action will ban workplace discrimination based on a person's sexual orientation or gender identity. This is a sharp pivot from Trump's administration, which had pushed the Supreme Court to rule that gay and transgender employees were not covered by Title VII.\\n\\nFortifying DACA protections\\n\\nBiden is ordering his cabinet to ensure that the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) policy will stay put. DACA, which is intended to protect people who arrived in the U.S. as children from deportation, has been one of Trump's targets since 2017. Now, Biden is asking Congress to adopt legislation giving DACA recipients permanent legal status and a path to citizenship.\\n\\nUndoing Trump's Muslim ban\\n\\nBiden has axed the so-called Muslim ban or travel ban, one of Trump's earliest policies from January 2017 that banned foreign nationals from seven Muslim-majority countries from entry into the U.S. The Supreme Court upheld a very stripped-down version of it in 2018.\\n\\nReversing Trump's immigration enforcement rules\\n\\nThe Biden administration is ending Trump's policy of prioritizing the deportation of all undocumented immigrants in the U.S. and strictly enforcing that through Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Biden's team said it instead will set civil immigration enforcement policies that best protect the American people and are in line with our values and priorities.\\n\\nStopping border wall construction\\n\\nThe border wall along Mexico was one of Trump's biggest and most expensive campaign promises, but all plans for its construction are done under Biden. He is ending the national emergency Trump declared in order to divert money to the project.\\n\\nExtending protections for Liberians\\n\\nBiden is extending temporary protection from deportation for Liberians under the Deferred Enforced Departure (DED) program until June 30, 2022. Trump had been threatening to end the program, which around 4,000 Liberians have been relying on following civil war in their country.\\n\\nRequiring noncitizens in the Census\\n\\nIn a reversal from a policy Trump initiated last summer, Biden is requiring noncitizens to be counted in the U.S. Census, which affects how federal money is allocated across the country.\\n\\nEthics pledge for executive branch employees\\n\\nExecutive branch employees under Biden will be required to sign an ethics pledge and vow to to uphold the independence of the Department of Justice.\\n\\nReversing Trump's regulatory approval process\\n\\nBiden is rolling back Trump's rules for establishing new regulations, tasking the Office of Management and Budget to improve the regulatory review process and putting a freeze on regulations until his administration has time to review any that Trump enacted during his last days in office.\\n\\nRead live updates on Biden's inauguration below.

{"original": "By the end of election week in November, Democrats' hopes of winning a sizable majority in the U.S. Senate had fallen apart. But the party's operatives had already started developing their plan to squeeze out enough seats to win control.\\n\\nLosses in Maine and North Carolina meant Democrats needed to sweep two runoff races in Georgia to reach the 50 seats required to control Congress' upper chamber, with Vice President-elect Kamala Harris breaking ties. Their hopes rested on two candidates ― Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock ― defying historical trends in Georgia and mounting a comeback after GOP candidates earned more votes in both races in November.\\n\\nBoth campaigns and the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee knew pulling off the upsets would demand the type of massive ground game Democrats had eschewed during the pandemic era. Christie Roberts, a senior adviser at the DSCC, had begun searching for an operative to run a unified field operation even before Election Day. It was one of the crucial shifts the party made before the two-month runoff campaign that proved essential to Warnock and Ossoff's victories in elections that saw record-breaking turnout.\\n\\nSome of these changes were relatively minor. Ossoff's campaign, for example, opened a TikTok account after Democrats largely avoided the platform because of security concerns during the regular election. But other actions amounted to significant shifts.\\n\\nIn television ads, Democrats doubled down on a corruption argument against GOP Sens. Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue that the party largely avoided making against President Donald Trump. And the return of coronavirus relief to the news helped the party develop a sharper, more specific economic message focused on winning larger relief checks for voters.\\n\\nThe 50-seat Senate majority may not be enough to fulfill Democratic policy dreams, but it will allow President-elect Joe Biden to quickly fill his Cabinet and push through judges. It also gives hope for liberal action on coronavirus relief, health care, climate change and other key issues.\\n\\nChecks And Corruption\\n\\nA few days before the election, Warnock was campaigning in the small city of Valdosta and had a question for people inside dozens of cars assembled to hear his socially distanced speech.\\n\\nDid you see them playing games with the $2,000 stimulus relief this week? Warnock asked to a chorus of horn honks. I mean, people are facing eviction. Folks are feeling pain. They've waited for relief for months.\\n\\nBoth Ossoff and Warnock had long pushed for an additional coronavirus relief package, and Ossoff had focused on Perdue's opposition to direct aid for individuals. But in the final weeks of the race, Democrats from Biden on down united behind pushing for bigger checks, while Republicans were split as Congress negotiated another round of relief.\\n\\nAt the same time, Democrats were continuing to hammer both Loeffler and Perdue for their stock-trading scandals, with Ossoff dubbing them the Bonnie and Clyde of political corruption. The message worked, particularly when paired with spotlighting the GOP's stance on coronavirus relief.\\n\\nPolling from Senate Majority PAC, the main super PAC backing Senate Democrats, found only 22% of Georgia voters believed the COVID relief package that included $600 checks did enough to help the country. Voters seemed to blame Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell: His approval rating among Republicans in the state slipped from 70% in November to just 57% on Dec. 29.\\n\\nAs COVID-19 raged and Georgia's small businesses went under, Democratic candidates Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock owned the economic message of putting money in people's pockets, Senate Majority PAC President J.B. Poersch wrote in a memo to donors obtained by HuffPost. This was the perfect contrast to the corrupt GOP ticket, which saw a tidal wave of negative news that we hammered in ads.\\n\\nAn Unprecedented Ground Operation\\n\\nBy Election Day, the Georgia Democratic Party had hired Jonae Wartel, a native of the state who had been working for LeBron James' More Than A Vote advocacy group, to run the ground operation. Roberts and Lauren Passalacqua, the DSCC's communications director, both settled in Atlanta for the runoff campaign.\\n\\nI can't overstate as an operative how hard it is to scale up a field program of this size in such a condensed time period, Roberts said.\\n\\nThe party quickly made a crucial decision. Rather than pursue swing voters, they would focus on turning out the Democratic base, especially Black voters. The choice wasn't obvious. There were roughly 100,000 voters, mostly in the Atlanta suburbs, who cast ballots for Biden and Purdue in November. But knowing Republicans had roughly 300,000 more high-propensity voters in the state than Democrats, the campaigns wagered their best bet was to fire up Black turnout.\\n\\nThere, they had some significant outside help. A coalition of liberal groups and unions teamed up to spend tens of millions of dollars and make more than 10 million door knocks, and succeeded in contacting 93% of the 3.1 million voters targeted. The effort was led by BlackPAC (4.9 million door knocks), the labor union UNITE HERE (1.6 million) and the Stacy Abrams-founded New Georgia Project (1.3 million). Another member of the coalition, the Latinx advocacy group Mijente, knocked on the door of every registered Latino voter in Georgia.\\n\\nI believe this was one of the largest independent expenditure efforts ever, said Adrianne Shropshire, BlackPAC's executive director.\\n\\nElijah Nouvelage / Reuters Campaign ads for Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock are seen on a wall near the John Lewis mural the day after the U.S. Senate runoff elections in Atlanta.\\n\\nSome of the efforts were innovative. Ossoff's team hired 2,000 mostly young, mostly Black community organizers to reach out to their personal social networks and encourage people to vote. BlackPAC enlisted more than 2,500 businesses across the state ― including ice cream shops and hair salons ― to distribute literature to their customers.\\n\\nRepublicans countered with their own massive ground game, with the National Republican Senatorial Committee hiring 1,000 field organizers. While Republican turnout in the runoff also was high, it lagged behind Democrats in some crucial conservative areas. But GOP operatives said Trump's refusal to accept the election results limited their ability to portray the race as an essential check on Democratic control of Washington.\\n\\nBoth sides saw relatively little hope of persuading voters after tens of millions of dollars had already been spent on television advertising in the general election. Ossoff's campaign tested more than a dozen negative messages about Perdue, and a dozen negative messages they thought the Republican would deploy against Ossoff. None had a significant impact on the electorate.\\n\\nThe mobilization effort paid off. Turnout among Black voters jumped across the state, from Atlanta to smaller cities like Savannah to rural counties with large Black populations in the state's southwest, after lagging behind other groups during the general election. It was the major reason Warnock and Ossoff were able to improve on Biden's performance from November.\\n\\nSenate Republican operatives have pointed to Trump's refusal to accept the election results as a major reason for Warnock's and Ossoff's victories, saying it limited conservative faith in the election and deprived them of arguing Loeffler and Perdue's victories were necessary to prevent unified Democratic control of Washington.\\n\\nBut an analysis from UNITE HERE argues it was high Democratic turnout ― not low GOP turnout ― that determined the election. Georgia has more high-propensity GOP voters than Democratic voters, but there are more more medium-propensity Democratic voters. As turnout rises in the state, the memo argues, Democrats become more and more likely to win.\\n\\nRepublican turnout was not 'suppressed,' the union wrote. To the contrary, low-propensity Republicans turned out at a higher rate than low-propensity Democrats. There just weren't enough Republicans to win."}

Of course, parents were concerned and outraged over the faulty YouTube filters, a long-time problem that finally prompted the company to roll out new moderation policies.\\n\\nAs part of those efforts, YouTube will soon roll out a new, non-algorithmic version of its YouTube Kids apps that will rely on real, flesh-and-bone human beings to curate content, BuzzFeed News reports\\n\\nAccording to BuzzFeed News, the video streaming service plans to release a whitelisted version of the kids' app that will only display videos from channels handpicked by YouTube moderators. The updated mode should be introduced in the next couple of weeks.\\n\\nParents will be able to select the new version as an option that will exist alongside YouTube Kids' algorithm-based app. In theory, the whitelisted mode would mean the app will no longer suggest disturbing or sexually-explicit content featuring favorite kids characters like Peppa Pig or the Paw Patrol, or even conspiracy theory videos making claims that the earth is flat ― a problem revealed by a Business Insider investigation last month, BuzzFeed News reported.\\n\\nNews of the whitelisted YouTube Kids app came from a source, but the company didn't deny the plans when contacted by BuzzFeed News for comment.\\n\\nIn November, YouTube introduced a new policy to deal with the fake kid-targeted videos that would put age restrictions on videos flagged in its main app. The company, at the time, said that YouTube's team of moderators will review the flagged content and age-restrict any content that violates the new policy. That means those inappropriate videos wouldn't filter into the YouTube Kids app, according to Mashable.\\n\\nWhether or not the whitelisted version will do what it intends ― or if it will be released at all ― remains to be seen.

{"original": "Leading up to the federal government's 2017 budget, there was speculation about an increase in the tax on capital gains. The current tax exemption is disproportionately beneficial to the wealthy, and it has little in the way of general economic benefits.\\n\\nOnly half the value of capital gains is currently taxed. This costs $5 billion in annual tax revenue just for the federal government (and more for the provinces). About 50 per cent of the tax saving goes to the top one per cent of income earners, who earn the bulk of capital gains.\\n\\nNothing was done in this year's budget, but an increase in capital gains tax may still come in the future. In his speech, Finance Minister Morneau declared that going forward, we will close loopholes that result in unfair tax advantages for some at the expense of others. We will eliminate inefficient tax measures, especially those that disproportionately benefit the wealthy.\\n\\nProponents make two arguments in favour of the exemption for capital gains, but neither succeeds in justifying this tax giveaway.\\n\\nOne claim is that it encourages risk taking and investment. In fact, much of it goes to people who make money by speculation in real estate or foreign stock markets, neither of which is beneficial to the Canadian economy.\\n\\nCapital gains tax is generally levied based on where you live, not where you invest. Therefore, the capital gains tax charged by the Canadian government has little effect on Canada's ability to compete for capital from foreign investors. A foreign investor who invests in Canadian companies listed on stock markets does not pay Canadian capital gains tax. A lower capital gains tax may be justified for investments in small, new enterprises that are financed locally. Those may deserve some special treatment, but it does not justify an across-the-board exemption.\\n\\nThe other argument for exempting capital gains is inflation. Some of the increase in the price of assets is due to general inflation, and it would be unfair to tax it. That is true, but the current regime is not a good way to deal with it. A capital gain earned from a thirty day speculation gets the same treatment as a long-term investment that has been held for thirty years. That is not fair to the long-term investor, who may in fact have no real capital gain at all once inflation is taken into account.\\n\\nThe cost in foregone tax revenue amounts to tens of billions of dollars per year.\\n\\nThe proper approach is to adjust the gains for inflation. Charge tax on the real increase, after inflation has been factored out.\\n\\nIndexing to remove the effects of inflation before capital gains are calculated would be an important reform if the government goes ahead with an increase in the capital gains inclusion rate. Otherwise, it would lead to an unfair situation where people who have held property for a long time are taxed on illusory capital gains due to inflation. This is particularly significant when a person dies. At that time, the tax code deems all his property to have been sold, and capital gains tax has to be paid on it. This is a hazard for the middle class. The wealthy have access to tax planning tools such as trusts and estate freezes that help them avoid tax when they die.\\n\\nThe federal government has set up an expert panel to review a range of tax expenditures. The cost in foregone tax revenue amounts to tens of billions of dollars per year. Curtailing inefficient tax expenditures would free up money for spending on infrastructure, and for balanced reductions in the general tax rate, as I suggested in a recent paper for the Mowat Centre for Policy Innovation at the University of Toronto. It may not be politically easy, but it is the best way to significantly improve Canada's economy.\\n\\nFollow HuffPost Canada Blogs on Facebook"}

{"original": "MOSCOW (AP) — A judge on Monday ordered Alexei Navalny to be remanded in custody for 30 days, the Russian opposition leader's spokeswoman Kira Yarmysh said on Twitter.\\n\\nThe ruling concluded an hours-long court hearing set up at a police precinct where the politician was held since his arrest at a Moscow airport Sunday.\\n\\nNavalny flew to Russia from Germany, where he had spent five months recovering from nerve agent poisoning that he blames on the Kremlin. He was detained at passport control at Sheremetyevo airport after flying in Sunday evening from Berlin, where he was treated following the poisoning in August.\\n\\nNavalny's arrest prompted a wave of criticism from U.S. and European officials, adding to existing tension between Russia and West.\\n\\nGerman Foreign Minister Heiko Maas noted that Navalny had returned of his own volition and said it is completely incomprehensible that he was detained by Russian authorities immediately after his arrival.\\n\\nRussia is bound by its own constitution and by international commitments to the principle of the rule of law and the protection of civil rights, Maas added. These principles must of course also be applied to Alexei Navalny. He should be released immediately.\\n\\nThe politician's allies said Monday he was being held at a police precinct outside Moscow and has been refused access to his lawyer. The court hearing into whether Navalny should remain in custody was hastily set up at the precinct itself, and the politician's lawyers said they were notified minutes before.\\n\\nIt is impossible what is happening over here, Navalny said in video from the improvised court room, posted on his page in the messaging app Telegram. It is lawlessness of the highest degree.\\n\\nCalls for Navalny's immediate release have come from European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, the office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab and top officials of other EU nations.\\n\\nU.S. President-elect Joe Biden's pick for national security adviser called on Russian authorities to free Navalny. Mr. Navalny should be immediately released, and the perpetrators of the outrageous attack on his life must be held accountable, Jake Sullivan tweeted.\\n\\nThe outgoing U.S. secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, said the U.S. strongly condemns the decision to arrest Navalny.\\n\\nNevertheless, the judge ordered that Navalny be remanded in custody until Feb. 15, Yarmysh said on Twitter. Navalny's lawyer Vadim Kobzev told the Interfax news agency that the defense plans to appeal the ruling.\\n\\nNavalny's detention was widely expected because Russia's prisons service said he had violated probation terms from a suspended sentence on a 2014 money-laundering conviction.\\n\\nThe service said it would seek to have Navalny serve his 3½-year sentence behind bars.\\n\\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said Monday the stream of Western reactions to Navalny's arrest reflects an attempt to divert attention from the crisis of the Western model of development.\\n\\nNavalny's case has received a foreign policy dimension artificially and without any foundation, Lavrov said, arguing that his detention was a prerogative of Russian law enforcement agencies that explained their action. It's a matter of observing the law, he added.\\n\\nNavalny, 44, President Vladimir Putin's most prominent and determined foe, brushed off concerns about arrest as he boarded his flight in Berlin on Sunday.\\n\\nIt's impossible. I'm an innocent man, he said.\\n\\nNavalny fell into a coma while aboard a domestic flight from Siberia to Moscow on Aug. 20. He was transferred from a hospital in Siberia to a Berlin hospital two days later.\\n\\nLabs in Germany, France and Sweden, and tests by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, established that he was exposed to a Soviet-era Novichok nerve agent.\\n\\nRussian authorities insisted that the doctors who treated Navalny in Siberia before he was airlifted to Germany found no traces of poison. Russia refused to open a full-fledged criminal inquiry, citing a lack of evidence that Navalny was poisoned, and officials have challenged Germany to provide proof of the poisoning\\n\\nLast month, Navalny released the recording of a phone call he said he made to a man he alleged was a member of a group of officers of the Federal Security Service, or FSB, who purportedly poisoned him in August and then tried to cover it up. The FSB dismissed the recording as fake.\\n\\nNavalny has been a thorn in the Kremlin's side for a decade, unusually durable in an opposition movement often demoralized by repression. Russian authorities have launched multiple criminal investigations against him, and he has been tried and convicted in two separate criminal cases widely seen as politically motivated.\\n\\nIn December 2014, Navalny was convicted on charges of fraud and money-laundering and received a 3½-year suspended sentence, which he denounced as politically motivated and the European Court of Human Rights found arbitrary and manifestly unreasonable three years later.\\n\\nThe sentence carried a probation period that was due to expire in December 2020. Authorities said the politician was subject to regular in-person checks with law enforcement officers as one of the conditions of his probation.\\n\\nRussia's prison service first accused Navalny of not appearing for these checks on Dec. 28 — two days before the probation period was supposed to end.\\n\\nNavalny and his team rejected the accusations and said the move was an attempt by the Kremlin to keep the politician from coming back to Russia.\\n\\nThree days before his return to Moscow, the prison service alleged in a statement that Navalny repeatedly failed to appear for the checks, including when he was convalescing in Germany, and said it was obligated to undertake actions to detain the politician.\\n\\nNavalny had repeatedly said he would come back to Russia despite threats of arrest, saying he didn't leave the country by choice, but rather ended up in Germany in an intensive care box, and said he was still dedicated to his cause.\\n\\nI will go back to Russia, I will continue my work. No other possibility has ever been considered or is being considered, Navalny said in October.\\n\\n___\\n\\nVladimir Isachenkov in Moscow and Geir Moulson in Berlin contributed to this report."}
{"original": "Andrew Yang dropped out of the presidential race in early February, and with him went his promised freedom dividend— universal basic income.\\n\\nUniversal basic income is an idea that has spanned centuries, has been proposed in one format or another by public figures ranging from Martin Luther King Jr. to Milton Friedman to Mark Zuckerberg. At its core, the idea is that the government provides a minimum income to those who qualify to lift them out of poverty, protect them from automation or compensate their unpaid work.\\n\\nSome propose those who qualify be everyone, others suggest it's only those who are most in need — people who are being supported by various welfare programs. Democrats, for the most part, want it as an addition to welfare; Republicans, usually, want it to replace welfare.\\n\\nThe important thing to note, though, is that it's not as unpopular of a policy as Yang's campaign results would make it seem, and it makes more common sense than most of us would like to admit.\\n\\nAt its core, the idea is that the government provides a minimum income to those who qualify, to lift them out of poverty, protect them from automation or compensate their unpaid work.\\n\\nI am a senior at Emerson College, in Boston. I created my own program at Emerson, which is called Writing and Publishing on Inequality (and here I am, doing just that). I wasn't really a supporter of Yang, but I didn't oppose him either (I'll vote for any Democrat that makes it to the general election, even if I disagree with them on many economic issues). I write for a data science conference company, and I receive a basic income.\\n\\nDid I get you with that last part?\\n\\nI'm not a part of any of the many, so far successful, trial runs of UBI. I'm not from Italy or Iran, Seattle or Stockton, California. I'm not on welfare, I don't qualify for food stamps and I don't have a meal plan or live on campus.\\n\\nWhat I have are parents who believe in the value of working for a living and learning how to make money on my own, but also understand that today, compared to when they were enrolled, that's nearly impossible to do while in school. I'm in the privileged position to receive from my parents exactly what Yang promised us in his running: $1000 a month, no matter what (as long as I'm in school).\\n\\nAs I said, I live in Boston. I share a two-bedroom apartment with another person, I commute an hour on the train every morning for classes. I spend my freedom dividend entirely on rent, but I could have had more to spare if I chose to share a room or live in a different town. This maybe isn't the smartest way to use my basic income — it could be more fruitful to have leftover money to pay for bills or groceries or something. But it was my decision to do so, and any time I feel like I don't have enough left in my bank for what I want to do, I at least feel the security that it was my decision and mine alone.\\n\\nWith the information I had going into it, I knew I cared more about having my own bedroom every night than I did a long commute or an extra $200. My money is not dependent on what I use it for, and only I get to decide what is best for me.\\n\\nI'm in the privileged position to receive from my parents exactly what Yang promised us in his running: $1000 a month, no matter what (as long as I'm in school).\\n\\nFor the rest of my expenses, I work, making about $1200 a month at my part-time job, which is more fortunate than many people can say, given that I make above minimum wage. I have some student loans in my name and some loans my parents have taken out but that I will be paying back. I'm attending graduate school in the fall, and since it's in a cheaper city and I'll have a heavier school schedule, I'll likely work less and rely on my basic income more, day-to-day. Spending my income one way, at one point in time, doesn't dictate how I have to spend it forever.\\n\\nI currently work more than many students at my college — a private school in a city, full of middle-class students like myself. But I also know there are many at my school and at the schools neighboring me (there are over 60) that work far more than I do and don't have the luxury of a basic income. I know I'm lucky. And I feel lucky every time I get to come home from class and watch TV, every time I receive a paycheck and my parent's direct deposit, and every time I'm in the class I'm auditing just because I want to learn more. I'm thankful when I get to revise an essay, go over a reading for a second time, or write an article like this, because without the extra $1000 in my account each month, I wouldn't have time to do any of that.\\n\\nEach month, after bills (wifi, electricity, car insurance, credit cards), I have a couple of hundred dollars to spare, which often goes toward eating out and doing college student things. I'm not perfect with money, but I'm learning, and I do my job because it means I can afford to learn and still live a comfortable life. Learning how to be good at money is a process, and your life shouldn't be at risk if you don't get it right the first time.\\n\\nLearning how to be good at money is a process, and your life shouldn't be at risk if you don't get it right the first time.\\n\\nMost of my experiences are exactly what the research on UBI predicts. Some opponents of basic income say that people won't use their money for what's good for them, so we should give it to them in the form of food stamps or other forms of welfare. This is, for one, somewhat patronizing, and secondly, not backed by the research.\\n\\nIt's impossible to know exactly how income receivers spend their money. But researchers from the University of Tennessee and the University of Pennsylvania found that receivers of the Stockton UBI used about 40% of their monthly $500 on food, about 24% on sales/merchandise, which includes places like Walmart or discount stores that also sell groceries, 11% on utilities and bills, and 9% on car repairs and fuel. The rest went to everything from medical expenses to education and donations.\\n\\nThis isn't to say I think all welfare programs are patronizing, or that they should all be replaced with UBI. But a main critique from the Right is that UBI would cost too much, and would just be even more big government. Reducing the less effective forms of welfare would create a middle ground that actually helps people, while giving them the authority over their own bodies and lives, just like I have been granted.\\n\\nA critique of UBI from the Left is that it would make businesses think they can lower wages and working standards, because their employees have more money to begin with. The Right tends to argue that even if that's the case, it wouldn't matter because basic income receivers would now have more bargaining power since they could survive even if they have to leave a bad job and find another one.\\n\\nAnd while the former is a valid argument, and businesses do seem to be worse to employees if they're allowed to, I've also found the latter to be true. When I first moved to Boston, I took a low paying job I was excited about, but after spending eight months in it, I realized I was being underpaid and overworked. If I was completely reliant on that job for my income, I would have been forced to stay in that unhealthy situation until I found a replacement. Instead, I quit. With savings and a few hundred dollars of freelance work, I stayed jobless for about a month, but wasn't forced into another bad position. I could hold out for something that actually benefited me.\\n\\nMost of my experiences are exactly what the research on UBI predicts. Some opponents of basic income say that people won't use their money for what's good for them, so we should give it to them in the form of food stamps or other forms of welfare.\\n\\nMany people fearful of UBI say they don't like it because it would disincentivize people from working. Because who would work more if they could survive to work less. The research shows a minimal decrease in working hours, and even then, it's mostly attributed to parents, who are working less to spend more time with their children, or to students who are working less so they can study more, like myself. Most people will still work extra because they want to afford their standard of living, and don't want to move.\\n\\nThe odd thing, in all of this, is that I started this essay saying I would be voting for any Democrat candidate, yet what I've laid out here, in my argument for why UBI is good, draws from both sides of the party line. Controversial as it sounds, I think people should be allowed to do what they want if it doesn't harm others. And if there's a particularly large barrier, keeping them from that life they desire or deserve, I think the government should step in.\\n\\nIt's the people with privilege and power who are in the position to get UBI enacted, even if the largest beneficiaries are those below the poverty level.\\n\\nI wanted to go to Emerson College, I wanted to work for an education that would support the rest of the life I want to live. I wouldn't have been able to do that without the basic income my parents have provided me with. And I think it's unfair that I get to sidestep that barrier to entry, when so many others don't.\\n\\nNo proposed plan for UBI has been perfect, but that doesn't mean we shouldn't try.\\n\\nHave a compelling first-person story or experience you want to share?

{"original": "A sweeping reform bill that House Democrats say will be their first priority after ending the partial government shutdown is filled with policies that would fundamentally alter the nation's voting and campaign finance systems. These policies are not coming out of nowhere. Most of them have been implemented and tested in cities and states across the country.\\n\\nWithin the last five or six years, you just got more and more of these solutions happening at the state and local level, said Rep. John Sarbanes (D-Md.), the bill's chief sponsor. It's not a unicorn. It's not like we're talking about something that exists in the atmosphere of Jupiter. This is happening in America.\\n\\nSupreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis, in a famous dissenting opinion from 1932, asserted the freedom of a state or local government to serve as a laboratory; and try novel social and economic experiments without risk to the rest of the country. This laboratories of democracy concept holds that state and local governments are the proper place to test policies before they move to the national stage.\\n\\nThat is exactly what has happened with the sweeping policies in Democrats' H.R. 1, which they're calling the For the People Act. The bill's campaign finance provisions on public election financing, dark money disclosure and democracy vouchers have all been field tested. The same is true of automatic voter registration, felon re-enfranchisement and the use of independent, nonpartisan redistricting commissions.\\n\\nSAUL LOEB via Getty Images House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) speaks alongside Democratic lawmakers about H.R. 1, the For the People Act, at the Capitol in Washington, D.C., on Jan. 4.\\n\\nAutomatic Voter Registration\\n\\nSince 2015, 15 states and the District of Columbia have adopted automatic voter registration, a popular reform among advocates who believe it can significantly expand the number of people on the voting rolls in the United States.\\n\\nThe policy works slightly differently in each state, but the basic premise is the same: When someone interacts with the state motor vehicle or other agencies, they are automatically registered to vote unless they opt out. If they are already registered, their information gets updated if needed. Federal law already requires state motor vehicle and some state agencies to offer people the opportunity to register to vote, and automatic voter registration essentially tweaks the process to make registering an opt-out choice instead of an opt-in.\\n\\nOregon, considered the model for automatic voter registration, was the first state in the country to pass it in 2015. While it's still relatively early to assess the impact, the early evidence is encouraging. The policy went into effect in January 2016 and in a little over a year and a half, the policy added 375,000 people to the voter rolls. A 2017 analysis from the left-leaning Center for American Progress found over 116,000 people had been added to the rolls who wouldn't have otherwise registered.\\n\\nAutomatic voter registration also went into effect in California last year, where it added 727,924 new voters to the rolls since its launch in April and updated the addresses of 269,365 people. (There were around 5.5 million eligible but unregistered voters in the state as of October.) The program also attracted scrutiny when it emerged the DMV made errors on thousands of voter registrations, including registering people who were ineligible to vote. The head of the DMV resigned and the agency imposed an additional level of review on the voter registrations it received.\\n\\nAutomatic Restoration Of Voting Rights For People With Felony Convictions\\n\\nASSOCIATED PRESS Former felons Desmond Meade, president of the Florida Rights Restoration Coalition, left, and David Ayala, husband of State Attorney Aramis Ayala, celebrate with copies of their voter registration forms after voters approved an initiative restoring voting rights to ex-felons in November.\\n\\nForty-eight states don't allow people with felony convictions to vote while they are incarcerated, but states have widely different policies on when and how ex-felons can get back their right to vote. Some states allow former felons to vote once they're released from prison, while others bar them while they're on probation or parole. The various policies can be extremely confusing and deter people from registering to vote, even if they're eligible.\\n\\nThe For the People Act aims to fix this problem by automatically restoring voting rights once someone is released from prison. Currently, 13 states and the District of Columbia do this, but having a federal statute would help make the process easier for everyone involved.\\n\\nI think having a uniform rule that applies to everyone, everywhere and making that loud and having some action on it would be really helpful, said Sean Morales-Doyle, counsel at the Brennan Center for Justice, a New York-based nonprofit advocating for campaign finance reform and voting rights. Having a uniform policy would clear up confusion among voters. It would also clear up confusion among elections officials. It would make keeping track of voter lists a lot easier.\\n\\nDark Money Disclosure\\n\\nThe Supreme Court's 2010 Citizens United decision led to an explosion of undisclosed money spent by nonprofits, trade associations and corporate entities in elections. Congress attempted to fix the court's collateral damage to transparency with the Disclose Act in 2010, but it fell one vote short of clearing a Republican filibuster in the Senate.\\n\\nStates have since stepped in to pass their own Disclose Acts or to issue regulations to stop dark money in state elections. Varying disclosure rules to plug the holes created by the Supreme Court have been adopted in California, Delaware, Montana, New York, Texas, Vermont and Washington. Some of these laws provide more disclosure than others, and that can help Congress determine the best option for federal elections.\\n\\nCalifornia's Disclose Act is great but limited, said former Federal Election Commission Chairwoman Ann Ravel, now with the pro-disclosure nonprofit MapLight.\\n\\nThe California government has enacted two disclosure bills since the Citizens United decision. The first was passed in 2014 to require any group spending more than $50,000 on elections to disclose its donors. The second, enacted in 2017, mostly focuses on requiring independent spenders to post disclaimers detailing their top three donors on their advertising and campaign materials. Ravel believes that the $50,000 threshold for disclosure could be lower ― which is something the House Democrats' bill does.\\n\\nDemocracy Vouchers\\n\\nASSOCIATED PRESS Seattle City Council member Teresa Mosqueda was the first person in the country to win an elected office by collecting democracy vouchers to fund her campaign.\\n\\nA little-noticed provision in Democrats' big reform bill would create a pilot program for democracy vouchers ― a proposal to provide every citizen with vouchers that can be used as small-dollar political donations. These vouchers would come in $25 increments, but could be used to give donations as low as $1.\\n\\nThe democracy vouchers idea was first proposed by constitutional law professor Bruce Ackerman decades ago, but had never been adopted until Seattle voters backed a 2015 initiative to implement the idea. The program has already enabled a large number of people who would otherwise be incapable of affording political donations, including homeless people, to participate in the political process by contributing to candidates. One study found that 84 percent of people who used used their vouchers in the city's 2017 elections had not made a political contribution in at least the previous two election cycles.\\n\\nThe vouchers also provide an alternative fundraising system for candidates who lack the kind of connections to big-money donors that are often seen as necessary to run for office.\\n\\nIn 2017, Seattle City Council candidate Teresa Mosqueda became the first person in the country to win their first election running with democracy vouchers. She had kept hearing that she should run for City Council from participants in a program she ran for the AFL-CIO that encouraged women, people of color and working-class people to run for office. She was the kind of person she was trying to get to run: a Latina in the labor movement who didn't come from money. But her background also presented an obstacle to funding a campaign ― until Seattle's democracy vouchers became available.\\n\\nThe democracy vouchers program really took the pressure away from having to see yourself bankrolling a campaign or frankly having to dial for dollars for the majority of your time, Mosqueda said.\\n\\nI was able to spend more time talking with people about what they wanted to see in government, she added.\\n\\nThe pilot program in the Democrats' bill would be implemented in three randomly selected states to test how it works for congressional elections and whether it should be expanded to the whole country.\\n\\nEarly Voting And Same-Day Registration\\n\\nThe For the People Act would require states to allow people to register on the same day they vote and to allow voters to cast ballots for at least 15 consecutive days before Election Day. It would require poll sites to be open at least four hours each of those days and, to the greatest extent possible, that they be located near public transportation.\\n\\nTwenty states and the District of Columbia have approved some form of same-day registration. It's seen as a reform that can greatly drive up voter participation rates because people start paying more attention to an election the closer it gets. Federal law currently lets states cut off voter registration 30 days before an election. Activists also embrace early voting because it gives people more time to go to the polls at their convenience.\\n\\nEarly voting in particular has been at the center of many recent fights between Republicans and Democrats over voting laws. The conventional wisdom is that early voting benefits Democrats, so Republicans in several states have moved to limit its availability. But one 2017 paper published by four political scientists at the University of Wisconsin-Madison suggests that reality may be more complicated. The authors analyzed early voting in the 2004, 2008 and 2012 presidential elections and found that while Election Day registration tends to benefit Democrats, early voting on its own is more likely to benefit Republicans.\\n\\nThe type of voter who takes advantage of early voting ― older, whiter, and wealthier ― is already likely to vote, and more likely to vote Republican, the authors wrote in a blog post last year. Our findings confirm that early voting on its own has a negative and statistically significant effect on Democratic vote share in all three presidential elections we analyzed. The availability of early voting in isolation raises the Republican vote by about six percentage points.\\n\\nWhen same-day registration is combined with early voting, the paper found, voter turnout aligns more with the conventional wisdom.\\n\\nIndependent Redistricting Commissions\\n\\nH.R. 1 would require states to create independent commissions that would be responsible for drawing congressional districts. State lawmakers currently have the power to draw districts once a decade, and both parties have manipulated that process to their advantage. In 2011, Republicans saw an opportunity to take control of state legislatures, control the redistricting process and lock in an electoral advantage for the next decade. They executed that plan extremely precisely and well.\\n\\nSix states ― Alaska, Arizona, California, Idaho, Montana and Washington ― use independent redistricting commissions to draw lines for state or congressional districts. (Voters in Michigan, Utah and Colorado passed ballot measures establishing independent commissions in the November election.) Advocates say lawmakers have firm incentives to draw districts that favor their parties, and the independent commissions offer a firm check to make sure districts are fair.\\n\\nWhen lawmakers draw their own lines, they lose all of their philosophical ideals and they become ugly monsters. Kathay Feng, national redistricting director at Common Cause\\n\\nIn 2011, California's independent redistricting commission drew electoral boundaries for the state for the first time. Anyone can apply to serve on the 14-member commission ― which is made up of five Democrats, five Republicans and four people not affiliated with either party ― but there are strict requirements on who can serve. Eligible applicants must be registered to vote in California and have voted in two of the last three elections. In the 10 years leading up to submitting their application, they also can't have run for office, worked for a lawmaker, political party or as a lobbyist, or donated $2,000 or more to a party or candidate. Votes from multiple Democrats, Republicans and independents are required to approve a plan. H.R. 1 would impose similar safeguards on the independent commissions it creates to help ensure the districts are fair.\\n\\nWhen lawmakers draw their own lines, they lose all of their philosophical ideals and they become ugly monsters that are willing to cut out competitors, punish people from the other party and try to draw the most protective district for themselves so they don't have to face serious competition for the next 10 years, said Kathay Feng, national redistricting director at the good government group Common Cause, which championed the creation of California's commission.\\n\\nSmall-Donor Public Financing\\n\\nThe For the People Act's main campaign finance reform is the creation of a small-donor matching system to publicly finance congressional elections. It is based on the decades-old public financing program run for New York City elections.\\n\\nNew York adopted a small-donor matching system to publicly finance its elections in 1988 in response to a series of corruption scandals throughout city government. At the time, the system provided a 1-to-1 match for donations of $1,000 or less. A candidate received $1 in public funds for every $1 of a contribution up to $1,000. But the system has changed to boost the power of small donors over the years.\\n\\nProponents of New York City's matching fund system point to changes that greatly enhanced the role of small donors as the public match was increased and the contribution limit for matching funds was lowered. Currently, the system provides an 8-to-1 match for contributions up to $175. That means a $175 contribution actually counts as a $1,575 contribution after the public funds are added in. Democrats' For the People Act uses a 6-to-1 match, a rate used by the New York City system from 2009 through 2018, for contributions up to $200.\\n\\nThe fact that it's been around for 30 years and it's still working, I think that's pretty remarkable, said Lawrence Norden, a lawyer for the Brennan Center for Justice.\\n\\nNew York City's system has enabled candidates ― especially those from less affluent neighborhoods ― to more consistently rely on small donors in their districts. The city's public financing system gives candidates an incentive to reach out to a broader and more diverse array of constituents to fund their campaigns, a 2012 study by the Brennan Center and the progressive think tank Demos found.\\n\\nThis small-donor matching system has also spread to other states, cities and municipalities. Some matching funds programs have existed for years, but in the past five years, adoption has spread rapidly to Washington, D.C.; Montgomery and Howard counties in Maryland; and Suffolk County, New York, among other places. New York state lawmakers are currently debating the statewide adoption of such a program.\\n\\nIf New York City is any guide, it actually changes how candidates raise money, Norden said. So, right now you have many candidates raising many more contributions than we've seen in the past raising from small donors. I think we would see even more of a change of going to constituents and small donors as a source of funding rather than the biggest donors.\\n\\nCORRECTION: A previous version of this story stated that Teresa Mosqueda was the first candidate in the country to run and win using democracy vouchers.

{"original": "President-elect Joe Biden has assembled what environmentalists are calling an all-star team to lead his government's efforts to curb climate change and reverse the Trump administration's astoundingly pro-polluter legacy.\\n\\nRep. Deb Haaland (D-N.M.), one of the first two Native American women elected to Congress and a strong supporter of the Green New Deal movement, would replace a former oil lobbyist if the Senate confirms her as head of the Interior Department. In place of the ex-coal lobbyist running the Environmental Protection Agency would be Michael Regan, who brokered the biggest coal-ash cleanup settlement in U.S. history as North Carolina's top environmental regulator. The Energy Department would swap a fossil fuel die-hard for Jennifer Granholm, Michigan's former governor and attorney general and now a clean energy advocate.\\n\\nWith the Senate likely to remain in Republican hands this year, Biden seems to be preparing to resurrect the Obama administration's approach after Democrats lost the House in the 2010 midterms: a combination of aggressive regulation, executive orders and close collaboration with states.\\n\\nTo oversee the effort, Biden picked Gina McCarthy, Barack Obama's former EPA chief and architect of the administration's regulatory suite, as his domestic climate czar, a position Obama initially created in his first term to coordinate the federal government's energy and environmental strategy and work to get climate legislation passed in Congress.\\n\\nBeyond their stark ideological contrasts to President Donald Trump's agency heads, Biden's top-level nominees also appear to signal the new administration's plans to embed climate policies at the state level, cementing the clean-energy transition and making it harder for the next GOP president to undo whatever progress his administration makes.\\n\\nThere's this very calculated, hard-nosed recognition among the choices that executive action is going to be the key to progress, and action at the state level is going to be the key to progress, said Cara Horowitz, a climate policy expert at UCLA School of Law.\\n\\nAs the Obama and Trump presidencies prove, it could likely be a rocky road. Absent new legislation, the White House must creatively interpret its legal mandate to enact rules under existing statutes, leaving them open to challenge. Republican state attorneys general sued the Obama administration so routinely that the top cop in Texas joked: I go into the office in the morning. I sue Barack Obama, and then I go home. GOP-led states persuaded the Supreme Court to block Obama's signature power plant regulation in 2016, and that was before Trump added three right-wing justices to the bench and stacked lower federal courts with conservatives. Red states are already vowing to pursue that same strategy.\\n\\nBut Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris have options. And they've made it clear they're all on the table.\\n\\nThe Biden-Harris Administration intends to pull every lever available, not only through executive and legislative action, but partnering together with cities, states, and businesses to reverse course on the climate threat, advance environmental justice and a clean energy future, and create millions of good-paying union jobs, Jamal Brown, a Biden transition spokesman, told HuffPost in an email.\\n\\nCarolyn Kaster/ASSOCIATED PRESS President-elect Joe Biden announces his climate and energy team nominees and appointees at the Queen Theater in Wilmington, Delaware, Dec. 19.\\n\\n'A Weak Tool'\\n\\nBiden kicked off his presidential run on the wrong side of a climate movement. Young activists were leading the push for a more ambitious federal approach, against the backdrop of dire United Nations projections on global warming. In May 2019, Reuters reported that Biden was carving out a middle ground climate policy that would likely face heavy resistance from green activists.\\n\\nUnsurprisingly, climate activists and scientists revolted, with some dubbing him Middle Ground Joe. The Biden campaign dismissed the report, and Biden himself defended his record as an early champion of climate action.\\n\\nAs the election drew closer, Biden made climate a central part of his bid for the White House, tempering fears among advocates and scientists that he'd take the same slow, moderate approach that Obama had during his first term a decade earlier.\\n\\nObama picked Ken Salazar, an oil and gas ally, as his interior secretary, and balanced new federal support for renewable energy with boosts to fossil fuel drillers, promising an all of the above energy play. The approach relied on Congress, both chambers of which Democrats controlled when Obama took office, to enact a new carbon pricing scheme that would gradually increase the cost of fossil fuels and incentivize a shift to solar, wind and energy efficiency. Democrats' landmark cap-and-trade bill ― a conservative and incrementalist policy that aimed to set a cap on carbon emissions, then let companies trade pollution permits ― fizzled in 2010. Going forward, the GOP, seemingly hell-bent on obstructing anything Obama proposed and financially encouraged by dark-money groups unleashed by the Supreme Court's 2010 Citizens United ruling, adopted a full-fledged position of denying the reality of climate change itself.\\n\\nThe partisan divides that inhibited strong climate action during the Obama years have only deepened under Trump, a reality that Horowitz hopes will be enough to deter the Biden administration from futile attempts at reaching across the aisle to address climate change.\\n\\nWitnessing and seeing firsthand how deeply dysfunctional attempts at bipartisan action have been over the last four years have really taken the shine off any notion that there might be some grand 'Kumbaya,' coming-together moment, and that the Biden administration should waste any amount of time whatsoever at the beginning of their administration seeking such a moment, she said.\\n\\nBiden will be forced to navigate a similar legislative playing field, except another decade into a rapidly worsening global crisis. Unless Democrats can somehow flip a pair of Republican-held Senate seats in the Georgia runoff election on Jan. 5, the GOP will maintain control of the Senate while Democrats hold a slim majority in the House.\\n\\nThere is some possibility of compromise on issues such as nuclear power, carbon capture technology and research funding for renewables, all things included in the bipartisan spending bill passed last month. But a legal mandate to rapidly phase out fossil fuels and intervene radically in the economy is difficult to envision, given the makeup of the 117th Congress.\\n\\nALEX EDELMAN via Getty Images Defeating the threat of global climate change is the fight of our lifetimes, Gina McCarthy said after being introduced as Biden's nominee to be his national climate adviser.\\n\\nBiden isn't ruling out a legislative pathway. In the $1.7 trillion climate plan he released in 2019, which set a goal of achieving net-zero emissions by 2050, Biden said he will demand that Congress enacts legislation in the first year of his presidency to establish a system for achieving that 2050 target. He said he will call on Congress to make huge investments in energy and climate research and incentivize a rapid shift toward clean energy technologies.\\n\\nIn his plan, Biden also vowed to use the full authority of the executive branch, beginning his first day in office, to combat global warming, including orders to limit methane pollution from fossil fuel operations, protect the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge from oil and gas drilling and conserve 30% of America's lands and waters by 2030.\\n\\nBut whether he's able to forge a climate legacy that endures beyond his time in office may very well hinge on leveraging states and cities to take aggressive action.\\n\\nThe lesson of the Trump years is that executive order is a weak tool, said Amy Myers Jaffe, managing director of the Climate Policy Lab at Tufts University. The Biden team absolutely needs to see how they can support states ― from New England wind to stricter methane rules mirroring Colorado to California's clean freight and [electric vehicle] policies.\\n\\nMyers Jaffe supports a federalist model for addressing climate change, one to organize state voluntary efforts into a federally led initiative that would build a national policy without letting one or two states dictate through the courts, she said.\\n\\nNotably, several members of Biden's environmental team have state government experience.\\n\\nThat's where I think the list really shines, Horowitz said. He's packed this list with people who know how state progress is made.\\n\\nWhat He Can Do Without Congress\\n\\nExperts say there are numerous ways for the incoming Biden administration to empower states and shore up its own gains even if a Republican unseats him in 2024.\\n\\nBiden's administration could condition federal funding for state plans to build electric vehicle infrastructure and clean energy, or pay states to prepare climate action plans and stipulate that they be subject to federal enforcement or forced to return the money if they don't meet those goals. Such a program would need to be voluntary, and could be expanded to include funding for states that agree to conserve additional land under their control, but it's a possibility, said Michael Gerrard, director of Columbia Law School's Sabin Center for Climate Change Law.\\n\\nIt's challenging to achieve permanence without legislation, Gerrard said. But conditions on voluntarily received financial assistance are one method.\\n\\nThe administration could also consider providing new resources for states to mitigate the effects of wildfires and other climate-related disasters, or give states the flexibility to figure out how to meet new federal pollution-reduction goals, Horowitz noted.\\n\\nGiving states the power and funding to make progress helps to insulate progress from the seesaw of future federal policy priorities ― not perfectly, but at least somewhat, she said.\\n\\nDavid Hayes, executive director of New York University School of Law's State Energy & Environmental Impact Center and a former deputy interior secretary under Obama, declined to comment specifically on the incoming Biden administration, but stressed the importance of federal-state collaboration.\\n\\nThe Trump administration pursued its energy, climate and environmental deregulatory agenda with little regard for states' rights and interests, he said, citing, among other things, the administration's decision to revoke California's ability to set its own stronger fuel economy standards. This approach does not produce durable policy. As we've seen, many of the Trump administration's rollbacks and replacement rules have been struck down in the courts, and many more will meet the same fate.\\n\\nIn his lengthy climate plan, Biden slammed the Trump administration for abdicating America's leadership on climate, and applauded state and local leaders for their efforts to slash planet-warming emissions, invest in renewable energy and build climate-resilient infrastructure. Since Trump announced in June 2017 that he would pull the U.S. out of the landmark Paris climate agreement, 25 states, hundreds of cities and thousands of businesses and other entities have pledged their commitment to the goals of the international accord.\\n\\nThese states and cities deserve to once again have a partner in the White House, the Biden plan reads. Biden will be that partner.\\n\\nThis story has been updated with additional details about Biden's 2020 presidential run."}
{"original": "The events of Jan. 20, 2017, seemed to be a given: Polls, public opinion and the apparent steady flow of history itself had aligned, setting the date for a woman to be sworn in as president. A year later, such female leadership resonates only as a fever dream. During a year's orbit around that orange fireball at the center of our system (the sun ― did you think I meant someone else?), the story of a woman in charge of not just the East Wing, but the West itself, has been usurped by a very different kind of triumph for women.\\n\\nThe narrative so many thought would unfurl over the year was about a woman elected to the highest position of power in the world. In this narrative, a woman was subject, not object. At the center of the story was a woman who was the embodiment of the active voice, not the passive one ― someone defined by doing things of consequence, not someone to whom things are done. Regardless of what you thought of this protagonist, these were the facts of the tale many believed was about to begin.\\n\\nBut that script got sent to rewrite. Instead of the new twist on the old story — frigid harpy schoolmarm wields power over homestead/boarding school — we expected, we got a different one. In this one, women were objects, not subjects. Young and desirable bodies to conquer, firm flesh to be despoiled by modern day Caligulas. (I'll never forget the image of Brett Ratner with his penis in one hand and a bowl of shrimp cocktail in another, an image that was lost among the tales of Weinstein's many gilded hotel rooms.)\\n\\nAs always, women are cast as one thing or another, never both. And this year we've gone from the heights of heretofore unknown leadership, desexualized and fearsome, to the ancient trope of sexualized victimhood. As Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie has said, in talking about what she calls the danger of the single story, the trouble with stereotypes isn't that they're wrong, it's that they're incomplete. This year, we traded in one incomplete story, albeit one of extraordinary power, for another ― this one of extraordinary (and all too ordinary) victimhood. We flooded our prismatic channels of conversation with stories of abuse and harassment, drowning some of the most powerful men who shape our very culture.\\n\\nFor all that these stories, bravely shared by domestic box office stars and domestic workers alike, have done to lay bare injustice, they've also, inescapably, returned us to the old ways of talking about what it means to be a woman. The big public feminist victory of the past year has both advanced our discourse and banished us, clutching our torn bodices, back to a narrative of powerlessness it seemed we'd finally, well, trumped. All those pink hats from the Women's March have been packed away as mementos; it's the talk of pussy that remains.\\n\\nSurely exposing widespread abuse and harassment of women is a revolutionary act, especially when done en masse. But it has also lent a new primacy to an old definition of what women are. That definition, that story of abused objects, cannot be the story that defines, once again, what it means to be a woman ― a woman who can police her own body, in regards to power, policy and pleasure alike. Victimhood and leadership are not mutually exclusive; indeed, many of our greatest leaders have known great victimhood. But tales of women victimized by powerful men cannot be the only stories that have, and allow us to wield, power.\\n\\nIn a sense, all revolutions are led by victims; the overturning of power necessitates the victory of those without it. And it is indeed revolutionary to set fire to the locker room (or boardroom, or situation room). But it's also important to remember that sexual victimhood has long been synonymous with women's public voices. Indeed, it has mainly been all society will tolerate hearing. Mary Beard is not the first historian, but is certainly the latest and loudest to note that for millennia, when women speak to power it is to decry their own martyrdom to men's genitals, usually as a precursor to their own death. The rape of Lucretia, for example, became a trope of European art, from Shakespeare to Titian to Britten, because, as the ancient story goes, the daughter of a Roman prefect denounced a monarchical prince named Sextus — making nominal the conflation of sex and abusive power. He brutalized her before she took her own life.\\n\\nThe narrative arc must bend back from prey toward powerful leadership once more. We must learn to braid these notions together and find a place for progress within them, to build a reality for women and men alike that reflects our truth and our potential. (We saw an excellent example of this when Oprah Winfrey spoke at the Golden Globes this month, connecting Recy Taylor's rape to Rosa Parks's radicalism to her own place on that stage. Such personified leadership aroused the public's vapors clamoring for a presidential run from, yes, another television star.) We've got a lot more to break than just silence: We must redefine the very notion of what women are and what men are, and how we can share not just our bedrooms and break rooms, but power itself.\\n\\nThe narrative we must revise is as old as the very existence of narrative. And it will require what women have been acculturated to resist most of all: to make a mess. Not just the expression of pristine black gowns or neat hashtags, but embracing of the sort of complicated characters we've long said we want to see. Our stories will require nuance and contradictions if we want them to truly rewrite the world ― a panoply of desire and ambition and fury, as varied as we are.\\n\\nLauren Sandler is a journalist and the author of Righteous, One and Only and a forthcoming book about a year in the life of a young homeless mother.\\n\\nThis piece is part of HuffPost's brand-new Opinion section.

{"original": "One of the largest grocery chains in the U.S. has decided to end much of its in-house delivery service, outsourcing the work to third-party companies like DoorDash that rely on independent contractors to drop off food to customers on the cheap.\\n\\nUnions representing workers at Albertsons say the chain's decision will end up degrading good delivery jobs by putting the work on a gig model. Independent contractors tend to bear many of the costs of employment, providing their own vehicles and covering wear and tear, while forgoing traditional work benefits like health coverage and a retirement fund.\\n\\nAlbertsons told HuffPost that DoorDash was one of several third-party companies that the grocer would shift the work toward, to compete in the growing home delivery market more effectively. The company said it's e-commerce business has exploded during the pandemic.\\n\\nWhile we know that this move will help us create a more efficient operation, it wasn't a decision we made lightly or without a great deal of consideration, an Albertsons spokesperson said in an email.\\n\\nWhile Albertsons did not cite the new California law known as Proposition 22 for the decision, several major California markets will be impacted by the policy change. Prop 22 makes it easier for companies like DoorDash to classify their drivers as independent contractors.\\n\\nThe change is scheduled to take effect on Feb. 27.\\n\\nThe decision by Albertsons was first reported by KnockLA, which said that Albertsons chains Vons and Pavilions would be firing union workers. But Albertsons said it would be offering the affected drivers other positions within stores and warehouses, and both Albertsons and union representatives said jobs under union contracts would not be impacted by the change.\\n\\nFor all our nonunion drivers who can't bargain, it's really messed up. Jim Araby, UFCW Western States Council\\n\\nThe United Food and Commercial Workers union condemned the move by Albertsons. Jim Araby, director of UFCW's Western States Council, said his union represents around 250 drivers in California's Bay Area who work for Albertsons subsidiary Safeway. Those drivers organized about two years ago and are in the process of securing their first contract; their jobs will not change as a result of the new arrangement at Albertsons.\\n\\nAraby said third-party delivery services appeal to companies like Albertsons because another company has to worry about the fleet and the logistics of employment: You don't have to maintain the truck, you don't have to worry about accidents and all that goes with that. And the third-party companies ultimately don't have to worry about much of that either, because everyone is using their own cars.\\n\\nAccording to Araby, both UFCW and the Teamsters represent in-house drivers at Albertsons, but only a small share of the overall workforce. He said even though union drivers would not be impacted by the change, he believes grocers' increasing reliance on companies like DoorDash will imperil more in-house jobs over time.\\n\\nGeri Lavrov via Getty Images An Albertsons store in Buellton, California.\\n\\nAnd for all our nonunion drivers who can't bargain, it's really messed up, Araby said. I think it's an example of corporate greed.\\n\\nHe said his union is considering filing a grievance, believing the change may run afoul of provisions it has bargained related to subcontracting.\\n\\nAlbertsons declined to say how many positions would ultimately be eliminated, but that it plan[s] to offer positions to each impacted associate. Those who don't accept the transfer may be eligible for severance pay: We will work with them on their individual situation.\\n\\nThe move comes against the backdrop of Prop 22. In 2019, California passed a law known as Assembly Bill 5 making it harder for gig companies to classify workers as independent contractors rather than employees. Prop 22, which voters passed in November, excluded app-based drivers from the earlier law, protecting the contractor system at companies like Uber, Lyft and DoorDash.\\n\\nThose companies spent heavily to get the measure passed. Unions and their allies on the left viewed the success of Prop 22 as a major setback in their fight with Silicon Valley and the growth of the contract workforce.\\n\\nAdan Alvarez, a spokesperson for Teamsters Local 396, called the decision by Albertsons a natural response to Prop 22, now that the gig model is secure in the state among food delivery drivers. His union represents employees working out of Albertsons warehouses in Southern California. Although no Teamsters will lose their jobs, he said he expects the new jobs to be less stable than the ones being eliminated.\\n\\nThis is an example of what we predicted. It's giving companies an open door to chip away at employee-based jobs, Alvarez said. These [Albertsons] employees, they weren't unionized. But they were still employees with wages and benefits."}
{"original": "Answer by Ben Waggoner, PhD in Integrative Biology; paleontologist, evolutionary biologist, on Quora:\\n\\nAs of 2013, there are estimated to be about 100 uncontacted tribes left in the world, mostly in thick forested areas like New Guinea and the Amazon rainforest (Uncontacted peoples). But most of these would be minimally contacted tribes. Some of these tribes have at least seen airplanes and helicopters that have photographed them. Some have learned about the rest of the world from encounters with neighboring tribes that have been contacted, and some have picked up a few Western goods through trade or gifting. And some are tribes that have already fled their land and withdrawn deeper into the wilderness--these do know about the rest of the world, and they have good reason to fear it and avoid it.\\n\\nBut if you're talking about tribes that have had no contact with the outside world, it is probably much lower than 100. But this is harder to measure. It would be very hard for us to find out about a tribe's existence without the tribe finding out about ours.\\n\\nGovernment policy in most of the countries that still have uncontacted tribes is generally to try and leave them alone, although missionaries and tourists sometimes violate the policy. This is in part because uncontacted tribes may have no immunity to civilized world diseases--when the Nukak people of Colombia were contacted in 1981, about half the tribe died of respiratory disease. Narco-traffickers and land grabbers moved in, and the surviving Nukak were forced to move to a town where they're stuck in wretched conditions. Other tribes have been wiped out or severely reduced by having their land seized for mining, agriculture, timber, etc., or by slaving, or by military or guerrilla actions. This article tells some of the story: The Lost Tribes of the Amazon.\\n\\nMore recently, in 2014, three members of a previously uncontacted tribe in Brazil encountered a team from Brazil's National Indian Foundation (FUNAI), and unfortunately caught influenza. They were treated, but it's feared that they may have brought it back to their tribe. Making matters worse, the tribe in question may have been fleeing attacks by cocaine traffickers. See: Members of previously uncontacted tribe infected with flu. Here are the three:\\n\\nProbably the best known uncontacted tribes are the people of North Sentinel Island in the Indian Ocean. Even they have had some contact with the outside world--they know we're out here, but most attempts at contact have been met with arrows and spears. Between 1967 and 1996, there were a few attempts to make peaceful contact with them by leaving them gifts, so the Sentinelese have at least accepted a few Western goods, such as aluminum cookware, and we have a few close-up photos of them. Several people attempting to make contact were hurt or killed, including the director of a National Geographic documentary, who was speared in the leg during a 1974 contact attempt that ended badly. Since 1996 the Indian government policy has been to leave them alone. In 2006, the Sentinelese killed two fishermen who were in their waters illegally--and then drove away the Indian Navy helicopter sent to retrieve them, with a volley of arrows.\\n\\nThey're not ignorant of modern technological advances.

{"original": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Congress has overridden President Donald Trump's veto of a defense policy bill, a first by lawmakers since he took office nearly four years ago.\\n\\nIn an extraordinary New Year's Day session, the Republican-controlled Senate easily turned aside the veto, dismissing Trump's objections to the $740 billion bill and handing him a stinging rebuke just weeks before his term ends.\\n\\nTrump had lashed out at GOP lawmakers on Twitter, charging earlier this week that Weak and tired Republican 'leadership' will allow the bad Defense Bill to pass.″\\n\\nTrump called the looming override vote a disgraceful act of cowardice and total submission by weak people to Big Tech. Negotiate a better Bill, or get better leaders, NOW!\\n\\nThe 81-13 vote in the Senate followed an earlier 322-87 override vote in the House of the widely popular defense measure. The bill provides a 3% pay raise for U.S. troops and guides defense policy, cementing decisions about troop levels, new weapons systems and military readiness, personnel policy and other military goals. Many programs, including military construction, can only go into effect if the bill is approved.\\n\\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said before the vote that Congress has passed the National Defense Authorization Act every year for 59 years in a row, and one way or another, we are going to complete the 60th annual NDAA and pass it into law before this Congress concludes on Sunday.″\\n\\nThe bill looks after our brave men and women who volunteer to wear the uniform,″ McConnell said. But it's also a tremendous opportunity: to direct our national security priorities to reflect the resolve of the American people and the evolving threats to their safety, at home and abroad. It's our chance to ensure we keep pace with competitors like Russia and China.″⁣\\n\\nThe Senate override was delayed after Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., objected to moving ahead until McConnell allowed a vote on a Trump-backed plan to increase COVID-19 relief payments to $2,000. McConnel did not allow that vote; instead he used his parliamentary power to set a vote limiting debate on the defense measure, overcoming a filibuster threat by Sanders and Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York.\\n\\nWithout a bipartisan agreement, a vote on the bill could have been delayed until Saturday night. Lawmakers, however, agreed to an immediate roll call Friday once the filibuster threat was stopped.\\n\\nTrump rejected the defense measure last week, saying it failed to limit social media companies he claimed were biased against him during his failed reelection campaign. Trump also opposed language that allows for the renaming of military bases that honor Confederate leaders.\\n\\nSen. Jim Inhofe, R-Okla., chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said he was disappointed with Trump's veto and called the bill absolutely vital to our national security and our troops.″\\n\\nThis is the most important bill we have,″ Inhofe said. It puts members of the military first.″\\n\\nTrump has succeeded throughout his four-year term in enforcing party discipline in Congress, with few Republicans willing to publicly oppose him. The bipartisan overrides on the defense bill showed the limits of Trump's influence in the final weeks of his term.\\n\\nEarlier this week, 130 House Republicans voted against the Trump-backed COVID relief checks, with many arguing they were unnecessary and would increase the federal budget deficit.\\n\\nThe Democratic-controlled House approved the larger payments, but the plan is dead in the Senate, another sign of Trump's fading hold over Congress.\\n\\nBesides his concerns about social media and military base names, Trump also said the defense bill restricted his ability to conduct foreign policy, particularly my efforts to bring our troops home.″ Trump was referring to provisions in the bill that impose conditions on his plan to withdraw thousands of troops from Afghanistan and Germany. The measures require the Pentagon to submit reports certifying that the proposed withdrawals would not jeopardize U.S. national security.\\n\\nTrump has vetoed eight other bills, but those were all sustained because supporters did not gain the two-thirds vote needed in each chamber for the bills to become law without Trump's signature.\\n\\nRhode Island Sen.

{"original": "There were several moments in 2018 when it was difficult to remain hopeful for any sort of meaningful action on climate change. The Trump administration has worked tirelessly to impede a transition to a green economy with actions ranging from opening the long-protected Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to drilling, to implementing tariffs on imported solar panels, to the president's own denial that humans are causing unprecedented warming ― despite his own government's comprehensive report stating the opposite.\\n\\nGiven the severity of the challenge we now face, it would be easy to see 2018 as an irreversible step backward, the sealing of our already grim fate. Yet despite all this, 2018's midterm elections showed that politicians do have a path forward with American voters when it comes to comprehensive action on climate. The message, as it turns out, isn't any sort of brilliant political calculus either. It's a return to kitchen-table issues: jobs and economic opportunity.\\n\\nThe seats that Democrats picked up across the country this fall were largely won by reassuring voters that they are willing to fight for workers young and old, and ensuring that they will have affordable health care and gainful employment. The Green New Deal, a bold proposal to put Americans to work building green infrastructure, modeled after Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal, was a central campaign issue for a progressive faction of the newly elected Democrats. At first, establishment Democrats scoffed at the Green New Deal as some ultraleft policy demand, but the more the idea of job creation through building renewable energy and climate-adapted infrastructure were floated with the American public, the more support they gained. Not to mention, the notion of slowing rampant income inequality and leaving no American behind sits favorably with working people throughout the nation.\\n\\nThe Green New Deal is a unifying political message that gets back to the basics of creating an economy that works for all people and protects the planet as a result. In fact, a recent poll by the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication and George Mason University showed that a staggering 93 percent of Democrats and 64 percent of Republicans agree with the basic components of the Green New Deal (our own poll data from earlier this year echoed those findings, showing the American public's overwhelming preference for renewables over fossil fuels). The only other thing that gets such a high level of bipartisan agreement is that Democrats and Republicans can't agree on basic facts.\\n\\nIt's now important that we take advantage of this consensus, and fast. The 2018 midterm election should be a clear lesson for the still-forming roster of 2020 presidential contenders: What Americans crave the most is a government that works for the people, not just some of the people. Americans, first and foremost, want their basic needs met and candidates who are willing to listen to their concerns and then work to address them in Washington.\\n\\nTom Williams via Getty Images Sens. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) and Kamala Harris (D-Calif.), possible 2020 presidential contenders, have both voiced support for the idea of a Green New Deal.\\n\\nA bold plan to transition to a green economy will both put Americans to work and reduce pollution that keeps millions of the working poor sick and trapped in poverty. Kids will miss fewer days of school due to respiratory illness, parents will miss fewer days of work, and working a full-time job will pay a livable wage. And action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions is the only way to lower the probability that devastating fires, hurricanes and floods will become even more frequent occurrences. For the kinds of climate-related impacts that we have already endured ― and will continue to ― we need coordinated infrastructure and systems in place to ensure that Americans are prepared and protected.\\n\\nIn addition to the Green New Deal, candidates must stress that their opponents' inaction on environmental issues hurts American workers and their communities. Florida's former Gov. Rick Scott won a Senate seat this fall even though his gutting of Florida's water management budget by hundreds of millions of dollars likely created the conditions for the unprecedented red tide event that cost Florida's tourism economy over $90 million in one summer. His opponent, then-Sen. Bill Nelson, hardly mentioned that Scott's recklessness and complete disregard for Florida's environment and waterways was a direct blow to small businesses, fisherman and millions of Floridians whose livelihoods depend on the health of the ocean. Meanwhile, evidence shows that 30-year Congressman Dana Rohrabacher's notorious denial of climate issues potentially cost him his seat in California's 48th Congressional District this fall after he routinely ignored the issues plaguing his constituents ― including rampant flooding in Orange County's Balboa Island that has resulted from sea-level rise.\\n\\nAs now-Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez recently said in a tweet, People are starting to realize our issues aren't left and right, but top and bottom. That perfectly expresses the opportunity Democrats have in 2019, to set the stage for the 2020 race and run as a party that has real solutions to put people to work and propel our economy, and our planet, into the future.\\n\\nThere's no time to waste.\\n\\n\\n\\nMonica Medina and Miro Korenha are the founders and publishers of Our Daily Planet."}

If your goal is to make sure no one in the room would ever give you the Heimlich, go ahead and tell them you're from LA.\\n\\n\\n\\nHaving established I wasn't a townie, the bartender proceeded to give me a third grade book report on Randsburg. I learned that their chief export is the same as their average annual rainfall: no dice. I also learned that Randsburg was originally a mining town in the 1800's. Gold, silver, and something used for making batteries. I don't know if the mines are still operating, but in the same way you might not ask a waiter if he's been on any great auditions lately, I took one look around at the burnt out houses that dotted the village and decided not to ask, How's business?\\n\\n\\n\\nIn the corner, there sat a beautiful wooden upright piano; an underutilized instrument, bathed in silence, dreaming of once again being touched. One sympathizes. Now, it was a stand for a flat screen television. Samsung. I'll bet he did. It was taco night, I assume. There were what one might identify as taco fixins on a long table in the center of the room. No one was hovering around it the way my ilk would've, so I suppose it could've been an art installation.\\n\\n\\n\\nTwo of the local women struck up a conversation with me, proving once again that what I have cannot be taught. They told stories of a neighboring tavern that had since been shut down after the authorities discovered it was a brothel. I smiled and nodded, and googled the term when I returned home. Incidentally, yikes. They went on to describe the proprietor, a woman whose name I can't recall, so I'll make up something dignified. Apparently, if you gave Old Beaver Jugs a single dollar, she'd climb a step ladder in an ill-fitting skirt, hoisting her business district skywards and presenting the patronage with a view of the second thing I had to google that night. Incidentally, yikes.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt was around this time that I decided to put Randsburg to my rudder. I had soaked up all the culture (read PBR) that I could. I packed up my bag, tipped the bartender, headed for the door, remembered I had to pee, turned back, peed, and headed for the door.\\n\\n\\n\\nI took my time walking back down the road. All kidding aside, things look pretty bleak in Randsburg. Most of the houses are missing windows, and it clearly rains every time someone plays that piano. The abundance of antique stores makes you feel as though the town is selling off everything it has left. The locals seem to treat their conditions as most small towns treat a brothel. Everyone knows it's there. Everyone knows what goes on inside, but what are you gonna do, bring it up?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOn the way back to the car, I stopped to photograph the post office.

{"original": "By Stefan Hilser, MS candidate, environmental studies and sustainability science, Lund University\\n\\nThe scandal around the revelations that Volkswagen manipulated emissions monitors on its cars to give falsely low readings damaged the company's image and its stock market value, which dropped 40 percent within two days of the news breaking. This damage threatens to have tremendous effects on the German economy, where 1 in 7 workplaces is directly or indirectly dependent on the automotive industry.\\n\\nLooking at why and how VW committed the fraud is also an opportunity to examine practices related to environmental monitoring in the automotive industry and whether the reaction to the scandal is really likely to prevent another one from occurring. For many experts involved in the devising of monitoring methods, the scandal has some obvious roots--the desire for more profits. But they also note that governments and consumers themselves perhaps also share some complicity in the deception that's now costing VW so dearly.\\n\\nEnvironmental monitoring regulations and adaptation are costs, so there's a tendency to avoid them, says Arthur ten Wolde, manager of circular economy public affairs at De Groene Zaak, a Dutch business-lobbying group that advocates for a circular economy. He spoke to Pro Journo at October's World Resources Forum in Davos, Switzerland.\\n\\nEstimates by Transport & Environment (T&E), a Brussels-based green research and lobby group, calculate that at a cost of 50 euros per car, they could upgrade most Euro 5 emissions standards vehicles to equip them with selective catalytic reduction systems (known as SCRs). According to the group's tests, these systems would reduce nitrogen oxide emissions so that the cars meet EU environmental norms.\\n\\nBut to avoid those costs, the industry is lobbying against stricter regulations. Based on the EU transparency register, in 2014 Volkswagen alone spent more than 3.3 million euros and employed over 43 registered lobbyists, followed by Daimler, with 2.5 million euros and 14 lobbyists, and far ahead of BMW, with approximately 1.4 million euros and eight lobbyists.\\n\\nReuters has reported that VW plans to recall 8.5 million affected vehicles in the EU. Assuming that all the engines meet the Euro 5 norm, if these vehicles were to be equipped with a SCR system, the total cost could amount to a maximum of 4.25 billion euros. VW's calculation is perhaps easy, then, to understand.\\n\\nThe Economist has drawn attention to some of the testing practices developed by allegedly independent testing organizations to win clients. Among other things, they include the removal of wing mirrors and sound systems, taped cracks between panels and the use of high-performance lubricants and tires to save weight and reduce drag.\\n\\nIn the case of the current manipulation scandal, the most important cheat is that testing takes place on a rolling road under laboratory conditions, which are far from being realistic. The software installed in VW cars was able to detect these conditions, making it possible for the car manufacturers to deceive the testing regime, as well as customers and regulators.\\n\\nIn a letter submitted recently to the EU's Technical Committee on Motor Vehicles, Transport & Environment asked for stricter testing regimes under real-life conditions and complained that when driven on the open road, the vehicles exceeded test values by a factor of nearly five.\\n\\nThe main answer why we haven't done monitoring under real-life conditions yet is cost, says Paul Ekins, a professor of resources and environmental policy, and director of the UCL Institute for Sustainable Resources, at University College London.\\n\\nAccording to Ekins, this is also due to governments' various interests. As with everything to do with government regulation, there is a tension between wanting to keep the cost down and wanting the regulation to be observed, he says, noting that governments are reluctant to insist on regulation that will push up cars' consumer prices. There is often an assumption that companies just want to maximize profits. But Cornis van der Lugt, a senior research fellow with the Centre for Corporate Governance in Africa at the University of Stellenbosch Business School, says that real financial decision-makers are quite often more sophisticated. Many decent investors will tell you it's not just about short-term profit; more importantly, it's about the doability of longer-term cash flows.\\n\\nVan der Lugt also says that business is not against regulation per se and that there are good examples of business self-regulation in the form of setting industrial and reporting standards, such as the Global Reporting Initiative. Still, he notes, it is mostly governments that introduce the requirements for reporting in the first place, but the regulator often leaves it up to the market as to how the companies report and which indicators they use.\\n\\nThe EU has a very long-standing process of increasing the stringency of emission standards from vehicles, says Ekins. That in itself means nothing at all, unless those standards are enforced.\\n\\nThe extent to which the EU and especially the German government are actually interested in enforcing stricter regulations is questionable.\\n\\nThe Guardian recently revealed that the U.K., France and Germany, while publicly calling for investigations, were lobbying to keep the testing loopholes The Guardian report suggested these loopholes would increase real-world carbon dioxide emissions by 14 percent above those being claimed by manufacturers. This was particularly noteworthy in light of the recently concluded COP21 climate summit in Paris, where the international community negotiated on binding targets for emissions.\\n\\nThere are suspicions that some in Germany's government, in a country where so many jobs are connected to the car industry, must have been aware of the fraud committed by VW. Elkins calls that pure speculation. Still, he says, it is understandable that the scandal was first discovered in the United States rather than in Germany.\\n\\nEnvironmental monitoring is meant to be tool that determines whether an environment is fit to live in and detects when problems occur. But there are many conflicts between different interest groups, ranging from citizens and consumers to businesses and governments, that undermine environmental monitoring efforts. Increased transparency on all levels, the right mix of incentives and regulations and participatory processes in setting standards are key to overcoming these conflicts. In the end, it's a question of finding the right mix of rewards and punishments.\\n\\nThis story was originally published on projourno.org."}

{"original": "Public health research has documented racial disparities in health and health care for decades. When looking at the 10 leading causes of death in the U.S. ― including cancer, stroke and heart disease ― mortality rates among black Americans are higher than among white Americans, even after controlling for socioeconomic status factors. Compelling evidence suggests both individual- and institutional-level discrimination cause this disparity. For example, black Americans experience high levels of residential segregation, which limits their access to health resources and exposes them to poor housing quality and environmental toxins.\\n\\nIn contrast, Latino Americans ― and recent immigrants in particular ― appear to experience better health than non-Hispanic white Americans. This occurs despite lower education and income and reduced access to health care services. Researchers call this the Hispanic paradox (or Latino paradox). The exact cause of this phenomenon is not yet well-understood, but some experts speculate healthier diet, strong family ties and lower smoking rates among Latino Americans may be contributing factors.\\n\\nBut what Americans who identify as both Latino and black? Researchers in the U.S. have a tendency to focus on the traditional black-white American binary and forget about individuals at different racial and ethnic intersections. Because of this, we've been ignoring how race further impacts the lives of Latinos in the U.S.\\n\\nIt's important people recognize the racial diversity that exists within the Latino community. We are not a monolithic group.\\n\\nIn the same way it's not entirely clear why health disparities exist between non-Hispanic white Americans and the general Latino-American community. It's also not entirely clear why health disparities exist between Afro-Latino Americans and white Latino Americans in particular. However, opportunity differences may help explain. Afro-Latinos share similar sociodemographic characteristics with that of non-Hispanic black Americans, including high poverty rates, disproportionately low incomes and highly segregated neighborhoods. All of these factors are strong determinants of health; recent studies have shown Latin-American immigrants who identify as black report lower educational achievement (11.64 vs. 12.77 years of education) and weekly earnings ($718.38 vs. $760.95) compared to black Americans.\\n\\nThe number of Latino-Americans who also identify as black has rapidly increased over the past few decades. In 1980, approximately 389,000 Latino-Americans identified as black. Fast forward 30 years, and by 2010, the Afro-Latino population in the U.S. had risen to approximately 1.2 million. The highest percentage of Afro-Latino individuals who self-identify as black are Dominican, followed by Puerto Rican, but it's crucial to note many Latinos, particularly recent immigrants, tend to reject our racial categories here in the U.S. In one Pew Research study, for example, 24 percent of Latino respondents identified themselves specifically as Afro-Latino. However, when asked about their race, only 18 percent of these same Afro-Latino respondents identified as being black. This shows just how complicated self-identification and socially assigned race can be ― and how discrimination, internalized oppression and self-preservation further affects them. All of this influences a person's overall health and well-being.\\n\\nIt's important people recognize the racial diversity that exists within the Latino community. We are not a monolithic group. Our national origins, ethnic backgrounds and indigenous histories are distinct and varied. Social scientists and public health researchers are beginning to recognize this and have identified drastic health inequities within this group. Without question, the Latino-American population as a whole faces economic and social barriers that the average non-Hispanic white American doesn't. But the heaviest health burden of all seems to fall on Latinos who have darker skin or who identify as black.\\n\\nWhere do we go from here? Public health researchers must identify which health inequities disproportionately affect Afro-Latino Americans, figure out their causes and come up with ways to appropriately address them. This community will continue to suffer if we do not take these inequities seriously and come up with viable policy solutions. The racial diversity that exists within the Latino-American community also gives the rest of us an opportunity to expand beyond the traditional binary black-white discourse when we talk about race-related issues here in the U.S; anti-black discrimination affects members of Latino communities, too.\\n\\nWe've been ignoring how race further impacts the lives of Latinos in the U.S.\\n\\nFinally, we must be self-reflective and take a look at how our actions contribute to these social and health inequities. We are not independent of the system that created these issues. We all contribute to today's injustices. We must check our own biases and speak up when we feel certain issues are not being adequately addressed.\\n\\nTo understand the Latino-American experience, we ultimately have to acknowledge race plays an important role. Historically, race has been a strong determinant of education, income and health. As we continue to undo the effects of past injustice and build policies to prevent further discrimination, we must make sure marginalized groups are not being forgotten. Race and ethnicity are not just black and white. They're not even just black, white and Latino. The answers lie at the intersections.\\n\\nAdolfo G.

The driver of the first modern wave of Iranian settlement in Canada was the 1979 revolution that overthrew the monarchy, and another wave of arrivals can be traced to reformists and political refugees fleeing after the 2009 revolution.\\n\\nAs the situation in Iran worsened and became more unstable, increasingly more people leave Iran and come to Canada, she said.\\n\\nThe plane crash has seen a direct channel of communication open between the Iranian and Canadian government; Foreign Affairs Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne minister spoke to his Iranian counterpart late Wednesday about the investigation into the tragedy.\\n\\nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau suggested Thursday that while Canada does have significant issues with Iran, this situation is something different.\\n\\nIt is clear we are coming together in the wake of a terrible tragedy, he said at a news conference, where he disclosed that intelligence indicates the plane was shot down by an Iranian missile, possibly by accident.\\n\\nOne can't forget that the majority of victims on that airline were Iranian citizens and this is something that binds us together in our grief and I think the desire for answers from families who lost loved ones is fairly universal.\\n\\nJafari said the relationship between Canada and Iran, including ongoing sanctions, causes continuing difficulties for the diaspora beyond immigration logistics.\\n\\nYou don't have any other communities where the two nodes of your personality, and of your citizenship, and of your being are at such odds with each other, she said.\\n\\nThere aren't many other countries that the U.S. and Canada have such huge concerns with other than Iran.

{"original": "ASSOCIATED PRESS A woman looks at a wall painted with portraits of U.S. President Donald Trump and Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Ahmedabad on Feb. 18, 2020.\\n\\nNEW DELHI — On 5 June, 2019, the Trump Administration removed India from its Generalised System of Preference Program (GSP), a preferential trade agreement for developing countries under which Indian goods worth $5.7 billion had gone into the United States duty free. A day after the U.S. President Donald Trump announced his first official trip to India, his government removed India from a list of developing countries that are given trade benefits on the grounds that India is a member of the G-20. This naturally makes it harder for India to regain its GSP status, a key demand from New Delhi in the fraught negotiations with Washington.\\n\\nThis has happened despite Prime Minister Narendra Modi's best efforts to woo President Trump.\\n\\nAs Modi and Trump smile and wave over the next two days, Kashish Parpiani of the Observer Research Foundation in Mumbai explains the intricacies of the trade deal and the harsh fallout of American conservatism in India.\\n\\nTensions have really reached a crescendo, he said.\\n\\nTensions have really reached a crescendo.\\n\\nWhat is this trade deal between India and the United States?\\n\\nIndia and the US do not have a formal trading arrangement. They do not have a formal security arrangement. But still the US-India relationship has been promising. We are at $142.6 billion in terms of annual trade of goods and services. In terms of military cooperation, we do the most number of exercises with the Americans than with any other country. It seems a lot of natural convergences have borne this progress.\\n\\nNow, there is a need to formalise and institutionalise this relationship in formal agreements. A trade agreement is certainly a part of that. But what is baffling is that the trade deficit between India and the US has been narrowing in the past three years. Despite that, tensions have increased.\\n\\nThe trade deficit between India and the US is less than a tenth of the trade deficit that the US has with China. And still, tensions have increased. It gives you a sense that American apprehensions on this matter, on trade with India, go beyond mere consideration on trade imbalances. It's about duties. From an American point of view, it's about gaining fair access into the Indian market.\\n\\nWhat are obstacles to the trade deal?\\n\\nDairy is one. On dairy, it is not an issue of tariffs but certification. India has been saying that the American dairy products can surely come into India, but they have to assure the Indian consumer via packaging, that none of the products that are up for sale are procured from animals that have been fed blood meal. Blood meal is a protein supplement that the American dairy industry uses to get greater yield from their cattle. It is derived from dead ruminating animals, dead bones, dead blood and so on. India is putting the argument that it hurts our religious sentiments if products like that are going to be up for sale and no one is going to buy them. So, the U.S. dairy industry needs to create a different production line just to cater to the Indian market. A production line in which cattle have not been fed blood meal and reinvest in a specific packaging for the Indian market. That is what their dairy industry has not been willing to do.\\n\\nWhat are the other hurdles?\\n\\nThe other hurdle is that the Indian government brings down the prices of American pharmaceutical products like coronary stents and any implants by nearly 65% to 80%. We do that because our consumer base is largely middle income that cannot afford to pay humongous prices for these vital products. The Americans say if you want to do that then do that, but why should we take a hit on our per unit cost. You do that on the landed cost. You give us our margins on the per unit cost. The Indians are countering that by saying that don't think about the per unit cost, but think about the big market that you are entering. The sheer quantity that you will sell will give you your numbers.\\n\\nThese are two big issues.\\n\\nHow would Trump's re-election — if it happens — change the dynamics of this trade deal?\\n\\nIt would definitely become harder. The Americans are approaching India with the attitude that if you are not going to do this deal now then wait till President Trump gets re-elected. The Americans are saying that then you will be forced to deal with us again and you may not get the terms that we are offering you currently. You can expect Trump to get a little harsher and unconstrained on trade because he is not going to have the pressures of re-election.\\n\\nYou can expect Trump to get a little harsher and unconstrained on trade...\\n\\nIs removing India from its Generalised System of Preference (GSP) list connected with the trade deal?\\n\\nFrom what I understand of how the Trump administration negotiates, it likes to get competitive leverage by pursuing a zero-sum game. It's been long known that a partial trade deal will happen between India and the US and the US wants to get more access to agricultural goods, dairy products, Harley Davidson motorcycles amongst other things.\\n\\nNow, what does India want in exchange? For India, it was let's get our GSP benefits reinstated. In 2017, India was the biggest beneficiary of the GSP program. Products worth $5.7 billion went into the U.S. duty free. It was natural that GSP is something that India wants again in exchange for a limited trade deal.\\n\\nBut what does the Trump Administration do? It announces last week the dates of the president's visit to India and barely two days after that the office of the U.S. trade negotiator releases a federal notice, talking about how he is kicking particular countries off a list, which is a list of the developing countries of the world that pose no threat to American industry and businesses. India was thrown off with the rationale that India is a developed country and not a developing country anymore.\\n\\nIndia was thrown off with the rationale that India is a developed country and not a developing country anymore.\\n\\nHow is that connected to GSP?\\n\\nIt is connected to GSP because GSP is a preferential trade arrangement only for the developing countries. Now, when Indian negotiators go back to the table and say that we want GSP back, the Americans will say that you are classified as a developed country from now on. That is the American way of negotiating that has increasingly come to the fore under Robert Lighthizer (United States Trade Representative). This is classic American conservatism on trade.\\n\\nThis is classic American conservatism on trade.\\n\\nWhat is going on with the H1-B visa?\\n\\nIndia is trying to get a totalisation agreement on people who have H1-Bs. A totalisation agreement is how do you square the circle on social security and taxes when you have individuals who split their time between the US and India. That is the next step on to the axiom that Indians are going to continue to dominate H1B visas. But immigration being such a hotbed issue and at the core of Trump's 2016 campaign, and possibly once again in the 2020 campaign, I don't think anyone wants to sort out the H1B visa, right now. It's going to be on the back-burner.\\n\\nI don't think anyone wants to sort out the H1B visa, right now.\\n\\nHas the NDA government continued the UPA government's approach to the US?\\n\\nIn many ways, it's been a continuum with the U.S. Not only has it taken the baton forward, it has only built on it.\\n\\nPM Modi has made great efforts to woo Trump. Why is there so much friction?\\n\\nI think it's about both sides failing to progress the issue beyond a top heavy approach. For the longest time in the post Cold War-era, the relationship has largely been dependent on the political chemistry between the two heads of state, whether it is a Bush and Manmohan, who enjoyed working together, or Obama and Manmohan, where Obama revered Manmohan Singh's advice on macroeconomics even when it came to the eurozone crisis. There is a lot of personality driven partnership and camaraderie there. The same for Modi and Obama and Modi and Trump as it was for Clinton and Vajpayee.\\n\\nNot being able to move away from this top heavy approach is a failure. If we had moved away then we wouldn't have been at a stage where a head of state, in this case Trump, would be used as a leverage point to say — he is coming next week — do you want to get this deal done or not. If we had progressed on building this relationship on multiple levels, these issues would not play out in the open. These would be settled behind a consultative dialogue that happens behind closed doors.\\n\\nLook at some of the allies that America has — Japan, South Korea, Canada, Mexico, the UK. Trump has a style of insulting and being brash about things on Twitter, but mostly issues with these countries have been solved behind closed doors because their relationships have been institutionalised over 40, 50, 60 years. With institutionalised relationships, a lot of these differences get divided down the political ladder, where empowered cabinet secretaries can make decisions. With India and the U.S., it's a one step forward and two steps back kind of situation.\\n\\nWith India and the U.S., it's a one step forward and two steps back kind of situation.\\n\\nDoes Trump see India as a defence partner?\\n\\nTrump has a thing about buying American. The buy American plan is to make it easier for defence companies to sell to foreign nations. There are two tracks of arms procurement from the US. There is the DCS (Direct Commercial Sales) track and the other is the FMS (Foreign Military Sales) track.\\n\\nForeign Military Sales have to be routed through the government, through the US Congress, because some platforms are so sensitive that the US government needs to sign off on it first. In the case of DCS, you don't need that approval from the political establishment. These could be small ancillary weaponry, not big platforms like fighter jets.\\n\\nUnder Trump, the state department has reduced the red tape in terms of increasing the relevance of DCS track. The gains of that were witnessed in the year after Trump took office when Americans hit their highest peak at 55.66 billion dollars because of these actions. It is a priority for the Trump administration to sell more and India emerges as a natural partner. India, after Saudi Arabia, is the largest importer for arms. Why wouldn't they want to tap into this rising economy that is increasingly going to have enough economic heft to spend as much on its defence?\\n\\nIs Trump carrying on the Clinton-Bush-Obama legacy when it comes to India?\\n\\nIn many ways, yes. The Obama administration while leaving talked about India getting status as a major defence partner. In 2016, the Trump administration put that into policy. It's not been grounded in legislative precedent yet. The bill on that has not yet been voted upon, but the executive branch led by Trump has put that into force already.\\n\\nThe Trump administration has also accorded India with the Strategic Trade Authorization - 1 status. India is now the only third Asian country after Japan and South Korea to have that designation for arms export. There is a commitment not only to continue on that legacy but also build on it by making it easier for future administrations to sell more and engage in Indian capacity building.\\n\\nDoes the Trump base in the U.S. care about his trip to India?\\n\\nIt plays really well with the Trump base. We buy almonds worth $600 million from the U.S. The produce comes mainly from California, which is the liberal stronghold of the Democratic party. Trump saying let's see how big the Indian market is for nuts and let's try selling them pecan nuts becomes an election talking point. Pecan nuts are mostly based in Trump land, the flyover states like Georgia. He says my trade deal with India is really helping you because I just got you another market. Instead of buying almonds, they will also buy pecan nuts. In that sense, the Trump base cares what happens with India.\\n\\nIt feels like Trump is calling all the shots?\\n\\nMaybe we have seen the writing on the wall that Trump is going to come back. So, this is the time that you appease so that Trump 2.0 will be a little less aggressive on the trade front. I think that's a calculation that a lot of other countries also made when they gave the Trump Administration a renegotiated deal, especially China. Why would China offer a phase 1 deal at the end of January, a minimal but a symbolic victory?\\n\\nIf you look into the deal, it's nothing of great substance. It's a lot of Chinese declaration to buy more from the Americans and nothing more than that. Nothing on intellectual property, nothing on theft of intellectual property or forced transfer of technology to Chinese counterparts. None of those systemic changes or reforms, but just a lot of commitments. That too is enough for Trump to go back to his base and say that he has been productive in term one. I think that's a calculation that we are making as well"}
{"original": "There's one key step Congress could take to help the millions of women struggling to care for children at home due to school and day care closures, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) told HuffPost: pass paid sick and family leave in the next COVID-19 relief package.\\n\\nMillions of women have left the workforce since the start of the pandemic, and this could stem the tide.\\n\\nThis is an idea whose time has not only come, but one that is an elegant solution to the epidemic we're in right now, said Gillibrand, who has long advocated for paid leave.\\n\\nGillibrand, along with Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) and Reps. Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn.) and Ayanna Pressley (D-Mass.), sent a letter to the incoming Biden administration and congressional leaders on Wednesday, urging them to prioritize paid leave.\\n\\nEmergency paid leave provisions passed in Congress with bipartisan support in March, but the benefits expired at the end of the year. And those measures only covered workers at some small businesses. The U.S. is among the few developed countries that do not mandate paid time off to sick workers.\\n\\nIn their letter, the lawmakers pressed President-elect Joe Biden, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and incoming Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) to extend that leave and expand it to cover more workers.\\n\\nWe need people who are sick to be able to afford to stay home in order to curb the spread of the virus, and to keep their jobs to be able to provide for their families, they wrote.\\n\\nHuffPost spoke with Gillibrand on Wednesday about paid leave, how the Senate can balance COVID-19 relief and impeachment, and various other crises facing the new administration.\\n\\nDoes it feel like an uphill battle around paid leave at a time like this, when there's just so much going on?\\n\\nI think it will feel less like an uphill battle after the inauguration. I'm going to work very hard next week, to make sure it is included in the next COVID package.\\n\\nWhy prioritize paid leave? There's also vaccine rollout, state and local aid and extending unemployment.\\n\\nObviously, they're all extremely high priorities. But one of the most significant facts is that last month there were 140,000 jobs lost in the United States. And that job loss was 100% women. Most were women of color.\\n\\nSo we are in a crisis in this country, where women wage earners are losing their jobs, losing their ability to provide for their family, and losing their long term earning potential.\\n\\nOne of the best ways to fix that issue is to offer universal paid leave to all workers.\\n\\nCOVID and this epidemic and the economic collapse have really fallen on the shoulders of a lot of women. Because when children aren't allowed to go to school because of COVID, [women are] often designated immediately as the caregiver who has to stay home.\\n\\nHow do you envision the Senate balancing this COVID relief package with an impeachment trial?\\n\\nWell, the impeachment trial is necessary because of the crimes and misdemeanors committed by President Trump. You certainly can walk and chew gum at the same time.\\n\\nI believe you can absolutely complete our work on this COVID package. At the same time, we can start a trial to convict President Trump of inciting violence, of inciting a riot, inciting sedition, as well as the efforts he made to undermine the electoral results in Georgia.\\n\\nIt's not that difficult to write the COVID bill now. We've been working on this bill since May, since the House introduced a robust COVID package. The Senate has been trying to perfect those ideas.\\n\\nPaul Morigi via Getty Images Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) told HuffPost she's pushing to include paid leave in the next COVID-19 relief package Congress takes up.\\n\\nWhy did pay leave expire in the first place? It's such a no-brainer.\\n\\nFirst of all, [it's] something that Mitch McConnell has never cared about. And we've been unable to convince Senate Republicans to care about. Second, there's not enough women in Congress. That is an impediment, because, again, not all members of Congress understand the disproportionate impact COVID's placed onto the shoulders of women and caregivers.\\n\\nWhat would this paid leave look like?\\n\\nFirst of all, it would apply to all workers. It wouldn't just be limited to small businesses. Secondly, it would apply to all life events. So whether you have to stay home because of COVID or you have a family member who has to stay home because of COVID or a child who has to stay home because schools are closed or you're sick yourself, you are entitled to up to three months paid at 66% of your wage to meet those needs. And it would extend to the end of the pandemic.\\n\\nDo you envision a more permanent paid leave law happening now that Democrats have the Senate? If the impediment was basically Mitch McConnell as majority leader, now that's gone.\\n\\nCorrect. Now the bill can be authored in part by Chuck Schumer and Patty Murray, two people who deeply care about national paid leave. And the tiebreaker will be Kamala Harris, who equally is passionate about paid leave, as is President Biden.\\n\\nHe continues to show no contrition. And he continues to not see that he is the instigator of this violence. Kirsten Gillibrand on President Donald Trump\\n\\nWhat else do you want to see in a relief package?\\n\\nOh, I want to see a great deal of resources for cities and states. I want to make sure there's provisions for food stamps and food assistance, because there's a lot of hunger in my state and in the country right now. I want to make sure we fund the health force to implement a vaccination program around the country, because the pace for getting vaccines out is unacceptable. And if we can hire hundreds of thousands more workers, and train them to support our nurses, and doctors and do these vaccinations, through centralized locations, we can get more vaccines.\\n\\nWith regard to vaccine roll out, it seems like it's a mess.\\n\\nIt's an absolute mess, it is inadequate, it is too slow. It was poorly planned. And these are all failings of the Trump administration.\\n\\nI'm curious about other priorities of the Senate and the Biden administration after COVID relief. And one thing I've heard is that universal pre-K is on the agenda.\\n\\nI hope so. Mothers and fathers cannot go back to work if you don't restore day care. We've lost so many day care centers because of the epidemic. As small businesses, they've been unable to survive. They didn't get resources for the additional PPE or the additional [social distancing] needs. Before the pandemic, for every four children looking for day care spots, there was only one spot. Now, for every eight children that are looking for a spot, there's only one spot. So the need has exponentially grown.\\n\\nAnd so the care economy needs to be addressed directly. And we need to pay our caregivers more. We need to pay people who are full time caregivers, and we need to make sure our daycare workers are paid above the minimum wage and have real careers.\\n\\nIt seems like every policy you were banging the drum about before COVID, COVID has made it clear just how necessary they are.\\n\\nSo necessary. It's very frustrating. If they would just listen.\\n\\nOn a separate note: How scared are you about members of Congress being attacked ― or worse ― at the inauguration? What's your level of fear? What was it last week? And what is it now?\\n\\nI'm not afraid. I was not afraid last week for my own safety, but I have deep concerns that we will be attacked again. And I have voiced those concerns. Our national security team is far more prepared for the next set of protests and possible violence and riots than they were on the sixth. So I'm grateful for that work and effort.\\n\\nBut I'm still very concerned that there will be further violence, which is one of the reasons why I support not only impeachment, but Article 25, as well as for prosecution of President Trump. He continues to show no contrition. And he continues to not see that he is the instigator of this violence.\\n\\nThis interview has been condensed and edited for clarity."}
{"original": "Easter is a time for family, colorful parties and egg hunts, but sadly it also attracts scam artists looking to make a quick buck during the high-fructose corn syrup free-for-all.\\n\\nThere are all stripes of Eastertime cons and scams waiting for you if you're not paying attention — or even if you are. Some don't really qualify as scams, whether we're talking about those colorful plastic eggs for storing treats, sometimes loaded with lead paint, that old favorite Kinder Eggs, now illegal due to choking hazards, or folks selling bad chocolate. First and foremost, you need to be a savvy consumer.\\n\\nBut awareness isn't such an easy thing when there are so many ways a person can get scammed. Here are six scams to watch out for.\\n\\n1. Charity Scams\\n\\nSome people say Easter was originally a pagan holiday to celebrate fertility, which explains the eggs and bunnies, but it's primarily a religious holiday, and as such there are plenty of scams out there pointed at spiritually minded people looking to make the world a better place.\\n\\nIf you get an email from a charity, even if it's one you've given to in the past, don't click any links. Type in the URL or find it through search and make sure the address is correct. Scam sites will often be slightly different than legitimate ones. And although this should go without saying, never give a donation over the phone if you receive an unsolicited solicitation. Call the charity, or use a secure site to make your contribution rather than providing your information by phone, or send a check.\\n\\n2. E-Cards\\n\\nAs I've said ad nauseam, including in my book Swiped: How to Protect Yourself in a World Full of Scammers, Phishers and Identity Thieves, never click strange links or download files you receive — even e-cards that appear to be from loved ones or friends. E-cards can mask links to malware.\\n\\n3. Cute Meme Scams\\n\\nThe same thing goes for all the cute stuff you get via email this time of year. Before you click on the link below a message, ask yourself: Is it worth hours of hassle getting a virus off your computer or causing malware to install ransomware or a keystroke logger on your machine that gives a crook access to every financial account you visit on your computer?\\n\\n4. Pet Scams\\n\\nFor better or worse (usually worse for the animals), adorable pet babies are a gift idea associated with Easter. In addition to the question as to whether unexpected livestock or woodland creatures are a good idea, if you're going to go pet shopping for the holiday, beware that scammers are lying in wait to grab your money and disappear into thin air. Whenever buying a pet, do it in person.\\n\\n5. Airline Scams\\n\\nEaster Week is often during a school recess, and many people try to book last-minute travel. Be very careful when booking flights. Take the time to determine whether or not it's a scam. For starters, only do business with a secure (look for the padlock next to the URL) and well-reviewed site, and make sure the address is correct. (You can see more tips for surfing the internet safely here.) Also take the time to read and understand the privacy policy.\\n\\nIt could be that you receive an email or a phone call informing you that you have a chance to cash in on a big win: Free airline tickets. There have been several attempts to contact you about the tickets (you won them through a sweepstakes you have never heard of, in which you were automatically enrolled when you purchased some product or service you can't recall, and you're going to lose the tickets if you don't act quickly. There are certain requirements. But meeting those obligations will cost you far more than the alleged free tickets.\\n\\n6. Last-Minute Vacation Rental Scam\\n\\nThe scam happens when a thief finds a rental property online and uses the details to create his or her own website and listing. There may even be bogus five-star reviews, and the deal will sound particularly affordable, possibly due to a one-day-only internet sale. You book the listing, pay either by credit card or wire transfer, and pack your bags.\\n\\nHere's the problem: When the time comes and you show up for your vacation, that's not your condo. It's not just a matter of bait and switch, where the gorgeous property on the website doesn't exactly live up to the reality. In this case, the property is very real and even very beautiful … but you didn't rent it. There may even be another family inside. You now find yourself on vacation with nowhere to sleep, and your scammer is nowhere to be found.\\n\\nTip: Whenever you're booking a rental property — for any reason, not just a beach getaway — there's a sneaky little trick you can use to verify the authenticity of the listing and the property. Instead of emailing, call the person, but first do an online search for other businesses in the area surrounding the property, then ask the contact some specific questions to which you've already figured out the answers. How far is it to the nearest beach access? Where is the nearest restaurant with a kids' menu? How far are we from an emergency room in case someone in our group gets hurt?\\n\\nThe thing about an Easter sugar high is that it makes you happy, and then you crash. When it comes to these scams, it's all crash and no high. If you have reason to believe you've been the victim of a scam, don't brush it off.

{"original": "When it takes control on Thursday, the new House Democratic majority plans on serious oversight of corporate monopolies and the lax enforcement from federal antitrust agencies. It will target tech giants like Google and Facebook and health insurers Aetna, Cigna, Humana and Anthem while making sure Federal Trade Commission regulators are doing their job.\\n\\nThe Dems' new push will focus on three areas: consolidation of health care markets driving up prices for consumers, the monopolization of big tech platforms and anti-competitive labor abuses like non-compete agreements and wage fixing. Hearings on these issues could even result in the first major rewrite of antitrust law since the 1950s.\\n\\nDemocrats increasingly see antitrust policy in the same vein that they have come to view campaign finance reform ― a fundamental structural problem underlying the many issues of skyrocketing health care costs, lower wages, lack of labor mobility, rising prices, fewer local businesses and less political power. A 2018 poll by the anti-monopoly group Open Markets Institute found 76 percent of respondents believed big corporations have too much power over your family and your community.\\n\\nThere's been a growing recognition that many of the central concerns of the Democratic Party, namely on inequality and regional inequality, are being driven by concentration and a lack of antitrust enforcement, Zach Freed, a researcher at the Institute for Local Self-Reliance, an anti-monopoly nonprofit, said.\\n\\nLeading the charge on antitrust for Democrats is Rep. David Cicilline (D-R.I.) who will take the helm of the antitrust subcommittee within the House Judiciary Committee in January.\\n\\nBloomberg via Getty Images Rep. David Cicilline (D-R.I.) will lead Democrats' investigations into corporate monopolies as head of the antitrust panel on the House Judiciary Committee.\\n\\nCicilline has emerged as an aggressive voice calling for a break with the antitrust status quo that has turned a blind eye to the extreme consolidation across the economy. He helped launch a congressional antitrust caucus and is the lead sponsor of key antitrust reform bills that range from giving the news media more power to organize against digital ad monopolies like Google and Facebook to modernizing the antitrust laws passed during the age of Teddy Roosevelt.\\n\\nHe intends to host hearings to build a record and obtain analysis from experts and to craft legislation to rein in consolidation and anti-competitive behavior in health care markets, the big tech platforms and labor contracts. He will also plan aggressive oversight of the Federal Trade Commission, the main antitrust regulator that has enabled extreme corporate consolidation over the past 40 years thanks to the adoption of pro-monopoly economic theories by lawyers and economists of both political parties.\\n\\nProponents of aggressive antitrust enforcement are excited about Cicilline's rise to the chairman's seat on the antitrust panel.\\n\\nThey've been doing a great job of elevating the issue of antitrust ― scrutinizing the enforcement of the oversight agency for the first time in a long time, Marshall Steinbaum, fellow at the progressive Roosevelt Institute, said about Cicilline and Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee.\\n\\nIt's gonna be great, Matt Stoller, fellow at Open Markets Institute, said. Man, we're going to kick some ass.\\n\\nCicilline may be a lawyer, but he didn't come to Congress with expertise in antitrust. After he became ranking member of the antitrust subcommittee, he noticed how the consolidation problems that he was investigating in his oversight role overlapped with the broader inequality issues that Democrats were trying to tackle.\\n\\nAs I began to do this work I really came to realize that this fundamental question of, 'How do we get the economy working again for everyone in this country so that working people have a fighting chance to get ahead?' is really connected to this very serious concentration of economic power, and concentration of political power, and it's getting worse rather than getting better, Cicilline said.\\n\\nCicilline was one of a number of members who pushed for the inclusion of strong antitrust principles in the Democratic Party's midterm policy platform. That Better Deal platform included very strong language calling for a new antitrust consensus and a focus on breaking up consolidated markets and giving workers more power and more pay.\\n\\nAlthough the Democrats' Better Deal policy program mentioned consolidation in markets from oil and gas to eyeglasses, it notably left out the problem of big tech monopolies. Cicilline, however, is one of Silicon Valley's biggest critics on Capitol Hill. He told Facebook that it cannot be trusted to regulate itself and got Google CEO Sundar Pichai to admit that Google was considering launching a search engine in China.\\n\\nASSOCIATED PRESS House Democrats will continue to investigate Mark Zuckerberg's Facebook for monopolistic practices in the social media and online advertising markets.\\n\\nHe intends on hosting more hearings with tech CEOs and technologists who analyze competition on digital platforms to develop a better understanding of how these tech trusts dominate markets and crush competition. This will result in legislation that could enable users to port their data from one social platform to another or mandate the platforms become interoperable with each other and future competitors.\\n\\nCongressional Democrats are supportive of this push for more antitrust oversight. Rep. Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.), the incoming chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, told antitrust regulators at an oversight hearing in December that Congress had abdicated its role for too long by allowing pro-big business administrations, both Republican and Democratic, to erode antitrust laws.\\n\\nThe decline in enforcement over the last several decades has also been an economic catastrophe for millions of workers, Nadler said.\\n\\nThere is even interest in stronger antitrust oversight from Republicans on the Judiciary committee. Rep. Doug Collins (R-Ga.), the next ranking member on the committee, has taken umbrage at consolidation in the pharmacy benefit manager market. He introduced legislation to shine a light on the anti-competitive practices in the industry to uncover how they are driving up consumer costs for drugs.\\n\\nBut where the Republican leadership was not interested in prioritizing these issues in the last Congress, the Democratic Party leadership is insistent on pursuing them.\\n\\nWhat has been really remarkable is there has been a really significant kind of renewal of interest in antitrust in the Congress, Cicilline observes. I think there is sort of a reawakening of the kind of understanding the critical impact that competition and antitrust enforcement has in getting the economy to work right."}
{"original": "After nine years of playing defense on Obamacare, Democratic leaders at the state and local level want to go on offense when it comes to health care.\\n\\nNew plans announced by California Gov. Gavin Newsom, Washington Gov. Jay Inslee and New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio this week also demonstrate that ideas short of single-payer could partially address the shortcomings of America's health care system ― and reach people the Affordable Care Act did not.\\n\\nNewsom, Inslee and de Blasio all support the implementation of a national, government-run single-payer health care system, but that's not the focus of this round of policy proposals.\\n\\n\\n\\nInstead, the two governors are calling for new programs ― and spending ― to shore up the health insurance market for people who find Affordable Care Act exchange policies too expensive. In New York, the mayor is eyeing a local plan to use city money to cover medical expenses for uninsured residents. The California and New York City proposals include assistance for undocumented immigrants, who are ineligible for federal programs like Medicaid and the health insurance exchanges.\\n\\nDemocrats are bullish on health care as an electoral issue after focusing on President Donald Trump's agenda during the midterm elections last year, during which the party won control of the U.S. House and made gains in state legislatures and governors' offices around the country. In addition, voters in Idaho, Nebraska and Utah ― three reliably Republican states ― approved ballot initiatives to expand coverage for low-income residents through Medicaid.\\n\\nNotably, Inslee and de Blasio are potential presidential candidates this cycle, something Newsom has ruled out. Newsom is in his first days as California governor after winning election in November, while Inslee and de Blasio are each in their second terms in office.\\n\\nSingle-payer health care proposals have become mainstream among Democratic officials at all levels of government in the wake of Vermont independent Sen. Bernie Sanders's 2016 Democratic presidential campaign and electoral wins last year by proponents of the policy who now serve in Congress and state legislatures.\\n\\nOther Democrats have proposed an expanded government role in providing health coverage and medical care through means such as a public option plan that would compete with private health insurance or proposals to allow consumers to buy into Medicare or Medicaid.\\n\\nBut it's virtually certain that no major expansions are going to happen in Washington for the next two years because Republicans still control the Senate and the White House. Their agenda has focused for years on scaling back federal and state programs that provide assistance to low- and middle-income families and would lead to millions fewer Americans covered.\\n\\nAt least for now, it's up to the states ― and cities ― to act.\\n\\nLots of time and energy has been put into taking away health care from tens of millions of people, de Blasio said Tuesday during a press conference at a Bronx hospital. What we're doing here in New York City, we're getting health care to a lot of people who never had it before. We're going the opposite direction.\\n\\nCalifornia, New York and Washington are among the states that embraced the Affordable Care Act by immediately adopting its Medicaid expansion for low-income adults and by creating state-run health insurance exchanges.\\n\\nThese states also already have relatively generous health care safety nets. The uninsured rates in all three states are below the national average of 10 percent as of 2017, the most recent year for which Census data on the uninsured at the state level are available.\\n\\nWe have done fantastic things in the state, with one of ― if not the ― most successful health care efforts in the United States, Inslee said at Tuesday press conference, just hours after de Blasio's. But there is more to do.\\n\\nJae C. Hong/Associated Press California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) is pushing for policies to expand health care access in his state.\\n\\nThe California Plan\\n\\nSingle-payer is still the main topic of political discussion in California, and among the moves Newsom made on Monday was to send a letter to the Trump administration and congressional leaders calling for legislation that would give states like his the authority to craft their own single-payer systems.\\n\\nBut given that single-payer is staunchly opposed by Republicans in Washington and has struggled to get sufficient support even in California's Democratic-controlled legislature, the more consequential action, for now, will likely be on three other parts of Newsom's announcement.\\n\\nOne is a call to substantially increase the financial assistance available to people who buy private insurance through Covered California, which is the online insurance marketplace that the state runs as part of the Affordable Care Act.\\n\\nUnder the Affordable Care Act, tax credits are available to people whose incomes are up to four times the poverty line, or $48,500 for an individual and $100,400 a year for a family of four. People with higher incomes can find coverage difficult, if not impossible, to afford ― even in California, where the marketplace is considered among the most successful in the country.\\n\\nAnd because the tax credits are available on a sliding scale, relative to income, even some people eligible for assistance struggle with either premiums, high out-of-pocket costs or both.\\n\\nNewsom is calling for legislation that would make many more people eligible for assistance ― increasing the thresholds all the way up to $72,840 for individuals and $150,600 for a family of four. The legislation would also provide more assistance for people who already qualify.\\n\\nIn order to offset the cost of those new subsidies, Newsom wants to reinstate the financial penalty for people who do not have insurance ― a penalty that was part of the Affordable Care Act until congressional Republicans and Trump eliminated it, effective this year. This would make California the fourth state to adopt an individual mandate with a penalty; Massachusetts, New Jersey and Vermont already have such a policy in law.\\n\\nFinally, Newsom called for legislation that would open up Medi-Cal, the state's version of the Medicaid program, to undocumented young adults. California already offers Medi-Cal to undocumented immigrants until they turn 19. This would push the eligibility age up to 26.\\n\\nA similar proposal that the state legislature considered last year would have cost an estimated $250 million per year, according to the Los Angeles Times, and it would all have to come from California because federal dollars cannot be spent on health care programs for undocumented immigrants under the Affordable Care Act and other laws.\\n\\nThe outlook for any of these proposals in the state legislature is unclear. California has a history of aggressive action to help people get health care, up to and including its implementation of the Affordable Care Act. But some of its more ambitious initiatives have failed because legislators could not agree on funding and the state constitution requires a two-thirds vote for new taxes.\\n\\nThe other initiative Newsom announced Monday will affect prescription drugs and won't require legislative action because Newsom was able to use executive authority. He issued an order that will allow one state agency to negotiate prices for all state programs that purchase drugs. That includes Medi-Cal, which by itself insures some 13 million people.\\n\\nWhether it succeeds in reducing drug prices meaningfully ultimately will depend on a number of factors, not least among them the ability ― and willingness ― of state negotiators to exclude popular but duplicative drugs from coverage because manufacturers won't agree to lower prices.\\n\\nTed S. Warren/Associated Press Washington Gov. Jay Inslee (D) called for a public option in his state.\\n\\nThe Washington State Plan\\n\\nInslee's plan is the most straightforward and most familiar, because he wants the state legislature to create something that progressives have wanted as part of the Affordable Care Act all along. He's calling for the state to create a public option ― a stand-alone insurance plan, which a state agency would manage, available to people buying coverage on their own through the state's exchange, Washington Healthplanfinder.\\n\\nAt the Tuesday press conference, Inslee said the plan would be available in all parts of the state, in part to fulfill one of its chief goals: to make sure everybody has coverage available. Washington, like many states, has had trouble keeping insurers from abandoning rural areas. This year, 14 counties in the state have only one carrier.\\n\\nThe public option would reimburse doctors, hospitals and other providers of health care at the rate that the federal Medicare program uses, Inslee said.\\n\\nThat is no minor thing. Medicare pays far less than commercial insurers and hospitals say the reimbursements are not sufficient to cover their costs. It's why a public option could potentially offer lower premiums but also why, historically, proposals have generated such intense opposition from hospitals.\\n\\nIn his remarks, Inslee talked about the Washingtonians who were grateful for the coverage they'd gotten from the Affordable Care Act over the last few years ― and those who were still struggling, even with the law fully in place.\\n\\nWe still have thousands of people in the state of Washington who still do not have that comfort, who still live under the anxiety of a potential loss of coverage, who still are dealing not only with the problem of a disease but the problem of anxiety over their economic circumstances, Inslee said.\\n\\nDrew Angerer/Getty Images New York Mayor Bill de Blasio (D) said his plan would be available to the 600,000 city residents who currently are uninsured.\\n\\nThe New York City Plan\\n\\nThe goal of the New York City plan is to promise access to health coverage and health care services to all of the city's 8.6 million residents, de Blasio said.\\n\\nFrom this moment on, in New York City, everyone is guaranteed the right to health care, de Blasio said.\\n\\nAccording to the mayor, 600,000 New Yorkers who currently are uninsured would be eligible for existing programs he wants to expand and for a new medical care program. Based on that figure, the uninsured rate in New York City is about 7 percent, the same as New York state and lower than the national rate of 10 percent as of 2017, according to Census data.\\n\\nMedical services for this population will cost the city about $100 million a year once his plan is fully implemented over the next two years, de Blasio said.\\n\\nAbout half of those newly eligible people are undocumented immigrants, de Blasio said. The remaining uninsured generally are people who don't qualify for Medicaid or other city, state and federal programs, including New York State of Health, the insurance exchange. The new initiatives will target young adults in particular, he said.\\n\\nThe plan has two parts. The first is an expansion and enhanced enrollment outreach for MetroPlus, a city-run insurance program. The second is the creation of what de Blasio called NYC Care, which would give uninsured residents ― especially undocumented immigrants ― access to medical and mental health care services provided by hospitals and clinics managed by a city agency.\\n\\nPatients would pay for care on a sliding scale based on their income, he said. These programs would build on New York City's and New York state's health care safety net, which is more comprehensive than in most states.\\n\\nDe Blasio reiterated his support for single-payer health care, both at the national level and in New York state.\\n\\nThe majority-Democratic New York Assembly passed single-payer health care bills several times in recent years, but the state Senate ― then controlled by Republicans ― didn't take up the measure. Democrats now have a majority in both chambers of the legislature and are set to reconsider single-payer, although Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) has expressed skepticism.\\n\\nNew York wouldn't be the first municipality to carry out a plan seeking universal coverage. San Francisco enacted a similar plan in 2007, while Newsom was mayor, and one of that plan's architects now is a de Blasio adviser. Los Angeles County, California, and the District of Columbia also have local programs that provide coverage and services to uninsured residents that predate the Affordable Care Act."}

A global energy revolution is clearly underway.\\n\\nWhat catalyzed this transformation?\\n\\nIn our latest study, Faster and Cleaner 2: Kick-Starting Decarbonization, we looked at the trends driving decarbonization in three key sectors of the global energy system – power, transportation, and buildings.\\n\\nBy following the emission commitments and actions of countries, we examined what forces can drive rapid transition through our Climate Action Tracker analysis.\\n\\nIt turns out that, in these fields, it has taken only a few players to set in motion the kind of transformations that will be necessary to meet the Paris Agreement's target of keeping the global temperature increase to well below 2˚C, ideally to 1.5˚C, over its pre-industrial level.\\n\\nRenewable energy on its way\\n\\nThe most progressive field in the power sector is renewable energy. Here, just three countries – Denmark, Germany, and Spain – were able to show the way and start an international shift.\\n\\nAll three introduced strong policy packages for wind and solar that provided clear signals to investors and developers to invest in these new technologies. Renewable energy targets and financial support schemes, such as feed-in tariffs, were central to them.\\n\\nBy 2015, 146 countries had implemented such support schemes.\\n\\nNext, we established that the United Kingdom, Italy and China, along with the US states of Texas and California, pushed bulk manufacturing of solar technology even further and provided the kinds of economies of scale that led to this massive increase in renewable capacity globally.\\n\\nBetween 2006 and 2015, global wind power capacity increased by 600%, and solar energy capacity increased by 3,500%.\\n\\nSolar is projected to become the cheapest energy generation source by 2030 in most countries. In some regions, renewables are already competitive with fossil fuels.\\n\\nInformation released this month by the United Nations Environmental Programme and Bloomberg New Energy Finance confirms that, in 2016, the rate of renewable take-up rose yet again, with clean energy providing 55% of all new electricity generation capacity added globally. This is the first time there was more new renewable capacity than coal.\\n\\nInvestment in renewables doubled that of investment in fossil fuels. Yet clean power investment dropped 23% from 2015, largely because of falling prices.\\n\\nTo meet the goals of the Paris Agreement, we need to fully decarbonise the global energy system by mid-century. That means the historic trends in the energy sector – 25% to 30% annual growth in renewables – must continue for the next five to ten years.\\n\\nThis will require additional policies and incentives, from increased flexibility in the energy system to new regulatory and market approaches.\\n\\nElectric vehicles poised to take off\\n\\nA similar trend is beginning to transform the transportation sector. In 2016, more than one million electric vehicles were sold, and new sales continue to exceed projections.\\n\\nAgain, our research tells us that it took only a few players to kick off this trend: Norway, the Netherlands, California and, more recently, China.\\n\\nChina has become a leader in clean transportation. These vehicles are solar-powered. vtpoly/flickr, CC BY\\n\\nTheir policies focused on targets for increasing the share of electric vehicles for sale and on the road, campaigns to promote behavioral change, infrastructure investment, and research and development.\\n\\nThe European Union saw sales of electric vehicles pick up in 2013. And in the US, their market segment grew between 2011 and 2013, slowed down slightly in 2014 and 2015, and bounced back again in 2016.\\n\\nChina's market took off a little later, in 2014, but sales there have already surpassed both the US and the EU.\\n\\nThough, to date, it lags behind the renewable power sector, the electric vehicle market is poised to see a similar boom. Current sales numbers are impressive, but we are still far from seeing a transportation transformation that would allow us to meet the Paris Agreement targets.\\n\\nFor the world to meet the upper limit of 2°C set in Paris, half of all light-duty vehicles on the road would need to be electric by 2050. To reach the 1.5°C target, nearly all vehicles on the road need to be electric drive – and no cars with internal-combustion engines should be sold after roughly 2035.\\n\\nTo get us going down that path, more governments around the world would need to introduce the same strict policies as those adopted by Norway and The Netherlands.\\n\\nBuildings come in last\\n\\nThe third sector we examined is buildings. Though higher energy efficiency standards in appliances are really starting to curb emissions, emissions from heating and cooling buildings have been much more difficult to phase out.\\n\\nThere are proven technological solutions that can result in new, zero-carbon buildings. If designed correctly, these constructions are cost-effective over their lifetime and can improve quality of life.\\n\\nIn Europe and elsewhere, there are some good initial policies on new building standards that make new constructions more environmentally friendly, and some EU states – the United Kingdom, France and the Netherlands among them – are also beginning to mandate that older buildings be retrofitted.\\n\\nStill, the rate of retrofitting falls well short of what is required to substantially drop building emissions.\\n\\nInnovative financial mechanisms to increase the rate of retrofitting buildings, along with good examples of building codes for new constructions, would go a long way to drive adoption of these technologies.\\n\\nAnd, as our study showed, only a handful of governments (or regions) would need to make a move to kick-start a transformation. It worked for energy and transport – why not buildings, too?\\n\\nThe more governments work together sharing policy successes, the bigger the global transformation. With collaboration, we can meet that 1.5°C goal.\\n\\nThis article was originally published on The Conversation. Read the original article."}

In fact, South Korea is home to some of the best health care, entertainment and wellness wisdom in the world.\\n\\nBelow are a few things the 2018 Winter Olympics host country can teach the rest of us about living a good, healthy life:\\n\\nOne word: kimchi\\n\\nwoyzzeck via Getty Images Kimchi is served with most meals in Korea.\\n\\nKimchi — fermented cabbage with garlic, vinegar and spices — is a staple of Korean cuisine. Labeled one of the world's healthiest foods by Health.com, kimchi is a condiment served with most meals in Korea. (And, they report, it's so abundant that Koreans even say kimchi instead of cheese when snapping photos!) It's filled with vitamins A, B and C, but perhaps more importantly, kimchi is loaded with probiotics, which can support healthy digestion. What's more, lactobacilli, one probiotic found in kimchi, is thought to possibly be an anticancer agent.\\n\\nThey take internet dependency seriously\\n\\nSouth Korea is one of the most plugged-in countries on the globe, with the majority of its people having access to broadband internet and smartphones. Surveys suggest an estimated 10 percent of teens in the region are addicted to the internet, according to The Washington Post.\\n\\nSouth Korea has been confronting this internet attachment head-on for more than a decade. There are camps and treatment centers for people who are dealing with addictive behaviors around online gaming and internet browsing, and the government enacted measures like the Shutdown Law, which prevents access to individuals under the age of 16 after midnight.\\n\\nTackling device dependency is a smart move: Research shows too much tech can cause blurred vision, poor sleep, headaches, mood issues and more.\\n\\nThey make entertainment a priority\\n\\nRB/Bauer-Griffin via Getty Images Korean K-pop band BTS is seen performing at Jimmy Kimmel Live in November.\\n\\nSouth Korean arts and pop culture have been exported around the world ― and for good reason. South Koreans put a high value on arts and entertainment, and it's resulted in a culture with a rich film, theater, music and visual arts scene. Pop music (also known as K-pop) is a multibillion-dollar industry in Korea.\\n\\nK-pop is known for its high cuteness factor, fast-paced choreography and seductive winks, smiles and double takes, as well as lyrics that tend toward frothy fun or breakup boohoo, Patrick Healy wrote in The New York Times in 2013.\\n\\nIt's a phenomenon that may even have health and well-being payoffs. A number of studies have demonstrated the mood-boosting power of music, including a 2013 University of Missouri study that showed listening to happy music (and trying to feel happy during it) might elevate mood.\\n\\nA popular professional sport focuses on the body AND the mind\\n\\nThe traditional Korean martial art of taekwondo fuses self-defense and combat. But taekwondo is more than a physical activity: It's also a philosophy of using the strength of the body and the power of the mind to create greater peace in the world.\\n\\nAccording to World Taekwondo, the sport is a discipline that shows ways of enhancing our spirit and life through training our body and mind. As the international federation governing the sport explained:\\n\\nTaekwondo can be characterized by unity: the unity of body, mind, and life, and the unity of the pose [poomsae] and confrontation, and cracking down. When you do Taekwondo, you should make your mind peaceful and synchronize your mind with your movements, and extend this harmony to your life and society. This is how in Taekwondo the principle of physical movements, the principle of mind training, and the principle of life become one and the same.\\n\\nThey enjoy the great outdoors\\n\\nTravel and Still life photography via Getty Images Many South Koreans visit campgrounds to enjoy time in nature.\\n\\nCamping is becoming an increasingly popular trend in South Korea — and many campers there are seeking refuge from the urban hustle without ever leaving the city. Seoul-based international news outlet Arirang News reported in 2013 that stressed-out urbanites flock to campgrounds within the city to enjoy some relaxing time in nature.\\n\\nWe live in an extremely fierce and competitive world, one Seoul resident told Arirang News. Coming out here in nature, I feel a sense of healing, so I keep coming back.\\n\\nResearch shows that camping can have mental and physical health perks, from getting better sleep to improving mood to increasing exercise.\\n\\nThey're happy with their health care\\n\\nA 2016 study found that the quality of care offered in Korea had the largest effect on satisfaction within its health care system. And out of 15 countries surveyed in a 2013 Ipsos poll, South Koreans were most satisfied with their medical care. In fact, they scored the highest across all categories in the poll.\\n\\nNational health insurance in Korea has been successful in mobilizing resources for health care, rapidly extending population coverage, effectively pooling public and private resources to purchase health care for the entire population, and containing health care expenditure, Soonman Kwon, professor of public health at Seoul National University, wrote in the Oxford Journals' Health Policy And Planning."}
{"original": "Texas education officials violated federal law when they excluded more than 100,000 students with disabilities from programs designed to help them, the federal government announced.\\n\\nThe Department of Education sent a letter to the Texas Education Agency Thursday to announce it's findings after a 15-month-long investigation. The federal government found that state officials were setting a target for how many students could receive special education services, The New York Times reported. Federal law insists that school serve all students with disabilities.\\n\\nThe state's target created a drop of more than 100,000 students who were previously getting the tools the needed, including therapy and counseling. As the Times explains:\\n\\nThe target, enacted in 2004 and eliminated last year, was set at 8.5 percent of enrollment, and school districts were penalized for exceeding that benchmark, even though the state and national averages had both long been about 12 percent. As a direct result of the policy, regulators determined, the share of students receiving special education services in Texas dropped from 11.6 percent in 2004 to 8.6 percent in 2016 — a difference of about 150,000 children.\\n\\nThe federal investigation was prompted by a massive report from the Houston Chronicle in 2016.\\n\\nThe law requires that schools base their special ed decisions on need, not opinion, or space availability, or money, or teacher training or other subjective positions, Kerry Steiner, who worked with a Texas school district as part of a parent training project, told the publication at the time. It was heartbreaking to see schools not do that.\\n\\nFederal investigators held public forums, went to school districts across the state, and interviewed teachers before coming to their conclusion. The DOE has now ordered Texas to create a plan to find and help students who were illegally kept out from special education programs.\\n\\nEvery child with a disability must have appropriate access to special education and related services that meet his or her unique needs, Education Secretary Betsy DeVos said in a statement. Far too many students in Texas had been precluded from receiving supports and services.\\n\\nTexas lawmakers had previously ended the policy following the Houston Chronicle's report."}
{"original": "I've said often that the Common Core failed in its creators' central goal ― to establish a set of national standards followed with fidelity by every school from Maine to Alaska. Every school would follow the exact same set of learning goals so that a child who left Iowa to attend school in Florida could make the switch without missing a step. The standards would be set in cement (remember the rule that a state could only add 15 percent additional Stuff) and we would all march together in lockstep into a fully-standardized perfect education future.\\n\\nBut the Core was revealed as both political kryptonite and amateur-hour educational junk. It entered the Bad Policy Witness Protection Program and took up residence in many states under an assumed name. Also, states took about five minutes to realize they could go ahead and rewrite, alter and add anything they damn well felt like.\\n\\nDavid Coleman's dream of fifty states all yoked to his vision was dead.\\n\\nBut something else was not dead, and is, in regrettable fact, very much alive.\\n\\nOnce upon a time, school districts would plan curriculum, the whole scope and sequence and pedagogical approach as well as the actual content― they would do all of that by consulting the experts that they had already hired. Maybe a curriculum director if they had one, or some other administrator if they didn't. Certainly an assortment of their actual classroom teachers. Those folks might consult some other reliable sources as well as using their own professional judgment to develop the district's educational plan.\\n\\nBut that was once upon a time.\\n\\nNow the goal is standards-based curriculum.\\n\\nInstead of curriculum conversations that begin with What do we believe a graduate of our school district should know? we now get conversations that begin with Let's take a look at the standards. And then schools use them as a checklist. Let's work our way down the list of standards and make sure that we have something written into the curriculum that allows us to check off each one so that we can say it's covered. And let's be double-certain when it comes to the tested standards.\\n\\nHere are the questions that are not answered (and sometimes not asked) in attempts to build standards-based curriculum:\\n\\nWhere did these standards come from? Who wrote them, and is there some reason to believe that they know better than our own trained professionals what students in our district should learn? Are the standards based on any sort of research, and is that research valid and trustworthy?\\n\\nWhat is not covered by the standards? Are the standards strictly focused on skills while ignoring content (spoiler alert: probably)? Are there areas of our course of study that we, in our considered professional judgment, consider vital, but which the standards do not address? And if there are are, given a finite school year, can we discuss setting aside some of the standards in order to make room for content and material that we consider important?\\n\\nWhen the Common Core wave passed, it had swept away the notion that actual teachers and administrators are experts in education. Teaching, it turns out, is somehow too hard for mere teachers. Instead, the standards-based school district now assumes that nobody in the school system actually knows what should be taught, and that the most they can be trusted with is to unpack the standards and create a checklist-certified list of education activities that will meet the standards' demands. That's the best-case scenario. In the worst-case scenario, the district doesn't believe that trained education professionals can be trusted with even that much, and should just be handed materials that dictate the teacher's every move, throwing aside their professional judgment and replacing it with the judgment of some bureaucrat or textbook publisher.\\n\\nWorst of all for the long run, this approach has infected schools of education who prepare their few remaining future teachers to accept this, to envision for themselves a diminished role as content delivery specialists or instructional facilitators or classroom coaches.\\n\\nCommon Core was pitched against a definite enemy― the teachers who insisted in teaching things in their own classroom just because they thought those things were worth teaching, the teacher who insisted on using her own professional judgment, the teacher who wanted to function as an autonomous individual. Ironically, even though the Common Core did not conquer the nation's school districts as it had hoped, it did manage to deliver a serious defeat to its chosen enemy. We now understand in (too many) districts that we must adhere to the Standards, which have descended manna-like from some mysterious, magical higher power. They are not to be argued with or contradicted, nor will there be any discussion of the educational wisdom (or lack thereof) behind them. They are to be treated as our compass, our grail, our North Star. Teachers should sit down, shut up, and start aligning.\\n\\nAnd that defeat of professional educators, that clampdown on teacher autonomy― that's the one victory that Common Core State (sic) Standards can claim.\\n\\nOriginally posted at Curmudgucation"}
{"original": "Undocumented U.S. residents are among those hardest hit by COVID-19, and experts and activists are increasingly concerned that vaccines won't reach their communities.\\n\\nMany experts warn of a public health disaster, citing lack of accessibility, fear of deportation and general wariness, unless a strategy is put in place to communicate with hard-to-reach communities and allow them the opportunity to get vaccinated without risks to them or their families.\\n\\nThe undocumented community has really been disproportionately affected by everything that's happening with the pandemic, said Adonia Simpson, director of the Family Defense Program at the Miami-based immigrant-rights group Americans for Immigrant Justice.\\n\\nHostility toward immigrants by the Trump administration and some lawmakers, as well as fear of possible information sharing with immigration officials, has forced some immigrants underground, even though undocumented immigrants are among those most vulnerable to the coronavirus, Simpson added.\\n\\n\\n\\nFear And Distrust\\n\\nMany members of the undocumented community wonder if their status will be a hindrance to receiving the vaccine, or if they'll be vaccinated at all.\\n\\nIn December, New York Gov. Anderew Cuomo (D) successfully lobbied the federal government not to collect personal data as a prerequisite for receiving the vaccine. That quelled the concerns of the state's nearly 1 million undocumented immigrants who were concerned their status could fall into the hands of federal immigration authorities.\\n\\nThe communities hit hardest by COVID can't be the last to get a vaccine, Cuomo said after sending a letter to U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar. It would be unfair and discriminatory.\\n\\nBut in Nebraska, the sentiment isn't the same. Earlier this month, Gov. Pete Ricketts was widely criticized by immigration advocates after he announced that legal citizens would be prioritized for the vaccine and undocumented workers would have to wait.\\n\\nNearly 11 million undocumented immigrants reside in the U.S., with hundreds of thousands of them working in essential services, including the food, retail and construction industries.\\n\\nAlthough no other state appears to have publicly suggested it will consider legal status in its immunization campaign, Nebraska's plan has heightened fears among undocumented communities across the country.\\n\\nThat type of information spreads really quickly and snowballs, so I do anticipate when vaccines become available to individuals that there's going to be a continued concern about how this could impact their immigration cases or if their information will be shared or even if they'll be eligible to get the vaccine, Simpson said.\\n\\nAdvocates are now looking to the Biden administration ― which this week plans to announce an overhaul to the nation's immigration laws and a pathway to citizenship ― to earn the trust of undocumented immigrants as a part of his promise to vaccinate 100 million people a day during his first 100 days.\\n\\nDebunking Myths\\n\\nIt is no surprise that millions of undocumented residents are anxious. Almost a year ago, in February 2020, Trump expanded the scope of the public charge rule― a seldom-used policy in place since the 1880s that allows the federal government to deny entry to immigrants, especially green card holders, who are deemed to be overly reliant on public benefits, such cash assistance programs.\\n\\nAfter the change in the public charge rule, immigrants have become hesitant to utilize lifesaving services during the pandemic, such as Medicaid, federal housing, and food aid, for fear of jeopardizing their chances for a green card and citizenship. Simpson noted that some families are not seeking medical services or local assistance for fear of being deported or denied a chance at residency.\\n\\nThe purpose of this rule was really to create confusion and fear, which it was very successful doing, said Simpson.\\n\\nIt's just so critically important to keep everybody in mind. This is not a time to be distinguishing between individuals who are documented and undocumented.\\n\\nA wide array of advocacy organizations have been working to combat disinformation with answers about the Trump rule.\\n\\nThere's been a lot of mistrust in the government surrounding immigration, so the messaging is just going to have to come from trusted entities on the ground that are working with immigrant communities, said Simpson.\\n\\nBut there still is skepticism. Advocates like Simpson said it is critical for lawmakers and medical professionals to provide clear messaging in various languages to reach undocumented communities and ensure that the vaccine is accessible to them.\\n\\nIt's just so critically important to keep everybody in mind, Simpson said. This is not a time to be distinguishing between individuals who are documented and undocumented. This is a health emergency, which immigration status should play be no factor in this at all."}

Australia has been struggling to contain the disease, which is expected to take a significant economic toll, with the Treasury department warning the outbreak would cut at least half a percentage point from economic growth in the first quarter. Australia has recorded 112 cases of the coronavirus as of Wednesday morning, while three people have died from the disease. Just under $1.2 billion of that will actually, we anticipate, be spent this financial year, particularly as the virus and its impacts ramp up in the months ahead, Morrison told reporters in Canberra.\\n\\nThis package is about preventing and treating coronavirus in the coming weeks. Australia also extended its travel ban for Italy from 1800 local time on Wednesday, after Italy expanded a lockdown to cover the entire country to contain the spread of the virus. The federal government said the latest funding package would include the $500 million announced last week to support the costs on the health system from the virus outbreak. The package will be in addition to a multi-­billion-dollar economic stimulus package the government has said it is preparing.

Elizabeth Warren about her claimed Native American identity, last October the Massachusetts Democrat caved, spit into a cup and released a highly produced campaign-style video to publicize the results of a DNA test.\\n\\nThe loud criticism from Indian Country was quoted, shared and repeated by non-Native media and, for the first time since the controversy began in 2012, it felt as though Native voices were shaping the story. (For a full collection of essays about why the DNA test undermined Native rights ― points this essay is not rehashing ― check out this reading list.)\\n\\nDespite the backlash, Warren slogged on. In repeated interviews and under enormous media pressure, she refused to apologize. In an interview with The Boston Globe's editorial board, she stated, I have an election. Donald Trump goes in front of crowds multiple times a week to attack me. ... I got this analysis back, and I made it public.\\n\\nScott Eisen via Getty Images On Dec. 31, 2018, Sen.

But I am experienced enough to demand that elected representatives be responsive to their constituents and accountable for their actions. A prerequisite for good governance is building responsive relationships with constituents, one that incorporates feedback into strategy and policy. In the era of big money, Washingtonian elites and out-of-touch lawmakers, I am not the only voter who is sick of candidates who can't or won't listen.\\n\\nInstead of listening to marginalized voices, Warren listened to Trump.\\n\\nWarren bills herself as the ever-accountable champion of the underdog, but on this particular issue, she has failed. She has proved that, in service to her political gain, she will ignore the concerns of marginalized voices ― as she has done to Native critics for the past six years.\\n\\nShe has had ample opportunity to make her mistake of falsely claiming to be Cherokee ― both as a law professor and, more awkwardly, as a cookbook plagiarist ― a minor issue in 2020. Yet her hardheadedness has only worsened the initial offense.\\n\\nDespite Cherokee genealogists' irrefutably documenting that she has no Native ancestry, she has refused to stop publicly claiming her family is part Native. Despite Native Americans' warning that DNA testing is dangerous race-based science and an affront to sovereignty, she took the test. Despite promising to work for and with tribes, she did not consult the government at the center of her self-absorbed fiasco and, pointedly, has not sat down with the Cherokee Nation since. If she had listened to the concerned constituents at the center of her repeated bungles, most of this mess could have been avoided.\\n\\nInstead of listening to marginalized voices, Warren listened to Trump. In her elaborate DNA test rollout, the senator was more focused on one-upping the trolling president than protecting Native rights ― a promise she made and broke in less than a year. The DNA test not only used the same rhetoric about race, blood and Native identity that the far right is using to attack tribal sovereignty but also was politically stupid.\\n\\nYou don't win Trump's game by playing it. If Warren can't resist giving in to his taunts as a senator, how is she going to effectively maneuver a 2020 candidacy? We don't need a Democratic nominee tuned into the Trump show; we need a nominee tuned into voters.\\n\\nWarren stands for a lot of positive things that Trump does not, but her misstep on the DNA test is enough to question her commitment to speaking for all voters.\\n\\nHer defenders on the left argue that because Trump is so much worse, she deserves a pass. I agree with her on most policy issues, but in what will likely be a crowded Democratic field, her blatant disregard for some of her most vulnerable constituents is enough to question her ability to represent all voters.\\n\\nIf the Democratic Party is going to build on its midterm election gains ― after a decade of historic and catastrophic losses ― it needs to be more responsive, accountable and politically savvy than Warren has been. It is naive to think this issue will stop haunting her, and no, that reality is not unfair. She had other options, but she has spent the past six years stubbornly digging the hole she is now stuck in. Native people warned her. Repeatedly. She ignored us. Now the Democratic Party needs to not make the same mistake.\\n\\nWhile her early announcement betrays her embroiled position, it has already been an effective distraction. Right before the holiday season, a seemingly unprovoked news cycle saw articles in several major outlets ― The New York Times, GQ, Rolling Stone and even the senator's longtime loyal hometown paper, The Boston Globe ― questioning or outright rejecting her viability as a candidate. The editorial board for the Globe turned against the presidential hopeful, calling her a divisive figure and suggesting that after testing the election waters, she should stay on the beach.\\n\\nBut on Monday, she jumped into the waters, and the concerns raised by Native Americans that was headline news mere months ago went back to being a footnote. Without taking responsibility for the harm her DNA stunt caused, by her own standards of holding the powerful in Washington accountable, she is not fit to represent all the diverse people that make up these United States.\\n\\nOn this issue ― where we have so much at stake ― Native Americans are consistently talked over. We are talked over by bigots who taunt Warren with war whoops and tomahawk chops, whose racism is really pointed at us. And we are talked over by Democrats like Warren who profess they stand for our rights but, when it's politically convenient, plow right over us.\\n\\nThis country was built on our systematic erasure. We deserve to be heard.\\n\\nRebecca Nagle is a writer, organizer and all-around agitator for good. She is a Cherokee Nation citizen and a proud Two Spirit woman."}

{"original": "NEW YORK ― Officials in New York City on Wednesday announced a lawsuit against five major oil companies over infrastructure damage caused by climate change and plans to divest roughly $5 billion in fossil fuel investments from the city's five pension funds.\\n\\nThe announcement from Mayor Bill de Blasio came roughly a week after the Democrat was inaugurated for a second term. It marks his strongest action yet to address global warming and its associated sea-level rise, which devastated the city with massive flooding during Superstorm Sandy in 2012.\\n\\nAt a press conference Wednesday, de Blasio said that while there may have been climate change deniers in New York City before Sandy, he doubts there were any left afterward. The world, he said, is facing a painful, horrible reality and the city will no longer participate in a system that endangers our very own people.\\n\\nIt's time to do something different in New York City, isn't it? he said. We're going after those who have profited — and what a horrible, disgusting way to profit.\\n\\nThe lawsuit against oil giants BP, Chevron, ConocoPhillips, ExxonMobil and Royal Dutch Shell seeks to recoup billions in climate-related damages the city has already incurred, as well as pay for billions in new infrastructure and resiliency measures to fortify the city and protect its residents moving forward, officials say.\\n\\nWe're bringing the fight against climate change straight to the fossil fuel companies that knew about its effects and intentionally misled the public to protect their profits, de Blasio said in a statement ahead of Wednesday's press conference. As climate change continues to worsen, it's up to the fossil fuel companies whose greed put us in this position to shoulder the cost of making New York safer and more resilient.\\n\\nNew York City follows cities and counties in California and Colorado that have either filed or announced pending climate impact litigation.\\n\\nCurtis Smith, a Shell spokesman, told The Associated Press that the company believes climate change is a complex societal challenge that should be addressed through sound government policy and cultural change to drive low-carbon choices for businesses and consumers, not by the courts.\\n\\nThe American Petroleum Institute, a trade association for America's oil and natural gas industry, called de Blasio's announcement disgraceful.\\n\\nToday Mayor de Blasio turned his back on millions of first responders, police officers, firefighters and other public employees who depend on their pensions to provide for themselves and their families in retirement, API New York Executive Director Karen Moreau said in a statement. Government pension managers have a responsibility by law to seek the greatest return for their investors and pensions that invest in oil and natural gas companies have historically delivered a higher return than other investments. Deliberately hurting pension holders, like the fine men and women who keep our city safe, is a disgraceful way to score cheap political points.\\n\\nIn addition to the lawsuit, New York City intends to divest the approximately $5 billion the city's pension funds have invested in over 190 fossil fuel companies. The move comes more than two years after de Blasio announced plans to divest $33 million from coal, one of the dirtiest fossil fuels.\\n\\nWe know that the future is with big ideas in clean energy, not with big polluters, Comptroller Scott Stringer said. We believe that a green economy is a thriving economy, and that we have to be thinking about the next fiscal quarter as well as the next quarter century. That's what this is all about.\\n\\nStringer added that the city is embarking on one of the most significant divestment efforts anywhere in the world to date.\\n\\nCity officials said they hope to inspire other local governments to take similar action.\\n\\nIn 2016, a coalition of attorneys general — called AGs United for Clean Power and led by New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman — formed to combat the climate crisis. Its formation came after bombshell reports by InsideClimate News and The Los Angeles Times detailing how ExxonMobil executives were aware of the climate risks associated with carbon dioxide emissions but funded research to cover up those risks and block solutions.\\n\\nIn late November, Letitia James, New York City's public advocate, held a first-of-its-kind public hearing on climate change. Activists, students and voters packed an auditorium at the Borough of Manhattan Community College for hours, recounting stories of asthma exacerbated by air pollution and homes flooded by rising waters.\\n\\nNew York, the birthplace of the nation's annual climate march, has plenty of its own pollution problems. For example, in Queens, the city's largest borough, the Ravenswood Generating Station has another two years under city law to keep burning 3,264,000 gallons of fuel oil each year, producing annual emissions equivalent to about 500,000 cars. The city is also of the world's top garbage producers, and its recycling services lag behind other major metropoles.\\n\\nYet buildings account for about 70 percent of the city's emissions, creating a steep political challenge for a mayor who, to the chagrin of the progressive activists who helped elect him, spent much of his first term wooing real estate developers. In September, de Blasio's rollout of a new set of mandates to cut emissions from big buildings faced blunt criticism from the New York City Council, which accused the mayor of acting unilaterally and failing to go far enough with the proposed rules.\\n\\nStill, air pollution hit an all-time low last year after the city tightened heating oil rules.\\n\\nNew York City's effort to hold industry accountable for the impacts of climate change was applauded by numerous climate advocacy groups. Representatives of some of those organizations spoke Wednesday in New York.\\n\\nToday, the mightiest city on our planet takes on its most powerful industry — its richest, most powerful and most irresponsible industry, said Bill McKibben, the co-founder of 350.org. Science and economics and morality are on the side of this city, and so it will eventually win.\\n\\nThis story has been updated with a statement from the American Petroleum Institute."}
{"original": "Sadar Jafar/Facebook Sadaf Jafar, a teacher and a political activist in Lucknow, was arrested by the UP Police on 19 December.\\n\\nLUCKNOW, Uttar Pradesh — Naheed Varma was in college and her sister Sadaf was in class 11 when communal riots erupted in Ahmedabad in 1991. It was their first experience of communal violence, the sisters were shocked by the violence they witnessed in Gujarat. The fear that Naheed felt almost three decades ago has never left her.\\n\\nIt was horrifying for us. We had never seen anything like this. We realised how polarised Ahmedabad was. We were the only Muslims in a 10 kilometre radius, Naheed said. That was our first experience with the Gujarat model of polarisation.\\n\\nThe trigger for the violence lay 1,400 km away in Ayodhya, where then UP Chief Minister Mulayam Singh Yadav had ordered the police to fire on the karsevaks who had gathered near the Babri Masjid. A year later, the 16th century mosque would be demolished by the karsevaks, and 27 years later, the Supreme Court of India ruled in favour of building a temple at the site.\\n\\nVarma, who married a Hindu man in 1993, was born into a Shia Muslim family from Lucknow, a mostly peaceful city where she spent her formative years. Lucknow remained calm even as the demolition of the Babri Masjid on 6 December, 1992, triggered the worst communal riots since the Partition in 1947.\\n\\nToday, Varma still can't believe that Lucknow, a city that she considered her safe haven, where her granduncle and great granduncle had fought British rule, is where her younger sister Sadaf has been arrested, assaulted by the police, and charged with attempt to murder and being in possession of explosives.\\n\\nOn 19 December, 2019, Sadaf Jafar, who came out to protest against the discriminatory Citizenship Amendment Act, was the only woman arrested by the Uttar Pradesh police in the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-run state. For two days, the police did not tell her frantic family members where Jafar, who is a member of the opposition Congress Party, was.\\n\\nYou won't believe this when I tell you, but I felt relief when we finally heard that she was in jail. Just to know where she was was, that she wasn't dead, was all that mattered in that moment, she said. Then, it hits you. Our lives have changed forever.\\n\\nUnder the garb of maintaining law and order, Chief Minister Ajay Bisht, who calls himself Yogi Adityanath, has unleashed a brutal crackdown to crush any dissent against the discriminatory citizenship law. The UP Police has arrested thousands of people, beaten women and children, shot at non-protestors, and tortured children. Now, the government is sending notices to people suspected of damaging public property to pay damages or face seizure of their properties.\\n\\nFor a week now, there have been rumours of the police sending a recovery notice to Jafar and two other prominent social activists — Deepak Kabir and Mohammed Shoaib — who were arrested on 19 December in Lucknow.\\n\\nOn Thursday, Varma said the family had not received any notice so far. Honestly, we are prepared for the worst. We are living in some alternative reality where the truth no longer matters, she said.\\n\\nOur lives have changed forever.\\n\\nWho she is\\n\\nAll that her sister did was to come out for a peaceful protest and make live videos for Facebook, Varma said. But it is not what her sister was doing that bothers Bisht and the BJP, she said, but rather who she is and what she represents.\\n\\nThe arrest and beating inside the thana was payback, but not only for the Facebook videos that embarrass the BJP government and raise questions about how the UP police were operating on 19 December.\\n\\nIn a state where people critical of the government are arrested and charged with defamation or sedition, Jafar was one of the very few voices still calling them out on everything from the poor quality of midday meal for students to the alarming levels of sexual violence against women in the state.\\n\\nShe is everything they hate. She is Muslim. She is a woman with a mind. She speaks angrezi. She stands up to them, said Varma.\\n\\nShe is Muslim. She is a woman with a mind.\\n\\n'Revenge'\\n\\nJafar, a mother of two children, did not flee the site of the protest even after it turned violent on 19 December. The former school teacher stuck around and posted videos of the events unfolding around her.\\n\\nIn one video, Jafar is seen and heard urging the policemen to take action against the miscreants. Why are you not stopping them? she says over and over again. There was so much police, but when the violence happened, the police disappeared, she says in the video.\\n\\nIn her final video, Jafar says, Why are you arresting me? I was protesting peacefully. You could not catch the people who threw stones?\\n\\nA woman constable is heard saying, Those thugs were with us (as if). Jafar says, Who knows?\\n\\nWhen Varma met her sister in the district jail in Lucknow, she noticed that a clump of her hair was missing.\\n\\nJafar told her sister that a woman constable had ripped out her hair and clawed her face. That was after male constables had beaten her with batons on her back and kicked her in the stomach.\\n\\nFollowing the public outrage that followed these allegations last week, the police released a video, denying all the accusations levelled against it in Jafar's case.\\n\\nSadaf said that someone who was beaten in jail before told her, 'show them your back or they will break your hands,' Varma said.\\n\\nSomeone had burnt a woman constable's scooter in the violence and she took her revenge on Sadaf, she told me. Someone said, 'bahut angrezi bolti hai.' They find English speaking women particularly irksome, she said.\\n\\nSpeaking of the men who beat her sister, Varma said, They must have thought video bana rahi hai, humko bata rahi hai…\\n\\nBisht, Varma said, had sworn revenge and that state police was complying.\\n\\nThe UP chief minister has vowed revenge against alleged arsonists. He recently tweeted, Anyone interrupting the yagya of the sanyasi for public welfare, will face punishment.\\n\\nVaibhav Maheshwari, the spokesperson for the Aam Aadmi Party in UP, said there were two reasons for Jafar's arrest. Her name, he said. And the absolute power given to the UP Police.\\n\\nPolicemen at the lower rung of the force, he added, were not acting like they belonged to a system, but lashing out on their own. Ego driven, bias driven police has replaced the system driven police force, he said.\\n\\nसंन्यासी की लोक सेवा और जन कल्याण के निरंतर जारी यज्ञ में जो भी बाधा उत्पन्न करेगा उसे दण्डित होना ही पड़ेगा।\\n\\n\\n\\nविरासत में राजनीति पाने वाले और देश को भुला कर तुष्टिकरण की राजनीति करने वाले लोक सेवा का अर्थ क्या समझेंगे ?#भगवा_में_लोक_कल्याण — Yogi Adityanath Office (@myogioffice) December 30, 2019\\n\\nFinding a voice\\n\\nJafar, her sister said, had never tired of reinventing herself. She was a single mother to a 16-year-old son and a 12-year-old daughter. She was a school teacher for many years. She was a social activist and a poet.\\n\\nShe had helped organise the first LGBTQ pride parade in Lucknow. She had recently joined the Congress Party hoping that it would amplify her voice.\\n\\nVarma, a career counselor in Lucknow, is a Muslim who practices Buddhism. She married Raj Saran Varma, a Hindu, whose mother was Muslim. He died in 2016. They gave their daughter a Sikh name — Simran.\\n\\nPointing to a grey bust of Vladimir Lenin in the room, Varma said, We're basically commies, but right now communism in India is just about making noise without solutions.\\n\\nDissent and politics runs in the family, said Varma. Their father's brother S.M. Jafar was a renowned freedom fighter in Lucknow, who had worked alongside Mohandas Gandhi and Subhash Chandra Bose. Their grandfather's brother Syed Ali Zaheer was the law minister in Jawaharlal Nehru's first cabinet and India's ambassador to Iran. Their great grandfather was Sir Syed Wazir Hasan, a prominent jurist who served as the Chief Justice of the Awadh Court.\\n\\nHer father, a bank employee, only showed them one movie but he made them watch it three times when they were growing up, Varma recalled. That was Richard Attenborough's Gandhi. Many years later, they made him see Ashutosh Gowariker's Lagaan.\\n\\nHer father was one of five brothers, all of whom chose to stay in India following the Partition. One sister moved to Pakistan with her husband's family. They learnt how she had suffered from depression and died in a mental health facility in Karachi, almost a decade after her passing.\\n\\nWhen they say, 'Go back to Pakistan…' It's not just words to us. It's not just political. It's personal, she said. We have lived the pain and tragedy of separation.\\n\\nWe have lived the pain and tragedy of separation.\\n\\nJafar, Varma said, could never stand for injustice in her personal or professional life. She was fighting a long and difficult custody battle for her children. She loves teaching but often ended up leaving for challenging the management.\\n\\nJafar, her sister said, quit her job at a reputed school when the teachers were told to fill up the seats at a function organised by the BJP government, and when the students were told to line up and wave at the CM's cavalcade.\\n\\nSadaf is exceptional in many ways, said Varma. Things that people accept, a bad marriage or injustice at work — people say arre thoda sa adjust kar lo, arre udhar mat dekho bus apna kaam karo — she cannot do that. When it comes to her beliefs, she is uncompromising. She chooses to do the right thing over comfort and convenience.\\n\\nEver since Narendra Modi led the BJP to power in 2014, Jafar had spoken up on a host of issues involving minorities and Dalits. She spoke against the fees hike at Jawaharlal Nehru University in Delhi and the disappearance of Najeeb Ahmed, who went missing from the JNU campus in 2016.\\n\\nShe wanted to make a difference. She wanted her voice to be heard, said Varma.\\n\\nShe wanted to make a difference. She wanted her voice to be heard.\\n\\nPaying the price\\n\\nThe charges against her sister, Varma believes, will eventually be dropped. She has faith in the higher courts of India. But the lifelong legal battle, which now lies ahead of them, will change their lives forever.\\n\\nFighting for bail is just the first step, she said. Sadaf's life is disrupted forever.\\n\\nKnowing her sister as she does, Varma believes Jafar will not be broken, but emerge stronger from her ordeal.\\n\\nIn any theocratic state, there is no place for women, she said. But we will not be silenced. This movement is spearheaded by women."}

We're not flattening the curve, he added. We have exhausted every option available to us.\\n\\nIn addition to shutting down nonessential businesses and greatly increasing testing, the state is retrofitting facilities such as New York City's Javits Center to use them as extra hospitals, recruiting more medical staff and using hotels and empty college dorms for extra beds.\\n\\nCuomo estimated the state will need an additional 140,000 hospital beds and 30,000 ventilators.

It's looking like it's heading to 50,000 or more deaths ― deaths, not cases. Fifty-thousand deaths ― which is, that's a lot, he said.

Nationally, New York has conducted 25% of the tests so far.\\n\\nCuomo also announced an executive order mandating hospitals to increase their capacity by 50%, and to double if possible. He is also considering other measures, such as granting clemency to some older inmates, as reports of COVID-19 outbreaks in state prisons start to rise.\\n\\nThe governor criticized President Donald Trump's response, which has involved encouraging the private sector to produce more supplies, as insufficient, saying it can't be ad-hoc.\\n\\nIt can't just be: 'Hey, who wants to help, let me know!' We need to know who is going to produce what and when, Cuomo said. This is a national emergency.\\n\\nHe went on to thank Trump for working quickly to help the state set up emergency hospitals, and to allow federal emergency funding, including waiving the requirement that the state pays for 25% of it.\\n\\nCuomo also indirectly alluded to Trump when arguing that it's important to balance public health response with a smart economic response.\\n\\nI think there is a dot where those two lines cross, Cuomo said, announcing he has convened experts to begin to consider how to restart the economic engine, which could include younger and healthier people going back to work sooner, and testing people to see if they are immune.\\n\\nNew York now has 20,875 positive cases, including 5,707 new cases since Sunday.

{"original": "BRUSSELS (Reuters) — Climate-change leaders and campaigners worldwide welcomed U.S. President Joe Biden's move to rejoin the 2015 Paris Agreement but said Washington must also cut emissions and use its influence to encourage other countries to do the same.\\n\\nIn one of his first acts as president, Biden issued an executive order on Wednesday to bring the United States, the world's second-largest greenhouse gas emitter, back into the global treaty committing nearly 200 countries to halt rising temperatures quickly enough to avoid disastrous climate change.\\n\\nWashington formally left the Paris accord last year but its role as a heavyweight in global climate negotiations had already stalled with the 2016 election of President Donald Trump.\\n\\nTrump cast doubt on climate science and asserted that the accord was an economic burden. U.N. climate negotiations have stuttered since then, with multiple summits failing to deliver ambitious action.\\n\\nI wouldn't be surprised if they get a standing ovation just by entering the room, former U.N. climate chief Christiana Figueres said, referring to a U.S. return to global climate talks. That doesn't mean that they will have a standing ovation forever. They have to prove that they are really determined to make the changes that are necessary.\\n\\nU.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres welcomed the U.S. return to the Paris accord but added: There is a very long way to go. The climate crisis continues to worsen and time is running out to limit temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius and build more climate-resilient societies that help to protect the most vulnerable.\\n\\nClimate diplomats said they want to see an ambitious U.S. commitment to cut emissions this decade and a diplomatic push to convince others to follow suit. Top of the list would be China, the world's biggest polluter, which plans to become carbon neutral by 2060 but has yet to unveil a short-term plan to reduce emissions.\\n\\nClimate agreements signed by China and the United States played a big role in securing a deal at the Paris climate talks in 2015.\\n\\nBut during the Trump administration, climate became another source of friction between the world's two biggest economies, and experts said it was unlikely that their relationship could immediately return to normal.\\n\\nA lot has changed since the Obama years that will make the G2 climate relationship under Biden unpredictable, said Li Shuo, senior climate and energy policy officer for Greenpeace East Asia, referring to the United States and China as the G2.\\n\\nLi pointed to the rock-bottom U.S.-China relationship and divisive politics that create challenges for climate engagement.\\n\\nWhat remains unchanged is the need for the G2 to move towards the same direction ... Now the task is for the pair to switch to high gear, holding each other's hand or not, Li said.\\n\\nCARBON BORDER TAX?\\n\\nBiden has said he wants to put the United States on track to net zero emissions by 2050 but has yet to detail what regulatory tools he intends to use to achieve that goal.\\n\\nOne of the core challenges for the administration is going to be reframing this as opportunity for green growth, for jobs - for the kind of things we've seen in Europe, which has managed to significantly grow its economy while reducing its carbon emissions, said Kelley Kizzier, a former European Union climate negotiator, now at the non-profit Environmental Defense Fund.\\n\\nThe EU is already eyeing areas for collaboration.\\n\\nIn June, it will propose a carbon levy on imports of certain polluting goods to protect European industry from cheaper competitors in countries with weak climate policies. Biden pledged in his election campaign to do the same, through carbon adjustment fees or quotas at the U.S. border.\\n\\nCarbon border policies offer an opportunity to work together to set a global template for such measures, the EU said in a December memo on its priorities for the new EU relationship with the Biden administration.\\n\\nPolicy analysts say a joint U.S.-EU carbon border measure could drive faster decarbonisation in countries with high-emitting export-oriented sectors - including China, the world's largest steel producer.\\n\\nThis is a very important tool in the hands of the EU and the U.S. administration to stimulate global climate action, said Simone Tagliapietra, research fellow at Brussels-based think tank Bruegel.\\n\\nFrans Timmermans, the EU climate policy chief, said he would team up with John Kerry, Biden's international climate envoy, to convince ever more countries that ambitious climate action is in their best interest.\\n\\nBut for vulnerable countries grappling with floods, heat waves and droughts made more devastating by climate change, the priority is finance.\\n\\nFormer President Barack Obama's administration pledged to deliver $3 billion to the U.N. flagship fund to help vulnerable countries fight climate change.

But in this case, some 380,000 federal employees are furloughed and another 420,000 are working without pay because Congress and the White House have not funded their agencies.\\n\\nIn labor parlance, what's happening is more like the polar opposite of a strike: a lockout. That's a work stoppage initiated by management, in which workers are denied access to their jobs.\\n\\nSure, it's a lockout. That's what it is. Jacque Simon, AFGE\\n\\nLike a strike, a lockout usually happens during a labor dispute, in an effort to gain leverage. There was no workplace dispute that led to the shutdown. Rather, lawmakers and the White House simply failed to carry out their responsibilities and appropriate funding for roughly a quarter of government functions.\\n\\nBut to government employees, the effect is the same: Workers who are willing to clock in are denied paychecks and many are barred from even venturing onto the job site, as a result of decisions made by management.\\n\\nSure, it's a lockout, Jacque Simon, policy director for the American Federation of Government Employees, which represents 700,000 government workers, told HuffPost. That's what it is.\\n\\nThe shutdown began on Dec. 22, when funding lapsed for several federal agencies, including the Department of Homeland Security and the Interior Department. Workers whose duties are considered essential, such as law enforcement, have continued to work.\\n\\nAny pay those workers get would have to come retroactively, through an act of Congress, after the government reopens. The same goes for the hundreds of thousands of workers who are furloughed and not working. Those workers are not even supposed to check their emails during the shutdown.\\n\\nTrump has threatened that the shutdown may go on for months or even years. If it stretches into Monday ― and there is no sign of an imminent breakthrough ― it will become the second-longest government shutdown ever. And if the shutdown lasts into mid-January, it will set a new record, regardless of what Trump wants to call it.\\n\\nHuffPost readers: Are you affected by the government shutdown? Email us about it.

{"original": "New Jersey state prisons have ended a ban that prevented inmates from reading a highly praised book that links racial discrimination and mass incarceration.\\n\\nMichelle Alexander's 2012 book The New Jim Crow: Mass Incarceration in the Age of Colorblindness had been off limits to inmates as a matter of policy at New Jersey State Prison in Trenton and Southern State Correctional Facility in Delmont, according to documents provided in response to a public records request from the state chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union.\\n\\nThe state Department of Corrections lifted the ban after the ACLU chapter on Monday demanded that access to the book be granted to inmates in the state, which the group said has the worst U.S. black-white incarceration disparity.\\n\\nThe New Jim Crow chronicles how people of color are shut out of society by mass incarceration, the letter states. That the very prisoners who experience the worst racial disparity in incarceration in the country should be prohibited from reading a book whose precise purpose is to examine and educate about that disparity adds insult to injury.\\n\\nThe Department of Corrections responded Monday afternoon by lifting the ban on the book at all state institutions, and said it would review the department's policy on prohibiting books. The department noted in a statement that The New Jim Crow has been used a teaching tool in a college-level course for inmates.\\n\\nAmol Sinha, the state ACLU executive director, said Alexander's book shows how people of color are not just locked in, but locked out of civic life, and New Jersey has exiled them even further by banning this text specifically for them.\\n\\nThe ratios and percentages of mass incarceration play out in terms of human lives, Sinha said in a statement. Keeping a book that examines a national tragedy out of the hands of the people mired within it adds insult to injury.\\n\\nBlack residents in New Jersey are incarcerated at a rate roughly 12 times the rate of white residents. The letter, addressed to state Department of Corrections Commissioner Gary Lanigan, says every player in the criminal justice system should be taking steps to reduce racial disparities.\\n\\nThe ban on The New Jim Crow does precisely the opposite and is a step backwards instead. In its worst light, it looks like an attempt to keep impacted people uninformed about the history of the very injustice that defines their daily lives, the letter states.\\n\\nIn the preface, Alexander writes that she wrote the book for all those trapped within America's latest caste system. You may be locked up or locked outside of mainstream society, but you are not forgotten.\\n\\nACLU attorney Tess Borden, who drafted the letter, said it was ironic, misguided, and harmful for a state burdened with this systemic injustice to prohibit prisoners from reading a book about race and mass incarceration.\\n\\nNew Jersey needs to eradicate its worst-in-the-nation racial disparities, not paper them over with a banned book list, hoping that people trapped in an unfair system will remain blind to its injustices, Borden said.\\n\\nThis article has been updated to include a response from the state Department of Corrections.\\n\\nRead the letter below.\\n\\nRyan Reilly is HuffPost's senior justice reporter, covering criminal justice, federal law enforcement and legal affairs.

{"original": "Geek Squad employees have been working as FBI informants for more than a decade, newly released documents show, revealing a much closer relationship between the two organizations than formerly reported.\\n\\nWhile we'd previously known some of the Best Buy workers alerted law enforcement whenever they found illegal material like child pornography on customers' hard drives, the new documents show that the FBI met with the Geek Squad team at least as early as 2008 and apparently viewed some workers as paid informants.\\n\\nThe Electronic Frontier Foundation filed a Freedom of Information Act request for the documents last year and released them on Tuesday. The Bureau refused to confirm or deny if it has similar relationships with other electronics repair companies.\\n\\nThe documents indicate Geek Squad technicians only flagged federal agents when they found child pornography on a client's computer, so it's hard to be too upset. Nevertheless, it raises concerning questions about potential violations of the Fourth Amendment's protection against unreasonable searches and seizures.\\n\\nSeeking to calm fears, a Best Buy spokesperson told HuffPost in an emailed statement that their technicians do not actively search for such content and only discover it inadvertently. But in at least one instance, that doesn't seem to be the case.\\n\\nPer the EFF, an illicit image found on the hard drive of Mark Rettenmaier, a California doctor who dropped off his computer at a Best Buy in 2011, was stored on unallocated space on the disk that typically requires forensic software to find.\\n\\nRettenmaier was tried in 2017 on felony child pornography charges, but the case was thrown out after U.S. District Judge Cormac Carney ruled the FBI warrant that allowed the search of Rettenmaier's home ― a warrant granted based on the image found by Geek Squad ― was obtained via false and misleading statements.\\n\\nBloomberg via Getty Images Geek Squad technicians work at the company's repair facility in Hillview, Kentucky, in 2012.\\n\\nEFF documents show this wasn't a one-off case, and that the FBI handled numerous incidents in similar fashion after being alerted by Geek Squad technicians at the company's repair facility in Kentucky. (The company's Kentucky Geek Squad City facility handles more serious repairs, including work like data recovery that could require them to sift through a customer's data.)\\n\\nRecords uncovered as a result of the Rettenmaier case show the Bureau had eight FBI informants at Geek Squad City from 2007-2012, and that some Geek Squad employees were paid between $500 and $1,000 for their help. At least one Geek Squad technician attempted to give the money back and was rebuffed.\\n\\nIn an emailed statement to HuffPost, Best Buy sought to temper concerns about possibly illegal searches, saying the company has both a moral and, in some cases, legal obligation to alert authorities when employees find child pornography ― as it does nearly 100 times a year.\\n\\nCustomers are also made aware of the policy in writing prior to Geek Squad beginning any repair.\\n\\nAs a company, we have not sought or received training from law enforcement in how to search for child pornography, the company said. Our policies prohibit employees from doing anything other than what is necessary to solve the customer's problem. In the wake of these allegations, we have redoubled our efforts to train employees on what to do — and not do — in these circumstances.\\n\\nWe have learned that four employees may have received payment after turning over alleged child pornography to the FBI, the company continued. Any decision to accept payment was in very poor judgement and inconsistent with our training and policies. Three of these employees are no longer with the company and the fourth has been reprimanded and reassigned."}

{"original": "Washington state Gov. Jay Inslee (D) signed a pledge Tuesday promising to reject donations from the fossil fuel industry ahead of a likely run for the White House that he's vowed to uniquely center on climate change.\\n\\nIn an interview with HuffPost, Inslee, 67, said he added his name to the list of more than 1,300 politicians across the United States who took the No Fossil Fuel Money Pledge.\\n\\nThe vow, administered by a coalition of 16 left-leaning environmental groups, commits candidates to adopt a policy to not knowingly accept any contributions over $200 from the PACs, executives, or front groups of fossil fuel companies — companies whose primary business is the extraction, processing, distribution, or sale of oil, gas, or coal.\\n\\nThis is just one small statement that they should not continue to have undue influence over our decision-making over the existential threat against our nation, Inslee said by phone Tuesday night. This challenge calls for the scale of national effort similar to when we went to the moon, similar to when we beat fascism.\\n\\nInslee is the second governor to sign the pledge, following newly elected Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz (D). California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D), who was sworn in this week, took a similar pledge ― called Oil Money Out ― but the oath was limited to the oil industry in the Golden State. But Inslee is the third likely contender for the next Democratic presidential nomination to take the pledge, after Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.).\\n\\nThe Democratic Party has to put a candidate forward who will make it the primary commitment to get this stuff done, Inslee said. It can't be put in just one of the baskets of many issues.\\n\\nBy signing, Inslee is laying the groundwork for a historic, if long-shot, bid for the presidency on the single issue of scaling back planet-warming emissions and preparing for climate change. The move is bold but timely. Record-breaking storms, droughts and wildfires wreaked havoc across the U.S. over the past three years as President Donald Trump attempted to boost the fossil fuel industry by gutting or delaying nearly every major federal climate regulation.\\n\\nEven amid a three-week partial government shutdown leaving federal workers scrambling for pay, the Trump administration is continuing to approve oil and gas drilling permits, Bloomberg reported.\\n\\nBloomberg via Getty Images An American flag flies on top of a Unit Drilling Co. rig in the Bakken Formation outside Watford City, North Dakota.\\n\\nIn October, United Nations scientists issued a dire warning, giving world governments a 2030 deadline to halve emissions or face a cataclysmic temperature spike. Yet emissions hit an all-time high last year and look set to continue soaring as new estimates released Tuesday showed a 3.4 percent surge in the United States alone.\\n\\nA new generation of left-wing Democrats, including Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) and Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.), ran as champions of a Green New Deal, a sweeping federal policy to end fossil fuel use and guarantee high-wage clean-energy sector jobs to every American. It's a popular idea. One poll released last month pegged the number of registered voters who support a Green New Deal at 81 percent, including 57 percent of conservative Republicans.\\n\\nYet only some of the high-profile Democrats hoping to challenge Trump in 2020 have made the issue a top priority. Sanders held a town hall on climate change in December and is preparing legislation on a Green New Deal. Merkley was the first senator to back a Green New Deal last year. Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) followed soon after, explicitly tying his push for a federal job guarantee to the climate proposal.\\n\\nFormer Rep. Beto O'Rourke (D-Texas) and Sens. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) voiced tepid support for the concept of a Green New Deal.\\n\\nThe pledge, even more than the Green New Deal, represents a true litmus test for serious climate action in 2020 and beyond, R.L. Miller, the president of the political action committee Climate Hawks Vote, said by email of Inslee's announcement. Our democracy is being drowned in a dark oily tidal wave of dirty money and it needs leaders who can rise above.\\n\\nInslee stands alone as the first candidate to say climate change takes priority over other hot-button issues like health care, immigration and inequality.\\n\\nThe political capital that needs to be invested, the intense gathering of allies to push this through Congress, just requires an all-out effort, Inslee said. That's not going to be done just because somebody now decides they're interested in climate change. It takes someone who's frankly cared about it for years and years.\\n\\nInslee boasts a lengthy record on climate.\\n\\nIn 2006, Inslee, then one of Washington's 10 U.S. representatives, spearheaded an effort to set a renewable portfolio standard in the Evergreen State. In 2007, he co-authored a book called Apollo's Fire: Igniting America's Clean Energy Economy, which, as the title implies, laid out a vision for bolstering the renewable-energy and electric-vehicle industries. In 2009, he co-founded the Sustainable Energy and Environment Coalition in the House of Representatives. Later that year, he sponsored the federal cap-and-trade bill known as Waxman-Markey.\\n\\nThis is the 11th hour. But it should be our hour to shine. Washington Gov. Jay Inslee (D)\\n\\nSince he was first elected governor in 2012, Inslee repeatedly championed incentives for electric vehicles, with the goal of getting 50,000 on Washington state roads by 2020. In 2016, he became the first governor to issue an executive order capping carbon dioxide emissions. A glowing profile published last week in The Atlantic credited Inslee with pursuing arguably the most progressive and greenest agenda in the country, with fields of solar panels, fleets of electric buses, and massive job growth to show for it.\\n\\nIn just the past year, Inslee kiboshed two major fossil fuel projects and added new regulations on existing infrastructure. Last January, he personally intervened to reject permits to build what would have been the nation's largest oil-by-rail facility at the Port of Vancouver. He signed a bill in March putting a new tax on pipelines, forcing the operators to fund a state program to protect against oil spills. In May, he blocked construction of a $680 million coal-export terminal on the Columbia River.\\n\\nThis is the 11th hour, Inslee said of the time that's left to halt catastrophic global warming. But it should be our hour to shine.\\n\\nInslee fought over the past year to pass Initiative 1631, a ballot measure that would have put a $15 per metric ton fee on carbon dioxide emissions and directed the money toward expanding public transit, energy-efficiency retrofits for big buildings and new wind- and solar-powered plants. The proposal, dubbed by some a state-level Green New Deal, failed after the oil industry spent a record $31 million pressuring Evergreen State voters to reject the measure. It was Inslee's third attempt at putting a price on carbon in his state.\\n\\nBut Inslee said he's not wedded to a carbon pricing scheme as the central focus of a climate policy. Carbon taxes are gaining favor among Republicans and oil companies. But a new gas tax triggered fiery protests in France and became a rallying cry over the past few months against carbon taxes that don't directly benefit low- and middle-income workers.\\n\\nASSOCIATED PRESS A photo shows the smoky haze that obscured the Space Needle and downtown Seattle in August 2018.\\n\\nPeople have focused on this issue of a carbon tax, but it may not be necessary to finance renewable energy infrastructure, Inslee said. We may find other ways to finance this. You look at the Trump tax cuts that were misbegotten and gave all these tax benefits to the upper-income groups, and people weren't worried about the deficit when they did that.\\n\\nInslee faces some critics on climate change. In February, 13 young people in Washington, ages seven to 17, sued the state, alleging Inslee and the agencies under his control violated the constitutional rights of a generation by failing to curb greenhouse gas emissions. One plaintiff ― Jamie Margolin, a 17-year-old activist in Seattle who founded the youth climate group Zero Hour ― railed against Inslee in a series of tweets last week accusing the governor of fighting tooth & nail against the lawsuit, which a state judge tossed in August.\\n\\nMargolin called Inslee an old corperate [sic] establishment white man who screws over the youth and indigenous folks of his state. She pointed to the ongoing fight over a massive liquefied natural gas terminal in Tacoma, Washington, which the Puyallup Tribe and leaders from 14 other Northwest tribes pleaded with Inslee to reject.\\n\\nAsked about the accusations on Tuesday, Inslee said the Tacoma facility had already begun permitting and that his administration was going to follow the law and allow the process to play out, though he said he requested additional carbon dioxide analyses of the project.\\n\\nI cannot make statements about eventual permitting until that plays out, he said. In a follow-up email, Inslee's spokesman reiterated that the project doesn't have final permitting yet.\\n\\nEarlier this year, Inslee visited the scorched remains of Paradise, California, a town decimated by the state's deadliest wildfire in history. He said that visit made clear to him that the 2020 election needed to be singularly focused on the crisis at hand.\\n\\nIt looked like Dresden after World War II, Inslee said. In my final days, when I look back and ask what I did to deal with climate change, I want to be able to say I did everything I could, including possibly running for president."}
{"original": "Farewell 2016 - Welcome 2017\\n\\nThe magic is in our hands!\\n\\nFor me, 2016 was all about turning resolutions into revelations. It was a year full of events, shedding new light on some deep social conflicts, and saying hello to some much-needed changes... something I chose to see positively.\\n\\n2016 found me in auto-recovery mode after leaving behind 2015 which was a momentous year of change and first-hand experiences - including dealing with newly involved political players in my homeland Greece, spearheading change in a public space that is known to be challenging and rather inflexible (Greece and the EU), and negotiating on the side of the Greek Government vis-à-vis the country's lenders. In so many ways, this was a tough and taxing experience.\\n\\nAnd so I crossed from auto-recovery to MAGIC...\\n\\n\\n\\nI was able to garner all my leftover energy and fulfill my promise to keep moving so as not to lose my balance. Just like Albert Einstein had compared life to riding a bicycle. He had said that you need to keep moving in order not to lose your balance. So that's exactly what I did.\\n\\n2016 was a successful year in terms of continuing to achieve lasting change in poor countries, cities, and neighborhoods with the international team of Thought 4 Action (T4A). This personal mark of our methodology in fighting poverty and building a robust middle class, maintains the magic and the purpose to continue! At T4A, we are proud to keep the movement alive and make the inspiration of change a reality for millions of people in the appropriate ecosystems.\\n\\nThrough all my travels, I was able to break new ground in the political entrepreneurship and changemaking movement. During my stay in the US, I worked with the T4A team to develop executive courses on Leadership for Growth and Change tailored for public and private sector thought and action leaders with the audacity to dream and the tenacity to deliver.\\n\\nWe also engaged in publically pushing for change and innovation in the areas of economic policy and politics. This work was applied in several places around the world, including parts of South and North America, and has been presented in lectures, policy briefs and articles that I authored or co-authored. It represents over 19 years of frontline experience, built on the successful application of transforming informal societies, people, and markets into vibrant formal entities and agents.\\n\\nOne example is the case of economic standstill in terms of growth. I have come to the realization that serious and deep innovative thinking in economic policy is needed to overcome the period of slow growth, as coined by Willem Buiter, chief economist of Citigroup Global. I believe the traditional ways of handling economic policy need to be revised. Simply because, the known developed-world has been saturated and new ideas do not easily reach the decision-making top, thus there is greater rigidity to change. This is a rather oxymoron phenomenon, as the developed world gives the impression of being open and welcoming to new ideas...\\n\\nUnfortunately, this is not always the case in practice. This is the reason we have noticed such abrupt changes in 2016. And this is why T4A launched Political Entrepreneurship: building leadership in a public private ecosystem, which was presented to global innovative entrepreneurs last October at Opportunity Collaboration. It was exciting to see the development of a productive dialogue on public policy from the side of entrepreneurs.\\n\\nA raw inspiration - one that emerges from new ideas - and the realization that it is possible to transform informality and stagnation, as well as, to create a formidable spirit for the future is what helped spearhead the magic. It is the reason I kept going. It is the reason we were able to build the local Greek T4A team and to hold a brilliant event streamed live to over 19,000 viewers around the world (www.t4action.org). The event, titled Transformation through Innovation was beyond any doubt a success.\\n\\nNow that we have stirred the waves and are in motion, we are gathering traction and gaining momentum. Forget about coasting on cruise control. We need to hit the accelerator to ensure that 2017 will be a year full of positive surprises and positive new trends. It's a new year and a new opportunity to ignite the engine of change. Let's challenge ourselves to pass from moving to flying!\\n\\nHappy and inspiring New Year. The Magic is in our Hands!"}
{"original": "Jonathan Ernst / Reuters President-elect Joe Biden jokingly thanks Georgia for certifying his victory three times as he campaigns on behalf of Democratic Senate candidates Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock in Atlanta on Monday.\\n\\nThe Democratic sweep in Tuesday's Georgia Senate runoff probably won't alter much of the incoming Biden administration's reform agenda. Progressive hopes for everything from action on climate change to judicial reform remain limited, if not nonexistent. Even without the pandemic, the country and the world are marching steadily toward various modes of destruction.\\n\\nBut claiming the Senate majority does offer Democrats some reasonable grounds for optimism, should the clear electoral indications from Tuesday hold. For the next two years, at least, President-elect Joe Biden's party will be able to control what bills receive votes and when. Most importantly, Democrats will have much greater influence over the federal response to the coronavirus pandemic and the economic support that must go hand-in-hand with national public health efforts.\\n\\nGiven the failed federal response to COVID-19 so far, that can only mean improvement. On public health, the record is one of unmitigated disaster. Where South Korea, Taiwan, New Zealand, Singapore and other places swiftly implemented effective measures to avert both mass death and economic calamity, the United States has been an uncoordinated and morally callous disgrace.\\n\\nSome of the trouble has been bipartisan ― plenty of states with Democratic governors pursued premature reopenings over the summer and have struggled with testing and now vaccinations. Some of it is the result of decades of economic non-policy that left the United States uniquely vulnerable to supply chain disruptions. But it is hard to imagine that Biden could do worse than the Trump administration's raving, dishonest incompetence.\\n\\nThat the federal government blew the pandemic response is, outside QAnon fantasy forums, uncontroversial. Less well-understood is the way federal economic mismanagement has contributed to the public health problem.\\n\\nCongress badly misjudged the nature and scope of the coronavirus crisis with the CARES Act, and then took six months to assemble a fiscal Band-Aid for its mistakes.\\n\\nThe flagship coronavirus legislation was the CARES Act, passed in late March with a unanimous Senate vote. Conventional wisdom in Washington regards the law as a smashing success. Even the chronically malcontent left has cheered the CARES Act for temporarily boosting unemployment benefits by $600 a week ― a level that put modest upward pressure on wages, since some workers found themselves better off financially after losing their jobs. Generous provisions for big business prevented a financial panic, and though clumsy, the hundreds of billions of dollars allocated to support small businesses did not go to waste.\\n\\nAll of this is true, but the verdict of success is misplaced. Congress badly misjudged the nature and scope of the coronavirus crisis with the CARES Act, and then took six months to assemble a fiscal Band-Aid for its mistakes. By the time Congress finally passed an eleventh-hour re-up on some of the law's provisions, 1 out of every 6 American families with children were going hungry. And what they passed was a paltry influx of cash ― far short of the $2,000 per person that Democrats, and even Trump, called for.\\n\\nDemocratic lawmakers recognized the inadequacy of their efforts back in the spring. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) began referring to phases of the legislative response ― CARES was Phase Three (Congress, it turns out, had actually passed two previous phases of relief so negligible as to have already been forgotten). When the next bill merely topped-up an almost instantly exhausted small business relief program, lawmakers changed Phase Four to Phase Three-and-a-Half. And when no further relief came from Washington for several more months, Pelosi stopped talking about phases.\\n\\nThe more robust unemployment provisions of the CARES Act expired in July. Its $350 billion in small business aid drained in two weeks, and 60% of the $310 billion top-up was gone within two weeks of Phase-Three-and-a-Half's passage.\\n\\nWorst of all, however, was the lack of concern for state and local governments. Back in July, the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal-leaning think tank, estimated that the coronavirus crash would create state government budget shortfalls of about $555 billion ― a figure that would increase substantially if local and tribal governments were included in the calculation. The CARES Act included just $150 billion in state and local government relief.\\n\\nThis guaranteed a large round of unnecessary layoffs for teachers, firefighters and other public servants. But it also encouraged disastrous pandemic policies. In order to boost tax revenue to balance state budgets, governors encouraged reckless reopening strategies, hoping to get money to local businesses that would make their way to state coffers. The results for state budgets were disappointing, but more importantly, they encouraged the spread of a deadly virus.\\n\\nIt is time for a big, multitrillion-dollar economic relief package ― for the sake of American families and public health. The results of the Georgia runoff make that kind of legislation much more plausible.\\n\\nThe fresh $900 billion in relief Congress passed last month includes a welcome $300 per week boost to federal unemployment benefits ― half that of CARES, and set to expire on March 14 ― along with a $600 per person check for households making less than $75,000 a year.\\n\\nIt isn't nothing, but once again, it is inadequate given the scope of the crisis.\\n\\nThe legislation includes no funds for state and local governments, and according to economists Mark Paul and Adam Hersh, is at least $2.1 trillion short of what the economy needs to return to pre-pandemic health. Paul and Hersh assume that government spending is about or a little more efficient at boosting economic growth than its direct outlays ― payments are spent on other activity, which in turn encourages more activity.\\n\\nBut the Congressional Budget Office has been much more conservative about the efficacy of government spending during the pandemic, assuming that only a fraction of every federal dollar will actually result in economic output. Based on the CBO's more cautious estimates, the latest stimulus legislation is a stunning $6.8 trillion short of February 2020.\\n\\nThe CBO is probably wrong; Paul and Hersh are probably right. And in a $21-plus trillion economy, a gap of a couple trillion isn't really that big. It's only big in the minds of members of Congress, who feel uncomfortable about spending money, even when every economic indicator says they should spend much, much more.\\n\\nRegardless of exactly how much needs to be spent, there is simply no economic indicator that suggests the United States government is anywhere close to overspending or over-indebtedness.\\n\\nInterest rates remain at or near historic lows and the Federal Reserve has a bevy of actions it can take should they rise. Inflation sits at just 1.2%, well below the Fed's target rate of above 2%.\\n\\nIn short, it is time for a big, multitrillion-dollar economic relief package ― for the sake of American families and public health. The results of the Georgia runoff make that kind of legislation much more plausible.\\n\\nBarring a bizarre-but-not-mathematically-impossible shift in the Georgia vote tallies, These fiscal decisions will be in the hands of Democrats. Key tax and spending decisions are not subject to the filibuster ― a simple majority will do, and Democrats will now have the simplest of majorities to do so."}
{"original": "Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear (D) blasted a fledgling effort to remove him from office on Tuesday, painting two of the four Kentucky residents who filed an impeachment petition against him last week as extremists of the sort who carried out an insurrection at the U.S. Capitol. He warned Republican state lawmakers that backing the removal effort risked inciting similar trouble in Kentucky.\\n\\nPointing to social media posts and news reports, Beshear accused a Kentuckian named Tony Wheatley, one of the authors of the impeachment petition, of organizing a spring protest where demonstrators hanged Beshear in effigy from a tree outside the state Capitol and others stormed the governor's mansion. Beshear also displayed a Facebook post in which another man behind the impeachment effort posted that God may strike [Beshear] down. The post included a video in which a handgun was visible behind the man's head.\\n\\nThese people who signed this petition have tried to create terror for me and my family before. And when that hasn't worked, I guess they're trying something new, Beshear said. We cannot, as a country and as a government, lift these folks up. It is dangerous. It is fanning the flames of their hate and of their anger.\\n\\nAnd whether this was something filed against me or anybody else, going out there and playing pattycake with the so-called militias that stormed our U.S. Capitol ... is just wrong.\\n\\nAP Photo/Timothy D. Easley, File Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear used a Tuesday news conference to blast an impeachment effort against him after four Kentucky residents filed a petition seeking his removal from office over COVID-19 restrictions he's put in place.\\n\\nThe two men were among the four Kentucky residents who filed an impeachment request to the state House of Representatives last weekend, arguing that Beshear violated the rights of Kentuckians with executive orders imposing various restrictions meant to halt the spread of COVID-19, even though the Kentucky Supreme Court unanimously ruled in November that dozens of Beshear's orders were legal and reasonable.\\n\\nThe petition alone is enough to force lawmakers to consider it under Kentucky law, and in theory, opens the door for the Republicans who hold massive supermajorities in both houses of the Kentucky legislature to escalate their own fight over COVID-19 measures and Beshear's executive powers if they choose to.\\n\\nBoth men have denied that they wished violence of any sort on Beshear or other political officials. But their effort to thwart the governor comes amid federal law enforcement officials' increased warnings about potential violence at state capitols and after months of volatile, often armed protests outside state legislatures, including Kentucky's, that have heightened tensions nationwide.\\n\\nIn Michigan and Oregon, attempts to take over state capitols served as precursors to last week's riot in Washington, D.C., and though the temperature hasn't risen quite that high in Kentucky, the impeachment effort is marked by a similar refusal to accept election results or the legitimacy of political power when a Democratic lawmaker attempts to wield it.\\n\\nWheatley told HuffPost that the four men filed the impeachment petition because they felt the Kentucky Supreme Court ruling allowed Beshear to do anything he wants, including wipe out the legislature altogether.\\n\\nThe Court ruling, though, did not go nearly that far ― it merely found that Beshear's orders complied with a law allowing governors to exercise some executive powers during an emergency.\\n\\nIt would sorely undermine democracy for the legislature to impeach a governor simply because they don't agree with his policy choices, as opposed to impeaching Trump for inciting a riot to overturn democracy. Joshua A. Douglas, University of Kentucky law professor\\n\\nAndrew Cooperrider, a bar and restaurant owner who was among the petition filers, noted that other Beshear orders had been struck down in court. It is not actually up for debate over whether or not he has made unconstitutional mandates, Cooperrider said Wednesday. What's up for debate is whether or not he should be impeached for doing that.\\n\\nThe answer, according to one legal expert, is a resounding no: University of Kentucky law professor Joshua A. Douglas said in an email this week that he believed the impeachment petition had zero merit.\\n\\nAny claims that Beshear has acted outside of his authority ― which I do not think he has ― can be handled by the courts, Douglas said. It would sorely undermine democracy for the legislature to impeach a Governor simply because they don't agree with his policy choices, as opposed to impeaching Trump for inciting a riot to overturn democracy.\\n\\nKentucky House Speaker David Osborne (R) announced Saturday that he would form an impeachment committee to consider the petition this week, a move that is required under state law even if House leaders ultimately decide the claims are baseless. Republicans aren't tipping their hand on whether they will pursue impeachment: State Rep. Jason Nemes, the GOP chair of the committee, said the group would meet Wednesday to outline rules and invite Beshear to file a formal response. Nemes would not discuss the merits of the impeachment filing.\\n\\nWe have a legal obligation to follow the law, and that's what we're going to do, Nemes said. I want to make sure that the governor is given adequate time to make his defense to respond if he chooses to respond. And I want to make sure that we treat the petitioners with respect and give them an opportunity to make their cases. They have the right under the law to do that.\\n\\nPolls have shown that a majority of Kentuckians approve of Beshear's job performance and his handling of the pandemic. But small groups of Kentuckians have still staged demonstrations outside the state Capitol in Frankfort to protest restrictions the governor has implemented.\\n\\nAP Photo/Timothy D. Easley Protesters lined the walkway to the Kentucky state Capitol with signs calling for Beshear's impeachment earlier this month. Armed protesters gathered outside the building on Saturday, just days after a violent insurrection at the U.S. Capitol.\\n\\nWheatley, who leads a group called Constitutional Kentucky, attended a protest against Beshear's COVID-19 measures in May. During that rally, a man with ties to the 3 Percenters militia group hanged the effigy of Beshear. Later that day, a crowd of demonstrators marched to the governor's mansion, where some of them banged on the door while Beshear and his family were inside.\\n\\nWheatley told HuffPost that while he was present at the rally, he did not organize it and had nothing to do with the effigy or the march to the governor's mansion. He said that he was the one who cut down the effigy once he noticed it.\\n\\nWheatley also participated in a protest outside the state Capitol in Frankfort on Saturday at which armed demonstrators marched as legislative sessions continued inside. The protests came just days after the Capitol invasion, but Wheatley said the Kentucky demonstration was peaceful. He said he opposed the Capitol riots, which he called an atrocity.\\n\\nWe think the people that started that should be prosecuted to the highest extent, Wheatley said. Lives were lost, and there is no reason for that.\\n\\nThe other man Beshear highlighted previously ran as a Libertarian candidate for the state House and has in the past posted that any politician who supports the Patriot Act, a controversial federal law passed after the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, is a traitor and a tyrant, and should be hanged.\\n\\nThe Kentucky Democratic Party on Tuesday also circulated a Nov. 6 Facebook post in which the man referenced the possibility of a looming civil war in the United States due to a lack of transparency in this voting process. (There were no irregularities in the 2020 elections, federal and state authorities have repeatedly said.)\\n\\nThe post Beshear cited that included a visible handgun was published in April and included a 12-minute video in which the man reads from the Bible and criticizes Beshear's early order to limit in-person church services. The man, who didn't respond to a voice mail message requesting comment, reposted the video ― in which he states that his message is not meant to be physically threatening and that I wouldn't want to see any harm come to you ― less than an hour after Beshear's news conference.\\n\\nAs usual, he is a liar, he wrote in a post accompanying the video. If you listen to the video, I make sure to clarify that I do not want any harm to come to him. … As for the gun, I always have a firearm next to my bed. Some people are scared of them, I guess. Again, I clarified several times that I hope no harm comes to him, and will pray for him. I still will.\\n\\nAP Photo/Timothy D. Easley Armed protesters gathered at the Kentucky state Capitol in Frankfort on Saturday, just days after the violent riots at the U.S. Capitol in Washington.\\n\\nThe Democratic Party's release also cited posts made by Cooperrider, whose bar and coffee shop have defied Beshear's orders restricting in-person dining. He regularly posts political messages from the company's Facebook account.\\n\\nYou reap what you sow, the company account posted Wednesday evening, just hours after the Capitol riot. You can't keep people locked up in their house. You can't keep ignoring the needs of your citizenry. You can't keep antagonizing the people. Then act surprised when they rise up and it boils over, the post said beneath a meme based on an image from the riots.\\n\\nCooperrider said Wednesday that political violence was useless and silly, and that Beshear was guilty of the sort of escalation the governor claimed he was trying to prevent. But he also thinks the riots in Washington were a natural result of frustrations those Americans feel.\\n\\nI don't see how showing the personal Facebook page of an individual during a press conference doesn't raise the temperature. That is sowing violence, Cooperrider said. When you take the D.C. riots ― when the media is completely disregarding these people's concerns, and not at least trying to address their concerns, and instead of calling them 'deplorables' and things like that, they're going to respond in that way.\\n\\nAnd I think pretending the D.C. riots is just an event without realizing it's a reaction to other things is the way that we're going to keep seeing these things. We have to recognize that those types of things are reactions. And we have to stop doing those things to stop violence from occurring.\\n\\nCooperrider said he had not attended the protests where Beshear was hanged in effigy and that he has called on people to avoid demonstrating on Inauguration Day.\\n\\nBeshear has faced numerous legal challenges from Republican Attorney General Daniel Cameron and other GOP officials since the beginning of the pandemic, and the Republican legislature last week advanced multiple bills that would place new limits on Beshear's executive powers, a move they'd promised to make in response to his use of executive orders to implement COVID-19 restrictions.\\n\\nBeshear stopped short of blaming the impeachment effort on the GOP during his Tuesday news conference. But he also warned that backing it risked fomenting even more anger in a state, and a country, that's already on a knife's edge.\\n\\nAt this point, I don't think they're supporting it, Beshear said. But we cannot spend our time lifting up those who create and cause terror in our country. We've already seen what happens when you do it."}

The Brussels leg was still on until the last minute.\\n\\nBut Pompeo's final visit schedule in Brussels was not going to involve any meetings with the EU or any public events at NATO. A third diplomatic source said allies were embarrassed by Pompeo after the violence in Washington last Wednesday.\\n\\nTrump encouraged his supporters at a rally to march on the building that houses the Senate and the House of Representatives while lawmakers were certifying Democrat President-elect Joe Biden's Nov. 3 election victory. Republican Trump claims, without providing evidence, that the election was stolen from him.\\n\\nPompeo condemned the violence but made no reference to the role Trump's baseless claims played in galvanizing the march on the Capitol.\\n\\nAppalled by the violence, Luxembourg's Asselborn had called Trump a criminal and a political pyromaniac on RTL Radio the next day.\\n\\nLuxembourg's foreign ministry confirmed the previously planned stop there was canceled, but declined to give further details. The EU declined to comment.\\n\\nThe U.S. State Department, in a statement, attributed the cancellation to transition work before Biden takes office onJan. 20, even if until recently Pompeo had been reluctant to unequivocally recognize Biden's win. The State Department declined further comment on European officials' rejection ofmeetings with Pompeo.\\n\\nIn Brussels, Pompeo was due to have a private dinner with NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg on Wednesday evening at Stoltenberg's private residence, before meeting Belgian ForeignMinister Sophie Wilmes, whose country is a NATO ally.\\n\\nThe cold shoulder was a contrast with Pompeo's previous visits to Brussels, which is home to NATO and EU headquarters, over the past three years, where he has given key-note speeches on U.S. policy and met the EU's chief executive, even as Europe balked at Trump's foreign policy.\\n\\nIn 2018, Pompeo said in Brussels that Trump's 'America First' policy was reshaping the post-World War Two system on the basis of sovereign states, not institutions such as the EU.\\n\\nEU officials, who say they were exhausted by Trump's unpredictability, are eager to build fresh ties with Biden.\\n\\nIt was not immediately clear why Pompeo sought to go to Brussels so near to the end of Trump's term.\\n\\nOne source, while explaining why Pompeo chose to remain inWashington, cited his eagerness to roll out planned foreign policy tasks until the end of the term and help keep the continuity of government.\\n\\nFor nearly three years, Pompeo, an evangelical Christian,proved a loyal executor of Trump's unconventional style.\\n\\nHis tenure did not include obvious successes in such long-standing U.S. foreign policy challenges as reining in the Iranian and North Korean nuclear programs, ending the U.S. war in Afghanistan or containing an increasingly assertive China.\\n\\nNevertheless on Jan. 1, Pompeo kicked off a daily Twitter thread, saying the United States was much safer today than four years ago thanks to what he saw as the foreign policy accomplishments of the Trump administration.\\n\\nHe said he would showcase the results. Over the coming days, I'm going to lay out the mission set, the huge wins, personal stories, and a lot more.

{"original": "There is an actual art (and science) to deal making. And after three-plus weeks of government shutdown, it should be clear by now ― if it wasn't already― that President Donald Trump is uniquely terrible at the practice.\\n\\nTrump is so out of the ordinary when it comes to negotiation, in fact, that the quarterly published by the Program on Negotiation at Harvard Law School, devoted its latest issue to him. For the first time in the Negotiation Journal's 35-year history, it's used a whole issue to talk about a U.S. president.\\n\\nDue out next week, the Journal drills into the central paradox of Trump and negotiation: The president spent his career positioning himself as the consummate deal-maker. He's listed as the author, after all, of the Art of the Deal, though it was ghost-written. Yet, there's little evidence he's actually good at deal-making. Many of his best real-estate deals were actually put in place by George Ross (who handled real estate negotiations), and Roy Cohn, the legendary attorney, was Trump's original fixer and known for being a brutal negotiator, writes University of Pennsylvania Wharton School professor G. Richard Shell in a piece for the issue.\\n\\nWithout Cohn, who died in 1986, there have been mostly business failures and bankruptcies and lawsuits.\\n\\nIn the close to 15 years that I've been editing the Journal, nobody has used Donald Trump's the Art of the Deal as a citation in their article. Never. Not once, said Nancy Waters, the managing editor of the Journal, which is the publication for the Program on Negotiation, a consortium that includes Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Tufts University.\\n\\nThe omission was not out of elitism. Waters said that the publication, which has contributors across disciplines from around the globe, has covered other more pop-culture-esque business books. Trump's just never turned up.\\n\\nThat may be because Trump's negotiating style at a base level contradicts all the best practices generally agreed on by experts in negotiation.\\n\\nThe way he negotiates directly challenges what is almost a half-century of tools and principles and methods that have emerged in the field, said Joel Cutcher-Gershenfeld, a professor in the Heller School for Social Policy and Management at Brandeis University, who is the editor of the Journal.\\n\\nTo start, Trump claims to use a zero-sum strategy in which he wins and the other side loses. The win-lose equation is considered out of date, ineffective and generally counterproductive among those who study negotiation.\\n\\nSAUL LOEB via Getty Images Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi and Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer speak to the media following a meeting with President Donald Trump about the partial government shutdown at the White House in Washington, DC, Jan. 9, 2019.\\n\\nWin-lose dealmaking is a tough sell in a democracy or anytime you're trying to reach an agreement with a powerful counterparty who has enough leverage to withstand the demands of the bully across the table, like Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) fresh off her party's electoral victory in the 2018 elections.\\n\\nIn such cases, you're not likely going to get exactly what you want. So a good negotiator has to think empathetically about what the other side wants and then sell them a deal that could be viewed as a so-called win-win. Trump isn't known for empathy.\\n\\nStill, this isn't complicated. All the other presidents knew how to make deals, said Carrie Menkel-Meadow, a professor of Law at the University of California Irvine Law School and a co-editor on the special issue.\\n\\nTrump doesn't understand the basic principle: To get what you want, you have to give other people what they want, said Menkel-Meadow, who was at Georgetown Law during the Clinton-era shutdown and trained negotiators at the Department of Justice.\\n\\nA solid deal-maker also doesn't make an enemy out of his counterparty. Ideally in politics or diplomacy, he's built up some goodwill with them. Trump, on the other hand, demonizes and belittles his political opponents (and sometimes his allies).\\n\\nNancy and Cryin' Chuck can end the Shutdown in 15 minutes. At this point it has become their, and the Democrats, fault! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 14, 2019\\n\\nFormer President Barack Obama used to get criticized for not schmoozing with Republicans in the House. This president, on the other hand, not only isn't here to make friends, he's actively terrorizing his colleagues via Twitter.\\n\\nWhat we're seeing here is the cost of not building a relationship with the Democrats and their leaders, and now when it's absolutely essential because they're more powerful and he needs their votes, he's incapable of doing it, said Thomas Kochan, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Sloan School of Management, who wrote about Trump's effect on business negotiations. They don't trust him; he doesn't trust them.\\n\\nLack of trust is the third critical piece of the failed Trump strategy. Negotiation experts concede that a hard-driving win-lose strategy sometimes can work. But not without trust.\\n\\nFormer President Lyndon Johnson, for example, was known for his hard-driving, persistent, negotiation tactics. And, of course, Johnson was able to push through civil rights legislation at a time when his own party was dominated by segregationists. This was a case of someone staking out a position and forcing everyone to his side.\\n\\nBut one of the key ways Johnson differed from Trump, Cutcher-Gershenfeld pointed out, is trust. His word was his bond, he said.\\n\\nTrump has already famously backed out of immigration deals he's agreed to.\\n\\nThere may be some upside to Trump's willingness to break the established norms of negotiating, said Cutcher-Gershenfeld. I don't want to say it's all bad, but I do want to say when you break the rules of the game you should know what you're doing. He pointed that in the case of Trump opening talks with North Korea, there could possibly be some upside to the president's unconventional approach.\\n\\nThe zero-sum strategy and willingness to walk away from the deal may also have been better suited to one-off real-estate transactions. Politics is different. In negotiations with Congress, when you walk away there isn't another Congress to walk to, he said.\\n\\nRight now, Democrats seem to be just as locked into their position as Trump. On Tuesday, a group from the House declined the president's offer for a lunch meeting, though there were reports that behind-the-scenes talks were happening.\\n\\nIn the Negotiation Journal's special issue, 35 experts in negotiation from across a wide range of disciplines ― lawyers, trade negotiators, psychologists, business school professors, political scientists ― examine the effect Trump's deal-making strategy is having on the world, from international diplomacy to gender and race relations here in the U.S.\\n\\nMany of the authors have advised both Democratic and Republican policymakers over the years.\\n\\nThe study of conflict resolution really took off during the Cold War when the stakes of failed negotiation and zero-sum gamesmanship were truly apocalyptic: nuclear annihilation. The stakes today seem increasingly high, as well, with Brexit threatening to destabilize the U.K. and Trump's sketchy diplomacy skills threatening to upend so much else.\\n\\nStill, many of the experts in the field are true believers in the proposition that there is no dispute too thorny to untangle. Many still believe there's a path to peace in the Middle East if only the right strategy is employed.\\n\\nAnd so, several who spoke with HuffPost did see a way out of the shutdown that didn't involve the courts. (That's where you go when negotiations break down, said Menkel-Meadow.)\\n\\nMIT's Kochan suggested reframing the debate. Instead of making this a fight about a wall, making it a negotiation more broadly about border security. That way there's more to bargain over ― not just a wall yes or no, but also funds for greater resources. Democrats could argue for support for the Dreamers and a path to citizenship.\\n\\nHe and other experts also recommended bringing in more people to negotiate ― a tried-and-true tactic. Kochan suggested that the president, the Senate and the House should create an expert panel that would figure out a path forward.\\n\\nSince this is Trump we're talking about perhaps the key to unlocking the stalemate begins and ends with the president's perception of himself. Any solution has to feed his ego, Kochan said. As much as it's painful to play into that.\\n\\nRight now, he's backed himself into a corner and if his opponents truly want to break this impasse they have to help him figure out a way to save face, said Deborah Kolb, a professor emeritus at the Simmons University School of Business in Boston and the author of Negotiating at Work: Turn Small Wins into Big Gains.\\n\\nHe's really locked himself in, she said, adding: Great negotiators just don't do that.\\n\\nClarification: Language in this story has been amended to clarify that it was George Ross who negotiated many of Trump's real estate deals."}

{"original": "President Joe Biden rescinded former President Donald Trump's travel ban on several Muslim-majority countries, fulfilling his pledge to Muslim and immigrant advocacy groups and allowing families to reunite in the U.S. after years apart.\\n\\nThe executive order was among many signed on Wednesday, his first day in office.\\n\\nNearly four years ago, Trump issued an executive order limiting entry for people from seven Muslim-majority nations, a follow-up to his campaign promise of a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States.\\n\\nAfter Trump signed his order, thousands of people went to airports across the country to protest the ban, calling it discriminatory. The original ban was challenged repeatedly in federal court, but the Supreme Court ultimately upheld a tweaked version of the order in 2018.\\n\\nOver the course of Trump's presidency, the ban was revised and expanded. In February 2020, he added several African countries to the list ― a move that Democrats and immigration advocates called racist.\\n\\nThe impact of the ban has been chilling. For years, thousands of families have been separated. Married couples were unable to reunite and parents missed the births of their children. Students could not attend college and people could not receive medical treatment in the U.S. One study found that women from travel ban countries were more likely to give birth prematurely.\\n\\nMore than 42,000 people tried to come to the U.S. and were barred under the ban, according to a 2019 analysis of State Department data by the Brennan Center for Justice, a nonpartisan law and policy institute. At least 3,460 parents were separated from their American children.\\n\\nThe number of Muslim refugees admitted into the country between 2016 and 2018 shrank by 91%. Of those refugees who resettled in the U.S. in 2018, 70% were Christian. Only approximately 15% of admitted refugees were Muslim.\\n\\nTwo and a half years passed before two congressional subcommittees held a hearing on the travel ban in September 2019. That hearing highlighted the proposed National Origin-Based Antidiscrimination for Nonimmigrants Act, or No Ban Act ― a bill that would terminate the ban and prohibit any similar laws.\\n\\nThe bill finally passed the Democrat led-House of Representatives in July 2020; it did not get a vote in the then Republican-controlled Senate. While Biden's executive order has now repealed the ban, Muslim advocacy groups are still pushing for an amended version of the legislation to prevent a future president from issuing a comparable ban.\\n\\nFamilies separated by the ban have expressed optimism and said they're hopeful their loved ones will be granted a second chance at entry under the Biden administration. The new administration has to deal with the backlog of case denials ― which could take months or even years ― while ensuring that approved immigrants can arrive in the U.S. safely amid the ongoing travel limitations due to the COVID-19 pandemic."}
{"original": "In the past two years, a dozen states have joined more than 200 localities in offering free tuition to four-year colleges, community colleges and technical schools.\\n\\nHunter Dyke, The Ann Arbor News via AP Students at the University of Michigan. Kalamazoo Promise, which has sparked a free tuition trend, covers four years of tuition at any public college or university in Michigan or at 15 private colleges in the state.\\n\\nBy Marsha Mercer\\n\\nTo churn out more workers with marketable skills, an increasing number of states are offering residents free tuition to community colleges and technical schools.\\n\\nThe move also is a reaction to fast-rising tuition costs — increases that stem, in part, from states reducing their financial support of public colleges and universities.\\n\\nMorley Winograd, president of the Campaign for Free College Tuition, a Seattle-based nonprofit, described the movement as the fastest-growing policy idea in the country — one with bipartisan support.\\n\\nEverybody's got cheap dirt — but do you have skilled workers? Winograd said. That's the question states face as they recruit new industry.\\n\\nBut the free tuition push hasn't produced an economic bonanza for any of the pioneering cities—at least not yet — and some states have struggled to come up with the money to keep their end of the bargain.\\n\\nThe free tuition trend began in 2005 in Kalamazoo, Michigan, which launched a privately funded effort to combat its economic decline. The movement has quickly spread: Today roughly 200 localities offer young residents free tuition to local community colleges and technical schools.\\n\\nIn the past two years, 12 states have enacted legislation to join them. The state rush to offer free tuition began with Tennessee in 2015, but other states quickly followed. Arkansas, Hawaii, Indiana, Kentucky, Minnesota, New York, Oregon and Rhode Island have started programs, and Nevada plans to launch one this year. California and Montana last year enacted legislation to create programs but have yet to appropriate funds.\\n\\nDelaware and Louisiana also offer somewhat more restrictive free college scholarships with additional requirements, such as a minimum college aptitude test score or a clean record.\\n\\nFree tuition plans typically promise students a free ride if they meet certain requirements, such as maintaining a certain GPA. Most plans only pay for tuition, so students must cover fees, books and other costs.\\n\\nMost of the programs are last dollar, which means a student must obtain and use federal aid, such as Pell Grants or other scholarships, before the program kicks in to cover the rest.\\n\\nSome states, such as Arkansas and Kentucky, limit their programs to students in selected fields. Arkansas only awards grants to students focusing on science, technology, engineering, math and other subjects employers most value. This year, Work Ready Kentucky is limiting aid to students studying health care, transportation and logistics, advanced manufacturing, construction, and business services and information technology.\\n\\nClearly we're seeing a lot of momentum right now, said Dustin Weeden, senior policy analyst with the State Higher Education Executive Officers Association, an advocacy group based in Boulder, Colorado.\\n\\n'Drive to 55'\\n\\nTennessee's stated goal is to make sure that 55 percent of Tennesseans have a college degree or certificate by 2025. The state started by offering free tuition for two years of community college or technical school to every recent high school graduate in the state. The state in 2016 revised the program to allow a greater number of older adults to attend any of the 27 Tennessee Colleges of Applied Technology for free, starting in this coming fall.\\n\\nThe state pays for the programs through an endowment started with $300 million in excess lottery revenue. The program operates on interest from the endowment.\\n\\nTuition at four-year public colleges has risen 35 percent since the 2008 school year, according to an analysis by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a left-leaning think tank based in Washington. In Tennessee, per-student state funding at public colleges and universities declined 18 percent from 2008 to 2016, and the average annual tuition at public colleges and universities rose by more than $3,000 during that period.\\n\\nSince Tennessee launched its free tuition program, applications and enrollment at the state's community colleges have soared. More than 33,000 Tennesseans have attended college free. Higher education is now a part of Tennessee's sales pitch to potential employers, said Mike Krause, executive director of the Tennessee Higher Education Commission.\\n\\nI can absolutely tell you it figures in our conversations, he said. Although he could not point to a specific employer won by free college, Krause said: There's a buzz now about education that wasn't there before.\\n\\nMixed Results\\n\\nBut in Kalamazoo, a dozen years of free tuition have yielded mixed results.\\n\\nKalamazoo Promise, which is funded by anonymous donors, covers four years of tuition at any public college or university in Michigan or at 15 private colleges in the state. Students who attend Kalamazoo schools every year from kindergarten through 12th grade receive all tuition and fees paid; those who attend grades nine through 12 receive 65 percent of their costs paid.\\n\\nTim Ready, a sociology professor and director of the Walker Institute for the Study of Race and Ethnic Relations at Western Michigan University, said the first nine years of free tuition, which cost donors $54 million, was marginally beneficial but not a slam dunk for Kalamazoo's economy.\\n\\nWe had the Great Recession, which makes it hard to determine what the effect of Kalamazoo Promise on the economy has been, Ready said. Other factors, such as a new university medical school, have played a role in the slowly recovering economy, he said.\\n\\nReady believes that free tuition is necessary but not sufficient to create economic impact. Between 2005 and 2014, the city's public school enrollment grew by almost 25 percent (though the number of low-income kids receiving free lunches also increased). Kalamazoo now has more college graduates, and the erosion in its population has stopped.\\n\\nKalamazoo Promise probably did help mitigate the decline in the central city area, Ready said.\\n\\nBut he cautioned that the progress is not reaching everybody. There's a lot of income inequality here.\\n\\nIn Oregon, which also offers each participating student $1,000 for books and other expenses, the challenge has been finding money to keep the program going.\\n\\nOregon Promise, established by the Legislature in 2015, scrambled after its first year, 2016-17, when lawmakers, while increasing funding, appropriated less than needed to continue the program in its original form. Demand had risen more than expected.\\n\\nThe Legislature increased funding from $10 million in the start-up year to $40 million in the next two-year budget, but that was still $8 million short. To compensate, the state set stricter income eligibility limits for new students (current students were grandfathered in).\\n\\nThat word — promise — is what makes the program really galvanizing, said Ben Cannon, executive director of the Oregon Higher Education Coordinating Commission.\\n\\nStates should be very careful about making promises they may not be able to keep, he said. When the program has to compete every year or every other year with other worthy needs in the state budget, legislators can find other priorities more compelling."}

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) is a full-time senator again, and he wants Democrats to back legislation that would cover health care for all during the coronavirus pandemic.\\n\\nSanders and Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) proposed an emergency version of their signature Medicare for All legislation on Friday: the Health Care Emergency Guarantee Act, which would have Medicare reimburse all out-of-pocket costs for both insured and uninsured Americans throughout the coronavirus pandemic.\\n\\nCongress has already passed a bill to make testing for the coronavirus free, and Democrats have also been pushing for coronavirus treatment to be cost-free as well. Even President Donald Trump said the federal government will pay providers for treating uninsured patients. But this plan from Sanders and Jayapal goes significantly further.\\n\\nThe two lawmakers want a federal backstop for the millions of Americans who have lost their health insurance due to unemployment in recent weeks, as well as some financial aid for the potentially high costs of hospitalization and treatment for COVID-19 patients.\\n\\nWhat we are seeing today is the fundamental fallacies of the employer-based health care, and the reason for that is that it is likely, over the two-month period, tens of millions of Americans are going to lose their jobs and lose their health care as well, Sanders told HuffPost in a phone interview. The idea that we look at health care in America as an employee benefit is totally absurd.\\n\\nFor uninsured Americans, the bill would cover any health care items and services that are medically necessary or appropriate to maintain a person's health, get a diagnosis, or go through rehabilitation, at Medicare rates, which are substantially lower than what private insurers pay providers. In other words, this would not cover elective surgeries like a hip replacement during the pandemic, but would cover cancer treatment or an inhaler for asthma. Many hospitals have stopped elective treatments during the pandemic as health care providers struggle to get the resources they need to address the surge in COVID-19 cases.\\n\\nFor those who are insured, the bill would cover deductibles, copayments and any cost-sharing burdens patients have. The emergency coverage would last until the Food and Drug Administration approves and widely distributes a coronavirus vaccine.\\n\\nSanders' colleagues in the House and Senate, like Rep. Ruben Gallego (D-Ariz.) and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), have also been out front calling for the government to help cover coronavirus treatments. Gallego's proposal in the House would have Medicaid, the federal health insurance program for low-income Americans, cover treatment.\\n\\nBut Sanders' and Jayapal's teams were concerned that going through Medicaid, which is run on a state-by-state basis, would encounter issues in lower-income states and in states that have been less willing to expand the program. And they saw the need for coverage beyond coronavirus treatment.\\n\\nASSOCIATED PRESS Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) speaks at a presidential campaign stop for Sanders at the State Historical Museum of Iowa on Jan. 20, 2020, in Des Moines, Iowa.\\n\\nAssuming there were political consensus that everyone should have this protection from health care costs during the crisis, Medicare is a natural vehicle since it already exists everywhere, said Larry Levitt, who oversees health policy work at the Kaiser Family Foundation. While many insurers have voluntarily waived cost-sharing for COVID-19 treatment, this goes quite a bit further in covering out-of-pocket costs for all health care. It's sort of a temporary Medicare for All, grafted on top of our existing insurance system.\\n\\nSanders' office noted that this emergency proposal is not an expansion of Medicare, unlike his Medicare for All plan, which would move all Americans onto a single supercharged Medicare program. Jayapal authored the House version of the Medicare for All bill introduced in 2019.\\n\\nThat said, there's been little political consensus around expanding health coverage beyond COVID-19 testing, and so far changes have been on the margins. Congress expanded Medicare's coverage of telemedicine in the last relief bill but did not include subsidies for COBRA, the federal law that allows recently unemployed Americans to continue their health plans at personal cost, or for the Affordable Care Act. The Trump administration decided against reopening the Affordable Care Act's marketplaces to the 28 million people who were uninsured before the pandemic.\\n\\nSince then, Republican leaders have been singularly focused on giving aid to small businesses instead of working on a broader relief package. Democrats' demands to pass widespread coverage for coronavirus treatment have gone nowhere so far.\\n\\nMore than 17 million Americans have filed for unemployment in the past four weeks; those who lost health benefits are eligible to extend their benefits through COBRA, buy into the ACA, or in many cases apply for Medicaid. Even for those with insurance, there have been reports of massive hospital bills for coronavirus treatment.\\n\\nAt a time so many people are losing their jobs, or seeing fewer hours they can work, a reduced income, what you want to do now is say, 'OK, we are going to take one burden off your shoulders: You're not going to have to pay for the health care that you need,' Sanders said."}

{"original": "States, cities and tribal nations across the country are facing massive budget shortfalls due to the economic fallout of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has emptied public coffers through a combination of depleted tax revenues and surges in emergency spending.\\n\\nThese governments are jointly expected to lack between $490 and $620 billion of the revenue they need to fund existing levels of public services through 2022, according to an analysis conducted by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal think tank.\\n\\nState and local governments have already begun responding by furloughing and laying off government employees, employing 1.4 million fewer people than they did in February. One million of those employees worked in schools or universities.\\n\\nProgressive lawmakers and activists worry that whether federal aid arrives or not, state and local governments risk making the same mistakes as they made after the 2008 financial crisis, when the decision to choose spending cuts over graduated tax increases hurt the economic recovery and left a lasting mark on schools and other public services.\\n\\nPolicymakers have choices, said Cortney Sanders, a policy analyst for the Center on Budget's state fiscal policy division. They can make choices that exacerbate inequalities or they can make choices to move us toward an anti-racist and equitable future.\\n\\nLev Radin/Pacific Press/LightRocket/Getty Images New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) earned fame for his press conferences on the coronavirus. He is resisting calls to raise taxes on the rich to fill a budget gap the pandemic caused.\\n\\nAnd while the leaders of Republican-run states like Texas and Georgia have sometimes been more eager to respond to their budget woes with spending cuts, leaders of Democratic-run states are at odds over how best to proceed. In several deep blue states, liberal lawmakers and advocates are struggling to persuade centrist executives ― and voters ― of the need for the wealthiest residents to shoulder their share of the budget gap in the form of higher taxes.\\n\\nIn that way, the fight over how to address the coming fiscal crunch is shaping up to be the latest test of the relative strength of the Democratic Party's reigning business-friendly wing, as opposed to a rising left wing aligned with organized labor.\\n\\nThe challenge for Democrats is to do something that will make a difference in the lives of regular people, said Michael Kink, executive director of the union-backed Strong Economy for All coalition, which is pushing for a host of higher taxes in New York. The only way to do that is with real money. You can't fake it.\\n\\nThe three biggest states in the country with unified Democratic control of government are California, New York and Illinois. How this trio balances its budgets affects the largest numbers of people and sets the tone for Democratic governance in the country.\\n\\nThus far, progressive calls for increasing taxes on the rich in these three states are facing significant headwinds.\\n\\nThis November, voters in California and Illinois voted down ballot measures designed to make their taxation systems more progressive.\\n\\nIn Illinois, billionaire Gov. J.B. Pritzker (D) bankrolled a Constitutional amendment ballot initiative that would have allowed the adoption of a progressive income tax, replacing the current system, which only permits a single, flat income tax rate. By its very nature, levying the same tax rate ― currently 4.95% ― on all state residents disproportionately affects low- and middle-income people, for whom the sum is more onerous. And the system has forced Illinois to rely more heavily on property taxes, which wealthy residents have often evaded by hiring politically connected property tax appeals lawyers.\\n\\nBut conservative billionaire Ken Griffin and other big business executives went dollar for dollar with Pritzker to defeat the initiative, arguing that, among other things, higher income taxes provided no guarantee of property tax relief. The amendment, which required 60% support to pass, failed 53% to 47%.\\n\\nWe're actually in a moment of abundance in terms of our ability to fill many of our budget gaps, but it's an abundance that must be coupled with political will to balance the budget not on the backs of those who have already been at the front lines. Sochie Nnaemeka, New York Working Families Party\\n\\nIn California, public-sector labor unions joined with the Chan-Zuckerberg Initiative in an effort to pass Proposition 15, which would have closed a massive property tax loophole for big businesses. The ballot measure was a response to the unusual property tax system California adopted in 1978 tying property taxes to the property's value at the time of the sale, rather than a rolling system of tax assessment of the kind used in other states. As a result, many homeowners and big businesses like Disneyland pay property taxes based on values assessed decades in the past, leading to major shortfalls for local services like schools and county hospitals. Despite its progressive reputation, California ranks 42nd in the country in per-pupil education spending when adjusted for cost of living, according to the California Budget and Policy Center, a liberal think tank.\\n\\nProp 15 would have created a separate property tax collection system for commercial properties worth more than $3 million, generating as much as $12.5 billion in new revenue. But some of California's biggest corporations and property investors, such as the private equity giant Blackstone, spent $53 million ― nearly as much as Prop 15's backers ― trying to convince Californians that the proposal would raise taxes on ordinary people and prices for consumers. State voters voted the referendum down, 52 to 48%.\\n\\nCalifornia is a more conservative state than a lot of people think, said Alex Stack, a former spokesman for the Yes on Prop 15 coalition.\\n\\nBut I wouldn't say taxes are a third rail in California anymore, he added. Opponents of reform are hanging on by a thread.\\n\\nBrian Cassella/Chicago Tribune/Getty Images Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker (D), a billionaire heir to the Hyatt hotel chain, bankrolled an initiative to enable Illinois to adopt a graduated income tax. Voters rejected the measure in November.\\n\\nWith the most ambitious progressive tax reforms off the table in California and Illinois, New York stands out as the biggest blue-state laboratory for progressive solutions to COVID-19 budget woes.\\n\\nThe Invest in Our New York campaign, led by labor unions, community groups and progressive powerhouses like the Working Families Party, is calling for the state's looming $15 billion budget deficit to be closed, and then some, through a suite of progressive taxes projected to raise $50 billion.\\n\\nThe initiative, which includes Kink's Strong Economy for All coalition, proposes higher state income tax brackets on earnings over $300,000; imposing a tax on capital gains to offset the disparity between federal taxes on capital gains and those on ordinary income; a 2.5% tax on inheritances of more than $250,000; taxing billionaires' asset appreciations as ordinary income; a small financial transactions tax; and a surtax on corporate incomes to offset the Trump administration's corporate tax cuts.\\n\\nProponents of the tax increases see them as the appropriate antidote to an uneven, or K-shaped, recovery from the economic fallout of the pandemic. Working-class people, including Black and Latino communities already harder hit by COVID-19, have been much more likely than upper-middle-class professionals to lose their jobs or otherwise have their lives upended since March. Food pantries are seeing unprecedented demand and the plight of the state's 725,000 undocumented immigrants, who have not been eligible for previous rounds of aid, has been especially acute.\\n\\nAt the same time, thanks to a rollicking stock market, New York's 120 billionaires grew their wealth by more than $77 billion between mid-March and mid-June, according to the liberal group Americans for Tax Fairness' analysis of Forbes data.\\n\\nWe're actually in a moment of abundance in terms of our ability to fill many of our budget gaps, but it's an abundance that must be coupled with political will to balance the budget not on the backs of those who have already been at the front lines, said Sochie Nnaemeka, director of the New York Working Families Party.\\n\\nNew York progressives already have a policy template from across the Hudson River in New Jersey, where Gov. Phil Murphy (D) finally succeeded in cutting a deal with the Democratic-run legislature in September to raise income taxes on earnings of $1 million to 5 million from 8.97% to 10.75%. The state also raised its surtax on corporate income from 1.5% to 2.5%. At the same time, he expanded the earned-income tax credit to 60,000 more low-income state residents.\\n\\nIf you're wondering how to raise revenue in the middle of a recession and in a way to combat an economic downturn, those were some good examples, Sanders of the Center on Budget said of New Jersey's tax changes.\\n\\nLegalizing sports betting and marijuana are just going to be other regressive taxes. Nicole Gelinas, Manhattan Institute\\n\\nThe Working Families Party also has high hopes of pressuring lawmakers in Connecticut and Rhode Island, where Democrats enjoy control of the legislature and governorships, to enact a similarly progressive course of action. President-elect Joe Biden has tapped Rhode Island Gov. Gina Raimondo (D), a centrist fiscal hawk, to serve as his Commerce Secretary. Her departure and a series of progressive primary wins in the state legislature in September are already generating more momentum to address the state's $513 million budget shortfall through tax increases that target the state's wealthiest residents, rather than spending cuts.\\n\\nMeanwhile, in New York, political will for higher taxes on the state's wealthiest residents is materializing among some key players. New York's state Senate, which was effectively controlled by Republicans until 2018, now has a Democratic supermajority fueled by progressive and even socialist victories across two election cycles. And the state Assembly, where Democrats already had a veto-proof majority, has seen some of its more moderate members ousted by younger left-wing challengers.\\n\\nAt the same time, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who began his first term in 2011 by coupling tax cuts with reductions in social spending, has proven resistant to any tax increases targeted at the super-rich. He has at once argued that it would provoke multi-millionaires and billionaires ― with whom he claimed to speak all day long ― to flee the state in pursuit of lower taxes, and wielded the threat of higher taxes as part of an appeal for federal aid.\\n\\nThe Invest in Our New York campaign has marshaled the research of scholars who have found that there is no evidence that a substantial number of rich people leave states in response to tax increases. And they note that federal aid in the aftermath of the Great Recession both fell short of New York's needs and came with cumbersome conditions on how it would be spent.\\n\\nFor Nicole Gelinas, a senior fellow at the conservative Manhattan Institute, conditions on federal aid would be a welcome dose of fiscal medicine to New York and other blue states that she believes have ratified public-sector union contracts with unnecessarily generous early retirement health benefits. Those benefits could be easier to scale back because they are not statutorily protected from cuts the way many state pension plans are.\\n\\nWhy not tie congressional aid to states and cities to reform of these retiree health care plans? she asked.\\n\\nIn his state of the state address on Monday, Cuomo, who retains a Republican budget director, said that if New York raised the state income tax rate on earnings over $1 million from 8.8% to California's top rate of 13.3%, it would only generate $1.5 billion in new revenue.\\n\\nErik McGregor/Getty Images New York State Sen. Julia Salazar (D) speaks in support of taxing the rich on Jan. 5. Salazar, a democratic socialist who unseated a Democrat in 2018, is part of New York's ascendant left.\\n\\nHe instead hammered home the need for help from Washington, including through the reinstatement of the full federal income tax deduction for state and local taxes, and proposed an array of spending cuts and revenue raisers.\\n\\nOnce a weed critic, he is now calling for the full legalization and taxation of both recreational marijuana and sports betting on mobile devices. He has embraced these fees despite estimates that the combined revenue from marijuana and sports betting taxes would fall short of $1 billion in annual revenue ― a sum smaller than the amount generated by the millionaire tax he has sniffed at.\\n\\nNotwithstanding their divergent ideologies, Gelinas joined Kink and Nnaemeka in panning the latter measures as tax increases that would fall disproportionately on people of modest means.\\n\\nLegalizing sports betting and marijuana are just going to be other regressive taxes, Gelinas said, noting that New York already has high regressive sales taxes. We tax pretty much everyone pretty heavily already and it's still not enough to balance the budget. Gelinas instead favors, among other changes, demanding voluntary pay freezes from public-sector unions as a first step to avoid layoffs.\\n\\nA spokesperson for Cuomo did not respond to a series of questions about the marijuana and sports betting taxes, as well as his other budget priorities.\\n\\nIn theory, Democratic lawmakers do not need to wait for Cuomo's approval. They have the power to pass laws raising taxes and to override Cuomo's veto if he chooses to block them. And both New York Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie and state Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins have expressed support for higher taxes on the wealthy.\\n\\nBut having the power is one thing, and using it is another ― especially in New York's lopsided system of state government. In the Empire State, the governor has uniquely centralized power relative to other state executives, because he or she alone can introduce the state's budget.\\n\\nIn order to negotiate their priorities with the governor in a closed process that he controls, Stewart-Cousins and Heastie have a strong incentive not to defy him on other priorities.\\n\\nThat's why the Invest in New York coalition is so committed to pressuring Cuomo directly, including by appealing to the progressive image he has sought to burnish in the wake of the pandemic and the revival of the Black Lives Matter movement this past spring.\\n\\nGov. Cuomo has a lot of beautiful, soaring rhetoric, but the history of his time in office is that he hasn't been able to deliver on the reality, Kink said."}
{"original": "By Wendy Whitman Cobb\\n\\nChina became the third country to land a probe on the Moon on Jan. 2. But, more importantly, it became the first to do so on the far side of the moon, often called the dark side. The ability to land on the far side of the moon is a technical achievement in its own right, one that neither Russia nor the United States has pursued.\\n\\nThe probe, Chang'e 4, is symbolic of the growth of the Chinese space program and the capabilities it has amassed, significant for China and for relations among the great power across the world. The consequences extend to the United States as the Trump administration considers global competition in space as well as the future of space exploration.\\n\\nOne of the major drivers of U.S. space policy historically has been competition with Russia, particularly in the context of the Cold War. If China's successes continue to accumulate, could the U.S. find itself engaged in a new space race?\\n\\nWhat will China discover on the far side of the moon? BeeBright/Shutterstock.com\\n\\nChina's achievements in space\\n\\nLike the U.S. and Russia, the People's Republic of China first engaged in space activities during the development of ballistic missiles in the 1950s. While they did benefit from some assistance from the Soviet Union, China developed its space program largely on its own. Far from smooth sailing, Mao Zedong's Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution disrupted this early programs.\\n\\nThe Chinese launched their first satellite in 1970. Following this, an early human spaceflight program was put on hold to focus on commercial satellite applications. In 1978, Deng Xiaoping articulated China's space policy noting that, as a developing country, China would not take part in a space race. Instead, China's space efforts have focused on both launch vehicles and satellites — including communications, remote sensing and meteorology.\\n\\nThis does not mean the Chinese were not concerned about the global power space efforts can generate. In 1992, they concluded that having a space station would be a major sign and source of prestige in the 21st century. As such, a human spaceflight program was re-established leading to the development of the Shenzhou spacecraft. The first Chinese astronaut, or taikonaut, Yang Liwei, was launched in 2003. In total, six Shenzhou missions have carried 12 taikonauts into low earth orbit, including two to China's first space station, Tiangong-1.\\n\\nIn addition to human spaceflight, the Chinese have also undertaken scientific missions like Chang'e 4. Its first lunar mission, Chang'e 1, orbited the moon in October 2007 and a rover landed on the moon in 2013. China's future plans include a new space station, a lunar base and possible sample return missions from Mars.\\n\\nA new space race?\\n\\nThe most notable feature of the Chinese space program, especially compared to the early American and Russian programs, is its slow and steady pace. Because of the secrecy that surrounds many aspects of the Chinese space program, its exact capabilities are unknown. However, the program is likely on par with its counterparts.\\n\\nIn terms of military applications, China has also demonstrated significant skills. In 2007, it undertook an anti-satellite test, launching a ground-based missile to destroy a failed weather satellite. While successful, the test created a cloud of orbital debris that continues to threaten other satellites. The movie Gravity illustrated the dangers space debris poses to both satellites and humans. In its 2018 report on the Chinese military, the U.S. Department of Defense reported that China's military space program continues to mature rapidly.\\n\\nDespite its capabilities, the U.S., unlike other countries, has not engaged in any substantial cooperation with China because of national security concerns. In fact, a 2011 law bans NASA from collaborating with its counterpart in China without Congressional approval. Does this signal a new space race between the U.S. and China?\\n\\nAs a space policy researcher, I can say the answer is yes and no. Some U.S. officials, including Scott Pace, the executive secretary for the National Space Council, are cautiously optimistic about the potential for cooperation and do not see the beginning of a new space race. NASA Administrator Jim Brindenstine recently met with the head of the Chinese space program, Zhang Kejian, at the International Astronautical Conference in Germany and discussed areas where China and the U.S. can work together. However, increased military presence in space might spark increased competition. The Trump administration has used the threat posed by China and Russia to support its argument for a new independent military branch, a Space Force.\\n\\nRegardless, China's abilities in space are growing to the extent that is reflected in popular culture. In Andy Weir's 2011 novel The Martian and its later film version, NASA turns to China to help rescue its stranded astronaut. While competition can lead to advances in technology, as the first space race demonstrated, a greater global capacity for space exploration can also be beneficial not only for saving stranded astronauts but increasing knowledge about the universe where we all live. Even if China's rise heralds a new space race, not all consequences will be negative.\\n\\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

Sign up for the weekly newsletter here.\\n\\nDear reader,\\n\\nThe new year kicked off in India with a major development in the fight over women's access to a famous Hindu temple. Protesters have blocked women of menstruating age from entering Sabarimala since September, when the Supreme Court ruled that all women had a right to enter the sacred space. This week, though, two women managed to slip into the temple in the middle of the night, setting off celebrations and protests.\\n\\nThe whole country, and especially the state of Kerala, where Sabarimala is located, was taken aback by the news, HuffPost India's Sharanya Hrishikesh said. The temple's priest conducted a 'purification ritual' after the women's entry on Wednesday, there was a violent strike called by the right-wing Bharatiya Janata Party on Thursday, and on Friday, even as protests are going on, news broke of a third woman entering the temple to offer prayers — a Sri Lankan national.\\n\\nHuffPost India reported on the role a Facebook page played in connecting the law professor and grocery store manager currently riling up the country. It also reported on the fascinating about-face most of the original Supreme Court petitioners have made since first pushing for women's access to the temple. Of the five women who originally advocated for equal access, just one still stands by her original views.\\n\\nThere is still a long way to go — the issue has exposed deep divides within Kerala, and there are many women who have internalized biases and claim they are ready to wait until they reach menopause to visit the temple, Sharanya said.

A survivor of forced marriage responded to the news in a blog post for HuffPost U.K. that sheds light on the way some families manipulate their daughters into marrying strange men thousands of miles from home. It's a fascinating read that does credit the Foreign Office for investigating nearly 1,200 forced marriage cases last year.

{"original": "In a primetime televised address Tuesday, President Donald Trump repeated his demand for $5.7 billion in border wall money in order to end the nearly three-week federal government shutdown, offering the deal as the only solution to solve a major national security crisis.\\n\\nThis barrier is absolutely critical to border security. It's also what our professionals at the border want and need, Trump said, describing the impasse as a choice between right and wrong, between justice and injustice.\\n\\nBut the only thing resembling a crisis on the U.S.-Mexico border isn't an existential threat to national security ― it's the question of how to handle a historically high number of Central American families and children coming into the country, many of whom are asking for asylum or some other humanitarian relief from deportation.\\n\\nThe White House position on the issue is clear: Trump wants to either indefinitely detain the Central American migrants or cast them back to Mexico. But the wall won't achieve either of those aims. Instead, the ploy harkens back to the symbolic solution to a largely fabricated crisis that paved Trump's way to the presidency back in 2016.\\n\\nThere was no border crisis when Trump launched his campaign in the summer of 2015, promising to wall off the Southern border. Instead, unauthorized crossings stood at their lowest levels since the 1970s. By the numbers, there's still no crisis ― the unauthorized population of the United States has remained flat for more than a decade.\\n\\nMario Tama via Getty Images People walk on the Mexican side of the U.S.-Mexico border barrier at the Pacific Ocean on Jan. 8, 2019, in Tijuana, Mexico.\\n\\nWhat has changed in recent years is that more of the migrants who do cross without authorization are Central American asylum seekers ― often traveling together as families or unaccompanied minors. That trend, which began in the summer of 2014, predates Trump. But since he took office, the number of Central American families crossing has risen to historic highs.\\n\\nIn 2010, just 10 percent of all migrants apprehended by Border Patrol were families and unaccompanied children ― instead, most were single men. As of November 2018, families and unaccompanied children make up 57 percent of those apprehended.\\n\\nThe Trump administration has constantly rehauled the immigration enforcement system to scare off the migrant families and children. But none of it ― zero tolerance prosecutions for petty immigration offenses, a six-week experiment with systematic family separation, the mobilization of the National Guard and U.S. military, a court-enjoined policy barring migrants from asking for asylum ― have stopped them from arriving.\\n\\nThat trend isn't particularly surprising. The three countries sending by far the most migrants since 2014 ― Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras ― all face extreme poverty and some of the highest homicide rates in the world.\\n\\nAnd now, Trump's focus on the wall and several policy changes have led to humanitarian problems of his own making.\\n\\nWith legal ports of entry largely blocked, many migrants find smugglers to take them on dangerous journeys through mountains and deserts to remote Border Patrol stations far away from medical services.\\n\\nCustoms and Border Protection officers are only letting between 30 and 90 people a day through legal ports of entry. As a result of that metering policy, thousands of migrants are waiting for weeks or months in shelters near the border, which in some cases are outdoor camps with limited access to clean water or large enclosed facilities where disease can easily spread.\\n\\nWith legal ports of entry largely blocked, many migrants find smugglers to take them on dangerous journeys through mountains and deserts to remote Border Patrol stations far away from medical services. The number of parents and children traveling through the El Paso sector, which includes a large swath of the Chihuahuan Desert, has risen by more than 1,500 percent over the past year. The number of border deaths has likewise increased.\\n\\nIf they reach the U.S., families and kids traveling by themselves are put in overcrowded Border Patrol stations that are struggling to deal with the influx of migrants. The Washington Post reported that in recent weeks, agents have been bringing dozens of sick migrants to clinics and hospitals. Last month, two children died while in Border Patrol custody.\\n\\nIn June, Trump implemented a new sponsor vetting policy that has forced children to languish for up to six months in long-term shelters. (In December, the administration rolled back some of the requirements for its vetting policy.) The number of unaccompanied children detained in government custody is at a record high.\\n\\nTrump won the presidency in 2016 largely by fabricating a border crisis and hawking a massive wall as the solution to the contrived problem. Now, he's upped the ante, by portraying migrant children and families from Latin America as a security threat so grave that the federal government shouldn't reopen without committing to building a symbolic wall to, in theory, keep them out."}

Their excuse for removing him is that they were overbooked and needed the seat for an employee of a partner airline.\\n\\nThe 69-year-old doctor was beaten and bloodied by police, the video went viral and can be seen here:\\n\\nOver the last 15 years, airlines have gotten to be over-the-top pushy. Ever since 9-11 they have been more empowered to take things into their own hands.\\n\\nMistakes happen, even horrid ones like this. It's easy to be a couch quarterback, but the issue here is what's going on after the incident. CEO Oscar Muñoz is handling this poorly. The 21st century offers many benefits and challenges that can make or break your company. Today information travels faster than the planes of any airline.\\n\\nIn Oscar's defense, he learned about business before the internet was popular. Todays climate is very different than it was 20 years ago. It used to be that you could keep people quiet and cover up faux pas like this with a limited amount of exposure, but today every person on a plane has a personal communicator (far more advanced than what Gene Roddenberry, the creator of Star Trek ever guessed) that has a video camera and access to a dozen places where they can share their video.\\n\\nThe thing he should know however is that: If it bleeds, it leads. Well Oscar, your passenger is bleeding, so its leading.\\n\\nUnited Airlines CEO Oscar Muñoz is doubling down when he should be shaking his finger at his staff and apologizing to his customers. There's bad customer service and then there is just bad policy. This is both.\\n\\nThe classic slapstick movie Airplane doesn't have a single scene as ridiculous as this real life situation. Somethings are unthinkable. I vote with my wallet and this company is on my do-not-spend list until further notice, mostly because of the CEO's indifference to the situation. Simply playing it down will not work in the 21st century. Information is everywhere and as a business you have to be proactive and do three things.\\n\\nAccept responsibility for your staff, not the incident. Most people run for the hills and go with the deny everything attitude fearing financial repercussions. What they miss is that you can accept that your staff made a mistake and get on the right side of the catastrophe. Apologize publicly. Never underestimate the general public to use emotion over logic. When we apologize publicly we enlist the sympathy of the mob. Release a plan. Most people just want to know that you have a plan and that you are on it. Detailing direct action will limit public upheaval and reduce your exposure.\\n\\nThe absence of these three things indicates the inability for this airline to be effective in the 21st century. They could call and ask me to help them control this, but they will probably be too busy being reactive to be proactive.\\n\\nIt's important to remember that you can't fix the past, but you can can engineer the future.\\n\\nThe good news is I'm pretty sure that this doctor will end up owning a considerable portion of this company's cash."}
{"original": "Tom Williams via Getty Images Speaking out against Steve King's comments is the exception, not the rule.\\n\\nRep. Steve King (R-Iowa) issued a defiant statement Monday night after House Republican leadership decided to strip King of his committee assignments following the release of an interview where the congressman questioned why terms like white nationalist and white supremacist were offensive.\\n\\nKing characterized the move as an unprecedented assault on my freedom of speech, and it makes sense that he would be somewhat mystified. For the better part of this decade, King has openly broadcast his racist and xenophobic views without consequence from the Republican leaders.\\n\\nIn September of last year, King met in Austria with members of a political party founded by a former Nazi SS officer and declared that western civilization is on the decline because minorities are supposedly replacing white Europeans.\\n\\nIn October, King endorsed a white nationalist to be mayor of Toronto. The candidate had previously participated in the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville and had recommended a book that called for the elimination of Jews.\\n\\nAnd in November, The Weekly Standard published an audio recording of King referring to immigrants as dirt on multiple occasions. The report prompted 140 organizations to sign a letter to then-House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) and Republican Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) to censure King for his anti-Semitic, anti-immigrant, racist language.\\n\\nJust to be clear, King's rhetoric cannot be attributed to the rise of Trumpism, it goes back to well before Donald Trump's entry into the 2016 presidential campaign. In August of 2013, King absurdly claimed that for every child of an illegal immigrant who is valedictorian, there's another 100 out there who weigh 130 pounds, and they've got calves the size of cantaloupes because they're hauling 75 pounds of marijuana across the desert.\\n\\nThroughout all of these episodes, congressional Republican leaders did nothing and continued to allow King to serve on the House Judiciary Committee, the committee that's responsible for immigration policy in America. So it's been interesting watching Republicans, after all this time, pile on the anti-King bandwagon this week.\\n\\nThis week, Senator Mitt Romney (R-Utah) called on King to step aside and for Congress to make it very clear he has no place there. This was eight years after King ignorantly proclaimed that former President Barack Obama had a default mechanism in him that breaks down the side of race – on the side that favors the black person. Mind you, in 2012, Romney told an Iowa crowd that King needs to be your congressman again. I want him as my partner in Washington!\\n\\nI wonder, does Leader McConnell's sentiments extend to Mississippi Senator Cindy Hyde-Smith?\\n\\nSenate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) released a strongly-worded statement declaring, there is no place in the Republican Party, the Congress or the country for an ideology of racial supremacy of any kind…Rep. King's statements are unwelcome and unworthy of his elected position. I wonder, does Leader McConnell's sentiments extend to Republican Mississippi Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith, who in November said of a supporter, If he invited me to a public hanging, I'd be on the front row?\\n\\nWill the Republican leadership allow Rep. Louie Gohmert (R-Texas) to continue serving on the House Judiciary Committee? Like King, Gohmert has an exhaustive history of making remarkably ignorant and racist comments. In June of 2011, Gohmert took to the House floor to accuse Obama of being loyal to the Muslim Brotherhood. Last year, Gohmert introduced a resolution wanting to declare March 31, Cesar Chavez's birthday, as National Border Control Day. Last October, Gohmert floated the idea that the president should invoke martial law to deal with the caravan of immigrants he characterized as gangbangers.\\n\\nIt was just over a year ago that President Trump declared that Haiti, El Salvador and Africa were shithole countries and that the U.S. should get more people from countries like Norway.\\n\\nI certainly don't see any of these suddenly outspoken Republicans denouncing the Trump administration's directive to include a citizenship question in the 2020 Census for the first time in 70 years at the behest of the disgraced Steve Bannon. A change that will result in the undercounting of immigrants and minorities.\\n\\nDo not think for one minute that Republican leaders are sincere about substantively addressing racism in their own ranks. Speaking out against King's comments is the exception, not the rule. The one example of action Republicans will hide behind to justify their silence on everything else. After all, if Mitch McConnell is sincere about there being no place in the Republican Party, the Congress or the country for an ideology of racial supremacy of any kind how could he possibly still be supporting and protecting the biggest racist of them all – Donald Trump.\\n\\n\\n\\nKurt Bardella is a HuffPost columnist and served as the spokesperson and senior adviser for the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee from 2009-2013.

{"original": "The above chart illustrates the game that is being played in China to keep things LOOKING good, even while they are falling apart. Then we have to take into account that 90% of the public companies in China are some form of quasi-state controlled entities. While a lot of investors take solace in that, believing the Government will back up these companies if they begin to stumble – the consultant in me has to consider the internal bleeding of all these companies adding up to possibly Trillions of Dollars (certain Trillions of Yuan) in bailouts. How long can the PBOC really keep this up?\\n\\n\\n\\nSince the answer is probably not forever, we can expect, at some point, a bit of a correction. It's not likely the US, Europe and certainly not the rest of Asia will be able to avoid the fallout of a Chinese correction so we're going to be watching China very carefully this summer and reading between the lines of their policy announcements – especially when the Premier talks about letting the markets work, which is code for no longer bailing out failing businesses.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt might not be too bad because most of the profits in China are paper profits anyway. People bought $1,000 worth of stock last year and now they think they have $10,000 but really it's $500. Of course, multiply that by half a Billion Chinese speculators and it does add up. Global Markets, led by China, just hit $75Tn – a new record.

And it's gross.\\n\\nI have two teen daughters whose figures make them look much older than they actually are (13 and 15 years old). During a holiday get-together, my father-in-law repeatedly made awkward comments around them, like, I hope your dad buys a shotgun for when boys come to the house. My girls were really uncomfortable, but my husband laughed it off as the kind of joke that every dad ― or grandfather, in this case ― makes when talking about teen daughters. But the girls didn't like it one bit, and neither did I. How do I talk to my husband and his dad about this so future holidays aren't so cringeworthy?\\n\\n― Ashley in Oakland, California\\n\\n<sarcasm font> It's sooo edgy and cool for dudes to threaten gun violence on children who attempt to date their daughters. </sarcasm font>\\n\\nI'm 100 percent with you on this one, Ashley. I'll never understand men who make comments like this. They're inadvertently telling their daughters (or granddaughters), I don't trust your ability to choose the right person, so I'm going to intimidate all of them by putting a killing machine in their faces. That will teach 'em to treat you right. It's straight up stupid. And the fact it's assumed boys will soon come knocking based on your teen daughters' mature looks is really gross and not exactly empowering to them as young women.\\n\\nI know, I know. People are surely reading this thinking, Oh boy, the PC police are sounding the alarms, again. But if being a member of the PC police means not being an out-of-touch asshole, then I'll proudly rock that badge. Feel free to stop me if you've heard this before, but gun violence is a big problem in America. The mere suggestion or joke that an adult should pull a gun on a teenager is beyond my level of understanding. So is making inappropriate comments about teenagers' physical attractiveness, knowing what we do about how these kinds of comments can negatively affect young women's sense of self-worth as they grow up.\\n\\nMy two daughters aren't even close to dating age yet, but when they are, I plan to tell them they can bring anyone to our house (boy or girl), and I'll do my part to make them feel comfortable and welcomed. Of course, if these guests engage in behavior that make my daughters unhappy or uncomfortable, I'll address it accordingly, just like any well-adjusted grownup should. And it won't entail waving a gun around like Yosemite Sam.\\n\\nYour situation is a pretty simple one, Ashley. Tell your husband to knock it off. Tell him your daughters don't find the jokes funny at all ― in fact, they were offended by them. Anyone who continues to spout off the same comments after being told your girls were upset by them is one of those aforementioned out-of-touch assholes. Your husband will fall in line if he doesn't want his daughters to think of him that way.\\n\\nYour father-in-law? He may be a bit more challenging; old heads tend to be pretty set in their ways. But you have the leverage, here, because you are in charge of how much (or how little) he gets to hang out with his granddaughters. And you're not going to make your kids spend time with people who make them feel uncomfortable — family, friends or otherwise. Make that very clear and institute a zero tolerance policy going forward. Note: This is a conversation you need to have with their grandfather, because he needs to see how serious you are about it. If you leave the discussion up to your husband, there's a good chance the message could be lost in translation.\\n\\nIt's 2019.

To do whatever necessary to make sure your wife is able to take care of herself.\\n\\nMy wife had a really rough 2018. Her best friend died in a drunk driving accident, and her mom was diagnosed with cancer. She and I have always lived a fit and healthy lifestyle, but her depression has gotten really bad. She's distant with our kids, has stopped exercising and has (and I really don't mean to sound like a jerk) gained a worrying amount of weight. My wife is normally a superwoman kind of mom ― she goes to work every day, cooks and cleans, reads stories to our daughters every night, and is at every ballet and soccer practice. I'm helping out as much as I can, but it's been challenging. I love my wife and want to help her start off the new year on the right foot and get her mental and physical health back. I'm not even sure she realizes how bad it's gotten. What can I do?\\n\\n– Jim in Los Angeles, California\\n\\nMy guy, your wife is a woman in America. She's probably fully aware she's gained weight, no matter how depressed she is (not to mention that depression and weight gain often go hand-in-hand). I'm curious as to whether you're more concerned about her physical health or mental health. You describe yourselves as a normally fit and healthy couple, so my guess is her weight gain has become an issue for your relationship. I get it: Sex and attraction are extremely important in a marriage. But I'll be honest: It sounds like this might be more about you than her.\\n\\nSomeone once told me that women are expected to work as if they don't have children and raise children as if they don't work. Go back and read what you sent me, Jim. Your wife works outside of the home, cooks and cleans, takes your kids to their extracurricular activities and generally sounds like a great mom ― one who is probably already exhausted and overwhelmed on a good day. Then, her best friend dies in one of the most tragic ways possible, and her mom gets sick. Of course she's struggling!\\n\\nYou say you're helping out as much as you can, but what does that mean, exactly? Are you offering to cook (and are they healthy meals)? Are you doing the laundry without asking? Do you know what an arabesque is or how to braid your daughter's hair? I hate it when husbands talk about helping out around the house as if they're being heroic by lending a hand.\\n\\nIt's disappointing that you need a complete stranger to tell you this, but now is the time for you to step up like you never have before. And don't wait for her to ask you to do it, either. You're a grown-ass man. You know what it takes to run a household. So do it.\\n\\nNext, let's address your wife's mental health. It's good that you recognize that she's depressed and want to help her. Is she seeking therapy? Does she need additional medical attention? Does she have a support group of friends she can spend time with when she's down? Are you making sure people know you're currently the go-to parent for the kids, so any extra burden is lifted from your wife's mental plate? Your job now is to do whatever's necessary to ensure your wife is taking the requisite time for herself.\\n\\nThen, and only then, will she be able to start addressing her physical health. And you can do it together in a way that makes sense for everyone. Take family walks around the neighborhood after dinner. Start a simple workout routine as a couple. Make a point to eat healthier meals in the new year as a family. Don't mention her weight gain specifically, because I promise you, she's totally aware of it. Just be her partner and stay supportive.\\n\\nLast, and certainly not least, tell her how much you love and appreciate her. Every day. I've been told by my mom friends that hearing thank you has the same (if not more) impact than hearing I love you. No matter what happens, keep emphasizing how important she is to you and your family — because at the end of the day, happiness is the goal.\\n\\nDoyin is a best-selling children's author, keynote speaker and dad dedicated to making the world a better place for parents and their kids.

For over a decade, I have been a habitual take the thing I was going to buy for myself out of the cart by the time I make it to the checkout kind of woman. I quit that martyr bullshit. The other day I bought myself expensive makeup that really covers the lines and age spots on my skin, and I'm not sorry about it at all.\\n\\nI quit gritting my teeth while my kids invade my personal space. I deserve to feel like a human being with a modicum of body autonomy. No more jungle-gym mommy, elbowing mommy in the ribs or head-butting mommy. Hugs are totally exempt from this policy.\\n\\nI quit these things because I finally understand that playing the martyr has had precisely the opposite effect I intended. Instead of giving my best to my family, I subverted my own needs so thoroughly that I became a wilting shadow of who I ought to be, and the me they get is stressed, angry and short-tempered. No more of that nonsense. From now on, everyone, including me, gets the calmest, happiest, most fulfilled version of me.\\n\\nBecause I quit."}

The area of southern Tel Aviv, where many reside, is economically challenged with unemployment and social tension, UNHCR spokesperson William Spindler told HuffPost on Monday.\\n\\nSpindler said that Eritrean and Sudanese people in Israel should be considered refugees, not migrants, as they left their homes to escape persecution and war. He also noted that Israel, as the receiving nation, has only in a very few cases processed and officially designated the migrants as refugees.\\n\\nIt is with regret that UNHCR notes cancellation by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of the Israel-UNHCR Agreement, the U.N. agency wrote in a statement on Tuesday.

As of Monday, no country had officially agreed to take in any of those refugees.\\n\\nThe agreement had also included support services for the African migrants who would be staying legally in Israel, Spindler said, including vocational training to help them find employment beyond southern Tel Aviv.\\n\\nPer the agreement, Israel would no longer pursue its non-voluntary relocation policy, according to a U.N. release.\\n\\nEarlier this year, Israel had announced a plan to force undocumented African migrants to voluntarily leave the country by the end of March or risk being detained. The plan would provide $3,500 to migrants to relocate to countries in sub-Saharan Africa. At the time, the UNHCR criticized the policy as one that left migrants in unsafe conditions. Israel's high court blocked the policy's implementation through a temporary order in mid-March.\\n\\nThis article has been updated to reflect Tuesday's cancellation of the deal."}
{"original": "On his first day in office, President Joe Biden issued an executive order strengthening anti-discrimination protections for the LGBTQ community, marking a quick turnaround from Trump administration policy.\\n\\nUnder the new executive guidance, federal agencies are to assume that laws forbidding discrimination apply to sexual orientation and gender identity, not just race, religion, sex and national origin. The measure was part of a slew of orders Biden signed shortly after his swearing-in, as both a substantive and a symbolic rebuke of the Trump era.\\n\\nThe order suggests that enforcement agencies under Biden will be open to pursuing discrimination complaints on behalf of LGBTQ people in a way the Trump administration was not.\\n\\nThe Human Rights Campaign called it the most substantive, wide-ranging executive order concerning sexual orientation and gender identity ever issued by a U.S. president.\\n\\nToday, millions of Americans can breathe a sigh of relief knowing that their President and their government believe discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity is not only intolerable but illegal, the advocacy group's president, Alphonso David, said in a statement.\\n\\nThe Supreme Court issued a landmark decision last June ruling that Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 protects workers from discrimination related to sexual orientation and gender identity. But that ruling applies explicitly to discrimination in the workplace, whereas Biden's executive order makes clear the safeguards extend to other areas like housing and education.\\n\\nIn a fact sheet released Wednesday, the Biden administration said the new order will build on the protections cemented by the Supreme Court.\\n\\nAll persons should receive equal treatment under the law, no matter their gender identity or sexual orientation, the White House said in a statement.\\n\\nThe Trump administration had urged the Supreme Court to rule that gay and transgender workers were not covered by Title VII, and after the ruling came down this past summer, the Trump administration tried to limit its reach.\\n\\nThe Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday that the Justice Department's civil rights division had recently issued a memo stating that the Bostock ruling, as it's known, should not be applied to education and housing. The memo also argued that employers may still be allowed to discriminate against LGBTQ workers by citing religious beliefs.\\n\\nThe executive order issued Wednesday was one that LGBTQ advocates were hoping to see immediately from the Biden administration. It should clarify that the federal government as an employer adopts the broader view of the Bostock decision as to what constitutes sex discrimination ― that it includes discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity ― while applying that interpretation to other laws like the Affordable Care Act, the Fair Housing Act and other parts of the Civil Rights Act.\\n\\nAP Photo/Andrew Harnik All persons should receive equal treatment under the law, no matter their gender identity or sexual orientation, the Biden White House said on its first day.\\n\\nThe previous administration had peeled back similar LGBTQ protections in other areas. Under then-President Donald Trump, the Department of Health and Human Services tried to scuttle an Obama-era regulation that forbade discrimination against transgender people in health care settings. As with the Bostock case, that measure was based on the administration's narrow reading of sex discrimination.\\n\\nA federal judge blocked the HHS measure from moving forward last year, ruling that it conflicted with the Bostock decision. The judge said the administration had refused to do the sensible thing and pause and reflect on the decision's impact.\\n\\nTrump also reinstated the don't ask, don't tell policy on transgender people serving in the military. Biden has vowed to quickly end that policy, too.\\n\\nThe Trump administration tried to undermine discrimination protections in smaller petty ways as well. In 2019, the Interior Department scrubbed the words sexual orientation from its guide on workplace discrimination."}
{"original": "Westend61 via Getty Images\\n\\nThough rarely discussed, sexless marriages are far more common than you might think.\\n\\nIt's been estimated that as many as 15 percent of married couples have not had sex within the last six to 12 months, according to a 2009 New York Times article.\\n\\nOf course, partners' levels of desire may fluctuate over time for a number of reasons ― for example, the birth of a child, health problems or medication side effects. And there are relationships in which both partners are perfectly content with infrequent sex or not having sex at all. But for many couples, it is an integral part of sustaining a physical and emotional connection.\\n\\nWe asked sex therapists to share some signs that a couple might be heading toward a sexless marriage. Below, 10 potential warning signs to look out for:\\n\\n1. You're starting to feel more like roommates than intimate partners.\\n\\nWe underestimate the importance of physical attraction in long-term relationships. In the beginning, couples make commitments to grooming, wearing clothes that make them feel desirable and feeling good about themselves. When you start to feel like roommates, you might need to change out of your sweats and comfy clothes and get ready for an intimate night together. Take a long bath or shower, put on something that makes you feel good about yourself, and put energy into feeling sensual. Even if you are staying in for the night, put something on that makes you feel open for sex and connection, like your favorite lingerie or use a new massage oil or perfume. ― Shannon Chavez, psychologist and sex therapist\\n\\n2. You're not comfortable talking about sex together.\\n\\nIf you've never had an open conversation about sex, it's likely that you'll have a sexless period in your relationship. Communication is essential to a healthy sex life, and intimacy just can't flourish without it. ― Vanessa Marin, sex therapist and creator of Finishing School, the online orgasm course for women\\n\\n3. You're giving all of your time and energy to the kids.\\n\\nWhile most new parents need to focus much of their time, energy and resources on the newborn, it's important to recognize that you need to nurture yourself and your relationship once the baby is a couple of months old. There are many parents who struggle to go out on a date after having children due to financial constraints. It's important for partners to engage with one another as adults with a variety of interests other than their kids in order to keep the erotic energy going. You can have sex while your kids are sleeping, but if all you've been doing night after night is reading stories and cleaning up after dinner, the routine can become old and exhausting. It leaves little time to connect romantically and sensually with your partner.― Sari Cooper, sex therapist and director of the Center for Love and Sex NYC\\n\\n4. You avoid watching romantic or erotic scenes on TV or in movies together.\\n\\nSex scenes in movies or on TV may inspire couples to get it on. They may see something they want to try, or they may get aroused just watching. If watching erotic scenes makes you uncomfortable, this may be indicative of a problem in your own sex life or trigger some aspect of your own sexuality that is shameful or confusing. Being able to enjoy a sexy scene with you partner is a sign of sexual health. If shame or embarrassment is getting in the way, it may be a sign of a problem. If you struggle to maintain sexual attraction to your partner, watching a sexy movie may serve as a painful reminder that you 'lost that lovin' feeling.' It may also spark a conversation that you do not want to have. Honesty is the best policy. Communicating directly about your sexual satisfaction, expectations and preferences is the best way to avoid a sexless relationship. ― Kimberly Resnick Anderson, sex therapist and associate professor of psychiatry at UCLA School of Medicine\\n\\n5. You stop flirting with each other.\\n\\nWhen your partner is starting to feel like a 'best friend' that you want to gossip on the couch with after a long day at work instead of connecting in a sensual and intimate way, it's time to create some space for being lovers and bring erotic energy into your connection together. Flirt, make eye contact, use body language to feel sexy and sensual. Move your body and be intentional about turning your partner on. Instead of turning to your partner and saying, 'Do you want to have sex?' at the end of the night, work on creating anticipation, hints outside of the bedroom, texting and communication that show you are interested in being connected and intimate together. ― Chavez\\n\\n6. Your partner makes fun of your sex drive, or lack thereof.\\n\\nIf your partner regularly mocks or derides your sex drive, that's not a good sign. All couples have sex drives that are mismatched to some degree, but it's important to be respectful of each other's needs even if they don't match our own. ― Marin\\n\\n7. You rarely touch each other inside or outside of the bedroom.\\n\\nPerhaps you haven't touched in months, even to kiss hello or goodbye. And you don't touch while you watch TV on the couch or hold hands in the car.  ― Tammy Nelson, sex therapist and author of Getting the Sex You Want\\n\\n8. You purposely stay up later than your partner to avoid the 'Not tonight, honey' conversation.\\n\\nBeing in the same bed at the same time as your partner increases the likelihood of having sexual contact. If you find yourself avoiding going to bed until after your partner is asleep, you may be consciously (or subconsciously) decreasing the odds of having sex. You need to ask yourself some tough questions: Why don't I want to be awake in the same bed at the same time as my partner? Are there aspects of my sex life that are disappointing or anxiety-provoking? Avoiding may feel easier than hurting your partner's feelings, but an honest conversation (first with yourself and then with your partner) may keep you from ending up in a sexless marriage. ― Resnick Anderson\\n\\n9. You jam-pack your schedule with other obligations, leaving little time for each other.\\n\\nWhile this could be true of many couples in this day and age — when work can call upon you wherever you happen to be via email or text — the couples that leave some time for fun, pleasure and intimacy are the ones who have a better chance of committing to creating time for sex. There are also hints that one or both partners are unconsciously avoiding intimacy through the overloading of their schedule. ― Cooper\\n\\n10. You have unrealistic expectations about what sex should be like."}

{"original": "As members of the Hollywood elite rose in solidarity at the Golden Globes on Sunday in protest of sexual harassment, the other side of the pond was also feeling the effects of the #MeToo movement.\\n\\nTrond Giske, described as one of the most powerful men in Norwegian politics, announced Sunday that he was resigning his post as deputy head of Norway's main opposition Labor Party. He also offered to step down as Labor's chief spokesman on economic policy. Giske's resignation comes on the heels of several allegations of sexual harassment. According to AFP, at least six women have come forward in recent weeks to accuse the veteran politician of sexual misconduct.\\n\\nThe 51-year-old, who's held several ministerial posts over the course of his 30-year political career, publicly apologized last month for what he described as inappropriate behavior. He, however, has refuted the more serious misconduct claims, according to Reuters.\\n\\nThe Labor Party, which is still reeling from its huge loss in Norway's general election in September, suspended Giske from his role as one of the party's two deputy heads on Jan. 1. In a Sunday Facebook post, Giske said this suspension must now become permanent.\\n\\nGiske said the main reason I'm doing this, is that it's impossible for me and my family to withstand the pressure we've been under in recent weeks. He added that he looked forward to giving my version of events and hoped the Labor Party would be able to return to work as usual following his resignation.\\n\\nI hope my decision means that [party] members and officials can again use their resources to create the society we burn for, he said.\\n\\nDetails about the harassment allegations against Giske remain scarce.\\n\\nLast week, however, Labor Party politician Line Oma became the first woman to speak publicly about her encounter with Giske.\\n\\nOma told the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation (NRK) that Giske had put his tongue down her throat against my will at a nightclub in New Delhi in 2010. Oma was 23 at the time, working as an intern at Norway's embassy in the Indian capital. She said embassy staff had ended up at the club following a large diplomatic reception attended by Giske, who was then Norway's minister of trade. Giske pushed her up against a wall, Oma told NRK, and after forcibly kissing her, asked her to return with him to his hotel ― a request she refused.\\n\\nAnother woman, who was not identified, told the broadcaster that she too had been at the club that night and had been groped by Giske.

{"original": "The first Women's March, in 2017, was a reaction to the election and inauguration of President Trump. The following year, it was a push for the polls for the 2018 midterm election. This year, with no upcoming national election, the movement has had to rethink its purpose — amid ongoing controversy over connections between some of its leaders and the anti-Semitic, anti-gay Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan. Some women who have marched before are sitting it out or attending separate rallies unaffiliated with the national organization. Thousands of others, though, will be in Washington, D.C., on Saturday.\\n\\nThis year, according to the COO of Women's March Inc., Rachel Carmona, the organization is releasing a Women's Agenda, a policy platform that she says will set the roadmap for our expectations for the elected officials who were either just elected or would like to be reelected in 2020. We view it as a work plan for all of our elected officials, and we are going to translate that into a 50-state strategy.\\n\\nThe Women's Agenda includes 10 policy issues, including racial and immigrant rights, and economic and environmental justice. Board member Linda Sarsour said that the policies, compiled by a committee of women from various national and grassroots organizations, establishes a precedent for not only the new Congress to work on, but sets a narrative for 2020. If you want to be my president and you don't have a position on the issues that are part of this woman's agenda, then don't knock on my door until you have an answer for these policies.\\n\\nStill, the biggest motivation for marchers has remained women's rights. At the Women's March 2017, only 61 percent of the people in the crowd said women's rights was the main reason they were out in the crowd, said Dana R. Fisher, a sociology professor at the University of Maryland College Park, who has collected data on past marchers. At Women's March 2018, 92 percent said they were out in the crowd for women's rights.\\n\\nIn 2017, the march did a really good job of turning out people that say women's rights matter and women are people too, Fisher continued. You can't just go around grabbing people by their genitals, and you certainly shouldn't be able to get elected president if you do that.\\n\\nFor the first march in 2017, the shock of Trump's election and the fear that that carried was great enough to hold that coalition together, but it would be kind of miraculous if that had held over time, said Nancy Whittier, a sociology professor at Smith College. The Women's March has to figure out: Is it a broad anti-Trump mobilization? Is it around intersectional feminism and not necessarily Trump? Is it around specific issues like sexual violence? The march has kind of been all of those things so far.\\n\\nAP Photo/John Minchillo Protesters gather beside the stage at the Women's March on Washington on Jan. 21, 2017.\\n\\nThe Women's March agenda isn't controversial among progressive women, but the issue of inclusiveness, or intersectionality, is. Sarsour is an activist for Palestine whose strong opposition to Israel makes some Jewish participants uncomfortable. In February, Tamika Mallory, a co-president of Women's March, Inc., attended the Nation of Islam's annual Saviour's Day event and was singled out in the audience by Farrakhan, whose speech also included the anti-Semitic and homophobic tropes he often deploys. When reports of the event surfaced, there were calls for Mallory to step down from her leadership role.\\n\\nMallory, who had been attending the Saviour's Day event for 30 years, responded to the criticism by reiterating her commitment to vulnerable communities including her LGBTQAI siblings, Jewish friends and Black women, and the Women's March released statements in the same vein.\\n\\nHowever, the backlash continued in response to pressure both from within and from outside the organization.\\n\\nLess than a month after the Women's March Inc. announced plans for the 2019 event, a white supremacist attacked a Pittsburgh synagogue, killing 11 worshipers. The rise in hate crimes against Jews — which the FBI says accounted for more than half of all hate crimes in 2017 — and the resurgence of neo-Nazism meant that the issue would continue to plague Women's March leaders, despite their statements of support for Jewish victims, op-eds denouncing anti-Semitism and participation in rallies against hate crime.\\n\\nFormer organizers and current chapters separated themselves from the national leaders (although the organization is fairly decentralized, and local groups operate with some independence.) Women's rights celebrities spoke out and #MeToo activist Alyssa Milano announced she would not speak at this year's march, shortly after Teresa Shook, who is credited with inspiring the first march with a Facebook post, called for the current co-chairs to step down.\\n\\nAP Photo/Mark Lennihan Tamika Mallory, right, at an interview in New York on Jan. 9, 2017, with her fellow Women's March co-chairs Carmen Perez, left, and Linda Sarsour.\\n\\nBut some Jewish participants object to the organizers' association with Farrakhan. Rabbi Jill Jacobs, executive director of T'ruah: The Rabbinic Call for Human Rights, will not be joining this year's March because it is being held on Saturday, the Jewish Sabbath. As an organization, because we represent rabbis and Jewish community members with a range of practices, we, as a rule, don't sponsor any events that happened on Shabbat, she says. She added that Sabbath observances vary, so for sure among our 2,000-plus rabbis, there are definitely a number of rabbis who will be marching.\\n\\nSarsour told Yahoo News she regrets that the Women's March was slow to communicate its renunciation of bigoted comments by Farrakhan, whose activism in black communities the co-chairs have commended. We're not a perfect organization, said Sarsour, [but] we do not want the story to be again that women of color and white women, in particular, were not able to organize together. We are committed to a movement where white women, where women of color and women of all backgrounds, can agree to disagree.\\n\\nVanessa Wruble, a Jewish activist and one of the initial organizers of the 2017 march, said that she was troubled, when working with the co-chairs, by anti-Semitic comments, some of which echoed Farrakhan. Mallory and Sarsour have publicly denied this.\\n\\nAfter the first Women's March, Wruble went on to found March On, the broad coalition of sister marches outside Washington. Asked if she and the Women's March Inc. leaders have reconciled, said no, but she told Yahoo News, Historically, all social movements have had rifts and splits, and I don't know why we would expect something different from such a large and broad movement as the Women's March movement. When these points of friction come up, it gives us an opportunity for everyone to learn from them. Ultimately, it makes the movement stronger, and I have absolutely no concern that the Women's March movement isn't going anywhere. It is unstoppable.\\n\\nPhoto: Courtesy of Vanessa Wruble Vanessa Wruble (center), co-founder of the Women's March on Washington and founder of March On at the Women's March on Jan. 17, 2017.\\n\\nSome cities, including Baton Rouge and Chicago, will not be hosting marches this year for a lack of resources, after footing the bills for organizing for the midterms last November. Harlene Ellin, communications lead of Women's March Chicago, said its chapter's decision not to march was made irrespective of the controversies surrounding Women's March Inc., with which it is not affiliated. Women's March Chicago pushed up its march to October, for a March to the Polls event ahead of the midterm election. It has no plans for a march in January.\\n\\nIt costs $150,000 to put on a march of that size, and countless volunteer hours, Ellin told Yahoo News. And we knew we weren't going to be able to turn around after October and repeat that in January.\\n\\nStill, Ellin fielded questions from members about anti-Semitism in the women's march. For me to answer the question, Are you anti-Semitic? when I'm Jewish, it's like: Are you kidding? No, we are not anti-Semitic. It was painful.\\n\\nAlthough Chicago won't be hosting one of over 200 marches taking place on Saturday, Ellin says the chapter will march again in the future. We will have a big march in 2020, she said. Because 2020 is going to be the biggest election of our lifetime.\\n\\nFor Yavilah McCoy, the founder of Ayecha, a nonprofit organization for Jewish women of color, the march's commitment to intersectionality is productive for policy change and the reason why she's organizing 100 Jewish women of color and allies to join marchers in D.C. on Saturday. We're doing our best to keep focused on what will mitigate pain, McCoy told Yahoo News, and will help us in policies to move freedom and liberation forward. Our eyes are on the prize.\\n\\nAP Photo/Elaine Thompson A protester in Seattle holds up a sign before a Women's March of tens of thousands on Jan. 21, 2017.\\n\\nThe march in Washington, D.C., is set to start at the National Mall at 10 a.m., with local and sister marches taking place around the country.\\n\\nAs for future marches, Sarsour said, Right now, we can't say that there's going to be a 2020 march. But there is going to be maybe the most important election year of our lifetime in 2020.\\n\\nSarsour added: Our motto eventually will be: In 2020, let's play a competitive primary. And whoever emerges as the candidate who will go up against this administration, that's going to be the candidate of the movement. I don't care who you are, where you are. For me, it's anybody but Trump.\\n\\n_____\\n\\nRead more from Yahoo News:"}

At various points, both Qualley and LaBeouf, who are rumored to be a couple in real life, appear fully nude.\\n\\nIn an Instagram post announcing the video's release, Rainey Qualley, who also goes by Rainsford, gave a special thanks to Wilde, leading many to wonder how exactly she was involved with the project.\\n\\nMultiple sources told The Hollywood Reporter, in a piece published Wednesday, that Wilde directed the video as a favor to the sisters after working with Margaret Qualley on the short film Wake Up last year.\\n\\nBut after filming, Wilde and LaBeouf didn't exactly see eye to eye, as he seemingly attempted to take control of the final edit by submitting his own cut of the video.\\n\\nHe sent the cut over on a group email to which Wilde responded that she would be happy to take a look and would submit her cut shortly, The Hollywood Reporter wrote. The response apparently did not sit well with LaBeouf who responded again by suggesting that the correct response would have been to write thank you and that 'we should go with this' in reference to the one he submitted. Per a source who saw the email, he also wrote: 'Great jazz musicians know when not to play.'\\n\\nWilde reportedly then exited the project and replied, I'm out, after LaBeouf's response. Her name no longer appears on the credits for the video.\\n\\nAt that point, Wilde had already fired LaBeouf from her upcoming thriller, Don't Worry Darling, after he displayed poor behavior during the pre-production process, according to Variety. An unnamed source told Variety that he violated her long-standing zero asshole policy on sets.\\n\\nWilde promptly recast Styles in LaBeouf's role, which led to the director and the singer sparking their now much-discussed romance.\\n\\nWilde was one of a slew of celebrities who came out in support of FKA twigs amid that singer's legal battle with LaBeouf, whom she accused of sexual battery, assault and infliction of emotional distress during their now-ended relationship.

{"original": "One of the country's most powerful labor unions is urging the incoming Biden administration to quickly fire the general counsel of the National Labor Relations Board, a potentially precedent-setting move that labor groups argue is necessary to protect worker rights.\\n\\nPeter Robb, who was appointed by President Donald Trump and confirmed by the GOP Senate, has 10 months left in his term as the labor board's quasi-prosecutor. The general counsel plays a crucial role in shaping U.S. labor policy, pursuing cases and setting rules that can determine how easy or difficult it is for workers to bargain collectively.\\n\\nThe 2-million-member Service Employees International Union sent a memo to President-elect Joe Biden's transition team in late December making the legal and moral case for sacking Robb, calling him an extreme, anti-union ideologue and a uniquely destructive figure in labor relations, according to a copy of the memo provided to HuffPost.\\n\\nOn Friday, union activists plan to take their call to fire Robb public. The Fight for $15 campaign in fast food, which was spearheaded by SEIU, has organized a one-day strike at McDonald's restaurants in several cities to coincide with the birthday of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.\\n\\nFiring Robb is expected to be a central theme of those protests.\\n\\nThe general counsel of the NLRB may be an obscure official to most Americans, but what Biden chooses to do about Robb could be a bellwether for how he governs ― as a consensus-making moderate who wants to play nice with Republicans, or as a hard-nosed progressive who wants to deliver for labor unions and other allies.\\n\\nSEIU supported Biden's candidacy and campaigned for him on the ground in crucial swing states like Michigan. Bloomberg Law reported in November that worker advocacy groups were hatching a pressure campaign aimed at getting Biden to fire Robb. Since then, SEIU has circulated memos not just to transition officials but to other allies in the labor movement arguing for Robb's removal.\\n\\nTerrence Wise, a Fight for $15 leader and McDonald's worker from Kansas City, Missouri, said Biden should not hesitate to oust Robb.\\n\\nThe NLRB is supposed to be there to help workers get a union. That hasn't been the case. [Robb] has led the fight against unionization, Wise said.\\n\\nLucy Nicholson / Reuters Fast-food workers protest outside of a McDonald's in Los Angeles on May 24, 2017, as part of the Fight for $15 movement. Fight for $15 is calling on President-elect Joe Biden to fire the NRLB's general counsel, Peter Robb.\\n\\nThe NLRB is an independent agency that referees disputes between employers and unions, with a five-member board that decides important cases, kind of like a supreme court. The general counsel, who is separate from that board, is supposed to investigate and prosecute cases where employers or unions run afoul of the law, and to manage the work of the agency's field offices.\\n\\nThe general counsel serves a 4-year term and is not normally fired when a new president takes office, even from a different political party. Robb's term is scheduled to end in November 2021. Firing him instead would allow Biden to install a new general counsel more friendly to workers and unions right away.\\n\\nGOP-appointed general counsels have historically favored businesses over unions, but labor groups argue that Robb has been egregiously anti-labor.\\n\\nSEIU and other unions were furious over his handling of the NLRB's case against McDonald's. The general counsel under Trump's predecessor, Barack Obama, had brought a case against the fast-food giant alleging it had retaliated against workers with the Fight for $15; after Robb took over, he reached a settlement with McDonald's determining that the company wasn't on the hook for labor violations alongside franchisees. A judge initially rejected the settlement, saying it left franchisees with no real obligations to do anything.\\n\\nSince then, Robb has gone after so-called neutrality agreements between unions and employers that make it easier for workers to organize. And he has recently taken on Scabby the Rat, the labor-dispute protest icon beloved by unions and progressives. Robb apparently hates the rat and wants to ban its use as unlawfully coercive. The board has asked the public to submit briefs on the issue and could hand down a decision that takes the air out of Scabby.\\n\\nJose M.

She said she has recommended he be fired in conversations with Biden transition staff.\\n\\nA spokesperson for the NLRB said the agency declined to comment.\\n\\nAside from SEIU, no other national unions appear to be making public calls for Robb's ouster. But a source close to the AFL-CIO, a federation of 55 unions that does not include SEIU, said it supports the idea of booting Robb. A spokesperson for the Biden transition did not respond to an email seeking comment.\\n\\nThe results of the special Senate elections in Georgia on Jan. 5 have likely only firmed up SEIU's conviction that Robb should be fired. With a Democratic majority in the Senate, Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and other Republicans will have a harder time stonewalling the nomination of a new, Democratic general counsel or other nominations to the NLRB.\\n\\nThe main danger is that such a move would establish a new precedent and that a future Republican president in Biden's shoes would oust a Democrat before their term ends in favor of someone who is anti-union.\\n\\nThose who support firing Robb might argue that Democrats should not observe hitherto political norms under the expectation that Republicans will pay them the same courtesy when they regain power. Trump has smashed one standard after another as other GOP leaders stood by, and McConnell has been ruthless in reshaping the Supreme Court to conservative ends.\\n\\nHenry argued the new administration shouldn't fret about setting a precedent.\\n\\nI think that working people are in the depths of a crisis. I think action is required, she said. This questioning about norms doesn't deal with what we've lived through in the last 40 years in his country, where norms around working people have been eroded steadily.\\n\\nI think that working people are in the depths of a crisis. I think action is required. Mary Kay Henry, president, SEIU\\n\\nWith most of another year left in his term, unions fear Robb could do more damage to their cause, especially with a 3-1 Republican majority remaining on the board. One seat is currently open, and the next vacancy comes up in August.\\n\\nIf Robb is permitted to stay on, SEIU's general counsel, Nicole Berner, wrote in a memo, he will help that majority continue their anti-worker project through November 2021 when his own term expires, and beyond, when the Board still will be able to decide pending cases from his tenure.\\n\\nBrandon Magner, a union-side attorney, recently wrote on his substack Labor Law Lite that a president's ability to fire the NLRB general counsel appears clear. Appointees to the five-member board can only be hooked for malfeasance or neglect of duty under the law, but no such stricture applies to the general counsel. Saying the labor movement was in a crisis, Magner concluded that Biden shouldn't be able to stand having Peter Robb serve a second longer than necessary.\\n\\nWise, the McDonald's worker, agreed with that assessment, comparing Robb's tenure to the fox guarding the chicken coop.\\n\\nThat's why we're calling on the Biden administration ― and I would say the first day, not the first 100 days ― to get rid of this guy, he said."}

The announcement sparked immediate backlash from military and intelligence officials, including the resignations of Jim Mattis, the defense secretary, and Brett McGurk, the U.S. special envoy to the coalition to fight ISIS.\\n\\nThe United States has around 2,000 military personnel in Syria, where they have supported Kurdish militia forces in retaking territory seized by ISIS.

Last month, Trump ordered the gradual withdrawal of 7,000 of those forces.\\n\\nIn her MSNBC interview, Warren said she rejected the foreign policy establishment view that U.S. forces should stay forever in Afghanistan, arguing that the prolonged American presence in that country hasn't resulted in lasting security or stability.\\n\\nWe're now 17 years in Afghanistan and ... the [Afghan] government controls less than 60 percent of all the land, Warren said.

{"original": "One week into his term, President Donald Trump devastated tens of thousands of people with the stroke of a pen.\\n\\nThroughout the campaign, Trump had vowed to enact a Muslim ban. His fifth executive order effectively made good on that promise, banning people from seven countries — all majority-Muslim — from entering the United States.\\n\\nImmediate chaos followed. People were stranded at airports. Families were kept apart. Refugees set to finally find safety in the U.S. after years of navigating international bureaucracies were abruptly abandoned.\\n\\nThat day proved to be a harbinger of what was to come. For the next four years, Trump followed up with policies, actions and comments that were tremendously painful for hundreds of thousands of people. That suffering was borne primarily by minorities and people of color: Latinos he demonized, Black people he denigrated for protesting against racism and brutality, Muslims he continually attacked, transgender people he licensed discrimination against, Asian Americans he insulted.\\n\\nTrump separated thousands of immigrant children from their parents in a policy that will go down in history as among the cruelest actions of his administration. He downplayed the coronavirus pandemic, which has thus far killed at least 375,000 Americans.\\n\\nTrump riled up supporters in opposition to his perceived foes: Democrats, particularly women of color such as Rep. Ilhan Omar; whistleblowers such as Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman; election workers who he suggested were part of a massive fraud campaign; public health workers who pushed for more safety precautions to stop the spread of COVID-19.\\n\\nHe defended white nationalist protesters as very fine people after they descended on Charlottesville, Virginia. He called Haiti and African nations shithole countries, a view he would have followed up with action to decrease immigration had he won support from Congress. He insulted the women who accused him of sexual assault. He encouraged supporters to overturn the election in statements that led to an insurrection at the Capitol last week, a move that led to him being impeached for a second time on Wednesday.\\n\\nThe Trump era will be remembered for many things, including corruption and extremism. For many people, it will also be remembered as a time of immense pain — a time when the nation's highest power, a man purportedly the president to all Americans, turned his aim on them.\\n\\nWe asked 14 people to share with us, in their own words, what it was like to live through it.\\n\\nRyan Kang/AP Jessica Drake at a news conference in Los Angeles on Oct. 22, 2016. She accused Donald Trump of grabbing and kissing her without her consent in 2006.\\n\\nOct. 22, 2016\\n\\nJessica Drake, an adult film actor, director and sex educator, accused Trump of grabbing and kissing her without her consent in 2006. She also said Trump offered her $10,000 to have sex with him at a Lake Tahoe golf tournament.\\n\\nTrump called her allegations total fiction, and his campaign continually smeared her character to undermine her claim. He later insinuated that Drake's accusation didn't matter because she was an adult film actor.\\n\\nIt was terrifying [coming forward with my story], and it wasn't a decision I made overnight. I understood that it would alter the course of my life significantly. However, it was extremely important to me that I speak out and share my personal experience prior to the election.\\n\\nWhen his campaign denied my claims, it was frustrating yet expected ― I knew that was their method. When he was doing a New Hampshire radio interview and said: One [woman] said, 'He grabbed me on the arm.' And she's a porn star… Oh, I'm sure she's never been grabbed before. That infuriated me. His dismissal of my claims being based on my occupation was unfair.\\n\\nAt first, when he won the election, I felt like nothing I had said or did mattered. I was devastated. Today, his fan base continues to hate me. I get hateful messages on social media. Some folks have thanked me. Some of the other women who came out against him have reached out to me in support. For me, the decision to speak out was a fork in the road of my life.

Since then, the ban has been challenged in courts, upheld by the Supreme Court, revised, and expanded. Thousands of people were separated from their families, missing weddings and funerals, education and work opportunities, and denied seeing their loved ones for years.\\n\\nAmong them was Mina Mahdavi, a 39-year-old solutions and cybersecurity engineer in California who has not been able to bring her mother from Iran to the U.S. because of the Muslim ban.\\n\\nMy mom is an avid traveler. I used to live in Canada and she visited me in Canada. She traveled all over Europe. She visited me here in the U.S. twice. And then, in 2016, I decided to have a kid, and I was planning to have my mom with me.\\n\\nMy son was born in May 2017, and I was still in denial. I thought, there's a waiver process, we can ask for a waiver. She's gonna make it. Maybe not the first couple of months, but she's gonna make it. And then, after it got rejected like 15, 16 months later, it sort of settled in — I can't have my mom here. Period.\\n\\nI went through depression. It's hard. I don't know how to describe it. It's hard.\\n\\nAt first, I was still hopeful. I was thinking, maybe not now, but she's going to come. Not today, but she was going to come like next week. She even packed her stuff. She was ready. The moment that she would get the visa, she would just fly. And then she sort of started unpacking, I guess, after a while.\\n\\nI still see people in the park with their grandkids ― a grandma or grandpa — and I don't know why I don't have it.

He is one of several plaintiffs suing the Trump administration over a transgender ban.\\n\\nJuly 26, 2017\\n\\nTrump announced in a series of tweets that he planned to ban transgender people from serving in the military in any capacity. The controversial policy, implemented on April 12, 2019, stated that trans people are only allowed to enlist in the military under the sex they were assigned at birth. The policy effectively banned transgender people from enlisting in the military, while forcing current trans service members who had already transitioned back into the closet.\\n\\nBrock Stone, an 11-year Navy veteran and transgender man, was one of those affected by Trump's ban. The 37-year-old is one of several plaintiffs in an ongoing lawsuit against the Trump administration over its ban on transgender service members.\\n\\nI remember being terrified. I didn't know how quickly it would all happen. I didn't know what the legal procedure would be. It was the commander in chief saying this. Does he give the order and then I fill out my paperwork and I'm out in 30 days and I hope I can find a job quickly? I had no idea.\\n\\nOf all of my feelings, I never wished I hadn't come out. It was more anger that I had gained that visibility and they were trying to erase me. They weren't telling me to detransition, they were telling me: Go away.\\n\\nThis wasn't just a job to me. At the time, I took quite a bit of pride in being part of the military. It felt like I was part of something bigger than myself. It wasn't a religious experience for me, but it was kind of a crisis of faith. It was a big chunk of my reality turned on its head.\\n\\nI remember when I was approached to join the lawsuit. I initially had said I needed to think about it. Ultimately, I thought, I can wait for somebody else to do this for me or I can do it myself. Now I know I did what I should've done.\\n\\n― As told to Alanna Vagianos\\n\\nRYAN M.

The crowd, which chanted racist and anti-Semitic statements, included neo-Nazis and members of other extremist hate groups. A man drove a car into a crowd of counterprotesters demonstrating against hate in their city, and a woman named Heather Heyer was killed.\\n\\nOn Aug. 12, Trump addressed the violence by stating, We condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides ― on many sides. He defended the comments on Aug. 15, saying, You have people who are very fine people on both sides and claiming he was referring to people protesting against removing monuments to Confederates and racists.\\n\\nLisa Woolfork, an anti-racist organizer in Charlottesville, reflects on what those comments signified.\\n\\nI was at the intersection when the white supremacist drove his car through the crowd. What I remember was hearing a loud bang. And then I saw a shoe in the air about 20 feet above me. It was chaos. Absolute chaos.\\n\\n[Trump's comments were] in the immediate aftermath. We hadn't even fully parsed what had happened. I remember standing here at our house in the living room, and my husband had read his statement aloud, I heard it. And I felt chills. I felt like someone had thrown a bucket of ice cold water over my head, and it was dripping down my body. I felt such rage. This was adding insult to injury. We had already had an injury. And the president of the United States piled on the insults. And it was an announcement that reflected everything that we had long known about this administration: that they had chosen their side and they were speaking to their base, which is a racist, white supremacist, fascist spirit that has infected American democracy. This is also the outcome of when you don't acknowledge that American democracy has always had at its core a form of racism and white supremacy.\\n\\nThis administration dispensed with the need for dog whistles, and then just shouts it from a bullhorn. You cannot unring a bell. You cannot.\\n\\n― As told to Elise Foley\\n\\nCourtesy of Gabriela Cruz Gabriela Cruz, a Dreamer in Santa Cruz, California, was affected by the Trump administration's immigration policies.\\n\\nSept. 5, 2017\\n\\nTrump announced he was ending the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA, an Obama-era policy that granted temporary work permits and deportation reprieve to about 800,000 undocumented young people who came to the U.S. as kids. He was later blocked in court.\\n\\nOne of these so-called Dreamers was Gabriela Cruz, a 31-year-old who lives in Santa Cruz, California, and now works for the advocacy group United We Dream and its political arm, United We Dream Action.\\n\\nI was so numb that day. I couldn't process what was happening. I immigrated to the country when I was only a year old, so I've been here for 30 years. I didn't get DACA until I was 23 years old. And so for me, I'd built a whole career. I had finally found stability in my life where I wasn't fearful anymore. At work I told myself, just keep it together to 5 p.m. and then afterward, you can cry, you can do whatever you feel like you need to do.\\n\\nI had never really been to a protest. But I wanted to be around people. I made this huge sign that said Santa Cruz Dreamer. And that was the first time that I ever called myself that. It actually ended up being the first day I actually shared my story out loud in public.\\n\\nThe last four years have been just so horrible. It's taken a toll on me mentally, physically. Now, I feel like I can finally take care of myself again. I couldn't do that the last four years because I was fighting for my life.\\n\\n― As told to Elise Foley\\n\\nCourtesy of Javier Garrido Javier Garrido, an immigrant from Honduras, was separated from his 4-year-old son for three months.\\n\\nApril 6, 2018\\n\\nIn 2018, then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced the implementation of Trump's zero-tolerance immigration policy. The order separated migrant children from their parents who were detained when they entered the U.S., causing a national uproar after photos of traumatized young children screaming and crying went public. After mounting pressure from lawmakers and advocates, Trump signed an executive order ending the policy a year later.\\n\\nJavier Garrido, 33, an immigrant from Honduras, crossed into the U.S. with his son. He was separated from his son, who was 4 at the time, for three months.\\n\\nI left fleeing for my life. It was in 2018. I left my country in March. I turned myself in at the bridge to ask for help. They detained me for three days when they separated me from my son. They took him from me. They left me at the border, over in Texas, and they took my son to New York.\\n\\nThat was painful. I never thought they'd take him from me. If I'd have known, I would have stayed and faced the violence in my country, rather than have them take my son. When they took him, the first thing the officer told me was that they were going to put him up for adoption for a family here in the United States. That was painful. If I'd have known that they would take away my kid like that, I wouldn't have come.\\n\\nIt went on for three months, me in one place and my son in another. They told me they would deport me along with my child, but I said, I don't care, as long as I get to see him. I'm going to Honduras. And later I'll find some way to go to another country. But I want my son.\\n\\nThe day [we reunited] was the happiest day of my life, as happy as the day my son was born. I was so happy when they gave him back to me because my head had been spinning, wondering whether they would give him back or not, or whether a family here would end up adopting him.\\n\\nIt's the saddest thing they can do, to separate someone from their family. I don't wish it on anyone. I don't think they should do it. Better to send them back together if someone comes here with their family, but don't split them up because that's painful.\\n\\nI spent about two months knowing nothing about my son, I didn't know where he was, I didn't know anything. I had to call family in Honduras, so they could try to figure out where my son was. I don't wish this upon anyone.\\n\\n― As told to Rowaida Abdelaziz\\n\\nCourtesy Ashante Clay Ashante Clay was among the 1.2 million federal contractors who were affected when the government shut down for 35 days in December 2018 to January 2019.\\n\\nJanuary 2019\\n\\nThe U.S. government came to a screeching halt in late December 2018. It remained remain shuttered for 35 days after Trump demanded Congress carve out in its appropriations bill nearly $6 billion to fund his wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.\\n\\nAbout 380,000 federal employees were furloughed and another roughly 420,000 were expected to continue working with their pay delayed until the shutdown ended. An estimated 1.2 million federal contractors ― including 31-year-old Ashante Clay of Virginia ― were also impacted.\\n\\nAnd while many of these workers received back pay once the government reopened, the stress of trying to make ends meet in the interim had lasting impacts for some.\\n\\nIt was pretty scary. It was like I was employed one week and then I just wasn't employed the next. I'm a single mom, so I still had day care and all my bills to pay.\\n\\nI was on unemployment for like three or four months. I was job searching outside of the government. After two government shutdowns with my company, it just didn't seem like the field to be working in. It was just too volatile.\\n\\nTo say it was overwhelming would be an understatement. I didn't expect to ever lose my job. I wasn't prepared, and I was just barely making it with day care and bills and everything. Losing that income ― it was really stressful.\\n\\nI did not want a border wall and I was very, very upset that something that's so terribly discriminatory and racist, something I didn't even want or support, cost me my job. And the people who were making these decisions did not care that their squabbling with each other was having real-life consequences to working people like myself.\\n\\nI don't really follow a lot of the political chatter ― it's just kind of too much ― but I never heard any lawmakers or anybody who was in support of the wall talking about the people who were losing their jobs or not being able to pay their bills just because of this border wall.\\n\\n― As told to Hayley Miller\\n\\nAl Drago/Bloomberg/Getty Images Rep. Ilhan Omar has been a frequent target of Trump's racist and Islamophobic rhetoric.\\n\\nApril 13, 2019\\n\\nOn April 13, 2019, Trump tweeted out a video falsely suggesting that Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.), who just five months earlier had become the first Somali American and one of the first two Muslim women ever elected to Congress, had tried to justify the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks. Trump has since made Omar one of the most consistent targets of his racist and Islamophobic rhetoric, repeatedly saying she should go back to Somalia, where a civil war made her a refugee as a child. At his rallies, crowds of his fans have chanted Send her back about Omar.\\n\\nIn November 2019, a Trump supporter pleaded guilty to making death threats against the congresswoman; Omar wrote to the sentencing judge asking him to be compassionate in his decision. Despite proof of the impact of his own vitriol ― which prompted investigations by both the FBI and the U.S. Capitol Police ― Trump has continued smearing Omar, apparently seeing it as politically useful to elevate his feud with the first member of Congress to wear a Muslim headscarf.\\n\\nSpeaking in her home state weeks before the presidential election, Trump claimed that Omar tells us how to run our country, making it clear he does not see her as an equal American. This week, Omar helped lead the charge to impeach the president a second time for inciting a mob to invade Congress on Jan. 6, 2021.\\n\\n[On Jan. 6] we saw the violent consequences of Trump's violent rhetoric. Every Member of Congress, staff member, and Capitol worker saw how violent and dangerous the leader of our country can be. Sadly, I have known the danger of this since I took office, as Trump's words have resulted in thousands of threats on my life.\\n\\nI do not worry for myself, but I worry about the consequences of this violent rhetoric on our fragile republic. I worry about the people in my district and around the world who share my identities. I worry about the little Ilhans sitting in refugee camps around the world who will not have the opportunity to come to this country because of his refugee policies. I worry about the Black children who won't have a stable home because of Trump's efforts to resegregate housing. I worry about the child who is separated from her mother because of Trump's cruel immigration policies. The legacy of this hatred will continue for decades and it is up to all of us to ensure that this ideology can never hold power in our republic again.\\n\\n― As told to Akbar Shahid Ahmed\\n\\nCourtesy of Laiken Jordahl Laiken Jordahl has been documenting the environmental damage at the U.S.-Mexico border.\\n\\nFeb. 6, 2020\\n\\nTrump campaigned on a promise to build a big beautiful wall along the southern border ― one that he insisted Mexico would foot the bill for. Four years later, more than 400 miles of border wall have been built, most of it replacement of smaller existing barriers, without Mexico paying a dime of the $15 billion price tag. In its rushed effort, the Trump administration has waived numerous environmental laws and forever altered the southern border.\\n\\nIn February 2020, the Trump administration began bulldozing and blasting sites within Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument, a UNESCO biosphere reserve that is home to numerous endangered species, to make way for Trump's wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. The sites included cultural and burial sites sacred to the Tohono O'odham and other Native American tribes.\\n\\nAlong with that damage, migration routes for jaguars and other species have been cut off, fragile ecosystems damaged, whole mountains sliced in half. Laiken Jordahl, a former wilderness fellow at the National Park Service, has been documenting the environmental damage in the borderlands, including Organ Pipe, as a campaigner at the left-leaning Center for Biological Diversity.\\n\\nI spent Trump's Inauguration Day wandering through a cactus forest in Organ Pipe National Monument, just north of the U.S.-Mexico border. At 26 years old, I'd landed my dream job: working with the National Park Service to protect Arizona's stunning wilderness lands for generations to come.\\n\\nBut as Trump was sworn in, I worried that he'd make good on his racist border wall promise and destroy so much of the wilderness I was charged with protecting. And even though Trump's plan to build a wall across the southern border was clearly the biggest threat facing Organ Pipe, I was told not to discuss, research or write about the horrific destruction a wall would cause. It was just too political.\\n\\nYears later, I find myself returning to Organ Pipe almost every week, but not as a park service employee. Now I return with a bullhorn and media crews. In the past year, Trump has dynamited sacred Indigenous sites, butchered hundreds of ancient saguaro cactuses, and pulverized swaths of wildlife habitat to build the wall along the monument's southern border.\\n\\nI've done everything I can to raise the alarm as this ecological catastrophe unfolds before my eyes, but I can't help but feel like I failed to protect Organ Pipe. The wall through the monument is nearly complete. I've become a disaster tour guide. It's heartbreaking.\\n\\nThe damage Trump's border wall has inflicted is incalculable. Much of it will last forever.\\n\\n― As told to Chris D'Angelo\\n\\nCourtesy of James Chen James Chen has seen how the president's rhetoric amplified the xenophobia around the coronavirus pandemic.\\n\\nMarch 2020\\n\\nWhile insisting the spread of the coronavirus in the U.S. wasn't his fault, Trump turned to a common scapegoat: China. The president repeatedly referred to the coronavirus as China virus, kung flu and Wuhan virus.\\n\\nViruses are no longer named after places because of the potential for harm for nations and people. Asian Americans reported a swell of hate incidents related to the coronavirus.\\n\\nJames Chen, a 45-year-old Taiwanese American small business owner in Queens, New York, said the president's rhetoric amplified the xenophobia and that his business faced a double whammy — a financial loss incurred by the pandemic lockdown and a bias that unfairly led customers away.\\n\\nI'm proud to be a Chinese, Asian American in this country. So when [Trump] used the word China virus, I wasn't too happy about it. I felt like it was very discriminatory.\\n\\nAsian Americans, especially Chinese Americans, are being discriminated against. I felt this way when I was out on Long Island, during the beginning of the pandemic. I was out wearing a mask in Rite Aid, and I felt other people being uncomfortable [with my presence] and they looked at me very weird. I wanted to say I'm protecting you guys, but unfortunately, it's what it is.\\n\\nEveryone is being affected in some way. I lost my aunt last year, due to coronavirus. A lot of people have lost or knew someone who passed away from coronavirus.\\n\\nAsian Americans, especially Chinese Americans in this country, take the coronavirus very, very seriously. During the beginning of this pandemic, they were the first ones to wear a mask. They are the first ones to shut down their businesses, the first ones to sanitize their business.\\n\\nWe want to stop the spread. Don't put this tag on us — Asian virus or China virus. It's really unfair.\\n\\n― As told to Rowaida Abdelaziz\\n\\nRich Fury/Getty Images Melina Abdullah participates in the Hollywood talent agencies march to support Black Lives Matter protests in Beverly Hills, California, in June 2020.\\n\\nJune 1, 2020\\n\\nA week after the death of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police, thousands of people, led by Black Lives Matter organizers, showed up at the gates of the White House to protest racism and police brutality.\\n\\nTrump directed law enforcement to tear-gas and launch rubber bullets at the peaceful protesters so he could walk to the historic St. John's Episcopal Church just a few blocks away. Once there, he posed with a Bible for a photo-op and said, Greatest country in the world. And we're going to keep it safe.\\n\\nMelina Abdullah, the co-founder of Black Lives Matter Los Angeles, was watching in horror from across the country.\\n\\nThe idea that Black Lives Matter organizers were out to protest police brutality and Trump used police brutality to silence those protesters ― it was a reminder of how deeply entrenched police violence is in this country.\\n\\nTrump's photo-op and the police crackdown on protesters was just days after [the death of] George Floyd. Those who want to maintain an oppressive and racist regime are perhaps most threatened by the organizing component. That's where I think you see the call for police violence against protesters ― it's because Trump was threatened by the protest. The lesson for us is we can't give up the protest, even in the midst of a pandemic.\\n\\nWe have to both vote and organize. We have to engage in both protest and politics. We don't just organize to vote. When we vote folks into office, we also have to ensure that they carry the agendas of the folks who voted them in.\\n\\nI feel so relieved knowing that Trump is leaving office. We're not under the illusion that just because Biden and Harris are in the White House, all of a sudden Black freedom comes. There's no illusion there. But Donald Trump was absolutely the most oppressive, repressive, racist, sexist, violent so-called leader we could have. So I am relieved to see him go. I think the whole world is exhaling. We're all sharing a collective sigh of relief.\\n\\n― As told to Alanna Vagianos\\n\\nDavid Zalubowski/AP Amber McReynolds, a vote-by-mail advocate, has been the target of online harassment since Trump started spreading conspiracy theories about election fraud.\\n\\nSummer 2020\\n\\nThe Justice Department and election officials nationwide have stated repeatedly that there's no evidence widespread voter fraud occurred during the 2020 election, and yet Trump has continued to falsely claim for months that the Democrats rigged the process against him. He's been especially critical of mail-in voting, making unsubstantiated allegations of election fraud and whipping his base into a frenzy.\\n\\nAs CEO of the nonpartisan National Vote at Home Institute, Amber McReynolds has spent the last two years helping state and local election officials across the country expand and secure their vote-by-mail systems. She's been the target of constant harassment online in recent months amid Trump's whirlwind of misinformation about mail-in ballots.\\n\\nIn the weeks after the election is when the death threats started. I had tweets directed at me [with] a picture of a noose saying that I should be hung for treason and executed for being a traitor. There was one tweet that had a picture of my kids in it, which was the one that really disturbed me the most. They got pretty bad, to where we actually hired off-duty police officers to be stationed outside my house for three or four weeks.\\n\\nMy election official friends have been targeted in unprecedented ways this year, and they're just trying to do their jobs. I'm running a nonprofit now and I understand people aren't always going to agree with what we're trying to do, but ultimately all we're trying to do is improve the election process for every single American and make sure it's safe, secure and accessible.\\n\\nThe election officials, my heart breaks for them because they're already under a very stressful situation and to have them get death threats or be followed to their cars or be harassed online or doxed on social media ― it's just unbelievable.\\n\\nI just never in my wildest dreams would have expected that an elected official ― at any level ― would do what has happened, not only with the president but also local officials and state legislators who have pushed these crazy conspiracies not based in fact. I just never expected that to occur in the United States of America.\\n\\n― As told to Hayley Miller\\n\\nCourtesy of Anna Wiley Diana Lachiondo, a county commissioner in Idaho, had her home surrounded by anti-mask protesters.\\n\\nDec. 8, 2020\\n\\nTrump downplayed the threat of COVID-19 from the get-go, repeatedly peddling misinformation about its transmission and mocking people who wore masks. His divisive and baseless rhetoric fired up supporters, some of whom staged armed protests against state and local officials making decisions about coronavirus mitigation measures.\\n\\nAda County Commissioner Diana Lachiondo of Idaho, a member of her district's public health board, was the target of one such protest. She tearfully excused herself from a health board meeting on a potential mask mandate after she learned protesters were surrounding her house. Her two children were home alone.\\n\\nAt the time, I thought it was just my 12-year-old, but it turns out it was my 12-year-old and my 8-year-old. He was upset and I just felt really helpless. I had to get home to my son. He's scared. There's people outside our door and I don't know what's going on. … I just can't believe where we've come to as a community and as a country, really. It's just ― it's sad.\\n\\nI'll tell you the most frustrating thing is that I get a weekly report from the White House coronavirus task force with recommendations about what we should be doing from a mitigation standpoint. At one point, [task force member] Deborah Birx herself was on the phone with just me and the health board member from our neighboring county, and she wasn't calling because we were doing so great over here; she was imploring us to take measures. Simultaneously, we're watching the president fan the flames of some of this rhetoric against the governor of Michigan and just in general.\\n\\nThe disconnect between what his own task force was asking us to do and these weekly White House reports and then what he was doing ... was incredibly frustrating. I, at this point, feel like it's had real consequences for my family. That's not leadership.\\n\\n― As told to Hayley Miller\\n\\nAakash Tandel Congressional aide Justin Goldberger watched the Capitol insurrection unfold from home while trying to get in touch with his colleagues inside the building.\\n\\nJan. 6, 2021\\n\\nTrump ― through his incessant false claims of voter fraud ― for weeks sowed defiance and distrust of the election results among his base. On Jan. 6, he addressed thousands of his supporters in Washington, D.C., and called on them to march on the U.S. Capitol. Many of them heeded his orders, forcing their way into the building. The violence resulted in at least five deaths, including a police officer who died after a pro-Trump rioter bludgeoned him in the head with a fire extinguisher.\\n\\nBecause of the pandemic, Justin Goldberger, a senior policy adviser to Rep. Donald McEachin (D-Va.), was working from home when the insurrectionists began storming the Capitol. He frantically called and texted his colleagues who were inside as he watched the insurrectionists attempt to overthrow the seat of the nation's government.\\n\\nSymbols of hate, including the Confederate flag and neo-Nazi iconography, were paraded through the Capitol. Goldberger — a co-chair of the Congressional Jewish Staffers Association whose boss is the third Black congressman ever to represent Virginia — found them particularly hard to see.\\n\\nYou see your place of work turn into a war zone. There's tear gas, there are protesters, and you're frantically texting your colleagues and just making sure that they're OK. It's tough because every minute you don't hear back, you're wondering.\\n\\nThe toughest part is seeing a place you're so familiar with, and you see every day and have all these memories in, just kind of implode.\\n\\nYou saw people quoting Hitler. You saw Nazi paraphernalia. And not even from a Jewish perspective, but I work for a [Congressional Black Caucus] member ― you saw nooses hung up. And just seeing that was I think equally as jarring and just disheartening, not only as a Capitol Hill staffer but just as an American.\\n\\nPersonally, do I think that some institutions probably incentivized or didn't at least do their part to stop this? Absolutely. … On the opposite side, seeing us go back to work right afterward and say, you know, we're not going to let this affect our timeline for making sure democracy runs its course was equally as heartening.\\n\\n― As told to Hayley Miller\\n\\nResponses have been lightly edited for clarity."}
{"original": "Photo Source: Dawn, Pakistan\\n\\nPakistan's powerful army chief, General Raheel Sharif, has stunned his supporters and critics with Monday's unanticipated announcement that he would not seek an extension for his job when the duration of his service expires in November. I don't believe in extension, he said on Twitter through a military spokesman. In a functioning democracy, this announcement would be deemed very strange because the army chief is not supposed to publicly speak about his job. It is generally the president or the prime minister who, with the consultation of the parliament, decides whether or not the commander should be offered an extension.\\n\\nIn Pakistan's case, General Sharif has spoken with a sense of entitlement indicating that if he wants to continue his job, he can easily do so but he will not emulate several of his predecessors. Former dictator, General Musharraf, has already suggested that General Sharif should be granted an extension in order to successfully complete the military operation against the Pakistani Taliban. If General Sharif means what he has stated in his statement, this would have long-term positive implications on Pakistan's democracy. He would deservedly be credited for helping in creating a Pakistan where the supremacy of institutions is given preference over ambitious individuals.\\n\\nGeneral Sharif's announcement has gained significant attention because rumors about the extension of his term were abundantly circulating in the local media. I would classify the Pakistanis who wanted an extension for Sharif in three categories.\\n\\nReward Sharif General Sharif is indeed very popular in Pakistan. His decision to unleash a military operation against the Pakistani Taliban is probably the main reason for his popularity among the masses. The tipping point for the Pakistani army came on December 16, 2014 when the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) killed 148 people, mostly school children, in an unprecedented attack on Peshawar's Army Public School. The mass killing of children galvanized public support for a decisive action against the Taliban. It has not been a flawless operation but it did inflict serious damages on the Taliban infrastructure. Whatever shortcomings the army experienced during this time were immediately compensated with a sophisticated media campaign. General Sharif has had master publicists and media strategists who have helped popularize his brand. His has been a brand of a general who had said good-bye to the Pakistani army's old policy of supporting the Jihadis. Thus, the Pakistanis who are convinced that General Sharif has actually defeated the Taliban believe he should be rewarded with an extension so that the country benefits from his leadership and the successes achieved under his leadership are preserved and furthered.\\n\\nNeed Sharif\\n\\nAttacks such as the one recently carried out by the Taliban on the Bacha Khan University in northwestern Pakistan that killed more than twenty people keep this category of the Pakistanis sleepless. These people are appreciative of General Sharif's leadership and acknowledge the gains made in the war against the Taliban but they are also skeptical of the claims that the army has fully won the war against the Taliban. So much credit is given to one man (i.e. General Sharif) for planning and executing the operation against the Taliban that these people believe General Sharif's retirement at a time when the battle against the Taliban is not over will keep one door open for the Taliban to regain power and carry out attacks on ordinary citizens.\\n\\nFear Sharif\\n\\nPeople in this category respect Sharif solely because they fear him. These are mainly the politicians, both from the government and the opposition. They want him to retire as soon as possible or at least suffice with an extension. They certainly do not want him to overthrow the democratic government and stage a coup, as seen at least on three occasions in Pakistan's history. General Sharif's recent movements, ranging from his trip to the United States soon after Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's meeting with President Obama in October 2015 to his latest visits to Saudi Arabia and Iran have all alerted Pakistan's democratic forces. In their views, General Sharif has established a parallel government against that of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif. Given his tremendous popularity among the people and the unfinished war against the Taliban, General Sharif is unlikely to face public resistance should he decide to overthrow the elected government. In spite of the circumstances that profoundly favor him, General Sharif's decision to retire without finding a pretext to extend his term or troubling the feeble democratic government, is laudable. This is good for Pakistan's democratic institutions and his own legacy.\\n\\nWhat is General Sharif going to do with so much popularity after he retires? There are speculations that he might join politics after retirement. That's not a smart choice. If the General's advisers are thinking that he has a bright future in politics, they are grossly mistaken. Generals and judges are powerful as long as they are in office. When they retire and jump in politics, they do not become overnight revolutionaries. General Sharif should take a leaf out of General Musharraf's book who founded his own party soon after retirement hoping that he would become a political game changer but his one-man party could not even get him elected in the parliament. Musharraf was followed by the former Chief Justice Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry, also once a popular public figure. Chaudhry has launched his own party but nobody even knows what his party is called because he does not have enough followers.\\n\\nThe Pakistani voters are not known for electing generals when they are not in the uniform or carrying a gun. They get public support when staging a coup mostly because voters are fed up with corrupt and selfish politicians and they fear the incoming man in the uniform. Every time a general was 'elected' through an election or a referendum, it was entirely based on fear and intimidation. Can General Sharif change that trend? He still has a few months to think about it."}

{"original": "The debate about Medicare for All is about to get more serious ― and more complicated.\\n\\nThe idea of creating a single national health insurance program for all Americans has been a big topic of political conversation since 2016, when Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) touted it during his Democratic presidential campaign. But Medicare for All couldn't be anything more than a rallying cry as long as Republicans controlled the levers of power in Washington.\\n\\nPolitical circumstances are different now. Democrats hold the House majority and, as Speaker Nancy Pelosi's office confirmed to The Washington Post on Thursday, at least two committees will hold hearings on Medicare for All this year. Exactly what those hearings will entail isn't clear ― Democratic leaders aren't saying ― but one focus will be a bill that Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) plans to introduce in the next few weeks.\\n\\nJayapal is a leader of a Medicare for All House caucus that had 78 members as of late November and, with an infusion of newly elected Democrats, should soon have more. The new bill will be similar to one she co-sponsored in the last Congress, which in turn was similar to a bill Sanders introduced in the Senate.\\n\\nJayapal has said she hopes a version will get a floor vote, although that seems a long ways off. The committees taking up the proposal initially aren't actually the ones that would write a health care bill. Even so, the hearings could represent the most serious attention the concept has received on Capitol Hill since the late 1940s, when committees took up then-President Harry Truman's similarly designed, but ill-fated national health insurance proposal.\\n\\nAnd Democrats in Congress won't be the only ones talking about Medicare for All over the next two years.\\n\\nWhen Sanders introduced his bill last year, the list of 16 Democratic co-sponsors included several prospective presidential contenders ― among them, Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who last week launched her exploratory committee for a White House bid. That announcement came one day after Sen. Kamala Harris of California, another likely presidential candidate, reaffirmed her support for Medicare for All in a New York Times Op-Ed. And, of course, Sanders himself is widely expected to run again.\\n\\nOne reason Medicare for All will get a hard look is that the Democratic Party's increasingly powerful progressives are determined to improve upon the coverage gains made under Affordable Care Act, which has helped many millions get health care but also left many millions still struggling to pay medical bills. A single government insurance plan, progressives say, would be more efficient and effective than Obamacare's awkward mix of private and public plans.\\n\\nAs proof Medicare for All can work, they cite the performance of national health systems in countries such as Canada, Sweden and Taiwan. As proof Medicare for All is popular, they cite surveys showing support among U.S. adults reaching 59 percent. But those poll numbers can be misleading. The same surveys show that when people hear about potential costs and trade-offs that come with Medicare for All, support falls.\\n\\nEven the architects of Medicare for All plans haven't fully worked out how their systems would function. That's particularly true when it comes to money questions, like how to pay doctors and hospitals or how to finance all the new public spending it would require.\\n\\nThey don't need all the specifics now. Medicare for All isn't going to become law as long as Republicans control the Senate and Donald Trump is the president. Meanwhile, the lawmakers and staff working on plans have already done more thinking than their conservative counterparts did about mythical, ultimately ill-fated Obamacare replacements.\\n\\nBut a Medicare for All system, like any complex policy enterprise, would entail difficult trade-offs. At some point advocates need to figure out how they want to handle those, how they'll overcome the inevitable political resistance to what they decide and which parts of their vision matter to them most.\\n\\nAmong the issues to consider:\\n\\nShould Private Insurance Have Any Role At All?\\n\\nThe existing Medicare for All proposals would basically eliminate private insurance because the new public program would cover everything, every single American would belong to it and the law would prohibit private insurers from offering anything similar.\\n\\nThe political benefit of this simplicity is that it's easy to explain. The main policy benefit is that it would simplify billing, which means that hospitals, clinics and other providers wouldn't have to hire so many administrative staff. That would make health care less expensive.\\n\\nBut wiping out private insurance would also mean ending the insurance arrangements that the majority of Americans now have, either through their employers or through Medicare Advantage, which is the private insurance option for seniors on Medicare.\\n\\nHow Americans would feel about this is a big unknown. As employer insurance gets more expensive, employers are passing along some of those higher costs to their workers in the form of higher co-pays and deductibles, to the point where some of the employees struggle to pay bills. And employer coverage often requires dealing with limited networks of doctors and hospitals.\\n\\nBut employer coverage is still popular, at least according to industry polling. As the 2017 fight to repeal Obamacare and pretty much every other health care battle has shown, change of any sort is scary. Americans are unlikely to welcome it unless they are absolutely convinced it's a change for the better.\\n\\nHow Generous Should Coverage Be?\\n\\nNo more copays, no more coinsurance, no more deductibles ― yes, that's right, out-of-pocket spending would basically disappear under the existing Medicare for All proposals. The only exception would be a provision in the Sanders bill that would allow some token cost-sharing to encourage use of generic drugs.\\n\\nThe logic here is that co-pays and deductibles inevitably fall hardest on the sick, because they have higher medical bills, and the poor, because they have less money at their disposal. Research shows that these groups will frequently respond to high out-of-pocket costs by rationing their own treatments and, as a result, suffer.\\n\\nBut zero cost-sharing could also encourage people to get care they don't need, which could mean unnecessary (and potentially harmful) tests and treatments, all while driving up costs throughout the system. Purely from a budgetary standpoint, the federal government would have to spend a lot more money if it's assuming responsibility for every single dollar on every single medical bill for every single American.\\n\\nZero cost-sharing is relatively unusual internationally. Most systems require at least some out-of-pocket spending, although it's usually a lot smaller and waived entirely for the poor and for treatment of cancer, diabetes and other chronic conditions.\\n\\nHow Aggressively Should Government Control Prices?\\n\\nThe reason Medicare for All can provide coverage to everybody, while spending less money, is that the government would regulate prices throughout the health care sector ― not just on prescription drugs, but for doctors and hospitals and everything else.\\n\\nStudies have shown that health care prices in the U.S. are outrageously high by international standards. Knee replacements cost $28,000 on average in the U.S., for example, while they cost $18,000 in the U.K. In a Medicare for All system, the government would force American prices down ― not all the way down to European levels, but enough to get a better handle on costs here.\\n\\nThe big question is how doctors, hospitals, drugmakers and all the other industries related to health care would react. Some would figure out how to become more efficient or live with lower margins. Some would react simply by reducing capacity, right at a moment when millions of newly insured people were seeking it.\\n\\nAnd that's assuming the price cuts would even become law. Even modest proposals to reduce what government programs pay providers and suppliers of medical care generate huge opposition from their lobbying groups. The kind that would come with Medicare for All would likely provoke an all-out war, one for which industry groups are already preparing.\\n\\nA lot would obviously depend on the details ― that is, precisely how low a Medicare for All proposal would push prices and, critically, how long it would take for those reductions to take place. There's a vast difference between cutting hospital rates by 10 percent over three to four years and cutting them by the same margin over seven or eight.\\n\\nHow Should Government Finance The Program?\\n\\nMedicare for All envisions the federal government spending a lot more money on health care than it does today. The government has to find that money ― by raising revenue through taxes or government-imposed premiums, cutting other spending, accepting higher deficits or some combination of the three.\\n\\nThe taxes and premiums would be in lieu of what private individuals and employers pay for insurance today, so that, advocates say, a majority would come out ahead. But exactly how many would depend on the budget arithmetic in the rest of the program. If the cuts in payments to doctors and hospitals aren't deep enough, for example, the whole program would end up more expensive, requiring bigger taxes and swelling the ranks of people who would feel worse off financially.\\n\\nHow Much Can Be Done, And How Quickly?\\n\\nMany Democrats do not support Medicare for All. But at this point even Democrats unwilling to endorse it are frequently calling to expand public insurance programs in some fashion ― if not by creating a new government plan that enrolls everybody, then by opening one of the two big existing programs, Medicare or Medicaid, to more people.\\n\\nOthers are enthusiastic about Medicare for All, but think it would be more practical, as policy and politics, to have a more gradual transition ― for example, by making the new public insurance plan voluntary for individuals and employers, while enrolling newborns so that it gets bigger over time. That's the approach of a new bill from Reps. Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn.) and Jan Schakowsky (D-Ill.).\\n\\nSuch a scheme could also preserve a role for private insurers, providing the same kind of alternative, tightly regulated coverage they do for seniors on Medicare today. Hybrid systems with both public and private insurance are actually pretty common around the world ― and succeed in establishing health care as a right, just as single government programs do.\\n\\nThe most committed Medicare for All advocates believe their approach is better than any of these ― or, at least, a better starting point for debate and negotiation. Over the next two years, they'll get a chance to make their case."}
{"original": "If you're like many 30-year-old Americans, you probably spent your 20s finishing up college, finding your first real job, taking some risks, making connections and hopefully having some fun.\\n\\nNow that you're in your 30s, you're moving into a different realm. These are the years to firmly establish yourself in your career and begin climbing the corporate ladder ― or perhaps breaking out to forge your own way as a millionaire. You may also be thinking about building a life with a partner, having kids and planning for your long-term future.\\n\\nThis is also the period when many fall into major money pitfalls that sap their finances for years ― or even decades ― to come. With so much going on with work and life, it's easy to focus on the here-and-now and put aside your bigger financial goals. However, this will leave you scrambling later in life. Think of this article as a map to help you bypass those monetary gaffes.\\n\\nAvoid these 10 money mistakes in your 30s, and you will set yourself up for financial freedom in your 40s and beyond.\\n\\n1. Carrying too much credit card debt.\\n\\nCredit cards can feel like a solution when you just need a little extra help to get you through to your next paycheck. Credit cards can be a useful tool to help you establish credit and earn points or rewards or allow you to make online purchases. But credit card companies make their money off of your dumb financial mistakes, namely, impulse purchases and buying things you really don't need.\\n\\nIf you don't pay your cards off every month or, worse, if you only make the minimum payment, you will end up paying for those items several times over. Credit cards are infamous for their fees, interest rates and hidden rules in their fine print, and it will be difficult for you to catch up once you fall behind.\\n\\n2. Not diversifying your income.\\n\\nMost of us treat employment like we would a relationship. We are faithful to a single career or a single employer at a time. We pour all of our time and effort into establishing ourselves in our primary place of work and eschew all else. But when it comes to making money, it's okay to have something on the side!\\n\\nIn fact, diversifying your income will give you a backup if something happens, and you find yourself out of your primary job. Think of this as a chance to broaden your interests or explore different areas. There are tons of ways to build a second career or money-making venture on the side. Having more than one source of income means more money to invest and save for future projects.\\n\\n3. Not having a financial plan when you move in with a partner.\\n\\nIt's no shock that more Americans are waiting longer to get married. And more people are living together before marriage, testing out the waters for long-term cohabitation and companionship. It all sounds wonderful ― until you have to decide how to divvy up the bills.\\n\\nOne of the biggest mistakes you can make is not having an honest and open discussion about finances, budgeting, debt and spending habits before you take the plunge and merge your lives. It may feel awkward to have this conversation, but it's important you understand where you are each at financially and how your monetary habits may differ. Getting on the same page will help keep money concerns from overshadowing and affecting your relationship.\\n\\n4. Putting off planning for retirement.\\n\\nIt may be hard to focus on retirement when it's so far off, but your 20s and 30s are the best time to begin growing your nest egg. You should be taking full advantage of your employer's 401(k) plan ― especially if they have a matching program. And take the time to set up an IRA, either a Roth or traditional, and make recurring contributions.\\n\\nThe earlier you start putting money away, the more time you will have to take advantage of the wonder of compounding: it's the most powerful way to make your money work for you. Consider this: if you invest $1,000 a year between the ages of 25 and 35, at approximately 7 percent interest a year, this $10,000 investment will earn you nearly $113,000 by the time you are 65 years old. Not bad, right?\\n\\n5. Overspending on housing expenses.\\n\\nYou can imagine how awesome your life will be when you're living in that apartment with the view of the river. Or how swanky you would feel to live in a trendy, up-and-coming neighborhood. One out of three Americans make this mistake, and live in a housing market where they are spending more than 30 percent of their income on rent.\\n\\nThink of it like this: if you take home $1,000 in income, but spend half on a house, you only have about $33 a day to pay for all the rest of your expenses ― not to mention saving for upcoming purchases or investments. Don't fall into this overspending trap. It will suck away money you could be investing elsewhere and leave you constantly scrambling to cover your expenses.\\n\\n6. Failing to plan for the worst.\\n\\nYou may be feeling invincible right now, but at some point you may get sick or hurt. According to the Social Security Administration, 1 in 4 of today's 20-year olds will become disabled for a period of time before reaching age 67. Most people don't have enough savings to cover months, let alone years, of lost income if they aren't able to work.\\n\\nYou can protect yourself by purchasing long-term disability insurance, which will help cover your income while you are incapacitated, so you can focus on getting better. To insure about 60 percent of your gross income, expect to pay around 2-3 percent of your gross income in annual premiums. Think of this as protection against needing to pull out your investments early or dipping into savings you worked so hard to accumulate.\\n\\n7. Not getting life insurance while it's cheap.\\n\\nNot to be a downer, but eventually we will all meet our demise one way or another. Here's your friendly reminder that there is no time like the present to make estate plans, and that includes making a will and purchasing life insurance.\\n\\nOne important rule of thumb: the younger you are when you buy a life insurance policy, the less you'll pay. The healthier you are, the cheaper and easier it is to get coverage. Jump on this bandwagon while you can. A little forethought will give you peace of mind later. You'll know those you love will be cared for even under the worst of circumstances.\\n\\n8. Not saving money for upcoming expenses.\\n\\nWhile you are busy socking away funds in your retirement accounts, don't forget to set aside money for other big, upcoming expenses. Someday you'd like to own a house, buy a new car, take a trip around the world or help put your kids through college. These major goals come with big price tags that may seem insurmountable, and they could put you in serious debt.\\n\\nBut a little forethought will go a long way toward making these goals a reality ― plus reducing your stress over finances. Set up multiple savings accounts to start setting aside money for specific purchases. Have the money come out through automatic transfers so you won't miss it.\\n\\n9. Overspending on kids.\\n\\nAt some point in life, you may find yourself cradling a bundle of joy ― a tiny person you are willing to do almost anything for to ensure their safety and happiness. For many people, that includes giving them the absolute best of everything, from top-of-the-line nursery furniture to brand-name clothes.\\n\\nA word of caution ― check your spending before your money disappears into a puff of toys, gadgets and baby accessories. Does your bouncing baby really need that fancy stroller? Or would it be more helpful for you all in the long run if that money went into an investment fund or savings account ― or went to pay off debt? Don't let emotions rule your purchases, for baby or for you.\\n\\n10. Expecting a standard of living beyond your reach.\\n\\nNo matter your age, it's easy to covet all the great new things other people seem to have. Many of us have gotten caught up in keeping up with the Joneses. But this game isn't sustainable and doesn't result in long-term happiness. Trying to keep up with someone else's standards isn't going to get you anywhere.\\n\\nAnother pitfall is expecting to live at the same level as your parents are at this phase in your life. Remember that your parents have (hopefully) spent decades accumulating their wealth. You will get there too, if you keep your expectations in check and don't spend beyond your means now.\\n\\nThis column was originally published on Entrepreneur.com on March 29, 2017."}
{"original": "I have two pressing questions about which I need your help. The two might appear to be unrelated but what ties them together is an Islamophobic radio host who works for a group on the Southern Poverty Law Center's list of hate groups.\\n\\nHere they are:\\n\\nIs it acceptable to lie if you're lying for Jesus? What's the opposite of plagiarism?\\n\\nThese two questions stem from comments that Bryan Fischer made on his radio show last week. Drawing on his background as a pastor, he proudly discussed how he fought a knucklehead member of the Boise city council who wanted to remove a statue commemorating the Ten Commandments from a city park. Although Fischer failed and the statue was removed because of the establishment clause of the first amendment of the US Constitution, now, years later, he's still angry.\\n\\nFischer tied this event to his antipathy for those with religious beliefs different from his and claimed that unless someone is devoted to Jesus Christ and to the public acknowledgement of the Ten Commandments, s/he is a traitor.\\n\\nAlluding to George Washington's Farewell Address as his source, Fischer said:\\n\\n\\n\\nGeorge Washington said, Look, a guy cannot be considered a patriot, he cannot be considered a patriotic American, if he labors to subvert either Christianity or the Ten Commandments. The essence of what it means to be a patriot, according to George Washington, the definition of patriotism, the essence of patriotism, is a man who is a sincerely devoted follower of Jesus Christ and seeks to live his life by the Ten Commandments, who adheres to Christianity and to the Ten Commandments. That is the definition and the mark and the hallmark of a patriot.\\n\\nHe concludes with the following amazing statement: You want to find a traitor to your country, find somebody who is actively working to oppose Christianity and oppose the public acknowledgment of the Ten Commandments. You are looking, my friend, right there at an American traitor.\\n\\nHere's the full audio clip to show you I'm not making this up!\\n\\nThe fact is, however, that George Washington never said what Fischer claimed he said. In his Farewell Address, Washington made a far more generic point. He said, Of all the dispositions and habits which lead to political prosperity, Religion and morality are indispensable supports. In vain would that man claim the tribute of Patriotism, who should labour to subvert these great Pillars of human happiness, these firmest props of the duties of Men & citizens. Hardly the rousing defense of Jesus Christ Fischer claims.\\n\\nSimilarly, in his 1790 Letter to Touro Synagogue, Washington said something in direct opposition to what Fischer claims. In response to a letter from Moses Seixas, warden of the Touro Synagogue in Newport, Rhode Island, looking for assurance of religious freedom for Jews, Washington demonstrated a very different understanding of good citizenship and patriotism than that offered by Fischer:\\n\\nThe Citizens of the United States of America have a right to applaud themselves for having given to mankind examples of an enlarged and liberal policy: a policy worthy of imitation. All possess alike liberty of conscience and immunities of citizenship. It is now no more that toleration is spoken of, as if it was by the indulgence of one class of people, that another enjoyed the exercise of their inherent natural rights. For happily the Government of the United States, which gives to bigotry no sanction, to persecution no assistance requires only that they who live under its protection should demean themselves as good citizens, in giving it on all occasions their effectual support.\\n\\nSo, no, Washington certainly didn't claim that only a sincerely devoted follower of Jesus Christ can be a patriot. And, no, you can't look to someone's religion to decide if that person is a traitor.\\n\\nFischer has a penchant for castigating those with religious beliefs that differ from his. One example will make this point. In a piece he published a while back entitled Islam and the First Amendment: privileges but not rights, Fischer claimed From a constitutional point of view, Muslims have no First Amendment right to build mosques in America.\\n\\nWhile Fischer might well be a bigot, he's certainly not an idiot. He has to know that his claims about Washington are untrue and that point returns me to my two questions.\\n\\nYears ago, I was ambushed by Ken Ham, the head of Answers in Genesis, the organization in charge of the two Kentucky creationist theme parks called The Creation Museum and Ark Encounter, when I agreed to do an interview on a fundamentalist Christian radio show. To my surprise, Ken was on the show ready to debate me. As I wrote years ago, When asked why neither the host nor Ken had the courtesy to inform me that I was to participate in a debate rather than in an interview, I was told that they believed that I wouldn't have accepted their offer had I been told the truth. When I questioned them about the deception, I was told that since the debate was to further God's wishes, a minor deception of this sort was acceptable.\\n\\nWhat Ham did seems similar to what Fischer has done: deceiving or lying to, in their minds, further God's wishes. If this sort of behavior is acceptable, what, really, does it mean to be a Christian?\\n\\nWe all know that plagiarism means taking of someone else's words or ideas and claiming them as your own. What is it called when you take your own words and claim that they were uttered by someone else? What is the appropriate terminology for the reverse of plagiarism, for this is exactly what Bryan Fischer did and he has to know it.\\n\\nEven in our post-factual world, such behavior has to be considered unacceptable."}

{"original": "George Frey via Getty Images Russell M. Nelson, 93, the new president of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, greets family members after a press conference on Tuesday in Salt Lake City.\\n\\nThe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has officially named Russell M. Nelson as its 17th president.\\n\\nSpeaking to reporters at a news conference, Nelson characterized his selection as sacred and humbling.\\n\\nHe also paid tribute to his predecessor, Thomas Monson, who died at the age of 90 on Jan. 2. He had served as president since 2008.\\n\\nNo words can do justice to the magnitude and magnificence of his life, Nelson said.\\n\\nAt 93, Nelson is the second-oldest person in the 187-year-old church's history to become president.\\n\\nWatch a recording of the announcement below.\\n\\nNelson has been temporarily presiding over the church since his predecessor's death. He was ordained for his new position during a religious ceremony on Sunday.\\n\\nThe president of the Mormon church is believed to be a living prophet able to receive divine revelations from God. Succession is based strictly on seniority. Nelson was the longest-serving member of a church body known as the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, which meant that he was next in line for the role of president. He became part of the Quorum in 1984.\\n\\nDuring the broadcast, Nelson announced that he had chosen two counselors to stand beside him in the First Presidency, the church's highest governing body. As First Counselor, he chose Dallin H. Oaks, who has long been part of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles and is next in line to be president. As Second Counselor, Nelson chose Henry B. Eyring, who served in the First Presidency under Monson.\\n\\nGeorge Frey via Getty Images President Russell M. Nelson of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints with his wife, Wendy L. Watson Nelson.\\n\\nGiven the church's succession process, it's unlikely the arrival of a new president will mean changes in how it approaches topics that have caused it controversy in recent years, such as queer sexuality and women in leadership roles.\\n\\nThis became apparent when, after the presidency announcement, Nelson and his counselors fielded questions from reporters about the church's future and vision.\\n\\nOne reporter asked about outreach to queer Mormons, many of whom have said they feel ostracized by the church. In November 2015, the church adopted a policy that deemed same-sex couples apostates. It also prohibited children of these couples from getting blessed or baptized until they were 18 years old, at which point they need to disavow their parents' marriage in order to join the church.\\n\\nNelson said that while God loves all his children and wants them to have joy, there are certain challenges associated with following God's commandments ― challenges to be worthy to enter his holy presence.\\n\\nOaks was a bit more explicit in his response, suggesting that believers need to follow God's commandments in order to receive blessings.\\n\\nAs leaders of the church we have a responsibility to teach love and also to teach the commandments of God, Oaks said.\\n\\nGeorge Frey via Getty Images Russell M. Nelson (center), First Counselor Dallin H. Oaks (left), and Second Counselor Henry B. Eyring (right) answer press questions after Nelson was announced as the 17th president of the Mormon Church.\\n\\nJana Riess, a Mormon blogger, said that the subtext of both men's remarks seemed to be a reiteration of the Church's position that homosexual behavior is in violation of God's commandments, but that all people are loved.\\n\\nShe also suggested it's unlikely that the First Presidency's traditional responses to concerns about women's leadership and minority representation in the church will be satisfactory to Mormons with questions about these issues.\\n\\nThese will be issues to watch in the months going forward, as the new First Presidency defines its mission and eventual legacy, Riess wrote in a blog for Religion News Service."}
{"original": "By Yasmeen Abutaleb\\n\\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration said on Thursday it would allow states to test requiring some Medicaid recipients to work or participate in community activities such as volunteering or jobs training as a condition of eligibility for the government health insurance program for the poor.\\n\\nThe Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services issued guidance making it easier for states to design and propose test programs that implement such requirements. States must propose such changes through waivers and receive federal approval.\\n\\nSeema Verma, the agency's administrator, said the policy guidance came in response to requests from at least 10 states that have proposed requiring some Medicaid recipients to work or participate in activities that may include skills training, education, job search, volunteering or caregiving. Those states include Kentucky, Maine, New Hampshire, Arizona, Indiana and Utah.\\n\\nCertain Medicaid populations would be exempt from the rules, including those with disabilities, the elderly, children and pregnant women. Verma also said states would have to make reasonable modifications for those battling opioid addiction and other substance use disorders.\\n\\nThis gives us a pathway to start approving waivers, Verma said on a call with reporters on Wednesday. This is about helping those individuals rise out of poverty.\\n\\nUnder the 2010 Affordable Care Act, former Democratic President Barack Obama's signature domestic policy achievement commonly known as Obamacare, 31 states expanded Medicaid to those making up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level, adding millions of people to the rolls.\\n\\nRepublicans have repeatedly failed to repeal and replace Obamacare, a top campaign promise of President Donald Trump. Instead, the Trump administration has sought to weaken the program through executive orders and administrative rules.\\n\\nThe Obama administration opposed state efforts to implement work requirements in Medicaid because it could result in fewer people having access to health insurance.\\n\\nFor instance, Kentucky last year proposed work requirements for able-bodied adults to get insurance and establishing new fees for all members based on income. A study found the proposal would reduce the number of residents on Medicaid by nearly 86,000 within five years, saving more than $330 million.\\n\\nRepublicans argue that Medicaid was created to serve the most vulnerable and has become bloated under Obamacare. Verma and other Republicans said implementing work and community engagement requirements could help improve health outcomes by connecting people with jobs and training.\\n\\n(Reporting by Yasmeen Abutaleb; Editing by Peter Cooney)\\n\\nChip Somodevilla via Getty Images"}
{"original": "More than 20 years ago I received an assignment to go to Oklahoma City after the bombing of the Alfred E. Murrah Federal Building. Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols conspired to destroy a symbol of government power -- without regard for human life.\\n\\nOne-hundred-sixty-eight people were killed and 680 injured in that incident.\\n\\nThe people of Oklahoma City asked themselves, Why? and especially, Why here?\\n\\nJannie Coverdale lost her two grandchildren, Elijah and Aaron, in the blast.\\n\\nJim Denny could only identify his 3-year-old son Brandon by a birthmark on the boy's thigh when he arrived at the hospital.\\n\\nOne of the victims, Rebecca Anderson, was a licensed practical nurse who rushed to the bomb site immediately after hearing the explosion. She was probably the finest woman God ever put on this earth, her husband, Fred Anderson, said.\\n\\nIn the weeks that followed, investigators determined that the killers had links with militia groups throughout the country. The militias and paramilitary organizations sought a New World Order and to create division within the country based on racial heritage or country of origin. All in the name of our constitutional freedoms.\\n\\nScenes of bloodshed also played out in Waco, Texas, and Ruby Ridge, Idaho, where extremists and the federal government dueled in deadly standoffs.\\n\\nLittle has changed since that time -- in fact, some militia members have been emboldened by rhetoric in Congress.\\n\\nOregon's Rep. Greg Walden, in urging clemency for Dwight and Steven Hammond -- the ranchers jailed for arson on federal property -- spoke angrily on the House floor of his constituents' tension, frustration and anger over federal land management policies.\\n\\nThese are words that inflame emotions, not soothe them. Any sympathy for armed rebellion in Harney County is misplaced.\\n\\nThe lesson I'm learning in Oregon is many good people want to help the Hammonds but not the Bundys.\\n\\nOur sister paper, the East Oregonian, wisely notes residents in the sparsely populated high desert area are largely rebuffing the militant Ammon Bundy and his followers.\\n\\nThe real question is how that land should be managed and how grazing and natural resource extraction will remain viable and part of the multiple use doctrine that historically governed public lands, the East Oregonian writes. Government policy once fostered the timber, livestock and mining industries that became the economic lifeblood of rural Western communities. Current policy -- the result of environmental lawsuits and regulatory and legislative changes -- is largely responsible for draining that lifeblood.\\n\\nOn the coast, we may be far from Harney County, but many of the same issues prevail. We have thousands of acres of timber and coastal land. We have a federal government overseeing and considering approval of a billion dollar pipeline over the will of impassioned citizens of all political persuasions. We have conflicts between Native Americans and management of their tribal lands. Fishermen face national and international regulations that may, to their eyes, defy logic.\\n\\nAll these issues must be vigorously debated and legislated. But nuance doesn't play well in a crisis. The words good and evil are so strictly defined by each of us in our own way that it's almost impossible to accept shades of gray. Extremism triumphs.\\n\\nEvents like the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge occupation only set back the conversation -- there is little value to legislation from the barrel of a gun or in the aftermath of tragedy.\\n\\nThe bombing of the Murrah Federal Building seems long ago and far away, but the lives lost in Oklahoma City in 1995 are irreplaceable.\\n\\nThe Oklahoma City blast had repercussions that went far beyond the death toll, we wrote in 1995. The American people suddenly got a glimpse of a new terrorist threat -- a threat from within.\\n\\nThe antigovernment movement has experienced a resurgence since 2008, when President Obama was elected, writes the Southern Poverty Law Center. Factors fueling the movement include changing demographics driven by immigration, a struggling economy and the election of the first African-American president.\\n\\nThe inspiration provided by many in the militia movement is no more of a divine message than that of the jihadists.\\n\\nWe conclude with this message from the Oregon State Police, who issued this statement last Wednesday, on behalf of all 36 sheriff offices in the state. The sheriffs of Oregon are united in the support of Harney County and its residents. We are supplying logistical and operational support to the community while the FBI works for a peaceful resolution with the militants at the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge, they said. We want the good people of Harney County and the state of Oregon to know that we will always unite to provide support and assistance to ensure the safety of our residents, for any length of time, whenever criminal activity or an emergency, fractures the peace and security in our communities.\\n\\nIt is those men and women, and all those on the front lines of our nation's defense, who are our real constitutional heroes."}

The move would alleviate what can be devastating personal and professional consequences for those convicted.\\n\\nI can't emphasize enough how much a conviction affects a person's life the moment it happens. Almost every application they fill out will ask, 'Have you ever been convicted of a crime?' Mayor Jenny Durkan said at the conference. While we cannot reverse all the harm that was done, we can give back to those people a record that says they were not convicted.\\n\\nIn an op-ed published earlier in the day, the mayor said the failed war on drugs had a clear racial bias and disproportionately targeted and impacted communities of color in our state.\\n\\nShe pointed to a 2012 Washington State University report showing that although white people in the state use marijuana at a slightly higher rate than black and Latino people, they are arrested far less. Black people were arrested at 2.9 times the rate of white people between 1986 and 2010. Latinos and Native Americans were arrested at 1.6 times the rate of white people.\\n\\nToday, @CityAttyPeteH & I are announcing that our City will move to vacate convictions & dismiss charges for misdemeanor marijuana possession.

People's lives were ruined for misdemeanor marijuana offenses. Too many here in our community faced huge legal bills and fines, or had a harder time getting loans, apartments, and good-paying jobs.\\n\\nSeattle's decision comes after San Francisco prosecutors announced plans late last month to wipe out marijuana convictions dating back to 1975.\\n\\nSan Francisco prosecutors announced a plan to dismiss and seal more than 3,000 misdemeanor cases, as well as to dismiss or reduce nearly 5,000 felony marijuana convictions. (Durkan and Holmes said they are not able to change felony convictions in their city.) California voted to legalize marijuana in 2016. The state included a legal avenue for people with past convictions to see them erased, but the process was not widely known and sometimes required costly attorneys.\\n\\nNow, neither Seattle nor San Francisco will require people to take any action on their past convictions.\\n\\nNine states and Washington, D.C., have legalized marijuana, and voters are viewing legalization with increasing favorability ― meaning many other areas face questions on what to do about past convictions that no longer conform to policy.\\n\\nThis article has been updated with details from Thursday's press conference."}

Unions want the policy extended across the whole of England, expressing fears about the health of both teachers and children.\\n\\nThe U.K. on Saturday hit a daily record for new coronavirus infections — 57,725 — and according to figures compiled by Johns Hopkins University has overtaken Italy once again to be the worst hit country in Europe with nearly 75,000 COVID-related deaths.\\n\\nThe fear is that the number of deaths will grow over the coming weeks.

It also told members they have a legal right not to have to work in an unsafe environment of accelerating coronavirus cases, hospital admissions and deaths.\\n\\nWe are doing our job as a union by informing our members that they have a legal right to refuse to work in unsafe conditions which are a danger to their health and to the health of their school communities, said Kevin Courtney, the union's joint general secretary.\\n\\nAnother union representing teachers, the NASUWT, also called for an immediate nationwide move to remote education due to virus safety concerns. Its general secretary, Patrick Roach, said there is genuine concern that schools and colleges are not able to reopen safely at this time.\\n\\nThe NASUWT will not hesitate to take appropriate action in order to protect members whose safety is put at risk as a result of the failure of employers or the government to ensure safe working conditions in schools and colleges, he said.\\n\\nThe government's own Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies warned at a Dec. 22 meeting that schools needed to stay closed to bring down virus transmission rates.\\n\\nThe U.K. is struggling with a sharp spike in new cases as a result of a new virus variant that officials said could be up to 70% more infectious.\\n\\nThe variant has been particularly prevalent in London and in surrounding areas, prompting Education Secretary Gavin Williamson to row back on plans to allow some primary schools — those for children 11 and under — in the capital to reopen as scheduled on Jan. 4.\\n\\nMost other primary schools in England are still scheduled to open on Monday. High school reopenings have already been delayed for millions of students, with exam-year pupils scheduled to return on Jan. 11 and others a week later.\\n\\nWith many British hospitals at or near capacity, there are growing concerns over how the already stretched National Health Service will cope with people seeking treatment for COVID-19 after getting infected over the holidays. Field hospitals that were built last spring but were then mothballed are getting outfitted again to take in patients.\\n\\nOn the inoculations front, Britain began vaccinating people over 80 and health care workers on Dec. 8 with the Pfizer-BioNTech coronavirus vaccine. Last week, the government approved another vaccine made by Oxford University and pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca that is cheaper and easier to use.\\n\\nThe U.K. plans to ramp up vaccinations on Monday using the vaccine developed by the University of Oxford and pharmaceutical firm AstraZeneca, and has set a goal of vaccinating 2 million people a week as soon as possible.\\n\\nThe Princess Royal Hospital in Haywards Heath in southern England was one of the first to get the newly approved vaccine on Saturday.\\n\\nSo whilst it's really difficult, and staff are under pressure, the hospitals are coping and we are still providing care to everybody who needs it, said Dr. George Findlay, the trust's chief medical officer.\\n\\nMore than a million people in the U.K. have already received their first jab of the Pfizer vaccine.\\n\\nBritain plans to give second doses of both vaccines within 12 weeks rather than the 21 days initially planned, to accelerate immunizations across as many people as quickly as possible."}

The Eurosceptic European Research Group of Brexiteer MPs has already pledged its support.\\n\\nBut even if the motion fails on Wednesday night, the Labour leader is perfectly free to try again at a point when he feels he can get more success.\\n\\nHis spokesman pointed to the 1970s when it took six confidence votes to unseat the sitting government: There have been situations in the past where there have been no confidence votes which haven't succeeded on the first occasion.\\n\\nThe appetite among Tory MPs to think the unthinkable – triggering a general election that could damage their party – may increase if parliament looks like it is heading for a no-deal Brexit on March 29.\\n\\nTime is running out, however. Under the Electoral Registration and Administration Act 2013, 25 working days are needed for an election campaign. So MPs really have until mid-February to act, if they are to hold polling day before the UK quits the EU.\\n\\nIn reality, an extension to Article 50 – the two-year legal timetable for Brexit – would be needed to allow more time for negotiations with the new government.\\n\\nCan Brexit be stopped?\\n\\nThe only way Brexit can realistically be halted is if MPs either back a second EU referendum, or if there is a general election in which Labour campaigns to Remain in the EU, and wins.\\n\\nSoon after the Leave result in 2016, many dismissed as ridiculous the idea that Britons could be asked to somehow re-run the referendum.\\n\\nBut backers of a so-called 'people's vote' have stepped up a highly successful campaign since last summer, claiming that the public have a right to endorse or reject the kind of Brexit the government has finally drafted.\\n\\nThe campaign got its biggest ever boost when Labour adopted a new policy last September. If we cannot get a general election, Labour must support all options remaining on the table, including campaigning for a public vote, the policy stated.\\n\\nYet Jeremy Corbyn's closest aides stress that a public vote is just one option and not the default or preferred option.\\n\\nSome Labour MPs suspect Corbyn will do everything possible to avoid holding a new referendum, partly because of worries about Leave voters in Labour's marginal and heartland seats. Others, like shadow chancellor John McDonnell, seem to be holding open the option more strongly.\\n\\nThe real problem is one of numbers. Although a sprinkling of Tory MPs (and even ministers privately) back the idea, there are so far not enough MPs overall to give a 'people's vote' amendment a majority.\\n\\nEven if MPs opted to back one, legal requirements on impartiality mean it could take at least a year to hold a new referendum. Again, Article 50 would need to be extended. And to actually win, any Remain referendum campaign would have to enthuse voters in a way it failed in 2016.\\n\\nCuriously, seconds after the government's defeat was announced, European Council President Donald Tusk took to Twitter to suggest the UK should stay in the EU, arguing the prime minister's historic loss in parliament left a deal looking impossible. He kept open the idea of Brexit being reversed.\\n\\nWill May try again?\\n\\nThe scale of the defeat – truly catastrophic rather than merely awful as some whips had hoped – makes it very difficult to see how May can win over rebels by merely tweaking her defeated deal.\\n\\nSome 118 Tory MPs voted against her plan - almost exactly the same number of MPs who voted to oust her as party leader (117) last month.\\n\\nThat suggests she may have to rely on Labour MPs to get any deal through Parliament.\\n\\nCrucially, she said May would hold meetings with senior Parliamentarians from across the House to identify what would be required to secure the backing of the House. These secret talks will start from Thursday.\\n\\nUnder the EU Withdrawal Bill, May is legally required to come up with a full statement within three days. No.10 said it expects her to make that statement on Monday and table a new Brexit motion at the same time.\\n\\nShe then has some breathing space of up to seven 'sitting days' of the Commons (January 30), before MPs vote again on any new deal. Sources suggest the fresh vote would take place later next week.\\n\\nMay desperately needs something new to persuade both Tory and DUP MPs that the UK won't be locked indefinitely into the controversial Northern Ireland backstop, the link to EU trade regulations aimed at keeping the border with Ireland open.\\n\\nThat something may be a new UK-EU joint legislative document that clarifies in law that Britain will not be tied to Brussels rules without end. The EU has made clear it won't renegotiate the withdrawal agreement for Brexit, but it might grant this concession to avoid a no-deal.\\n\\nHowever, with a massive number of her own MPs against her, May's 'Plan B' can't really be 'Plan A-plus'. She has a nightmare balancing act now: offer Labour MPs too much and she risks further bleeding Tory support; offer Tory MPs too much and the EU will never accept it.\\n\\nShe's a zombie PM in a zombie Parliament, and may get only one more time to resurrect her deal from the dead.\\n\\nWill MPs back a softer Brexit?\\n\\nA so-called 'Norway-style' Brexit is being pushed by some Labour and Tory backbenchers. It aims to keep the UK in the EU single market, ensuring free trade to continue on services, which makes up 80% of the UK economy.\\n\\nThe plan also aims to achieve a customs union with the EU, a key element that would remove the problem of the Northern Irish border.\\n\\nFor some MPs there are major downsides, not least that the single market would mean no new curbs on EU migration, something many Leave voters have demanded. A customs union would also mean the UK couldn't strike its own free trade deals independently of Brussels.\\n\\nBoth of these are 'red lines' for the PM and many Tory MPs who think it would mean 'Brexit in name only' (also known as 'Brino'). But if May's own deal is rejected repeatedly she may have no choice.\\n\\nStraight after the defeat, a No.10 spokesman said May's talks with MPs would take place on the 'basis' of her current deal, with the 'principles' being that the UK took control of its 'money, borders and laws' and retained an 'independent trade policy'.\\n\\nEach of those 'red line' principles may have to be erased. An independent trade policy is impossible if May supports a customs union. Control of borders is very difficult if she backs a single market.\\n\\nA 'Norway-style' Brexit would need more negotiation with Brussels and probably therefore an extension to Article 50. Some argue, however, that because the plan makes the Northern Ireland backstop irrelevant, May's withdrawal agreement could pass and the 'political declaration' tweaked instead.\\n\\nThe main attraction of 'Norway Plus' for Labour MPs, possibly including Jeremy Corbyn, is that it is consistent with his pledge at the last election to uphold the 2016 referendum result. Tories would have to swallow a lot, however, to accept it.\\n\\nWill the Commons get to choose which 'Plan B' it wants?\\n\\nThe real action on Brexit talks between May and other parties starts next week. MPs held off proposing their alternatives today because they wanted a clear signal that May's deal was dead first.\\n\\nIt is now up to them to work out which 'Plan B' can get a majority, with detailed amendments to the government's next motion. But tactics will come into play too.\\n\\nSupporters of the rival plans for a 'Norway-style' Brexit and a second referendum want their solution to be the last one standing after all the other options have failed.\\n\\nOn this, as on many other matters of procedure, the Speaker of the Commons suddenly assumes even more importance than usual.\\n\\nThanks to a hung parliament tying the government's hands and to his own decision to tear up previous conventions, John Bercow is now a very important figure. He may, for example, refuse to allow May to keep bringing back her deal several times.\\n\\nThere is one other option: the PM could proactively agree to demands from some of her Cabinet ministers to hold a series of 'indicative' votes on each of the options. But No.10 sources suggest that's unlikely.\\n\\nAre we heading for a no-deal Brexit?\\n\\nUnder the EU Withdrawal Act 2018, the default position is that the UK will leave the EU on March 29, 2019 – with or without any agreement.\\n\\nMany Tory Brexiteers have hoped that they can thus run down the clock while the Commons squabbles over Brexit, and just wait for exit day to arrive.\\n\\nTheresa May's language has changed dramatically on this in the past two years. In January 2017, she uttered the infamous line that no deal is better than a bad deal. Having lost the last election, she's been forced to now effectively threaten Tory MPs that my bad deal is better than no Brexit at all.\\n\\nSome Cabinet ministers say that May has also changed tack after reading detailed forecasts from civil servants setting out the full disaster for trade, and, crucially, security policy if we quit without a deal.\\n\\nLabour has long argued no-deal is a negotiating bluff, and despite billions being spent on emergency contingency plans, it looks very much like a bluff now.\\n\\nYet the only way to be sure to halt no-deal is if parliament gives May no choice politically, and possibly legally. That's why Nick Boles' new EU Withdrawal Bill is being seized on as a way through the logjam. It could 'instruct' May to choose whatever 'Plan B' the Commons agrees on."}
{"original": "UPDATE: Jan. 19, 2018 ― Larry Nassar pleaded guilty to 10 counts of first-degree criminal sexual conduct in November 2017. He faces up to 125 years in prison. More than 100 women read statements at his sentencing hearing about the effects of his abusive behavior.\\n\\nPREVIOUSLY:\\n\\nLast month, Larry Nassar, a longtime doctor for USA Gymnastics and Michigan State University, was charged with sexually assaulting dozens of girls and women he has treated over the past 20 years.\\n\\nThe girls and women in the case, most of them current and former competitive gymnasts, accuse him of using his medical practice to sexually assault them, digitally penetrating them without gloves or lubricant and fondling their breasts and buttocks — often while visibly aroused. Some of the girls were as young as 9 years old when the alleged abuse began, and at least one claimant, a parent, reported that her daughter was assaulted while she, her mother, was in the room.\\n\\nThere are still accusers coming forward.\\n\\nOf course, Nassar isn't the first beloved and much revered sports figure to have intimate access to young people and take advantage of them. Penn State assistant football coach Jerry Sandusky spent years sexually abusing boys in a charitable program.\\n\\nBut where the Sandusky case and Nassar case differ are the numbers. Sandusky was accused of assaulting 30 boys. Nassar is accused of sexually assaulting more than 100 girls and women.\\n\\nIn the gymnastics world, among fans and athletes, the Nassar story is the story. In the community it's everywhere you look, said Lauren Hopkins, who runs the gymnastics site The Gymternet, in an interview with The Huffington Post. The popular gymnastics podcast Gymcastic has covered the story extensively; four of the last five episodes have been about sexual abuse in the sport.\\n\\nYet the story has barely broken through from the gym world into mainstream sports coverage, let alone prime-time news. The Indy Star and some Michigan papers have been doggedly covering developments in the case. The Wall Street Journal has run several stories, and 60 Minutes did an interview with several accusers. The New York Times ran a single column the day after the hearing and two op-ed pieces, but otherwise the case has garnered relatively little national coverage when compared with similar stories. If Sandusky and Bill Cosby are anything to go by, this story should be in everyone's news feed and on everyone's mind. But it isn't. Why not?\\n\\nGymnastics is not football. Devoted though gymnastics fans are, they are far fewer in number than football fans, and no sport in America compares to football's monetary value. The NFL is a $7 billion-a-year industry, and football is a fixture of Sunday afternoons ― and Friday nights, and Saturday afternoons and some Monday nights. Also some Thursdays.\\n\\nM.E. Karns, a senior lecturer in the Department of Social Statistics at Cornell University and an advocate for survivors of sexual violence, agrees, saying in an interview with HuffPost that, with wildly popular sports like football and basketball, there's a ridiculous amount of identification with these sports. She added that there isn't the same widespread devotion to gymnastics.\\n\\nFootball is also synonymous with America in a way gymnastics is not. Football is culturally dominant. The result is that allegations made against football players and coaches ― Sandusky, for instance ― are far more likely to grab the attention of sports journalists and fans than are stories about gymnastics.\\n\\nThe demographics of sports journalism plays a role, too. A recent report by the Women's Media Center found that 89 percent of sports reporters are men, and women make up fewer than 10 percent of assistant sports editors.\\n\\nSports media is the malest and palest of them all, said sports journalist Jessica Luther in an interview with HuffPost.\\n\\nLuther, the author of Unsportsmanlike Conduct, a book about sexual assault and college football, says that the Sandusky case may have garnered more attention because the victims were boys, and the male editors and reporters might have more empathy for the victims. They can see themselves as someone who could be abused, she said. Most [sports journalists] won't see themselves that way with gymnastics.\\n\\nHopkins, the editor of Gymternet, says that even gymnastics journalists have been leery of asking too many questions of USA Gymnastics, coaches and gymnasts. At a national meet in March, Hopkins says, no one asked any of the coaches questions about the case.\\n\\nMainstream media people, she said, have been bizarrely quiet, shuffling around the issue. She said she believes that journalists fear losing access to coaches and athletes.\\n\\nLuther also argues that the uproar over what Sandusky did to dozens of boys was not actually about Sandusky, and it wasn't actually about those boys. I don't really know that people cared about the boys as much as they cared about the institution of Penn State football and Joe Paterno, she said, referring to the longtime head coach who was fired amid the scandal.\\n\\nPart of what fueled that case was everyone's idea of Paterno, she said. They felt like they knew him, and people had already decided that he was a very good man. Did people care about Sandusky? I don't know, outside of his relationship to Paterno.\\n\\nLuther's experience of covering rape allegations against college football players, she said, has taught her that when the athlete is in a high-profile program, media coverage and public engagement are far more likely.\\n\\nThere were football people rioting because they were so upset that [Paterno] got fired, she said. Luther argued that those protests had nothing to do with Sandusky or the victims. Rather, it was about the fear of what would happen to a beloved institution fans had supported for decades.\\n\\nRebecca O'Connor, vice president for public policy at the Rape, Abuse and Incest National Network (RAINN), says that she's not surprised by the lack of widespread attention to the Nassar case. The institution of Penn State football and the celebrity of Bill Cosby provided the spotlight necessary to make those cases front-page news.\\n\\nSometimes it does take a level of notoriety and heightened awareness to really turn people's heads.\\n\\nSign up for the HuffPost Must Reads newsletter.

{"original": "Voters approved Proposition 64 in 2016 to legalize marijuana for recreational purposes and reduce criminal penalties for various marijuana-related offenses for adults and juveniles. But the law did more than legalize marijuana, it also authorized a new process for individuals in the state to get previous marijuana-related convictions retroactively reduced, reclassified as lesser offenses or cleared altogether.\\n\\nAnd while the relief for past convictions is a component built into California's new marijuana laws, the process is not automatic or well-known. Individuals with past marijuana convictions must know the relief exists, petition the courts themselves to file the appropriate paperwork and may need to retain an attorney to do so. The process can be time consuming and costly. Gascón's approach, however, is novel because no action is required from eligible individuals with past marijuana convictions to take advantage of the law. His office is applying the relief process on its own.\\n\\nCalifornia produces vast amounts of marijuana and has done so for years. In 1996, it became the first state to legalize medical marijuana. And despite the passage of more permissive laws, there were still thousands of marijuana-related arrests annually. From 2006 to 2015, there were nearly 500,000 people arrested for marijuana offenses, a recent Drug Policy Alliance report found. And Rodney Holcombe, a legal fellow at DPA, said that there may be close to 1 million people in the state who have convictions that could now be eligible for relief.\\n\\nAcross the state, only about 5,000 people have so far applied to have their marijuana sentences reviewed for possible relief, according to data compiled by the Judicial Council of California. In San Francisco specifically, only 23 petitions for reduction or sentencing clearing have been filed over the past year, according to Gascón's office (the office has no active marijuana prosecutions).\\n\\nSan Francisco city and county officials have found that the black community has been over-represented in marijuana-related arrests in the region. In a study from the city's Human Rights Commission on the effects of marijuana policy in the region, between 1999-2000, arrests of African-Americans for marijuana-related offenses jumped from 34 to 41 percent, despite black San Franciscans comprising of less than 8 percent of the population in 2000. In 2011, after penalties for marijuana possession was downgraded from a misdemeanor in San Francisco, 50 percent marijuana-related arrests were of African-Americans, while they represented just 6 percent of the region's population in 2010.\\n\\nThis example, one of many across our state, underscores the true promise of Proposition 64 ― providing new hope and opportunities to Californians, primarily people of color, whose lives were long ago derailed by a costly, broken and racially discriminatory system of marijuana criminalization, Lieutenant Governor Gavin Newsom said in a statement. This isn't just an urgent issue of social justice here in California – it's a model for the rest of the nation."}

{"original": "President Joe Biden has issued an executive order extending a pause on federal student loan payments.\\n\\nThe order, which covers the vast majority of all federal student loans, will allow borrowers to defer payments without penalty and reset interest rates to zero.\\n\\nPresident Joe Biden on Wednesday issued an executive order to extend a pause on federal student loan payments through at least the end of September 2021.\\n\\nA pause on payments first went into effect as the coronavirus pandemic began in March 2020, and was extended in December to expire on Jan. 31. Borrowers were able to defer payments without penalty and reset interest rates to zero.\\n\\nBiden advisers had made it clear ahead of the inauguration that the incoming president intended to issue such an order immediately. The order covers the vast majority of federal student loans, but excludes some federally guaranteed loans that are held by a private lender.\\n\\nOn Day 1, the president-elect will direct the Department of Education to extend the existing pause on student-loan payments and interest for millions of Americans with federal student loans, David Kamin, deputy director of the National Economic Council in the Biden administration, previously told reporters.\\n\\nKamin also told reporters at the time that Biden would like Congress to work to cancel $10,000 in debt for all federal student loan borrowers, but did not provide details on other actions the president could take or would like to see. Other leaders within the Democratic Party, including Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), have pushed for canceling $50,000 in debt for all student loan borrowers through executive order.\\n\\nIt is unclear how Biden's pick for education secretary, Miguel Cardona, feels about student debt cancellation and related issues. Cardona, who has spent his career working in and around K-12 schools, most recently served as the education commissioner for the state of Connecticut.\\n\\nDonald Trump's secretary of education, Betsy DeVos, wrote a letter to congressional leaders before she left office, urging them not to cancel student loans or expand free college.\\n\\nI hope you also reject misguided calls to make college 'free' and require the two-thirds of Americans who didn't take on student debt or who responsibly paid off their student loans to pay for the loans of those who have not done the same, DeVos wrote in a letter addressed to then-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. Across-the-board forgiveness of college debts is not only unfair to most Americans, it is also the most regressive of policy proposals – rewarding the wealthiest sector of our labor force at the expense of the poorest."}
{"original": "In anticipation of the second annual International Day of Women and Girls in Science, celebrated on Saturday, February 11, The U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres said in a press release: For too long, discriminatory stereotypes have prevented women and girls from having equal access to education in science, technology, engineering and maths ... On this International Day, I urge commitment to end bias, greater investments in science, technology, engineering and math education for all women and girls, as well as opportunities for their careers and longer-term professional advancement, so that all can benefit from their ground-breaking future contributions.\\n\\nThe International Day of Women and Girls in Science was created on December 22, 2015, at the 70th Session of the U.N. General Assembly. It solidified the commitment of Member States to achieve gender parity in all areas and aims to meet new demands set forth by the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals.\\n\\nAccording to the National Science Board, women make up half of the total college-educated workforce in the United States, but they only comprise 29 percent of the science and engineering workforce. Most of these women are concentrated in fields of biological, agricultural, and life sciences. They are especially underrepresented as engineers and computer and mathematical scientists, accounting for only 15 percent and 25 percent of those workforces, respectively.\\n\\nThese statistics are exponentially more one-sided when looking outside the United States. One report by the U.N. Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization claims as few as 30 percent of the research workforce in Sub-Saharan African countries are women, 22.5 percent in Southeast Asia, and only 16.9 percent in South Asia.\\n\\nThis disparity is multifactorial and complex. Even at a young age, there exists a confidence gap between boys and girls that has direct consequences on early educational paths. Often unintentionally, girls are herded away from hard-science fields. Although severe discrimination seems all but eliminated in the United States, there still likely exists subconscious gender bias and stereotyping that may limit opportunities for women in these fields. For instance, the American Association of University of Women published a report exploring some of the concepts surrounding why women are lacking in these fields. According to their findings, there remain difficult and unwelcoming climates in science and engineering departments at colleges and universities that may present obstacles for women entering those arenas.\\n\\nIn order to bridge the gender gap for women in science fields moving forward, we must continue to bolster a culture that supports women scientists. We need to build strong networks and communities so girls might find mentors and role models. Additionally, we must advocate for policy changes to promote female education and participation in the workforce.\\n\\nOn this International Day of Women and Girls in Science, many organizations affiliated with the United Nations, as well as many independent groups, will hold seminars, workshops, and conferences to raise awareness and inspire conversations about these important issues. Globally, there exists unlimited potential for scientific and technologic advancement. By including more women in the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) workforce, the world would benefit from a larger and more diverse collection of people with differing talents, abilities, and intellects."}

What's the situation in the UK?\\n\\nDanny Lawson - PA Images via Getty Images Diamond Princess passengers arrive in the UK.\\n\\nOn Sunday, more than a hundred people who had been flown out of Wuhan were released from quarantine in a Milton Keynes conference centre after being held for 14 days. One man said it was a fantastic feeling to be released from Kents Hill Park training and conference centre. Some 118 people were being released, with guests holding backpacks and suitcases pictured getting taxis. The group, who were brought back to Britain earlier this month on a repatriation flight from Wuhan, included around 10 children and a family of four.\\n\\nIt comes as dozens of evacuees from a coronavirus-hit cruise ship spent their first night quarantined at Arrowe Park hospital on the Wirral. Thirty-two people, who spent more than two weeks trapped on the Diamond Princess cruise ship off the coast of Japan, arrived in Merseyside on Saturday evening. Some of the group – reportedly made up of 30 Britons and two Irish nationals – made gestures from their coaches as they arrived at the Merseyside facility on Saturday evening – one forming a heart symbol with her hands and another an OK signal. All of those who arrived at Arrowe Park tested negative to having Covid-19 before flying back to the UK. It is understood some British nationals who are part of the Diamond Princess crew opted to remain. Since being kept on board the cruise liner in the port of Yokohama, more than 600 passengers and crew have been infected. British couple David and Sally Abel, from Northamptonshire, who were were on the cruise for their 50th wedding anniversary, have both been diagnosed with pneumonia and relatives complained they had been moved to a prison-like hospital in Japan.

Officials also announced 648 new infections, representing a spike compared to the downward trend of recent days. The total number of cases in China is 76,510, most of which are in Hubei, the province where Covid-19 originated. Prior to the spike in daily infections, China's leadership sounded a cautious note about the country's progress in halting the spread of the virus, after several days of upbeat messages. The Politburo, made up of the senior officials of the ruling Communist Party, said the situation in Hubei and its capital Wuhan remains grave.

Italy's government have passed a series of emergency measures in a bid to limit the spread of the outbreak in what is now Europe's worst-affected country. The governor of Italy's northern Lombardy region Attilio Fontana said certified cases of the illness in his area had risen to 89 from 54 a day earlier, bringing the total number in the country to more than 100. In an emergency decree approved late on Saturday, the government adopted special powers to be able to stop people leaving or entering the worst impacted zones. A spokesman for the governor of the northern region Veneto said on Sunday the number of cases there had risen to 19, seven more than on Saturday. Lombardy is home to Italy's financial capital Milan which has a population of 1.4m. The city's mayor Giuseppe Sala has announced that all Milan schools will be closed from Monday, while universities in both Lombardy and Veneto have also been shuttered until early March. Sporting events have also been cancelled in the affected regions, including three Serie A football matches.

{"original": "coldsnowstorm via Getty Images\\n\\nThe devastating impact of homelessness has been laid bare by members of a House of Commons committee. MPs on Parliament's Public Accounts Committee have accused the government of being unacceptably complacent after an investigation revealed as many as 9,100 people are sleeping rough on the streets of the UK every night. More than 78,000 households, including over 120,000 children, are classed as homeless and housed in often substandard temporary accommodation. Labour MP and committee chair Meg Hillier said: The latest official figures hammer home the shameful state of homelessness in England and the abject failure of the government's approach to addressing the misery suffered by many thousands of families and individuals. As we approach Christmas there are thousands of children in temporary accommodation – a salutary reminder of the human cost of policy failure. The evidence we heard from organisations that work with homeless people should serve as a wake-up call;government decisions are not made in a vacuum and the consequences can be severe.\\n\\nMartin Rickett - PA Images via Getty Images PAC chair Meg Hillier\\n\\nAs well as those counted among official figures, there are also large numbers of 'hidden homeless' people who are housed by family and friends in shifting circumstances. According to evidence gathered by the cross-party committee, the average rough sleeper dies before the age of 50, and children in long-term temporary accommodation miss far more schooling than their peers. Homelessness has been steadily rising since 2010, with the number of households in temporary accommodation skyrocketing by more than 60%. Since March 2011, the number of people who sleep rough has risen by 134%. The committee said the light touch approach to tackling the issue displayed b the Department for Communities and Local Government had clearly failed. Hillier added: The government must do more to understand and measure the real-world costs and causes of homelessness and put in place the joined-up strategy that is so desperately needed. That means properly addressing the shortage of realistic housing options for those at risk of homelessness or already in temporary accommodation. More fundamentally, it means getting a grip on the market's failure to provide genuinely affordable homes, both to rent and to buy. Delegating a problem is not a solution and we do not share the government's faith in the cure-all potential of the Homelessness Reduction Act. There are practical steps it can take now – for example, targeting financial support on local authorities with acute shortages of suitable housing, rather than those councils which are simply ready to spend – that would make a real difference to people's lives. The committee has called for the government to show more urgency in tackling homelessness and publish a cross-department strategy with clear targets.\\n\\nPA Archive/PA Images Shadow housing minister John Healey"}

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) called climate change the biggest crisis of all in a fiery rebuke of President Donald Trump's televised address Tuesday night meant to drum up support for funding a U.S.-Mexico border wall to reopen the federal government.\\n\\nSpeaking shortly after Trump's prime-time Oval Office speech, Sanders listed the 30 million Americans without health insurance, the millions of senior citizens in desperate poverty and the 40 million young Americans trying to deal with outrageous debt as issues meriting a White House declaration of a national emergency.\\n\\nBut the Vermont senator and likely 2020 presidential candidate said human-caused global warming should top the president's priorities.\\n\\nThe scientific community has made it very clear in telling us that climate change is real and is causing devastating harm to our country and the entire planet, Sanders said. They have told us in no uncertain terms that if we do not transform our energy system away from fossil fuel, our nation and our planet and the planet we will be leaving our kids and grandchildren may well become unhealthy and even uninhabitable in the not-so-distant future.\\n\\nHe added: Mr. President, we don't need to create artificial crises, we have enough real crises.\\n\\nASSOCIATED PRESS In this Nov. 15, 2018 photo, smoke hangs over the scorched remains of Old Town Plaza following the devastating wildfire in Paradise, California.\\n\\nThe clarion call capped off Sanders' roughly nine-minute response and stood in stark contrast to the humdrum address the two top Democrats in Congress gave immediately after Trump's speech.\\n\\nIn a response aired on nearly every major network, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) accused the president of using the backdrop of the Oval Office to manufacture a crisis, stoke fear, and divert attention from the turmoil in his administration and of holding hostage critical services for the health, safety and wellbeing of the American people. They made no mention of climate change.\\n\\nThe two Democratic leaders, who were standing soberly side by side, drew mockery for appearing like two proverbial parents expressing disappointment with a misbehaving teen.\\n\\nIf that official Democratic response was meant to demonstrate the poise and civility that plays well with the Beltway crowd, Sanders' seemed targeted at average American voters.\\n\\nHe opened with a list of people victimized by the three-week shutdown of the federal government, including the disabled, their children and the elderly on food stamps, small businesses and farmers owed financial assistance, and would-be homeowners or sellers awaiting the processing of mortgage applications. (He didn't mention, however, that the Trump administration has continued processing oil and gas drilling permits, according to Bloomberg.)\\n\\nMr. President, we don't need to create artificial crises, we have enough real crises. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.)\\n\\nThen, Sanders recalled the Senate bill to fund the government that passed unanimously on Dec. 19 and said it was widely expected that the next day, the House would do the same and the government would remain open.\\n\\nUnfortunately, President Trump, who started receiving criticism from an assortment of right-wing ideologues, changed his mind about the agreement, Sanders said. He then read aloud quotes in which Trump said he is proud to shut down the government.\\n\\nIn terms of the shutdown, President Trump has made it very clear who was responsible, Sanders said.\\n\\nIn the middle of his speech, Sanders called on Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) directly, saying, let's vote to end the shutdown now in a bipartisan way.\\n\\nIt gives me no pleasure to tell you what most of you already know, and that is that President Trump lies all of the time, Sanders said, his voice rising. In his remarks tonight and in recent weeks regarding immigration and the wall, he continues to lie.\\n\\nSanders stopped short of denouncing the president's repeated statements that call the science behind global warming into question. But as he gears up for a second White House bid, the senator is making climate change a central focus of his campaign.\\n\\nIn December, he hosted a televised town hall talk on global warming and repeatedly tried to push the policy debate beyond whether or not climate science is real and toward a political revolution that takes on the fossil fuel billionaires, accelerates our transition to clean energy, and finally puts people before the profits of polluters.\\n\\nIn a twist, a right-wing commentator seemingly alluded to Sanders' words on Tuesday. Erick Erickson, a vocal conservative critic of Trump, suggested on Twitter that, if GOP lawmakers cave to the president's border demands, it is only a matter of time before a progressive President declares climate change a national emergency and uses eminent domain to shutter coal plants, etc."}
{"original": "True, the prime minister's affection for going Goldilocks on Canadians isn't as severe as leaning into the microphone and saying wrong. But it belittles the Canadian public all the same.\\n\\nJust as importantly, American politics presently demonstrates how quickly the slippery transition goes from rhetorical tactics to embracing techniques of propaganda.\\n\\nBut let's back up a bit and explain something about our Mr. Trudeau and his Goldilocks syndrome.\\n\\nPhilosophers have identified over three hundred of these mischievous rhetorical habits.\\n\\nWhen I used to teach critical thinking courses in university, we'd spend some time listing and discussing fallacies, otherwise known as irrational and illegitimate ways of arguing one's point.\\n\\nWhile some philosophers have identified over three hundred of these mischievous rhetorical habits, we'd normally only cover the more popular, such as: ad hominem (attacking the person), non sequitur (it does not follow), and begging the question (assuming what needs to be demonstrated).\\n\\nFallacies, I explained to students, all attempt to divert the argument away from sound reasoning to some unconnected and irrelevant side-issue. I was always sure to add that we should avoid their use, not exploit their power.\\n\\nWhy the warning?\\n\\nLike some dark power newly obtained, learning about fallacies and their emotionally persuasive, but illegitimate force, can be quite a temptation when arguing with the uninformed.\\n\\nAnd while it might not be noticed at first glance, proper arguing has a moral component to it: One shouldn't convince people with tricks of language.\\n\\nThis apparently wasn't a lesson learned by our prime minister during his university days. In fact, it's now quite obvious Mr. Trudeau thinks he's quite within his rights as prime minister to use fallacious reasoning to prop his decisions and policies in Parliament, and in front of the cameras.\\n\\nHis emerging favourite? The Goldilocks fallacy.\\n\\nDespite its rather benign name, it carries as much deceit as the other fallacies, especially because it's being done to obscure significant matters of national policies and legislation. It's an attempt to avoid real political debate and justification.\\n\\nMake no mistake: It's an assault on democracy.\\n\\nMr. Trudeau's rhetorical strategy isn't benign. It belies the notion that his policy decisions cannot be described to Canadians; that facts are not within the ability for us to grasp or argue through.\\n\\nJust like the three bears' porridge, Mr. Trudeau's modus operandi goes like this: Well, the NDP have one suggestion that's too cold. As for the Conservatives, theirs is too hot! Mercy me, what to do?! I guess we have no choice but to chose the one that's just right. Mine.\\n\\nIt shouldn't go unnoticed that Mr. Trudeau is clever enough to always add how much he respects everyone's right to their opinion. Nice in itself, but in the midst of a rhetorical ploy, it's not nice at all. It only adds insult to injury.\\n\\nSo pleased with the rhetorical success of the Goldilocks fallacy, he tried it out again when he approved the tarsands pipelines: One side of the House wants us to approve everything and ignore indigenous communities and environmental responsibilities . . . the other side of the House does not care about the jobs or the economic growth that comes with getting our resources to market.\\n\\nThis sort of tactic -- especially in the hands of a powerful politician -- usually gets worse before it gets better. So now, a rhetorical tactic has turned into a growing dependence on subterfuge, this time to justify breaking a promise made to Canadians about electoral reform.\\n\\nCouched once more in the prefatory mention of respect for all points of view, our prime minister proclaims, But there is no consensus, there is no sense of how to do this. And, quite frankly, a divisive referendum, an augmentation of extremist voices in this House is not what is in the best interests of Canada.\\n\\nMr. Trudeau's rhetorical strategy isn't benign. It belies the notion that his policy decisions cannot be described to Canadians; that facts are not within the ability for us to grasp or argue through.\\n\\nIt is an affront to the high standard of accountability and transparency a prime minister should respect, not denigrate.\\n\\nFollow HuffPost Canada Blogs on Facebook"}
{"original": "Mask up, for the good of your country.\\n\\nAs one of his first acts as president, Joe Biden is mandating Americans to wear masks while on federal property as part of an effort to slow the spread of COVID-19.\\n\\nBiden's action is more symbolic than it is prescriptive: While he has the ability to enforce that masks be worn in federal buildings and with regard to interstate commerce (think planes, trains and buses), he has no such power at the state or local level to make a more sweeping mandate.\\n\\nAdherence beyond the federal purview, then, will require Americans to comply out of a collective sense of civic duty.\\n\\nBiden has been urging Americans to wear masks since he won the election in November, framing it as an apolitical and necessary act.\\n\\nWe can save tens of thousands of lives if everyone would just wear a mask for the next few months, he said in a Nov. 9 address. Not Democrat or Republican lives, American lives.\\n\\nPlease, I implore you, he added. Wear a mask. Do it for yourself, do it for your neighbor. A mask is not a political statement, but it is a good way to start pulling the country together.\\n\\nPolling suggests a majority of Americans support the effort. A mid-January NPR/PBS NewsHour poll conducted by Marist found 74% of adults in the U.S. are in favor of Biden's 100-day mask plan.\\n\\nThe U.S. Chamber of Commerce also endorsed Biden's executive order, backing the initiative in an unequivocal statement Wednesday.\\n\\nWhile the Chamber will not agree on every policy the administration puts forward, we applaud the commitment to taking action against the unprecedented challenges starting with the pandemic and then restoring the economy, Chamber President Suzanne P. Clark said.\\n\\nPresident Biden's call for 100 days of mask wearing is a smart and practical approach, and one that we are proud to join, she added.\\n\\nBiden's action sets the tone for a more engaged federal role in curtailing a disease that has so far killed 400,000 Americans ― accounting for roughly 20% of global fatalities, a percentage far higher than every other developed country.\\n\\nThe federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has urged universal face mask use for months, citing firm, real-world evidence that cloth face masks can greatly reduce the spread of the disease. Lower rates of community spread (achieved by masking) allow for businesses to conduct more in-person transactions, which, in addition to lowering death and disability caused by the disease, also mitigates the pandemic's economic impact.\\n\\nDespite clear economic and public health benefits, however, the Trump administration strenuously resisted encouraging public mask use and instead turned the wearing of facial coverings into a political issue.\\n\\nOn Monday, Biden rejected that governing philosophy in a speech in which he introduced his scientific advisers and pledged to lead with science and truth."}
{"original": "Several victims of the Delhi riots have blamed him for instigating the violence. At least two Delhi BJP MPs have criticised him for hate speech. But a glance at the Twitter timeline of Kapil Mishra, AAP rebel-turned-BJP leader, shows that his strategy of half-claiming credit and half-playing the victim is still going strong.\\n\\nA few hours ago, Mishra tweeted that the same people who supported Burhan Wani and Yakub Memon were trying to brand him a terrorist. Scroll down, and you'll find that Mishra has retweeted several tweets praising him for taking on the anti-CAA protesters. On Monday, a day after he issued an open threat to the Delhi Police, there was a wink-wink-nudge-nudge appeal to the rioters for maintaining peace. On Tuesday night, in a since-deleted tweet, he expressed happiness at the peaceful protesters at Jafrabad being evicted.\\n\\nWhatever Mishra's strategy is, it's working. The Economic Times has reported that Manoj Tiwari and Gautam Gambhir, the two BJP MPs who have criticised Mishra so far, have been virtually isolated in the party.\\n\\nThe Delhi Police has been acting like it can't see or hear Mishra's provocations, though his infamous speech on Sunday was delivered in the presence of Ved Prakash Surya, the DCP (Northeast) of Seelampur. The Delhi high court on Wednesday had to ask for a clip of Mishra's speech to be played in the courtroom after DCP (crime branch) Rajesh Deo claimed that he had not seen it.\\n\\nSo far, so safe. And this immunity is likely to continue.\\n\\nApart from making vague noises about maintaining peace and calm, the BJP has not set much of a precedent for punishing hate speech by its members. Even its two top leaders, Narendra Modi and Amit Shah, routinely make hateful comments that act as dog whistles to supporters.\\n\\nRahul Verma, a fellow at the New Delhi-based Centre for Policy Research, said that the chances of the BJP leadership voluntarily acting against Mishra are slim.\\n\\nThe party can suspend him, but that's unlikely as similar remarks have been made by many other BJP leaders and no action has been taken against them. There are many people within the party who think Mishra is right, and the BJP would not want to antagonise its core base, said Verma.\\n\\nThe BJP's second option would be to deny Mishra an election ticket, but that is so far in the future that these incidents would be forgotten by then, Verma added.\\n\\nHe added that one way out for the BJP leadership—if it is inclined to punish Mishra—would be if the police or the courts charge him or pull him up.\\n\\nMishra could not be reached over the phone for his comments, but in a tweet, he reacted with defiance to the Delhi high court asking the police to register FIRs against hate speech.\\n\\nIt is our right to clear roads. I have not violated any laws, he tweeted.\\n\\nRewarded for 'Goli maaro'\\n\\nMishra, who joined the BJP last year, gets the credit for introducing the 'Goli Maaro Saalon Ko' slogan into the rioters' lexicon. He was rewarded with an assembly election ticket by the BJP last month, but lost to AAP's Akhilesh Pati Tripathi by over 11,000 votes.\\n\\nThough the Delhi BJP had distanced itself from Mishra's slogan and the resulting controversy at the time, several party leaders, including a Union minister, were later seen encouraging their supporters to chant the same slogan.\\n\\nPolitical analyst Sajjan Kumar pointed out that the BJP's history shows that it has always fielded a relatively liberal (within its ecosystem) face along with a hardcore leader on the Hindutva plank, giving the examples of Atal Bihari Vajpayee and L.K. Advani and more recently, Narendra Modi and Amit Shah. So it was unsurprising that Mishra was going unpunished even as voices such as Tiwari and Gambhir made an attempt to criticise him.\\n\\nMaybe he will be reprimanded or warned, but beyond that, expectations that the BJP will take any action against him are unwarranted, said Kumar, who is associated with research organisation Peoples Pulse."}
{"original": "Just weeks before the severity of the novel coronavirus outbreak in the United States became unmistakable, President Donald Trump's administration offered states a way to make significant cuts to their Medicaid programs, which provide health care coverage for just over 20% of the population.\\n\\nThe rapid spread of the disease is now making a clear case for why this initiative would be harmful to vulnerable Americans. According to one estimate, the cost of COVID-19 treatment can exceed $20,000.\\n\\nThe policy, which the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services calls Healthy Adult Opportunity, is the Trump administration's attempt to accomplish a long-held Republican goal: to shrink Medicaid by establishing annual caps on how much federal money goes to state Medicaid programs.\\n\\nThat would be a massive change from how the program currently works, with federal and state governments together spending whatever it costs to treat beneficiaries. This setup allows Medicaid funding to expand during economic downturns and public health emergencies.\\n\\nProponents of the new policy tout the flexibility it provides states to remake their health care programs for low-income people, but the reality is that flexibility would translate into states cutting enrollment, cutting benefits or both.\\n\\nIt is code for doing less, said John Holahan, a health policy researcher and fellow at the Urban Institute. It would be literally cuts, of one form or another, if they couldn't live within the caps that they agreed to, which in this situation where we are today, they clearly couldn't. Holahan published a policy brief on Wednesday outlining the negative effects of limiting federal Medicaid spending during the coronavirus pandemic.\\n\\nRepublicans generally favor reducing government spending and enrollment in safety net programs. But kicking people off benefits is unpopular, so it's politically easier to push reforms that sound bureaucratic and benign. The new policy's block grants, for instance, are an administrative maneuver masking a clear goal: reduced spending and fewer people getting benefits. In the 1990s, the Republican Congress and Democratic President Bill Clinton converted cash welfare into block grants, resulting in significantly less aid being provided to low-income families.\\n\\nMore than 70 million people in the United States were covered by Medicaid as of December, according to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. About 30 million potentially could be subject to the new Trump limits on the program's funding, according to the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation.\\n\\nThe coronavirus pandemic and the recession that's very likely to hit the U.S. economy offer a case study in how this kind of financing scheme puts Americans who earn very little at risk of getting sick or losing a job ― or both ― during a crisis.\\n\\nA Poorly Timed Bad Idea\\n\\nThe concept behind block grants and similar proposals for Medicaid is simple: Instead of open-ended federal funding to cover whatever costs the state's Medicaid beneficiaries require, the state gets a flat amount of money it must stretch over the year. And that amount is less than states get now.\\n\\nThe Trump initiative would allow states to choose between receiving a block grant ― a flat dollar amount per year ― that increases slightly faster than medical price inflation or a per-capita cap based on the number of current Medicaid enrollees that rises at the same rate as medical inflation. The per-capita cap option is less problematic than the block grants and offers states more financial leeway, but both would result in benefit and enrollment cuts, Holahan said.\\n\\nAs the Urban Institute policy brief illustrates, this financing mechanism wouldn't be adequate to cover current costs, let alone higher expenses associated with growth in the number of people using Medicaid or the costs of COVID-19 treatments. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services projected last year that Medicaid spending would increase 6% annually between 2019 and 2027. By contrast, medical inflation has risen less than 3% in recent years, according to the brief.\\n\\nWhile states that participate may request additional federal Medicaid funds during an emergency, those funds are not guaranteed and would require swift approval to be useful to states during crises. Under traditional Medicaid, the funding would automatically flow.\\n\\nUnder the Trump policy, announced in January, a state facing increasing Medicaid enrollment or higher spending on medical care for enrollees could choose to jettison people from the program or eliminate covered benefits. The alternative would be for the state to increase its own spending to maintain coverage and benefits, which would be significantly challenging because nearly all states must balance their budgets and can't turn to deficit spending. And given that this proposal is designed to appeal to Republican state officials, tax increases to finance additional spending would be unlikely.\\n\\nIt would put [states] in a horrendous position if they have a significant outbreak, Holahan said. It would either be bad for them fiscally if they decide to serve everybody or it would be bad for people if they decide that they couldn't because they agreed to this capped amount of federal money.\\n\\nNevertheless, the Republican governors of Oklahoma and Tennessee are still seeking federal approval to accept more limited federal funding for their Medicaid programs, respectively known as SoonerCare and TennCare.\\n\\nThe Anticipated Rise In Medicaid Enrollment\\n\\nTimes of rising unemployment and shrinking incomes tend to lead to large increases in Medicaid enrollment as people find themselves with less or no earnings and become eligible for the program. That leads to higher Medicaid spending. And a nationwide outbreak of a highly contagious virus that can lead to tens of thousands of dollars in medical costs will drive spending even higher this time. During the recession that began at the end of the last decade, millions of Americans enrolled in Medicaid.\\n\\nIn fact, Congress has already recognized these realities. The first coronavirus emergency bill that Trump signed includes additional Medicaid funding for states as a means of shoring up their budgets. That law also forbids states from cutting enrollment or benefits as a condition for receiving the temporary bonus funds. Extra Medicaid funding is a common form of helping state budgets and providing economic stimulus during recessions.\\n\\nAnd even as the Trump administration continues to support its Healthy Adult Opportunity initiative, federal authorities are taking other steps to shore up the Medicaid program amid the outbreak. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services is swiftly approving states' requests to relax Medicaid enrollment rules to make it easier for qualified individuals to sign up.\\n\\nBut a catastrophic epidemic is unlikely to dissuade Republicans who have been clamoring to substantially curtail Medicaid. The GOP's failed Obamacare replacement bill in 2017 included a similar block grants proposal and the party has been trying to impose one since the 1980s, when President Ronald Reagan backed a version of the policy.\\n\\nThe Trump administration's new Medicaid funding plan is based on the same principles as those previous versions.\\n\\nToday, Medicaid is an entitlement program, like Medicare and Social Security, meaning that spending automatically rises to cover the costs incurred for medical care. The federal government finances more than half of Medicaid expenses, with states picking up the remaining share, which eases the fiscal burden on states, especially when the economy is poor. But states that adopt the Healthy Adult Opportunity program would give up that open-ended guarantee of federal funding.\\n\\nIn exchange for accepting less federal money, these states would gain new authorities to alter their Medicaid programs without seeking further federal approval. Depending on a state's specific plan, it could impose eligibility and benefit cuts, cost-sharing and other burdens on a subset of adult Medicaid enrollees.\\n\\nThat includes parents, pregnant women who earn just over the poverty level, and adults who live in states that expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. The lowest-income pregnant women are exempt, as are people over 65, patients in long-term care, and individuals who receive federal disability benefits.\\n\\nMedicaid enrollees in states that adopt a block grant or per-capita cap could face new barriers to care, including monthly premiums and out-of-pocket costs, and they could be kicked off the program for failing to pay.\\n\\nStates could also limit access to certain medications, or eliminate Medicaid's retroactive eligibility standard that covers recent medical expenses accumulated by new enrollees prior to signing up, or impose asset tests that block benefits for people who own homes or cars or other property, regardless how low their incomes are. That would be especially burdensome on newly jobless people, who still possess their assets but no longer have incomes.\\n\\nArthur Delaney contributed reporting."}

{"original": "Newly elected California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) on Thursday proposed what would be the most generous paid parental leave policy in the nation: six months of partially paid leave so parents or other family members can care for a newborn or newly adopted baby.\\n\\nRight now, some California parents have access to a combined four months of leave at partial pay. Those who get less include adoptive parents, same-sex couples and single parents.\\n\\nTwo-thirds of countries in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development guarantee six months of paid time off to new mothers. Newsom's plan doesn't go that far. Instead, the proposal, unveiled as part of his 2019 budget, would allow two caretakers to split six months off, according to a fact sheet provided by his office. One parent could take three months, and the other parent or partner or another family member could take three more months, or vice versa.\\n\\nThe policy would roll out slowly. At a press conference unveiling the state's $209 billion budget on Thursday, Newsom said that leave would be paid for mainly with existing funds.\\n\\nIt's a developmental necessity, Newsom said of paid leave. We're committed to this.\\n\\nNewsom's proposal counts as groundbreaking and radical for the U.S., the only developed country in the world that doesn't guarantee paid time off to new mothers; just two of 34 OECD countries do not guarantee paid leave to new fathers. And it comes at a time when Democratic state and local politicians around the country are proposing new liberal social programs ― beefing up Obamacare protections and provisions and passing greater labor protections. These guys are just catching up with others around the world, however.\\n\\nLook, the whole world has this, except for the United States, said Ruth Milkman, a sociology professor at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York and a co-author of a book analyzing California's leave policy. This is not some utopian proposal. In the U.S. it would be a breakthrough.\\n\\nCalifornia's policy would be a big step up from what the state currently offers: six weeks of caregiving leave, plus six to eight weeks for birth mothers through the state's disability fund. The policy covers new parents and those who need time off to care for a sick loved one, offering a percentage of pay up to $1,216 a week.\\n\\nIt's not clear if the extension would include caregiving leave; about 13 percent of Californians who seek paid leave need it to look after sick spouses, partners, children or parents, according to the state's data.\\n\\nNew York, New Jersey and Rhode Island currently offer paid parental and caregiving leave, and Washington state, the District of Columbia and Massachusetts have policies set to start paying out within the next couple of years. These states offer between four and 12 weeks to new parents.\\n\\nThere's a belief in the U.S., promoted mostly by business interests, that paid maternity leave is costly and hurts businesses. That's a myth, said Milkman.\\n\\nCalifornia's existing program, started more than a decade ago, is relatively cheap. Workers in the state pay a 1 percent payroll tax on wages of up $115,000 to fund the program. And the fund is currently running a surplus, Newsom said Thursday. One way to pay for an expansion would be to tap into that surplus. He also mentioned raising the payroll tax as an option or raising the income limit so those earning more than the current taxable ceiling would contribute more.\\n\\nIt's a small price to pay for the peace of mind in knowing that if they need time off for a health crisis or new child, they can take it, said Milkman.\\n\\nThe money is not a lot, and it is so worth it, she said.\\n\\nAnd businesses have been largely unaffected by the paid leave program, according to a widely cited survey Milkman co-authored a few years ago. For those employers already offering leave, the policy means they spend less on the benefit.\\n\\nThere are some issues with California's existing law: Job protections are limited. Many employers still have leeway to fire workers who take leave ― a limitation that activists hope Newsom will address.\\n\\nWorryingly, even after more than a decade, many Californians don't know they have access to paid leave. Take-up rates for leave have been low.\\n\\nNewsom's announcement could help raise awareness. It can fuel the momentum we need to make this happen the way it needs to happen, said Jenya Cassidy, an activist who helped pass the state's first law. The director of the California Work & Family Coalition, she said the group hopes to work with the governor's office to sharpen and improve the proposal.\\n\\nThe budget Newsom unveiled Thursday offered up a bunch of goodies for young children and their parents, including a plan for statewide universal pre-K and all-day kindergarten, as well as more money for subsidized child care. He also announced an increase in benefits to undocumented immigrants. It was an astonishing contrast to the policy priorities of the Trump administration.\\n\\nThis comes at a time when Democratic leaders in blue states are pushing progressive agendas that go far beyond what the divided federal government is capable of these days.\\n\\nJust this week, New York Mayor Bill de Blasio proposed giving workers in the city two weeks of paid time off each year ― the nation's first guaranteed vacation policy.\\n\\nThe egalitarian nature of Newsom's scheme could avoid one of the pitfalls of paid leave: putting women at a disadvantage in the workplace. Mothers wind up taking long workforce leaves, and fathers don't. Under his plan, if parents want their child to have six months of care provided by a family member, fathers would theoretically have to step up. Mothers still take the majority of leave in the state.\\n\\nThe effect of a paid leave policy on improving public health and the economy is hard to overstate.\\n\\nStudies have shown that paid maternity leave reduces infant mortality rates, increases the amount of time women spend breastfeeding and makes it more likely that infants will be immunized.\\n\\nPaid leave for women also helps keep them in the workforce. And the U.S. lags other nations when it comes to the percentage of women who work outside the home."}

Congress has allowed inflated fears of terrorism to justify unprecedented encroachments on Americans' privacy, from the 2001 USA Patriot Act right up to the cybersecurity legislation the U.S. House of Representatives shoe-horned into the must-pass budget bill last month.\\n\\nRepresentative government requires robust protection of privacy to encourage citizen participation, petition, and censure. Who will dare to criticize the government if fearful of retaliatory actions based on dossiers assembled from indiscriminate surveillance? Retaliation could find expression in disclosures of embarrassing information, withholding benefits, audits, criminal investigations, or politically-driven prosecutions.\\n\\nThen-Attorney General Robert Jackson warned as long ago as 1940:\\n\\nWith the law books filled with a great assortment of crimes, a prosecutor stands a fair chance of finding at least a technical violation of some act on the part of almost anyone. In such a case, it is not a question of discovering the commission of a crime and then looking for the man who has committed it, it is a question of picking the man and then searching the law books, or putting investigators to work, to pin some offense on him.\\n\\nIn 1761, James Otis denounced British Writs of Assistance which empowered every petty British official to rummage through the homes or businesses of the colonists in search of contraband or smuggled goods. He remonstrated: It is a power that places the liberty of every man in the hand of every petty officer. John Adams later chronicled: Then and there the child of independence was born.\\n\\nThe right to be let alone was enshrined in the Fourth Amendment. It prohibits searches and seizures unless justified by a warrant issued by a neutral magistrate based on probable cause to believe that the place to be searched or the person to be seized is implicated in crime. Even in the narrow circumstances where the Supreme Court has permitted warrantless searches or seizures, they still must be reasonable.\\n\\nPrivacy laws enacted by Congress decades before the Age of the Internet are obsolete.\\n\\nAdditionally, the Supreme Court's third-party doctrine, fashioned in the 1970s to excuse warrantless searches of business records, is an anachronism. The doctrine holds that information voluntarily shared with private entities, like deposits with banks or dialed phone numbers with phone companies, is denuded of Fourth Amendment protection. But in today's electronically-enhanced world, all of our most sensitive information - including our location, our associations, our communications, and our Internet searches -are stored on third-party servers. Under the third party doctrine, this information becomes easily available to the government. Personal papers once zealously protected by the law while sitting on our desks are no longer adequately protected from the prying eyes of government.\\n\\nThe foreign intelligence capabilities the United States developed to protect us from Cold War enemies have now been turned inward against ourselves in the pursuit of potential terrorists-in-embryo. A whistleblower's revelations of the scope of the National Security Agency's domestic spying--doing what congressional overseers should have done-awakened Americans to the societal harms of mass surveillance. Studies documented journalists unwilling to write or speak on controversial topics, and ordinary Americans curtailing their religious practices and online searches after learning that the government was watching or listening. We act and speak differently in the de facto presence of the NSA or FBI. Mass surveillance is censorship by other means.\\n\\nEven members of Congress who enabled the expansion of domestic spying express shock at its present scope, especially when they found their own communications have been monitored.\\n\\nThe post-9/11 encroachments on privacy have not yielded more security. President Obama selected a review group to examine the NSA programs and to recommend reforms. It found that bulk telephone metadata collection was not essential to preventing attacks, and concluded that enhancing privacy protections were indispensable to strengthening security. Continuing breaches of government servers by foreign hackers have further exposed the government as an unreliable steward of sensitive information.\\n\\nThe perception of terrorist threats to the United States evolved as Middle East conflicts intensified, and the movement for privacy reforms stalled. Intelligence officials and prosecutors assailed companies that sought to satisfy consumer demand for encryption to secure their private communications and data. By enhancing privacy protection, the companies were accused of aiding criminals and terrorists with little evidence forthcoming from the government that encryption is frustrating criminal or terrorist investigations in any meaningful way.\\n\\nCongress continues to make the problem worse. Just last month, the House of Representatives used a slick procedural maneuver to erase the few privacy protections that remain over our online data. The Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act passed largely unnoticed in a 2000 page, eleventh hour, omnibus spending bill. Experts agree it will do nothing to improve Internet security while rolling the dice with privacy. Objections were voiced by privacy advocates, tech companies and security professionals. But House Speaker Paul Ryan turned a deaf ear.\\n\\n\\n\\nAmericans from both sides of the political spectrum want privacy. The Constitution demands it. American companies are eager to provide it. Technology will be part of the answer as companies foreign and domestic seek to meet the public demand for data security.\\n\\nBut the law must also change. An election year is the best time to make sure our voices are heard on matters of public policy. It is time we reclaim the courage of our ancestors, and demand accountability from our government. Updating privacy laws to protect our electronic records, and reforming the third party doctrine by statute or litigation to reestablish Fourth Amendment protection over personal information wherever we store it are essential steps toward creating true security in the digital era.\\n\\n**Mike German is a fellow with the Liberty and National Security Program at the Brennan Center for Justice at NYU Law School.

{"original": "TOPEKA, Kan. (AP) — Kansas' new Democratic governor on Tuesday reinstated a ban on anti-LGBT bias in state agencies' employment decisions that a Republican predecessor had repealed, and she also expanded the policy to cover government contractors.\\n\\nGov. Laura Kelly's executive order was her first official action since taking office Monday and fulfilled a promise she made repeatedly during her successful campaign last year. It bars state agencies from discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity when hiring workers or deciding whether to promote, discipline or fire them.\\n\\nThe move came after a historic wave of victories by LGBT candidates across the nation. In Kansas, Sharice Davids won a congressional seat and state Reps. Susan Ruiz and Brandon Woodard were elected as the Legislature's first openly lesbian and gay members. All three are Kansas City-area Democrats.\\n\\nKelly's order will apply to departments under Kelly's direct control, which have about 19,000 employees. But she also extended the policy to companies that have contracts with the state, telling reporters later that if they do work for the state, they ought to follow its rules.\\n\\nIn a perfect world, we wouldn't need executive orders like this, Kelly told reporters during a Statehouse news conference. It's important that, until we become a perfect world, that we make sure that we've got the kinds of things in place that move it towards perfection.\\n\\nKelly's move instantly drew praise from national LGBT-rights groups. It came after new Democratic governors in Michigan and Wisconsin issued such orders, as well as Ohio's new GOP governor.\\n\\nThey can be open an authentic about who they are, about who their families are and who their loved ones are without fear of retribution of losing their employment, said Tom Witt, executive director of the LGBT-rights group Equality Kansas, saying he personally knows of seven state workers who lost jobs after previous protections were rescinded.\\n\\nBut extending the anti-discrimination policy to government contactors could prompt a backlash in the Republican-controlled Legislature. House Speaker Ron Ryckman Jr., a conservative Kansas City-area Republican, said lawmakers will probably review the order because it applies to private businesses.\\n\\nI absolutely think that is a decision the Legislature should be making, said conservative Rep. Blake Carpenter, a Wichita-area Republican.\\n\\nKelly reinstated a policy against anti-LGBT bias in state government that Democratic Gov. Kathleen Sebelius imposed in 2007 through an executive order.\\n\\nRepublican Gov. Sam Brownback, a vocal opponent of same-sex marriage, rescinded Sebelius' order in 2015, arguing that state lawmakers should set such a policy. It was clear at the time that the GOP-dominated Legislature and its conservative leaders would not.\\n\\nThe Kansas law barring discrimination in housing and private employment doesn't cover bias based on sexual orientation or gender identity.\\n\\nHalf a dozen local governments have enacted their own anti-LGBT bias policies, including two Kansas City-area suburbs in December, but the Williams Institute, a think tank at UCLA's law school focusing on sexual orientation and gender identity policy, said only 12 percent of Kansas residents fall under them.\\n\\nWoodard and Ruiz said after Kelly's news conference that they are drafting a bill that would expand the state's anti-discrimination law.\\n\\nBut expanding the state's anti-discrimination laws is likely to be a hard sell in the Legislature.\\n\\nSome conservatives have argued that such an expansion would be used only as a legal club against conservative people of faith. They've also questioned whether such a law is necessary and whether anti-LGBT bias is pervasive in employment and housing.\\n\\nState Sen. Mary Pilcher-Cook, a conservative Kansas City-area Republican, called Kelly's order anti-liberty and said it is degrading to reduce individuals to their sexual inclinations.\\n\\nThese laws cause divisions in communities and can have serious detrimental and unintended consequences because of their subjective nature, she added.\\n\\nFormer Republican Gov. Jeff Colyer replaced Brownback last year when Brownback resigned to become U.S. ambassador at large for international religious freedom and signed a measure providing legal protections to adoption agencies that cite faith-based reasons for refusing to place children in homes that violate their religious beliefs.\\n\\nThe legislative debate centered on agencies that won't place children in LGBT homes. Supporters saw it as religious liberties measure, but Kelly has called it an adoption discrimination law and has said she will see whether she legally can avoid enforcing it.\\n\\nDemonstrating social conservatives' influence, the Kansas Republican Party adopted a platform last year that declares, We believe God created two genders, male and female. The platform also called for an amendment to the U.S constitution barring same-sex marriage, drafted so judges and legislatures cannot make other arrangements equivalent to it.\\n\\n___\\n\\nFollow John Hanna on Twitter: https://twitter.com/apjdhanna ."}
{"original": "WASHINGTON ― Senate Democrats on Tuesday filibustered bipartisan foreign policy legislation dealing with several Middle Eastern countries, demanding Republicans first allow a vote on reopening the government before bringing other matters to the floor.\\n\\nThe move was a small example of a victory under the emerging Senate Democratic strategy, which aims to put added pressure on Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) to bring up House-passed appropriations bills that would reopen the government.\\n\\nMcConnell reiterated on Tuesday, however, that he would not allow a vote on any bill to reopen the government that does not have the support of at least 60 senators and President Donald Trump.\\n\\nThe Senate will not waste floor time on show votes, messaging votes, or any other proposals which fail to check those boxes regarding the funding bill, McConnell said on the floor.\\n\\nUnder the Constitution, Congress has the power to override a presidential veto on any legislation.

Some Democrats have endorsed bills disallowing boycotts, but critics say such measures violate the First Amendment right to free speech.\\n\\nIn a 56-44 vote, Democrats denied the package the chamber's required 60-vote threshold to open debate. Four Democrats joined Republicans in supporting the bill: Doug Jones of Alabama, Joe Manchin of West Virginia, Bob Menendez of New Jersey and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona.\\n\\nMcConnell on Tuesday immediately moved to bring up the foreign policy bill again later this week, signaling he had no intention of backing down to the Democrats' demands. His office also issued a press release noting that the Democratic-controlled Senate continued to pass bills amid the 2013 federal government shutdown, which was more severe and affected more workers.\\n\\nIt's unclear how long Democrats can remain united in blocking legislation from coming to the floor.

I don't know legally if you could do that, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) told reporters on Tuesday, noting that such an emergency declaration is likely to be challenged in court.\\n\\nSen. John Cornyn (R-Texas), another Trump ally in Congress, agreed.\\n\\nThere's a hard way and an easy way to do things. I think that would definitely be the hard way, Cornyn said.\\n\\nBut Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.), who serves on the Senate Judiciary Committee, argued that an emergency declaration would survive legal scrutiny if Trump decides to go down that path.\\n\\nI have read the law.

{"original": "Courtesy Asgar Ali Indian pilgrims in coronavirus-hit Iran are waiting for the Government of India to evacuate them.\\n\\nNEW DELHI — At least 800 Indian nationals, 252 of whom have tested positive for COVID-19 commonly known as the novel coronavirus, are stranded in Iran with no clear path back home HuffPost India has learnt.\\n\\nTheir plight, they say, is a consequence of the Indian government's refusal to evacuate its own citizens who have tested positive for the virus. Several of those still in Iran are healthy, but will not leave as they cannot abandon a sick family member in a foreign land. Worse, the absence of any support from the Indian embassy to isolate and quarantine has forced the healthy to share the same hotels as the sick — potentially hastening the spread of the highly contagious coronavirus.\\n\\nIf repatriated, these Indian citizens would treble the number of COVID-19 positive cases on Indian soil, casting India's attempts to contain the virus in a very different light. Thus far, 110 positive cases have been reported on Indian soil.\\n\\n\\n\\nThese 252 individuals are part of an 800-strong group of Indians, most of whom had travelled from Ladakh to the holy city of Qom on a pilgrimage. There are also other Indian students and fishermen stranded in Iran. With nearly 14,000 COVID-19 cases and 724 deaths, Iran is the worst hit nation after China and Italy.\\n\\nThe Government of India barred commercial flights from Iran on 26 February, stranding hundreds of Indians like the group of pilgrims from Ladakh. The Narendra Modi government says they have evacuated 334 Indians from Iran from March 10 to March 15. But in a separate announcement, government officials have made clear that India will initially evacuate only those who have tested negative for the novel coronavirus. Evacuation does not mean we will bring everybody back, Additional Secretary Dammu Ravi told reporters in New Delhi, last week. Negative cases would be brought back.\\n\\nHuffPost India spoke to one pilgrim and two tour guides, who said they were part of an informal committee set up to parlay between the pilgrims, the Iranian government and the Indian embassy in Tehran.\\n\\nTheir account reveals the fallout of the Indian government's policy of only evacuating the healthy, while seemingly abandoning the sick and needy to their fate in a foreign land, and offers a glimpse of the COVID-19 induced chaos swirling through Iran.\\n\\nYou can't just say I'm bothered about the negative and bring them home and not care about the positives, said T Sundararaman, former director of the National Health Systems Resource Centre. A sensible policy for the government of India would have been to speak with the Iranian authorities to take care of these people and provide a certain degree of comfort.\\n\\nOur Mission is also maintaining close contact with those still left in Iran and taking all possible steps to ensure their safety and well being, Ravish Kumar, spokesperson for the Ministry of External Affairs, said in response to the questions that HuffPost India had sent to the MEA. We look forward to continued support from our nationals in Iran for a smooth evacuation process in the days to come, he said.\\n\\nPositives and negatives in the same hotels\\n\\nOn 1-2 March, Indian pilgrims in Qom were contacted by the Indian Embassy in Tehran.\\n\\nAsgar Ali, a 44-year-old tour guide from Leh, who heads the committee that is coordinating with the Indian authorities, said a team of doctors had come from India and began testing the pilgrims in a local hospital in Qom.\\n\\nWhen locals in the hospital objected, fearing the spread of the virus, the pilgrims were ferried by bus to the Indian Embassy in Tehran where their mouth-swabs were taken and sent for testing back home in Pune, Ali said.\\n\\nThus far, Ali said, the Embassy had informed them that 252 pilgrims had tested positive with a further 20 results still awaited.\\n\\nYet, as the test results were awaited, all the pilgrims — both corona-positive and negative — were living in the same hotels.\\n\\nThe government tested us with the expectation that some would test positive and others negative, but did not separate us. We have been living and eating under the same room for two weeks, said Ali. There are no positives and negatives left. We don't know who is infected and who is not.\\n\\nWe don't know who is infected and who is not.\\n\\nWhat this means is even those who did not have the corona at the time their samples were taken for testing, could have caught the virus in the time it took for the results to come back.\\n\\nNow, tour guides like Ali say they want all pilgrims under their charge to be retested, but they want that testing to be done in India.\\n\\nIran is in a far worse condition in India at present, its health system is struggling to cope with the high number of COVID-19 cases, and Indians do not have the language skills to seek treatment in local hospitals.\\n\\nWe are willing to cooperate with any testing and any time period of quarantine, but please bring us back to India, Ali said. We cannot survive here any longer.\\n\\nWe cannot survive here any longer.\\n\\nDr. Sundararaman, the public health expert, surmised that the Indian government was quietly aware that India lacked the facilities to cope with a sudden influx of infected Indians.\\n\\nTheir ability to quarantine them here is limited so they leave the problem there, said Sundaraman, adding that those who have been tested positive need to be isolated, the rest need to be retested and quarantined, and then retested after quarantine.\\n\\nTheir ability to quarantine them here is limited so they leave the problem there.\\n\\nNot leaving because of families\\n\\nIndia's policy of evacuating only those who have tested negative for coronavirus has meant that several healthy Indians have stayed behind as they cannot bear the thought of abandoning their families.\\n\\nWe told the Indian Embassy officials, say if you had gone with your family members to a foreign country, and if there was a policy that forced you to leave them behind, would you be able to do it? said an Indian tour guide.\\n\\nA second tour guide spoke on the condition of anonymity because he has not told his family that he tested negative, fearing they will ask him to abandon the rest of his group and return to safety.\\n\\nI took the responsibility of taking these pilgrims to Iran and then making sure they reach Delhi. How can I leave them? he said. It is a matter of common sense?\\n\\nMost of the Indian pilgrims in Qom, the tour guide said, were over the age of 50, and did not speak Hindi, Urdu or English, let alone Farsi. They speak mostly the local languages of Ladakh like Purgi, Sheena and Balti.\\n\\nTrying to leave Iran\\n\\nTwo weeks into their forced exile, the 800 stranded pilgrims from Ladakh are living in 15 hotels in Qom and are struggling to pay for their room and board.\\n\\nMohammed Imran, a 36-year-old businessman from Kargil, who was scheduled to leave on 28 February, said that he only budgeted a two-week long visit to Iran.\\n\\nThe situation is tough. The situation is really tough. The government has to get us out now, Imran said. The young will pull through, but what about the elderly? We are slipping into depression. We are seeing young and old slip into depression in front of our eyes.\\n\\nWe are seeing young and old slip into depression in front of our eyes.\\n\\nAli, the tour guide, said the pilgrims had run out of money and the tour guides were pooling together their resources to survive. The Indians buy groceries and cook in their hotels, which are now almost completely abandoned, he said.\\n\\nWe asked the Indian Embassy to give us masks but they did not. We bought a few, paying up to Rs. 500 for one. We are facing a lot of problems. The hotels have also given an ultimatum asking to leave. They know they are (COVID-19) positives here.\\n\\nAli said that on Sunday — almost two weeks since the first round of positive results — Indian officials met them and said those who have tested positive need to be separated and stay in separate hotels. Iranian officials have also spoken to the Indians in Qom about quarantining those who have tested positive to a 220-bed facility.\\n\\nMy question to them is where were you till now, said Ali.\\n\\nThey Indian officials here send WhatsApp messages saying you must separate yourself. But they have made no arrangements to separate us. We have got these hotels with so much difficulty. Where do we go? he said.\\n\\nMy question to them is where were you till now.\\n\\nGoing to the hospital in Iran\\n\\nThe second tour guide, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that he had never imagined that he would have to ferry pilgrims to a local hospital in Iran.\\n\\nBut on 11 March, this tour operator said that he spoke with embassy officials who told him to take 11 of the Ladakhi pilgrims who had tested positive for COVID-19 to the Kamkar Arbania hospital in Qom.\\n\\nBut the Iranian doctors took their temperature, checked their blood pressure and then sent them back to the hotels, he said.\\n\\nThe Indian officials say they are positive so take them to the hospital. Then, the Iran doctors say they are fine, just give them warm water, a warm bed. We cannot understand what is happening, he said.\\n\\nThe language barrier also made it very difficult for them to navigate the hospital, this tour operator said, adding that he had asked the Indian Embassy officials if they could send someone who could help them translate.\\n\\nThere was a huge communication problem. Only the Head of Department of the hospital knew some English. The doctors and nurses don't speak English or Hindi or Urdu, he said. How can we leave our relatives in a foreign soil for treatment when they can't even speak the language?\\n\\nHow can we leave our relatives in a foreign soil for treatment when they can't even speak the language.\\n\\n(This story has been updated on March 18 2020 to include a response from the Ministry of External Affairs)."}
{"original": "Former Attorney General Jeff Sessions and his then-top deputy, Rod Rosenstein, pushed a zero tolerance policy that led to immigrant family separations in spite of concerns raised by top federal prosecutors on the border, who were caught off guard by the decision, according to a new Justice Department watchdog report.\\n\\nSessions knew at the time of their decision that it would lead to families being separated, but he and his top officials made massive assumptions about how long that process would take, according to the report. Those assumptions were inconsistent with the realities on the ground.\\n\\nSessions and Rosenstein refused to adjust their views, even when they were more informed about how the process would play out and knew it would mean ripping young children away from their families.\\n\\nAfter some U.S. Attorneys on the border expressed their concerns, they were ordered to move forward with prosecutions.\\n\\nThis had enormous implications. The family separation policy split at least 5,400 immigrant children from their parents, according to American Civil Liberties Union, although advocates believe the number may be higher. Those kids included infants who were still breastfeeding, toddlers and other small children. All of them went through immense trauma, often adding to pain and fear they'd experienced in their native countries, which many were fleeing to seek asylum, and on the journey to the U.S.\\n\\nIn some cases, the government failed to keep records on where the children went. Some of these families were never reunited.\\n\\nSessions and Justice Department leadership, the report said, were operating under the belief that separation, prosecution, sentencing and reunification could take place within the span of an afternoon. Justice Department leadership did not consult the U.S. Marshals Service, federal defenders or federal courts before they made the decision. There is no evidence that Rosenstein was aware of some of the early discussion around the policy, but he supported and enforced Sessions' decision.\\n\\nRosenstein, who spent his Justice Department career in the greater Washington, D.C., region, appeared gravely naive about the realities on the ground involved in prosecuting so many low-level cases.\\n\\nMy thought was maybe we just release [the defendant] back to DHS and they can just hold the kid for a few hours while the parent was in court, and then they would be back together that night, he said.\\n\\nGene Hamilton, the counselor to the attorney general, also believed they would be able to reunited families in a few hours, according to the report.\\n\\nIt was our understanding that prosecution would happen in an afternoon or in days, [that a child would remain] in DHS custody and then there would be reunification with the children, Hamilton said. We didn't ever imagine DHS would lose track of the kids and their location. Like sending children off to a shelter in New Jersey. That was not our understanding at all.\\n\\nAfter reviewing a draft of the report, Rosenstein had second thoughts.\\n\\nI had this false sense of security that DHS has this under control, he said. [After] the AG had rolled this out, my understanding was it was coordinated with DHS, who handled [the way in which] children are going to be taken care of. … And so I had this false sense of security that I'm just doing what I can to provide logistical support and obviously, looking at it in retrospect, I have a very different perspective.\\n\\nAP Photo/Alex Brandon Then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions (left) and then-deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein talk during an event in Washington in 2018. Sessions was a top advocate of the family-separation policy during the Trump administration. (AP Photo/Alex Brandon)\\n\\nOfficials in President Donald Trump's administration either cheered on the policy as a way to deter unauthorized immigration or looked the other way.\\n\\nThe Justice Department began to split up families in 2017, but announced its zero tolerance policy more broadly in April 2018. In May, at the urging of White House senior adviser Stephen Miller, officials decided to move ahead with the policy in a show-of-hands vote, NBC News reported.\\n\\nDOJ began to dramatically ramp up prosecution for illegal entry among parents who crossed the border with children. Under past administrations, such as that of President Barack Obama, families that crossed the border illegally had not typically been charged with a crime, but rather put in immigration proceedings.\\n\\nSessions and other officials claimed it wasn't about separating families. Instead, they insisted it was no different than splitting parents from their children when they went to jail for another reason.\\n\\nBut the policy wasn't just about prosecuting crime; it was about taking away kids as a way to prevent parents from coming to the U.S. The administration began considering it a means of deterring families from coming to the border as early as March 2017. The same month, then-Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly confirmed publicly that such a plan was under consideration, also noting the need for deterrence.\\n\\nSessions was heavily involved, as the inspector general's office found. When the five U.S. attorneys along the U.S.-Mexico border raised concerns about children's welfare, Sessions dismissed them, The New York Times reported in October based on a draft of the report. We need to take away children, Sessions told the prosecutors, according to participants' notes, the Times reported. Rosenstein later said that the children's ages didn't matter. After intense public outrage, Trump signed an executive order in June 2018 to end the practice, and then took credit for doing so — even though his administration started it in the first place. Neither Sessions nor Rosenstein is still serving in the Trump administration. Sessions was eventually forced out after the 2018 election because Trump didn't like his handling of the special counsel investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. Rosenstein stepped down in May 2019, after the release of the the special counsel's report."}

{"original": "Today, lawmakers in 16 states and the District of Columbia announced new legislative efforts designed to protect Americans from intrusion into their personal data by schools, employers or government. The proposed laws focus on a range of issues, such as email and other electronic communications, employees' use of social media, cell phone trackers and license plate readers. Should these measures pass, it would send a strong signal to other states and Congress that Americans remain concerned about protecting their privacy.\\n\\nCongress seems unwilling or unable to address these issues. The federal laws governing online privacy date to 1986, five years before the World Wide Web existed. Legislation to update the privacy laws for email and other electronic communications has won strong bipartisan support but has repeatedly stalled.\\n\\nAlthough the Supreme Court has issued some important privacy-protective decisions in recent years, such as requiring a warrant to attach a GPS tracker or search a cell phone, it has yet to address the privacy of modern electronic communications like email or cell phone location information. It can take the Court decades to fully appreciate new technology. In the early 20th century, for example, the Court allowed police to listen in on phone calls without a warrant because they were only using their sense of hearing, not intruding into a home. It was not until 1967 -- some 40 years later -- that the Court reversed itself and required a warrant for phone taps.\\n\\nWe are in a similar situation today with more modern technology. Under current Supreme Court doctrine, formulated in 1979, there is no Fourth Amendment protection for private communications data, such as email, because users expose that information to third-party service providers like Gmail or Microsoft. And some courts have applied this logic to cell phone location data, which users must reveal to phone companies. Nonetheless, that doctrine is nearing its 40th birthday, and it is possible that the Court will have another telephone moment in the not-too-distant future.\\n\\nUntil that time comes, states are taking it upon themselves to update privacy laws. Legislatures in Minnesota, New Mexico, New York and Virginia are pushing to require law enforcement to get a warrant to access private data like email, texts, and location information. California's Electronic Communications Privacy Act, signed in October, is considered a national model.\\n\\nIllinois and Michigan are introducing legislation that would require a warrant for police to use cell phone trackers -- often called Stingrays -- that mimic cell phone towers and trick nearby phones into revealing private data. Nebraska's measure would ban their use entirely. Michigan and Nebraska are also introducing bills to set more stringent rules for automated license plate readers, or ALPRs, which can sweep up location information on millions of innocent drivers and send it to a database for long-term retention and data-mining.\\n\\nHaving state legislatures set policy will ensure greater clarity for both residents and police. Courts often confront privacy claims in the context of criminal cases when defendants invoke the Fourth Amendment. But the current constitutional test -- whether there is a reasonable expectation of privacy in the data acquired by law enforcement -- can be vague and difficult to administer. Under this standard, for example, courts have concluded that individuals have little privacy in some of their most cherished activities, even placing inordinate weight on the availability of a specific technology or the wording of a cellphone agreement. Privacy-protective state law can forestall this process by requiring a warrant or other process up front, and by adding more muscle to the constitutional argument that drivers, cell phone owners, and others do not abandon their privacy the moment they step outside.\\n\\nToday's announcements offer the chance to guard the privacy of millions of Americans. They should also spur Congress and the courts to create consistent national protections. When states representing nearly one-third of the population take steps to enhance privacy, it sends a strong signal to federal courts and national policymakers that it is time to update our laws and our Constitutional protections for the 21st century."}
{"original": "Speaker [Paul] Ryan has talked about his interest in tackling poverty, President Obama noted in his State of the Union speech. America is about giving everybody willing to work a chance, a hand up, and I'd welcome a serious discussion about strategies we can all support, like expanding tax cuts for low-income workers who don't have children.\\n\\nIn fact, President Obama and Speaker Ryan not only agree on this point, but they have nearly identical proposals: expanding the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) for childless adults -- the one group that the federal tax code taxes into poverty -- to make it a more effective work incentive. That's good news, and policymakers would be wise to follow their lead.\\n\\nThe EITC has long enjoyed bipartisan support because it encourages and rewards the work of low- and moderate-income people. Rigorous research has cemented its pro-work reputation: during the 1990s, EITC expansions did more to raise employment among single mothers with children than either the 1996 welfare reform law or the strong economy, a well-regarded study found.\\n\\nThe EITC, however, largely excludes workers who aren't raising children and completely excludes them if they're under age 25. A young man just out of school who's in an entry-level job gets nothing, and a middle-aged woman with grown kids who works for the minimum wage at the local nursing home gets close to nothing.\\n\\nPresident Obama and Speaker Ryan propose to change that -- in almost exactly the same way. They would phase in the credit more quickly as a worker's earnings rise, raise the maximum credit to about $1,000, and lower the eligibility age from 25 to 21.\\n\\nThese changes would make a big difference. Currently, as the chart shows, a childless worker with poverty-level wages filing their taxes now for 2015 would receive an EITC of $172, not nearly enough to offset the $1,188 he or she owes in income tax and the employee share of payroll taxes (to say nothing of the employer share, which economists generally agree ultimately falls on workers in the form of lower wages). The proposals from Obama and Ryan would give that worker an $841 EITC, a major step towards lifting the worker back to the poverty line.\\n\\nFor a childless adult working full time at the minimum wage, the proposals from Obama and Ryan would boost the EITC from just $23 to $542.\\n\\nAll told, the proposals from Obama and Ryan would lift about half a million people out of poverty and make another 10.1 million people less poor, the Treasury estimates. They also would increase the reward to work for people doing important jobs across our economy, as the table shows.\\n\\nPolicymakers found common ground last year to make permanent critical improvements to the EITC and low-income part of the Child Tax Credit that were scheduled to expire in 2017. This year, they should take up President Obama and Speaker Ryan's proposals and fix the glaring hole in the EITC for childless workers.\\n\\nThis post originally appeared on Off the Charts, the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities' blog."}

{"original": "WASHINGTON (AP) — President-elect Joe Biden will release the most available COVID-19 vaccine doses to speed delivery to more people, a reversal of the Trump administration policy, his office said Friday.\\n\\nThe president-elect believes we must accelerate the distribution of the vaccine while continuing to ensure the Americans who need it most get it as soon as possible, spokesman T.J. Ducklo said in a statement. Biden supports releasing available doses immediately, and believes the government should stop holding back vaccine supply so we can get more shots in Americans' arms now.\\n\\nUnder the Trump administration's approach, the government has been holding back a supply of vaccines to guarantee that people can get a second shot, which provides maximum protection against COVID-19. Both the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines require a second shot about three weeks after the first vaccination. One-shot vaccines are still undergoing testing.\\n\\nASSOCIATED PRESS President-elect Joe Biden speaks during an event at The Queen theater in Wilmington, Del., Thursday, Jan. 7, 2021, to announce key nominees for the Justice Department. (AP Photo/Susan Walsh)\\n\\nAfter a glow of hope when the first vaccines were approved last month, the nation's inoculation campaign has gotten off to a slow start. Of 29.4 million doses distributed, about 5.9 million have been administered, or 27%, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\\n\\nBiden has already indicated his displeasure. In a speech last week, before his election victory was certified by Congress, the president-elect said he intends to speed up vaccinations by having the federal government take a stronger role to make sure that vaccines are not only available, but that shots are going into the arms of more Americans.\\n\\nThe Trump administration plan to distribute vaccines is falling behind—far behind, Biden said. If it continues to move as it is now, it's going to take years, not months, to vaccinate the American people.\\n\\nThe American Hospital Association estimates that the nation would need to vaccinate 1.8 million people a day, every day, from Jan. 1 to May 31, to reach the goal of having widespread immunity by the summer. That's also called herd immunity and would involve vaccinating at least 75% of the population.\\n\\nWithout spelling out details, Biden said his administration will put in place a much more aggressive vaccination campaign, with greater federal involvement and leadership, and the goal of administering 100 million shots in the first 100 days.\\n\\nHe said he and Vice-president elect Kamala Harris have been talking with state and local leaders about a coordinated approach that meshes the efforts of governments at all levels. Among the specifics: opening up vaccination centers and sending mobile vaccine units to hard-to-reach communities.\\n\\nThe top thing is that there's not a coordinated national plan, Biden adviser Dr. Rick Bright told The Associated Press.\\n\\nDucklo said Biden will share additional details next week on how his administration will engage the pandemic when he takes office on Jan. 20.\\n\\nBiden's plan to change the vaccine distribution plan was first reported by CNN."}
{"original": "Here are five coronavirus myths we need to shut down – and what we should be doing to protect ourselves instead:\\n\\nThe internet allows us to stay up to date with every possible update on the virus, but researching something as complex as a novel virus can get confusing pretty quickly – especially when certain corners of the web are full of myths, misinformation, and full-blown conspiracy theories.\\n\\nA coronavirus endemic is now inevitable, scientists have said, and the government have released details of sweeping measures that could be brought in if or when the outbreak worsens.\\n\\nGroups of people wearing masks – in airport terminals, supermarkets, quarantined streets – have already become the defining image of the Covid-19 coverage, and even in areas with very low, or even zero, cases, masks in all their variations are selling out.\\n\\nGoogle Trends shows that a tiny majority of worldwide internet users were searching for coronavirus mask prior to January 20, 2019 – but by February 26 searches for the term had rocketed, including in the UK.\\n\\nSUBSCRIBE AND FOLLOW Get the latest on politics, news, community voices and lifestyle.

While they might be effective at preventing contact with contaminated liquid, they won't hold back small particles in the air from coughs or sneezes, and so aren't effective protection from Covid-19.\\n\\nAccording to the US government's Food and Drug Administration, the mask might help reduce exposure of your saliva and respiratory secretions to others – but there's no official advice on whether a mask worn by those already infected would slow the spread of coronavirus.\\n\\nIn fact, wearing a mask could increase your risk of contracting the virus, infection prevention specialist Eli Perencevich told Forbes.\\n\\nWearing a mask is tricky because it can create a false sense of security, Dr Perencevich said. If you don't wash your hands before you take off the mask and after you take off your mask, you could increase your risk.\\n\\nHealthcare professionals are trained specifically in how to wear the masks, but if a member of the general public wears one incorrectly then they risk trapping exactly the particles they are trying to keep out inside the mask.\\n\\nBest practice for preventing the spread of the infection is:\\n\\nCover your mouth and nose with a tissue or your sleeve (not your hands) when you cough or sneeze\\n\\nPut used tissues in the bin immediately\\n\\nWash your hands with soap and water often – use hand sanitiser gel if soap and water are not available\\n\\nTry to avoid close contact with people who are unwell\\n\\nAvoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth if your hands are not clean.\\n\\n2. Coronavirus can be cured by a 'Miracle Mineral Solution' (MMS)\\n\\nWidespread access to the internet means that a significant proportion of the global population can stay well-informed about rapidly-developing situations such as the coronavirus outbreak, but it can also provide a space for dangerous conspiracy theories and 'cures' to flourish.\\n\\nOne dangerous myth propagated in more questionable sections of the internet is that of a supposed cure, commonly referred to as MMS (Miracle Mineral Solution).\\n\\nConspiracy theorist Jordan Sather, who shares information through his social media relating to the Q-Anon pro-Donald Trump far-right conspiracy theory, is one proponent of the solution, alongside countless other online personalities who claim the solution as a cure for autism and diseases such as cancer, the New Statesman reports.\\n\\nIn reality, MMS consists of 28% sodium chlorite – a chemical compound most commonly known as bleach.\\n\\nWhilst it might be effective at stripping germs from your household surfaces, it's in no way safe to consume. Ingestion is likely to cause severe vomiting, diarrhoea, and in some cases acute liver failure.\\n\\nJust to reiterate, it's definitely not a 'cure' for a viral infection such as Covid-19.\\n\\n3. Seasonal flu is more likely to kill you\\n\\nYou might have overheard someone saying something along the lines of oh well, the regular flu kills more people each year than coronavirus has.\\n\\nSo far that's technically true – coronavirus has only been around for a few months and according to Public Health England around 8,000 people die each year from seasonal flu so the number of deaths is higher – but that doesn't mean the mortality rate for coronavirus isn't higher.\\n\\nResearchers are currently working on the basis that around 1% of people who contract coronavirus will die, with a best guess of nine people out of every 1,000 cases, the BBC reports.\\n\\nThe likelihood of dying from Covid-19 is dependent on a myriad of factors; including age, sex, health, and how good the health service looking after you is.\\n\\nWorking out the chances of death from coronavirus is not a simple process, not least because an unknown number of people with mild symptoms won't see a health professional, but may pass the infection on to someone else who may be at higher risk.\\n\\nAs with coronavirus, it's difficult to establish what percentage of people with flu die each year as many don't visit the doctor with mild symptoms, but estimates suggest that around 0.1% of people with seasonal flu die each year, the New York Times reports.\\n\\nWorking from those figures, death rates for coronavirus are ten times than what they are for seasonal flu.\\n\\n4. Vaccines for pneumonia and flu will protect you from Covid-19\\n\\nNo, vaccines such as the flu jab – which more than 25m people in the UK are offered each year – will not protect you against coronavirus.\\n\\nGuidance on the World Health Organisation's (WHO) website states Vaccines against pneumonia, such as pneumococcal vaccine and Haemophilus influenza type B (Hib) vaccine, do not provide protection against the new coronavirus.\\n\\nThe organisation however does recommend all eligible members of the public to get vaccinated against respiratory illnesses.\\n\\nResources are already being poured into developing a vaccine for coronavirus – and researchers are already testing potential vaccines on animal subjects, BBC news reports.\\n\\nIf those trials are successful they could be trialled on humans within months, but there's no quick way of mass producing a safe vaccine.\\n\\nThere are four coronaviruses that can already infect humans and cause the common cold. None of them yet have vaccines.\\n\\nFor the time being, the best way of avoiding coronavirus is to take preventative measures such as maintaining a high standard of personal hygiene.\\n\\n5. You can get coronavirus from household pets\\n\\nCoronavirus is believed to have originated in a wet market in Wuhan, central China, where humans were in close quarters with a huge variety of animals both alive and dead.\\n\\nIt is there that scientists believe the virus leapt from animals to humans – but that doesn't mean you'll catch coronavirus from your household cat or dog.\\n\\nThere have been reports of a dog in Hong Kong being quarantined after testing 'weak positive' for the virus, but WHO maintain on their website that there is no evidence that pets can be infected with novel coronavirus.\\n\\nHowever, their website states, it is always a good idea to wash your hands with soap and water after contact with pets. This protects you against various common bacteria such as E.coli and Salmonella that can pass between pets and humans."}
{"original": "Hooray! Your dear friend just got engaged! However… now that she's asked you be a bridesmaid, you're feeling a little less celebratory. If you're not entirely sure you're ready to commit to the bridal party obligations, you can, in fact, politely decline. While it will probably be a bit awkward no matter the situation, here are some guidelines for declining without ruining your friendship forever.\\n\\nTWENTY20\\n\\n1. You're worried about the time commitment\\n\\nPerhaps you have a lot going on right now (like traveling for work or planning your parents' anniversary party or even being a bridesmaid for someone else). Let your friend know how honored you are to be asked, but that you just don't think you'd be able to realistically spend the time necessary to be a good bridesmaid. Most importantly, convey that you don't want your busy life to detract in any way from her special day.\\n\\nTWENTY20\\n\\n2. You're strapped for cash\\n\\nWeddings are not cheap — especially for the bridal party. It's perfectly acceptable to tell a bride you simply can't afford to splurge on a dress, bachelorette party and a flight to her destination wedding right now. Just try to avoid any passive aggressive notes that will make her feel worse, I would be if you didn't choose a $500 bridesmaid abomination. Instead, you might have to be a bit more open about your finances than you might want to be. But your openness will help your friend empathize with your situation more.\\n\\nSIMON1969/GETTY IMAGES\\n\\n3. You're pregnant or trying\\n\\nThe dress alteration alone would be challenging, not to mention standing in front of a crowd for the entire reception with swollen feet and a baby who won't stop kicking. Um, no, thank you. If you feel comfortable doing so, tell her the truth. If she's ever experienced someone close to her go through those trying nine months, or if she's been pregnant herself, she'll likely understand how overwhelming it can be.\\n\\nIMAGE SOURCE/GETTY IMAGES\\n\\n4. You're in 20 other wedding parties\\n\\nOK, maybe 20 is a stretch, but if you've already committed to bridesmaid duties multiple times this year, her wedding might be impossible to fit in with your already packed calendar. Again, reiterate how honored you are to be asked and offer to participate in some other way, i.e., going with her to look at dresses, DIYing something for the reception or being on hand to help on the day of the wedding.\\n\\nZINKEVYCH/GETTY IMAGES\\n\\n5. You don't actually like the bride\\n\\nIt seems harsh, but hear us out. If you don't enjoy spending time with her on an average, humdrum day, then you definitely won't like hanging out during her peak emotional state. And she might not like it either — you think you have a great poker face, but your annoyance and discomfort are totally seeping through. Do the bride a favor and let her be surrounded by people who really do want to be there. As for what to tell her, perhaps honesty is not the best policy, in this case. Spare her feelings and use one of the above reasons instead."}
{"original": "Mary feels a rush of adrenaline after reading the perfect candidate's qualifications. You know the feeling -- realizing your expensive, time-consuming search could finally be over.\\n\\nHowever, Mary's moment of elation quickly drops to a pit in her stomach. One, two, three, she counted. Three jobs in four years. Another job hopping resume found its way to her desk and another quickly hits the 'no' pile.\\n\\nHiring costs an immense amount. That's why when a candidate with job hopping tendencies and perfectly aligned qualifications comes along, it's important to understand the positives behind them leaving previous employers.\\n\\nHere's what you need to consider before sending job hoppers to the 'no' pile again:\\n\\nOpens up the talent pool\\n\\nMary's sense of relief after thinking her candidate search was over stems largely from a scarce talent pool. She isn't the only employer having trouble finding qualified new hires. In fact, a 2015 ManpowerGroup survey revealed 38 percent of employers had difficulty filling jobs globally that year.\\n\\nA talent shortage means employers need to be even more open-minded about the resumes they're willing to place on the interview pile. Immediately denying candidates based on their apparent job hopping tendencies limits the number of qualified candidates during the interview process and may be costing companies their next best employee.\\n\\nThanks to other companies having the same hesitation, job hoppers may be easier to recruit. Open up your recruiting network to allow job hoppers into your interviews, and they just might surprise you.\\n\\nBe ready to ask detailed questions about why they've had so many jobs in the last few years. Why did they leave? Are they currently looking for long-term employment? If offered this position, what is one reason they would consider moving on?\\n\\nHighly skilled employees\\n\\nJob hoppers get stereotyped frequently by recruiters. Mary, for example, tossed a highly qualified candidate aside simply because she assumed they frequently left jobs because they were bored, didn't allow enough time to actually like their position, or don't like following company policy.\\n\\nIt's inevitable that some job hoppers fall into these undesirable categories. However, many leave for reasons most employers understand, appreciate, and even encourage, such as outgrowing a position, they were offered higher pay somewhere else, or they discovered their true passion.\\n\\nNo matter the reason for leaving, thanks to many job titles and task lists, job hoppers acquire a wide variety of skills. Among this long list is the ability to quickly acclimate to a new environment and retain information.\\n\\nUse job hoppers' qualities to your organization's advantage. During interviews, have candidates run through practice tasks that new hires will are required to do. Assessing if their previous experience has equipped them to catch on quicker than other candidates will let you know if they're worth hiring.\\n\\nIf you find they are, thanks to their differing skills, this job hopper turned new hire may grow and advance at the rate of the company's best employees.\\n\\nKnow what they want -- and what they don't\\n\\nWith experience comes wisdom. Moving between multiple positions and companies affords many job hoppers the opportunity to discover what they want out of their career.\\n\\nAfter having a couple jobs within three to four years, they might be applying to this position because they've narrowed down their list of wants. Working among many different personality types makes them more secure in their ideal company culture, and experience in many roles and fields gives their passions direction.\\n\\nJosh Tolan is the CEO of Spark Hire, a video interview solution used by more than 2,000 companies across the globe.

The wireless network at José Martí International Airport only covers the boarding area. But a woman presses her whole body against the opaque window that separates the travelers' area to communicate with human traffickers who are holding her daughter in Mexico.\\n\\nFor half any hour the lady reveals her despair. I don't have that much money, if I had it I would send it right now, she prays through IMO. The videochat is cut several times by the poor quality of the connection On the other side, the voice of a man repeats, without backing off, Three hundred dollars so she can return on Tuesday.\\n\\nThe woman wipes her tears and unsuccessfully asks for a reduction. Nearby, a maid who cleans the bathroom passes by, idly dragging a cart with cleaning supplies. A customs official walks by, absorbed, and pretends he is not listening to the disturbing request projected from the screen of the phone, Don't kill her, don't kill her.\\n\\nThe scene happens in a place crowded with people, most of whom are passengers about to board a transatlantic flight, or a new commercial route to the United States, and there are also the family members and friends who have come to see them off. No one shows any sign of hearing the drama developing a few feet away.\\n\\nA tourist tosses back a beer just as the woman is asking the man for half an hour to collect the money. She starts the race against the clock. She calls several contacts from her IMO address book, but the first four, at least, don't answer. On the fifth try, a shrill voice on the other end says, Hello.\\n\\nI need a huge favor, you can't say no, the lady stammers. But the head that can be seen on the screen shakes from side to side. Are you crazy? And if after you pay this money they don't let her go? asks the voice. The tension makes the hand holding the phone start to tremble and her granddaughter, who has accompanied her, helps her hold on to it.\\n\\nSeveral more calls and the money is not forthcoming. Finally a serious voice says yes, he can lend the money if the woman will pay it back in two installments to his sister in Havana. The mother agrees, promises she can repay every cent, although it sounds like a formula to get out of a bind. The man believes her.\\n\\nNow they must arrange the details. The victim doesn't have a bank account but the mother will send information about how to send the money. This is how the kidnappers get paid. Only then will they allow her to fly from Cancun to Havana, or at least that is what they promise.\\n\\nIn the middle of last year the Mexican authorities shut down a network trafficking in undocumented people from Cuba that operated in this tourist area in the Mexican state of Qunitana Roo. The end of the wet foot/dry foot policy this January has left many migrants in the hands of the coyotes, who don't hesitate to turn to extortion to make up for the reduction in the flow of Cubans and, as a result, their loss of earnings.\\n\\nThe wifi signal is lost altogether, but the mother is feeling relieved. She was in a large group, about 20 people, she tells her granddaughter. A simple calculation allows us to know how much the captors will earn on freeing all those they are holding.\\n\\nNothing ends with the delivery of the money. She is going to want to go again, concludes the mother, the instant she hangs up from the last videochat. I can't stand it here, I can't she repeats, while walking toward the escalator filled with smiling and tanned tourists.\\n\\n\\n\\n14ymedio, Cuba's first independent daily digital news outlet, published directly from the island, is available in Spanish here.

{"original": "President Donald Trump on Wednesday walked out of a meeting in the situation room with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) to discuss the partial government shutdown that has now lasted 19 days.\\n\\nTrump posted about the meeting on Twitter, calling it a total waste of time. The Democratic leaders had begun by stressing the need to reopen the government.\\n\\nI asked what is going to happen in 30 days if I quickly open things up, are you going to approve Border Security which includes a Wall or Steel Barrier? Nancy said, NO, the president tweeted.\\n\\nTrump has made his proposed border wall the sole focus of the shutdown: Unless he can secure some $5 billion for the project, he will not agree to any budget proposal that would fully reopen the government.\\n\\nHe continued: I said bye-bye, nothing else works.\\n\\nJust left a meeting with Chuck and Nancy, a total waste of time. I asked what is going to happen in 30 days if I quickly open things up, are you going to approve Border Security which includes a Wall or Steel Barrier? Nancy said, NO. I said bye-bye, nothing else works! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 9, 2019\\n\\nSchumer confirmed Trump's version of events, telling reporters gathered in front of the White House, Well, unfortunately the president just got up and walked out after Pelosi said she would not agree to funding for the wall.\\n\\nHe just got up and he said, 'Then we have nothing to discuss.' And he just walked out. Again, we saw a temper tantrum because he couldn't get his way, Schumer said.\\n\\nAccording to a source familiar with the meeting, the Senate minority leader had confronted Trump in the situation room about the human cost of the partial shutdown, which has left some federal employees with diminishing means to pay for basic necessities.\\n\\nYou're using people as leverage. Why won't you open the government and stop hurting people? Schumer said.\\n\\nAccording to the source, Trump replied: Because then you won't give me what I want.\\n\\nOutside the White House, Pelosi echoed Schumer's message, telling reporters that she did not believe Trump fully appreciated the financial impact on the federal workers who have been showing up to work without getting paid, or who have not been able to work at all since the shutdown began just before Christmas.\\n\\nThe president seems to be insensitive to that. He thinks maybe they could just ask their father for more money, Pelosi said. But they can't.\\n\\nIf you don't understand financial insecurity, then you would have a policy that takes pride in saying, 'I'm going to keep the government shut down for months or years unless you totally agree to my position,' she said.\\n\\nAsked whether the president acted out of anger, as alleged by Schumer, Vice President Mike Pence said he remembered Trump behaving calmly.\\n\\nThe president walked into the room and passed out candy. I don't recall him ever raising his voice or slamming his hand, Pence said.\\n\\nThe vice president told reporters that the Democratic leaders also objected to Trump's characterization of the situation at the southern border, which Pence referred to as a humanitarian and security crisis. Pelosi, Pence said, began to argue whether we even had a crisis or whether facts are true.\\n\\nThe Trump administration ― including the vice president ― has invited sharp criticism this week for its numerous misleading claims about what is happening on the U.S. border with Mexico to justify the proposed wall. White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders claimed in a Sunday interview on Fox News Sunday that 4,000 known or suspected terrorists had come into the U.S. illegally, prompting host Chris Wallace to fact-check her; the figure stemmed from people captured at airports. Pence cited the same misleading statistic in a Tuesday morning interview with Good Morning America.\\n\\nIn his Tuesday evening address to the nation, Trump repeated many of the same lies and half-truths he has long told in regard to the wall, falsely claiming that Democrats want open borders and painting the migrants arriving at the border to seek asylum as dangerous criminals.\\n\\nHayley Miller contributed reporting.

{"original": "Admission to New York City's Metropolitan Museum of Art is free ― technically. The institution promotes a suggested entrance toll of $25, but, after a few lawsuits, it's become abundantly clear that patrons can in fact pay nothing and still revel in the glory of art history.\\n\\nThat could change for some, though. According to The New York Times, the Met, which is currently embroiled in a multimillion-dollar budget deficit snafu and accompanying staff shakeup, has been in talks with NYC officials about potentially charging an admission fee only for visitors who live outside of New York.\\n\\nThe move would, as the NYT and several other outlets since have pointed out, be controversial. The Met is a public institution, once mandated by a 1893 state law to offer free admission at least five days and two evenings per week. (Since 2013, it adheres to an amendment to its lease with the city that allows it to renegotiate the pay-as-you-wish policy in the future.) It receives annual grants from NYC ― without paying taxes or rent ― now totaling $26 million. That amount, however, covers only approximately 8 percent of the museum's $332 million annual operating costs.\\n\\nIn the face of a $10 million deficit that could balloon to $40 million in the next year and a half, according to the Wall Street Journal, instituting a two-tiered admission structure could alleviate some financial pressure. The Met's current blanket suggested admission structure generated $39 million in the 2016 fiscal year, amounting to 13 percent of the museum's overall revenue. The NYT speculates that charging tourists would generate tens of millions of dollars more.\\n\\nReports in 2013 noted that six in 10 visitors shirked the full $25 fee, many of whom were locals familiar with the then-recommended nature of the fee. (After the aforementioned lawsuits, the Met settled upon slightly clearer language for its fee signage: suggested.) It's the unwitting out-of-towners who get yoked into chucking up the full price, The Atlantic wrote, noting that third-party ticket websites ― like Groupon ― didn't always communicate that fees were not mandatory.\\n\\nWhen asked whether or not talks concerning the admissions structure switch were indeed taking place, a representative from the museums sent HuffPost the following statement:\\n\\nOur admissions policy is one of many components of the Museum's operating budget, all of which are continuously under review and refinement. The Met and the City are partners, and always in conversation on how The Met can continue to thrive and best serve all of New York City and beyond. While we have started preliminary discussions about our admissions policies, we have not submitted an official, detailed request.\\n\\nA request for comment from the City of New York has yet to be answered.\\n\\nWhy is the Met in debt? There are several potential contributing factors: namely, financial mismanagement amid previously rising salaries, staff increases and expansion and rebranding plans. Plus, visitors ― particularly young ones ― are indeed paying less at the door, which, according to Daniel H. Weiss, the Met's president, matters. A decline of 30 to 40 cents per person is material, he told the Times.\\n\\nA two-tiered ticket system is hardly unheard of; pay-as-you-wish is more common. Some major museums like the Art Institute of Chicago allow locals in the city and state of Illinois a discounted entrance fee. Still, the response to the free-for-locals-only suggestion for the Met has been met with some criticism.\\n\\nEspecially at a time when our President is fueling his supporters' xenophobia, the last thing we need is to make foreigners (let alone fellow citizens) feel less welcome at our country's premier repository for world culture by instituting a two-tier admissions structure, arts writer Lee Rosenbaum wrote on her blog.\\n\\nMayor Bill de Blasio, on the other hand, has endorsed the decision, explaining during a news conference on Wednesday that he thought it would be fair to impose a fee specifically geared toward non-city residents.\\n\\nI'm a big fan of Russian oligarchs paying more to get into the Met, he added.\\n\\nThis piece has been updated to include comments from Mayor Bill de Blasio."}
{"original": "In the first episode of NBC's Mr. Mayor, bumbling businessman-turned-mayor of Los Angeles Neil Bremer (Ted Danson) is worried about getting canceled after botching a policy announcement and making some political enemies on his first day in office.\\n\\nI don't like being told I'm problematic, he says to his chief strategist, Tommy Tomás (Mike Cabellon).\\n\\nCancellation comes for us all, Tommy tells him.\\n\\nI avoided all the mines in the minefield, and I am still getting crucified, Bremer says. Am I allowed to say 'crucified'?\\n\\nOf course. It was a different time ... one second ago, Tommy says.\\n\\nThe obvious commentary on so-called cancel culture quickly becomes tiresome. These days, watching a show set in the world of politics and government is already difficult, and Mr. Mayor, co-created by Tina Fey and her frequent collaborator Robert Carlock, is just … aggressively fine. Although the workplace comedy's first two episodes, which premiered Thursday, are underwhelming compared to Fey's prior sitcoms (30 Rock and Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt), Mr. Mayor is already emblematic of both the best and worst of the Tina Fey TV universe. Her shows are great when their densely packed jokes and plotlines involve punching up, when the subjects of their mockery have ample power. But when the jokes and plotlines punch down and take unnecessary digs, the shows become more frustrating to watch.\\n\\nThere are several other cringey moments in the first episode of Mr. Mayor. Bremer has landed in hot water because he proposed a ban on plastic straws, which sparks criticism from a political rival, progressive councilwoman Arpi Meskimen (Holly Hunter). Meskimen teams up with a group of local disability rights activists, who hold a protest against the ban. The show weirdly mocks the activists, via a line of dialogue that does not serve any narrative purpose. In another scene, Bremer's communications director, Jayden Kwapis (Bobby Moynihan), tells the mayor that Meskimen supports referring to coyotes as mini-wolves because she believes using the word coyote is cultural appropriation. The joke doesn't really land and comes off as if it's dismissing actual forms of cultural appropriation.\\n\\nColleen Hayes/NBC/NBCU Photo Bank via Getty Images Danson and Holly Hunter (right) as Arpi Meskimen in Mr. Mayor.\\n\\nFey has never been great at addressing similar misfires in her earlier work. Last summer, at her request, NBC removed from streaming platforms several episodes of 30 Rock in which characters wore blackface. Fey issued an apology, but it referred euphemistically to race-changing makeup. In addition, she avoided a real conversation about why the show thought blackface was acceptable in the first place.\\n\\nBlackface in 30 Rock was only the tip of the iceberg. The show had a long record of racist, transphobic and ableist jokes and storylines. The throwaway bit about disability rights activists in Mr. Mayor is reminiscent of how 30 Rock often made disabled people the subjects of ridicule. For instance, in one episode in Season 3, Kenneth the Page (Jack McBrayer) has a crush on a woman who is blind. He is too shy to talk to her, so he enlists Tracy (Tracy Morgan) to pretend to be him, with the joke being that she can't tell them apart.\\n\\nMore recently, Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt featured a slew of racist stereotypes in its portrayals of Asian and Native American characters. In the show's second season, Fey appeared to respond to criticism by writing an episode mocking internet criticism. Titus (Tituss Burgess) becomes embroiled in controversy when he takes a role as a geisha wearing yellowface. He gets called out online by an activist group called Respectable Asian Portrayals in Entertainment (RAPE). The activists are portrayed as too fervent, overly sensitive and rushing to judgment. (Perhaps the first episode of Mr. Mayor is a similar attempt at meta-commentary.)\\n\\nFey's shows excel when they find clever ways to point out the absurdities of people and institutions that already have plenty of power. Over the years, the part of 30 Rock that has held up the best is its skewering of the business of television and corporate culture more broadly. The show's profusion of jokes about indecipherable business jargon, product placement, company mergers and the boundless confidence of mediocre white men often went over my head when I watched it as a teenager. But now that I'm an adult working at a media company owned by a telecom company, they seem much more relevant and more laugh-out-loud funny.\\n\\nThough not as sharp and cutting as 30 Rock, Mr. Mayor finds more of its stride when it makes Bremer's mediocrity and overconfidence the punchline. For example, at his first press conference as mayor, Bremer explains that he made his fortune selling billboard space. (One of his bestselling billboards, he says, was For Your Consideration: Nurse Jackie — an example of joke density, another signature element of the Tina Fey TV universe.)\\n\\nUnlike the first episode, the second episode lands much better by poking fun at the photo ops and ribbon cuttings that fill Bremer's days as mayor. His staff advises him not to do anything that could turn him into an embarrassing meme.\\n\\nThat's why we avoid bathing suits, dancing at a cultural day, and above all, eating on camera, Jayden says.\\n\\nBut sure enough, in one of the many gaffes he commits that day, Bremer visits a school and eats a slice of pizza (on camera, of course) by rolling it up and holding it like a burrito. Earlier in the day, he cuts the ribbon at the grand opening of a weed dispensary and then eats too many weed gummies.\\n\\nDanson and Hunter are delightful as the show's chief adversaries. Meskimen is rightly displeased at how Bremer was able to coast into the mayorship because he is a rich, mediocre, white man.\\n\\nWe can find some common ground here. We're both the same age, Bremer tells Meskimen after the plastic straw ban debacle.\\n\\nI am 10 years younger than you, Meskimen responds. But I'm perceived as a kooky old woman, and you're still a sexually viable man.\\n\\nDespite the sitcom's unevenness so far, their sparring makes Mr. Mayor worth watching because it keeps the focus on Bremer's ridiculous foibles. Hopefully, the show will continue to lean into their rivalry, rather than veering off into more, uh, problematic territory.\\n\\nMr. Mayor airs Thursdays at 8 p.m. ET on NBC."}
{"original": "Los Angeles public school teachers went on strike on Monday after 20 months of failed negotiations for higher pay, greater school funding and more support staff.\\n\\nUnlike many of the teacher strikes that gripped red states in 2018, the LA strike pits the massive United Teachers Los Angeles union against the Los Angeles Unified School District, which runs public schools in the city of Los Angeles and many surrounding communities. The labor dispute reflects a bitter Democratic Party rift on education policy that splits unions and their allies from proponents of charter schools, whose influence on the LA school board has helped precipitate the strike.\\n\\nA number of high-profile Democratic elected officials have nonetheless come out on the side of Los Angeles teachers, including Sen.

{"original": "Adrian Wyld/CP Foreign Affairs Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne updates reporters on the evacuation of Canadians from China in Ottawa on Feb. 6, 2020.\\n\\nOTTAWA — No one should construe the co-operation between Canada and China on the novel coronavirus outbreak as a sign that relations between them are returning to normal, Foreign Affairs Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne said Friday.\\n\\nCanada has been able to repatriate 550 Canadians since the outbreak with the help of Japanese and Chinese officials, Champagne said in a major speech in Montreal.\\n\\nHowever, it should not be inferred that Canada's relationship with China has returned to normal, the minister said in an English translation of an address given mainly in French to the Montreal Council on Foreign Relations.\\n\\nWatch: Champagne explains why coronavirus-infected Canadians can't return home\\n\\nThe speech outlined Champagne's priorities on foreign policy in an increasingly volatile world. Champagne also elaborated on Canada's campaign to win a two-year seat on the powerful United Nations Security Council, citing the need to strengthen the international institutions that were born out of the Second World War as one the main reasons for running.\\n\\nCanada wants to use its seat at that table to help address the challenges posed by rising populism and trade protectionism, the erosion of human rights, the selective application of international law and the shifting of political and economic power to Asia, he said.\\n\\nWe are seeing the emergence of a multipolar world with new epicentres of influence and competition over ideas and models of governance, he said. Around the world, human rights are increasingly under threat.\\n\\nChampagne's top declared priorities include winning the freedom of Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor from their arbitrary imprisonment by China and pushing Iran to release the black boxes recovered from the Ukrainian jetliner it shot down last month so they can be properly examined in France.\\n\\nHowever difficult and complex it may be, Canadians know that our relationship with China remains important in many ways, he said. You have to learn to live with this complexity.\\n\\nAs for the plane crash near Tehran, Canada had to scramble to respond because it had no formal diplomatic relations with Iran. I believe in dialogue even if it means having difficult conversations. After all, that's the nature of diplomacy. Sometimes you do need to have difficult conversations.\\n\\nHe called the crash that killed all 176 people on board, including 57 Canadians, a tragedy that illustrates once again the importance of diplomacy and necessity to adapt quickly to circumstances. While Iran has been co-operative in helping repatriate the remains of Canadian crash victims, the regime needs to more, he said.\\n\\nMuch work remains to be done in order for Iran to fully assume responsibility for this very tragic event, including a full and transparent investigation, the need for Iran to get the black boxes downloaded and analyzed without any further delays and a swift compensation settlement for the families of the victims, he said.\\n\\nThe vexing challenges posed by China and Iran come at a time when Canada is campaigning for that seat on the UN Security Council, an opportunity Champagne said would demonstrate Canada's leadership in confronting the great challenges and crises of our time — the rising threats to the world's multilateral institutions.\\n\\nUN Security Council 'among the most important tables'\\n\\nDespite a full slate of international crises to deal with since the start of the year, Champagne has stepped up his campaigning for the UN seat in travels across Africa, Europe and the Caribbean. The June vote will pit Canada against Norway and Ireland for two available seats for a two-year term that begins next year.\\n\\nCanada will need to win the support of at least 128 countries in the secret ballot at the UN General Assembly. Champagne cited Canada's contributions to the Lima Group on the Venezuela crisis, its leadership of a dozen countries on an initiative to strengthen the World Trade Organization, its efforts to rid the world's oceans of plastic pollution and its leadership on championing media freedom.\\n\\nIndeed, the UN Security Council is still among the most important tables in the world where major decisions and discussions on peace and security are taking place, he said.

{"original": "metamorworks via Getty Images If a job listing is looking for a self-starter who can work well under pressure in a fast-paced environment, there's a message in there about the company's priorities.\\n\\nBefore you apply for a job, you probably first read a listing that includes overused keywords and vague mission statements like We are seeking a self-starter who can work well under pressure in a fast-paced environment.\\n\\nThose common job listing phrases can inadvertently reveal a lot about the company's priorities, its ideal job candidate, and who belongs or doesn't in the organization's culture. Here's how recruiters and job search coaches say you should decode them:\\n\\n1. Fast-paced environment\\n\\nJob search strategist Melanie L. Denny said this can be code for a heavy workload. It typically means there's a lot of work to do and things are always busy, so be ready to work quickly because almost everything is time-sensitive, she said. You'll have to learn fast and work fast and your job may be in jeopardy if you can't keep up.\\n\\nIf this sounds like the worst job environment ever, think twice before applying.\\n\\n2. Self-starter\\n\\nA request for a self-starter could mean that you'll be given little training and have to come up with ideas on your own, Denny said. She said it's a popular listing in startups since leaders are likely still working out the specifics of business operations and procedures.\\n\\nThis could be considered a red flag for someone who is relatively new to the field and still [needs] training. But it's ideal for a leader who has similar experience under his/her belt and is ready to execute his ideas with little to no direction, Denny said.\\n\\nJob search coach Ashley Watkins said if a company asks you to be a self-starter, you need to go beyond just self-identifying as one in your job application. Back it up by sharing times you initiated a process or took the lead when your supervisor wasn't there, Watkins said.\\n\\n3. Be flexible or agile\\n\\nBoth flexibility and agility are subjective requirements and you may need to ask for clarity. Sometimes they'll say they want you to be flexible, but it's more about compromise than it is about being flexible, Watkins said. And when I say compromise, I mean you're always on the losing end of that compromise, meaning that you're going to do whatever they ask, because you're flexible.\\n\\nOne way to get at what their version of flexibility really means is to ask, How was the person that I'm replacing expected to be flexible? Watkins said.\\n\\nTejal Wagadia, a senior talent acquisition specialist at MST Solutions, said if a job listing wants an agile candidate, that means you need to be OK with dropping something mid-project, mid-assignment, whatever it is, and going to something else. It also means you can't be stubborn. They want somebody that will be like, 'OK, let's move on.'\\n\\n4. Unlimited paid time off\\n\\nUnlimited vacation time is a popular policy pioneered by companies like Netflix. The thinking goes that since you're a working adult who doesn't need to be micromanaged, you get to decide how much time off you take. But with the lack of clear structure, workers end up taking less time off.\\n\\nFrom an employee's perspective, you feel bad about taking vacation, Wagadia said. Most people thrive in knowing what they have, and how much they have, and how they can utilize it. There could also be a cultural expectation that you don't take long vacations. An employee taking a month off at a time in their first year could be considered a red flag by managers, she noted.\\n\\nFormer recruiter and career coach Diana YK Chan said if you want to get a better understanding of what a company's vacation policy really means, talk to someone in the know and ask them, Typically, how many days do people take time off and what percent of people are using that?\\n\\n5. Competitive salary\\n\\nWhen you see competitive salary in a job listing, this doesn't mean you can't negotiate your pay, Chan said. I have a lot of clients and they look at the research and think, 'OK this is the only band I could get in terms of range,′ but if you're considered at the higher range of salary, meaning you have more negotiation power, you should really stand strong on your value and ask for more, she said.\\n\\nTo get clarity on what exactly they mean by a competitive salary, ask what the range is during the interview process, Chan said.\\n\\n6. Wears many hats/And other duties as assigned\\n\\nDenny said if you read wears many hats, you will likely be asked to do things that are outside of your job duties. That interpretation may be reinforced by the phrase and other duties as assigned appearing elsewhere in the posting.\\n\\nThis could be considered a red flag for a candidate who appreciates the structure of a predetermined set of responsibilities and doesn't want to be pulled in many directions, she said. For another candidate, they may enjoy switching up his/her daily tasks.\\n\\nChan said if you find a job listing that expects you to take on multiple responsibilities and handle it all, ask a clarifying question in the interview process such as, 'How much time, in terms of percentage, do you envision me doing this part of the work?' she said. That helps as a job seeker to see, 'Do I actually want to spend that much time on that?'\\n\\n7. Works well under pressure\\n\\nYou are going to be put under lots of projects and deadlines that will not be realistic, and management knows that's the case, is what this phrase could mean, Wagadia said. Most people will leave in one to two years; most people won't thrive on that for long-term.\\n\\nTo succeed in this environment, you need to accept imperfection, because you are going to need to produce mediocre-level stuff and be OK with it, Wagadia said.\\n\\n\\n\\n8. Be passionate\\n\\nBeing passionate does not mean you have to be genuinely enthusiastic about the industry, but you do need to come to an interview prepared to showcase your expertise in the subject, Wagadia said. Even if you're not passionate, do enough research that show you have interest in them, she said.\\n\\n9. Be a problem-solver\\n\\nIf you get this in a listing, you are likely to hear interview questions like Tell me about a time you had to pivot your strategy, or any other question that asks you to share how you troubleshoot, Chan said.\\n\\nChan said if you see this kind of standard request, you should anticipate what are the challenging problems facing this role and be prepared to explain how you would actually tackle them.\\n\\n10. Ninjas, rockstars, jedis, gurus, unicorns, and other superstar titles\\n\\nWith these fancy titles, there's a certain level of expertise and expectation that you will know what you're doing, that you know how to do it. But often these expectations are unrealistic, Wagadia said.\\n\\n\\n\\nIf these phrases make you less likely to apply, you're not alone. Research has found that phrases like ninja, which suggest an aggressive expert in their field, can be a major turnoff to female job seekers.\\n\\nThese vague superstar titles can also be an indication that the company does not know what they want. Most jobs, if you can't define in easy-to-understand 5-7 sentences, you don't know what you're looking for, Wagadia said."}

They were galvanized by Trump's promise that the day would be wild and were ready to flout the District of Columbia's strict gun control laws.\\n\\nYes, it's illegal, but this is war and we're clearly in a post-legal phase of our society, one person wrote, The Washington Post reported. On thedonald.win, one person exhorted that anyone going to Washington be ARMED WITH RIFLE, HANDGUN, 2 KNIVES AND AS MUCH AMMO AS YOU CAN CARRY.\\n\\nAfter they broke into the halls of Congress, some rioters chanted hang Mike Pence — the vice president was presiding over a session of Congress that would affirm Joe Biden's election victory — while someone erected a gallows outside.\\n\\nInsurrection Goes Mainstream\\n\\nTo Horwitz, the firepower the rioters brought with them to what had started as a rally with the president is a fearsome reflection of just how mainstream the idea of armed government insurrection has become.\\n\\nToo many of our elected officials have exploited the idea of political violence for electoral gain, Horwitz said. Now you're starting to see, when you construct everything you disagree with as tyranny and you say, 'it's time to act,' people actually act.\\n\\nIn the decades he has been a gun control advocate, Horwitz has watched the gun lobby and Republican politicians deliver the idea of armed insurrection from the fringes of the far right and the internet to the heart of conservative politics.\\n\\nSlowly, they have recast the Second Amendment to mean citizens should be armed against their government, Horwitz said. Examples abound, like Newt Gingrich saying the Second Amendment is not about hunting, and Senate candidate Sharron Angle saying she hoped Second Amendment remedies wouldn't be the cure for the Harry Reid problems. In 2012, she was Reid's general election opponent.\\n\\nAt the same time, the National Rifle Association and the broader gun lobby moved away from representing hunting and sporting enthusiasts. It expanded its membership and political might by championing the idea that citizens should be allowed to own the same weaponry as the government. The list of weapons and tactical tools that authorities have confiscated from the U.S. Capitol rioters, he said, reads like a list of items you'd find at any weekend gun show in America.\\n\\nWhen you construct everything you disagree with as tyranny and you say, 'it's time to act,' people actually act. Josh Horwitz, executive director of the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence.\\n\\nThe conviction that individuals have a right to violently resist the government simply if they don't like its policies became turbocharged in reaction to the election of Barack Obama, the country's first Black president. It was common at protests against his signature policy achievement, the Affordable Care Act, to see Gadsden flags — a reference to the violent consequences of government overreach — and the protests often featured an armed contingent.\\n\\nThe insurrectionist idea is forever linked with racism, Horwitz said. It's all about control and power. 'Your health care law is tyranny because I don't like who's getting health care.' 'I don't like who's making the laws anymore, they don't look like me, therefore I need a gun to fight tyranny.'\\n\\nAll of this reached its apex with Trump. Starting with his days on the presidential campaign trail, where he suggested that saying if Hillary Clinton were elected president, Second Amendment people could do something about it, Trump has stoked the idea that political disagreements should be settled by whoever has the most guns.\\n\\nLast January, Trump commended 15,000 heavily armed gun owners who descended on the Virginia State Capitol on Martin Luther King Jr. Day to protest potential gun control. At the start of the coronavirus pandemic, Trump urged his Twitter followers to LIBERATE states that imposed strict lockdowns. It was a clear message for his followers to take up arms against the government, Horwitz said — which was exactly what happened in states like Michigan; in April, the state capitol was overrun by armed protesters.\\n\\nNo one understood better how those forces could be used as a private army than Donald Trump, Horwitz said. He's such a narcissist that we forget that he does have innate political abilities. He realized he could capture this group of people who could give him a lot of power.\\n\\nOn Wednesday, Trump sicced a mostly white crowd of thousands of his supporters on the seat of U.S. government, telling them if you don't fight like hell, you're not going to have a country anymore. They marched the two miles from the Ellipse directly to the U.S. Capitol."}

It was a policy of racial discrimination, and the decades of damage turned into painful memories that existed like a wound. Australia's politicians had battled for years over whether an apology should be made.\\n\\nIn Parliament on Tuesday, Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said what Australia had failed to understand was that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders were proud people.\\n\\nWe did not see Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander cultures and peoples as the gift they are, a gift which should have been honored but which was cast aside, disparaged and ridiculed, he said. On the 10th anniversary of the national apology to the Stolen Generations, I extend my respect and on behalf of all honorable members to all those Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people who despite immeasurable pain have survived.\\n\\nFor some, Rudd's national apology was a sign of profound change.\\n\\nIt was a magical moment for me, Michael Welsh told Australia's national broadcaster, the ABC. Welsh was taken from his mother and siblings when he was 8.\\n\\nIt's made a big difference to me in my life, through my life, where I've journeyed, it's made a difference to my children, and my brother and sisters, he said.\\n\\nBut there are signs the country is losing momentum for change, with this week's update to the federal government's decade-long Closing the Gap Strategy showing a lack of progress toward some goals toward equality.\\n\\n.@MrKRudd: Let's not bash the Closing the Gap targets, let's enhance them... we shouldn't water them down.

{"original": "A conservative Christian law firm that once defended an evangelical baker who refused to bake a cake for a gay couple is now representing a Christian charity that refused to let a homeless transgender woman stay in its overnight shelter.\\n\\nThe Hope Center, which is also known as the Downtown Soup Kitchen, wants to continue barring transgender women from sleeping in its overnight shelter for homeless women, and the Alliance Defending Freedom is supporting it in its fight.\\n\\nAnchorage, Alaska, where the Hope Center is located, has a city law prohibiting discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity. During a court hearing on Friday, ADF lawyers asked U.S. District Judge Sharon Gleason for a preliminary injunction against the city's government and Equal Right Commission, claiming that enforcing the anti-discrimination law would threaten Hope Center's religious freedom.\\n\\nAll Americans should be free to live out their faith and serve their neighbors — including the battered and homeless — without being targeted or harassed by the government, ADF lawyer David Cortman said in a statement.\\n\\nIn response, city lawyers have asked Gleason to refrain from making a decision about the case until the Equal Rights Commission concludes its investigation of the Hope Center. The charity has reportedly refused to provide information about its public funding, which would help determine whether it is a place of public accommodation that could be required to follow the anti-discrimination law, the city stated in court documents.\\n\\nRyan Stuart, an assistant municipal attorney, said Friday that the investigation into the Hope Center is on hold, largely because the shelter has refused to cooperate, The Associated Press reports.\\n\\nASSOCIATED PRESS Deitra Ennis, left, and Ryan Stuart, attorneys with the city of Anchorage, talk to reporters after a hearing in federal court Friday. They represent the city in a federal lawsuit filed by a faith-based shelter over a local requirement that it accept transgender women.\\n\\nThe Hope Center is faith-based soup kitchen, occupational training center and homeless women's shelter. Men and women are able to access the center during the day, but it only allows people who were assigned female at birth to stay overnight. The center houses its overnight guests in one large open room.\\n\\nMost of the women the shelter accepts overnight have been abused or have been victims of sex trafficking, the ADF said in court filings. The center calls a person's sex an immutable God-given gift, court documents state.\\n\\nThe controversy over the Hope Center's shelter policies started last January, when a transgender woman, identified in court documents as Jessie Doe, was dropped off at the shelter by police officers. Doe had after reportedly being removed from another local shelter for starting a fight.\\n\\nIn its complaint, the ADF maintains that Doe was injured, aggressive and inebriated when she arrived at the center. The ADF says Doe was turned away for violating the center's policy requiring overnight guests to be sober, not because of her gender identity. The Hope Center reportedly paid for a cab that transported Doe to the hospital for the night.\\n\\nDoe returned the next day and was turned away again, this time for arriving during a time when the shelter was not accepting new guests, the ADF claims.\\n\\nDoe later filed a complaint with Anchorage's Equal Rights Commission, alleging that she had been discriminated against on the basis of her gender identity. The complaint prompted an investigation.\\n\\nASSOCIATED PRESS Denise Harle, an attorney with the Christian law firm Alliance Defending Freedom, poses for a photo outside the Hope Center women's shelter in downtown Anchorage, Alaska, on Nov. 1, 2018.\\n\\nThe ADF argues homeless shelters should be exempt from Anchorage's anti-discrimination law and that the Equal Right Commission's investigation of the center has been irrelevant, overreaching, and harassing.\\n\\nThe ADF has also argued that sleeping alongside a transgender woman would traumatize many of the shelter's overnight guests.\\n\\nMany of the women Downtown Hope Center serves have suffered rape, physical abuse, and domestic violence. They shouldn't be forced to sleep or disrobe in the same room as a man, ADF attorney Denise Harle said in a statement. Battered women need a safe place to stay, but, incredibly, Anchorage is trying to take that place away.\\n\\nADF lawyer Ryan Tucker said Friday that the shelter's female guests have told staff members they would rather sleep in the woods than sleep alongside a trans woman, according to the AP.\\n\\nBut Masen Davis, CEO of the advocacy group Freedom for All Americans, said it's misleading to suggest that the presence of transgender women creates a risk at women's homeless shelters.\\n\\nAnchorage residents … should not be fooled by misleading tactics by anti-transgender activists that paint transgender women as predators or criminals, Davis told HuffPost. Transgender women aren't men ― they are women who value safety and privacy like everyone else.\\n\\nAs always, it's illegal to enter any space with the intent of harming or harassing someone else, and anyone who does so will be held accountable, he added.\\n\\nHomelessness is a major issue for transgender Americans. One in five transgender individuals have experienced homelessness at some point in their lives, according to the National Center for Transgender Equality. Transgender people also face increased risk for violence and victimization. Since 2013, the Human Rights Campaign has documented at least 128 cases where transgender people were victims of fatal violence. Nearly nine in 10 victims were transgender women.\\n\\nRobin Maril, associate legal director of the Human Rights Campaign, told HuffPost that access to emergency shelter is particularly crucial for the transgender community.\\n\\nFlat out denying access to shelter is never the answer, and exclusionary and dangerous policies that discriminate have no business being funded by the taxpayer, Maril wrote in an email. (IRS filings indicate the Hope Center has received some government grants in the past.)\\n\\nADF has stepped in before to defend conservative Christian business owners who want to refuse service to LGBTQ Americans. The organization is perhaps best-known for representing Jack Phillips, a Christian baker who in 2012 refused to make a wedding cake for a gay couple. Last June, the Supreme Court handed Phillips a partial victory by saying the Colorado Civil Rights Commission had shown hostility to religion while investigating the claims. The court did not rule on the larger issue of whether people with conservative religious beliefs can seek exemptions from anti-discrimination laws.\\n\\nHyoung Chang via Getty Images Jack Phillips, owner of Masterpiece Cakeshop, poses for a photo in his shop in Lakewood, Colorado, on Aug. 15, 2018. The U.S. Supreme Court faulted the Colorado Civil Rights Commission's handling of the claims brought against Phillips, saying it had showed a hostility to religion.\\n\\nMost Americans oppose religion-based service refusals, according to statistics from the Public Religion Research Institute. The organization found that a majority of members of only two major religious groups ― white evangelical Protestants and Mormons ― say business owners should be allowed to refuse service to lesbian and gay people. About 53 percent of each group supports service refusals.\\n\\nDavis said it's important that Anchorage's anti-discrimination policies don't permit sweeping exemptions that allow businesses to refuse service to transgender residents.\\n\\nHomeless shelters ― many of which are managed by communities of faith ― are a refuge of last resort for those who have nowhere else to go, Davis said. It's especially shameful that anti-LGBT activists are taking discrimination to new levels by attempting to prohibit homeless transgender people from being able to seek safety and shelter."}
{"original": "The Donald Trump presidency is now one year old and in many respects ― the unhinged tweeting, the contempt for democratic norms, the potential collusion with a hostile foreign power ― it has been unlike any presidency in history.\\n\\nBut there is one respect in which Trump's tenure in office has been rather ordinary: his administration's year-long effort to push familiar Republican initiatives that shift money and power towards corporations and the rich, and away from everybody else.\\n\\nNo, this is not the kind of presidency that Trump promised. As a candidate, he portrayed himself as a different sort of Republican, one who would attack the financial industry, govern independently of wealthy special interests, and protect public programs on which poor and middle-class Americans depend.\\n\\nOn Inauguration Day, speaking from the steps of the Capitol building, Trump reaffirmed those allegiances and priorities: We are not merely transferring power from one administration to another, or from one party to another, but we are transferring power from Washington D.C., and giving it back to you, the people.\\n\\nOf course, when Trump vowed to protect the forgotten men and women of our country, he likely had a specific subset of men and women in mind ― working-class Americans and, in particular, white working-class Americans. Stoking their racial resentment has been a theme of his presidency, just as it was a theme of his candidacy.\\n\\nIn public, Trump has assailed African-American football players for protesting during the national anthem. In private, he has said he wants to stop letting in immigrants from shithole (or, in some versions, shithouse) countries. In that sense, he has been exactly the kind of president he promised to be.\\n\\nBut the attacks on people of color, both abroad and home, look less and less like an effort to protect his supporters and more and more like a smokescreen for policies that will leave them ― along with most poor and middle-class Americans ― worse off than they were before. In a presidency that already has a reputation for dishonesty and graft, what Trump policies are doing to America's workers may be the biggest con of all.\\n\\nGiving Big Tax Breaks For The Wealthy\\n\\nBy far the clearest example of this is the Tax Cut and Jobs Act, which the Republican Congress passed and Trump signed in December. The legislation showers the vast majority of its benefits on businesses, investors and the wealthy ― by permanently reducing taxes for corporations, the owners of pass-through businesses, and holders of large estates. And although it also lowers some taxes for lower- and middle-income households, those cuts are smaller and temporary.\\n\\nTen years out, once the law takes full effect, more than half of all taxpayers will be paying more and most of the rest will see no change, according to analysis by the Tax Policy Center.\\n\\nCenter on Budget and Policy Priorities\\n\\nTrump and his allies say those numbers don't matter, because the tax cut will mean higher wages and more jobs ― both of which will benefit American workers. And lately Trump has been touting news of one-time bonuses that companies are offering, supposedly because of the tax cut, as vindication of the GOP argument.\\n\\nBut many of those same companies are laying off workers. And, in any event, the test of the tax cut's impact will be what it mean over the long term. In a survey of 42 top economists by the University of Chicago's Booth School of Business, just one ― one! ― thought Republican tax cuts would significantly improve growth.\\n\\nTrying To Take Health Insurance From Millions\\n\\nThe tax cut is Trump's only major legislative accomplishment, but it wasn't supposed to be. He and his congressional partners spent more of the year focusing on health care, as they tried to repeal the Affordable Care Act. The effort fell short, in no small part because GOP repeal proposals looked nothing like what Trump had promised.\\n\\nInstead of providing better, cheaper health care to all Americans ― a vow Trump made repeatedly in his campaign, sometimes using it to distinguish himself from rival GOP candidates ― repeal would have meant millions of poor and middle-class Americans losing their coverage. Some younger and healthier people would have ended up saving money, but only because older, sicker people would have ended up spending more ― or going without insurance altogether.\\n\\nStymied on the legislative front, Trump has carried on his war against Obamacare by using his executive authority. And here he has been more successful.\\n\\nHe cut funding for advertising for HealthCare.gov and for the groups that assist people with enrollment. He cut off a key set of payments to insurers, prompting some to raise rates and others to abandon markets altogether. And he's given states a green light to change their Medicaid programs in ways that will make it harder for poor people, especially those with chronic physical and mental health problems, to get and keep coverage.\\n\\nUndoing Rules To Protect Workers And Consumers\\n\\nTrump's tax cut and health care efforts have gotten a ton of attention. But they by no means capture the full extent of his governing agenda ― or the different ways his policies break his promise to American workers.\\n\\nIn March, Trump signed a Republican bill rescinding the Fair Pay and Safe Workplaces Act, an Obama-era law that required federal contractors to disclose and then address violations of labor law and worker safety regulations. In August, the Trump administration announced it was postponing implementation of the so-called fiduciary rule ― another Obama-era legacy ― that requires investment managers to act in the best interests of their clients. It's widely understood that the administration is merely buying time for a more formal rewrite or outright repeal of the regulation.\\n\\nThey're just pandering to big corporations, They don't care about family farms. Sen. Charles Grassley (R-Iowa) on a Trump administration regulatory change\\n\\nIn October, the Trump administration confirmed that it intended to rewrite Obama's rewrite of overtime rules, which would have extended overtime pay to more than 12 million workers. The Trump administration intends to scale that back, although not completely. And just last week, the Trump administration announced it was putting the brakes on new regulations for payday lenders, designed to stop them from exploiting low-wage workers by loading them up with unpayable debts.\\n\\nAnother major thrust of Trump's agenda is protecting businesses from lawsuits, even when they act in ways that exploit or harm consumers ― helping to foster what Mike Konczal, a fellow at the Roosevelt Institute, has called a Grifter Economy.\\n\\nAn example of this was the reversal of yet another Obama-era rule that, for the first time, exposed banks and credit card companies to class action lawsuits by consumers who believed they were victims of fraud. The Trump administration and its allies claimed this was an effort to help consumers, because class action lawsuits merely enrich trial lawyers. But, as consumer advocates point out, fear of class action suits and their potentially big awards are precisely what it takes to keep large financial institutions in line.\\n\\nWeakening Protections For Factory Workers And Farmers\\n\\nIn some ways, though, the most revealing policy changes of Trump's first year are the ones that affect the very groups he always claims to champion.\\n\\nTrump frequently talks about factory workers, and just this week he was in western Pennsylvania pledging to fight for them. But in the past year he has delayed implementation of rules designed to protect workers from inhaling toxic substances, including beryllium (a major hazard for steelworkers) and silica dust (a major hazard in construction). The plan, once again, is to scale back the rules in ways that expose many more workers to the hazards.\\n\\nYet another group that Trump loves to champion is farmers. But Trump this year overturned a regulation that made it easier for independent farmers to sue food companies and large agricultural conglomerates. And now the Environmental Protection Agency is talking about rescinding regulations that prohibit underage workers from handling toxic pesticides.\\n\\nWhen defending the change in farmer lawsuits, Trump administration officials made the same basic argument they did for most of their regulatory changes: that they were merely reducing frivolous lawsuits and eliminating paperwork, so that businesses can create more jobs.\\n\\nThe idea that regulation stifles the economy, ultimately hurting consumers or workers more than they help, is one that conservatives believe sincerely ― and that, in any given case, is a reasonable subject for debate. But on the rule change for farmers, even some of the president's allies thought it was more about helping powerful friends. They're just pandering to big corporations, Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) said. They don't care about family farms.\\n\\nIn public, Trump always suggests otherwise. Whether he's talking about rules for farmers or bankers, or changes to taxes or health care, he always says what he did at the Capitol a year ago ― that he's fighting powerful interests and protecting the forgotten American.\\n\\nBut in private, Trump has been known to present his accomplishments in a different light. In December, just hours after signing the tax cut, Trump was back in Florida at his exclusive Mar-o-Lago club, where initiation fees are $200,000. While dining with some friends and supporters, CBS News later reported, Trump told them what they probably knew already: You all just got a lot richer."}

It was just mass confusion, said Bayes-Fleming, a 24-year-old Toronto resident.\\n\\nDespite being registered with the Canadian embassy, she said, they received little information from the Canadian government. Ten hours after the state of emergency was declared, she received a generic email advising her to book a commercial flight.\\n\\nIt's reprehensible that the government expects us to navigate all of this, to understand the intricacies of foreign policy and border control when we're just two 20-somethings who came out here backpacking months and months ago, she said.\\n\\nPeople are saying the government is doing everything it can right now. I personally disagree.\\n\\nBayes-Fleming said she knows of tourists from the United States, Mexico and Israel who were able to get flights home.

He said travellers should return to Canada via commercial means while it is still possible to do so.\\n\\nThat advisory — to avoid non-essential travel outside Canada — remains on the federal government's website and has not been upgraded to the toughest message: Avoid all travel.\\n\\nOttawa notes that the situation abroad is volatile.\\n\\nTo limit the spread of COVID-19, Global Affairs Canada states, many countries have put in place travel or border restrictions and other measures such as movement restrictions and quarantines. Airlines have cancelled flights. New restrictions may be imposed with little warning. Your travel plans may be severely disrupted and you may be forced to remain outside of Canada longer than expected.\\n\\nThe United States on Thursday upgraded its travel advisory to: Do not travel.\\n\\nIf you choose to travel internationally … you may be forced to remain outside of the United States for an indefinite timeframe, the State Department warns.\\n\\nThe U.S. government also notes that some of its embassy personnel have been authorized to depart — much like in Canada — and this may limit the ability of the federal government to assist with consular services.\\n\\nOn Tuesday, Trudeau told Canadians that Ottawa is looking at every possible way of bringing Canadians home but suggested that there are just too many of them to bring back.\\n\\nI think it is just realistic to know that there are some of them who will not be coming home in the coming weeks, Trudeau said.\\n\\nThe government, he added, will ensure support is available, such as a $5,000 loan for those in need of temporary assistance.\\n\\nWe are [also] looking at flights, he said in French. We are looking to see what we can do to facilitate the return of the greatest number of Canadians possible in the shortest possible delay.\\n\\nAdrian Wyld/CP Foreign Affairs Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne walks in downtown Ottawa on March 11, 2020.\\n\\nThat day, in sharp contrast, Germany announced it is setting aside €50 million to repatriate its stranded tourists.

In one day alone this week, Global Affairs Canada received more than 10,000 emails and 6,000 phone calls requesting help.\\n\\nWednesday evening, wireless carriers sent text messages to Canadians roaming abroad asking them to register with the government. Officials are hoping to gather a better picture of where the needs are and where large and vulnerable concentrations of tourists might be, in order to prioritize their efforts.\\n\\nSpeaking to Radio-Canada on Friday, Champagne said the government has to negotiate, country by country, access to airspace and landing rights. They must also ensure an open airport and that flight crews won't be quarantined when they arrive. Canadians also have to be able to get to the airport — which isn't always the case when public and private travel is banned and whole regions of countries are under lockdown.\\n\\nIn a way, the easiest step is [securing] the plane, he said.\\n\\nIn Peru, for example, the foreign minister noted the airspace is not only closed but so too is the airport in Lima, and there are restrictions on interprovincial travel.\\n\\nWhat adds to more complications, Champagne said, is that airlines are reducing their capacity, alluding to the 5,000 job losses at Air Canada Friday.\\n\\nFor Bayes-Fleming and Carroll, who are now hunkered down in an apartment conveniently located next to a grocery store, time ticks slowly by. They may be there for weeks, perhaps even months.

But have you ever thought about where the worn-down stuff actually goes?\\n\\nAbout 10-30 percent of the rubber from car tires is lost as they wear out, a European Commission review reports. The majority of that material ends up on, or at the side of, the road, but most of us don't realize that tiny tire wear particles small enough to be inhaled are also mixed into the air we breathe.\\n\\nWhile a number of scientific studies have found tire dust has adverse health effects, the tire industry ― and studies it has commissioned ― suggests otherwise.\\n\\nGeorge Frey/Reuters The Utah Capitol is shrouded in smog in downtown Salt Lake City, Utah, in December.\\n\\nAir pollution in the U.S. causes as many as 200,000 premature deaths each year. Motor vehicles are a major source of this pollution. Exposure to pollutants from motor vehicles can cause lung and heart problems and early death, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.\\n\\nAlthough significant work has gone into researching the contribution of emissions from exhaust pipes to air pollution, emissions such as those produced by tire wear have been largely overlooked, professor Frank Kelly, chair in environmental health at King's College London, told HuffPost.\\n\\nThere is much that needs to be investigated, not only when it comes to the potential health effects but also around what actually goes into tires.\\n\\nSince the recipes manufacturers use for their tires are generally kept under wraps, exactly what these tire wear particles contain is a bit of a black box, said Kelly, who provides policy support on air pollution to the World Health Organization.\\n\\nThe findings of a study co-authored by the academic in 2013 suggest that reducing exposure to tire dust would likely lead to improvements in health. But more research is needed to better understand the health effects of tire wear particles, Kelly said, especially as non-tailpipe emissions ― from brake pads and road surfaces as well as tires ― become increasingly important while exhaust emissions are brought under control.\\n\\nThe tire industry, however, has pushed back on suggestions that tire wear particles have health effects. The Tire Industry Project ― an industry body chaired by the three biggest tire manufacturers, Michelin, Bridgestone and Goodyear ― says it is working to develop a better understanding of the possible health and environmental effects of tire and road wear particles (TRWP).\\n\\nAs part of this ongoing work, it has commissioned a series of peer-reviewed publications. The key takeaway from TIP's research so far has been that the presence of TRWP presents no significant risk to humans and the environment, Philippe Fonta, the managing director of TIP, told HuffPost by email.\\n\\nCyrille Roget, global head of scientific and innovations communications at Michelin Group, told HuffPost: All the studies that we have been looking at indicate that those particles in fact do not present any danger.\\n\\nDespite repeated requests, Michelin did not provide HuffPost with these studies. Michelin did say it is developing a tire with a biodegradable tread made from material such as hay or beets.\\n\\nMichael Nagle/Getty Images Traffic makes its way through Times Square in New York City.\\n\\nConcerns over tire particle pollution also raise questions about frequently cited ideas for tackling vehicle-related pollution, such as electric cars.\\n\\nElectric vehicles (EVs) are being touted as one of the most promising solutions to the air pollution crisis, especially in cities. But while they can significantly reduce tailpipe emissions, they won't tackle the effects of non-tailpipe emissions from the likes of tire waste.\\n\\nJonathan Grigg, professor of pediatric respiratory and environmental medicine at Queen Mary University London, told HuffPost that cities should go further than just promoting EVs and genuinely rethink urban transport to move away from private car use.\\n\\nYes, we can achieve a lot with EVs, but we shouldn't lose sight of the fact that we need to be able to move around our cities in different ways than just individual cars, said Grigg, whose research focuses on air pollution and health.\\n\\nCities around the world are experimenting with ways to get vehicles off the streets. Los Angeles is phasing out heavy-duty diesel trucks from its port and overhauling the mass transit system, while Norway is replacing car parking spaces with bike lanes and closing certain streets to private traffic in its capital city, Oslo. Brussels and Ghent in Belgium have also been experimenting with car-free initiatives, with mixed success. In Paris, major intersections are being redesigned to prioritize pedestrians and cyclists over vehicle traffic.\\n\\nThere's a long way to go, however, not least of all in America. In the current anti-regulatory political climate of the U.S., government officials are attempting to downplay the health impacts of poor air quality, Natalie Nava, project leader at the environmental group Greenpeace USA, told HuffPost. But don't be fooled ― the air we breathe is important. If the government and companies fail to take action to improve our air, we will be dealing with a global health catastrophe.\\n\\nCORRECTION: A previous version of this story indicated Los Angeles is phasing out diesel trucks. In fact, it is the port of Los Angeles that is doing so.\\n\\nFor more content and to be part of the This New World community, join our Facebook Group.\\n\\nHuffPost's This New World series is funded by Partners for a New Economy and the Kendeda Fund.

{"original": "TORONTO — None of the candidates running for Kathleen Wynne's old job can say they support the way Ontario's Liberal party chooses its leaders. One actually laughed out loud when asked if the model is democratic.\\n\\nThe delegated convention model is the opposite of giving people a say in how their government is run, candidate Alvin Tedjo told HuffPost Canada when he was done having a laugh.\\n\\nWe have to give people the right to vote for the leaders they want directly, Tedjo said. It's an antiquated system.\\n\\nThe convoluted process to choose Wynne's replacement kicks off this weekend with elections to decide who will actually get to vote in the contest. It's a crucial moment for a party at its lowest standing in more than 150 years — and it could be crucial for the province, too.\\n\\nIt's an antiquated system. - Alvin Tedjo\\n\\nEven without a permanent leader, polls are giving the Liberals an edge over Premier Doug Ford's ruling Progressive Conservatives. So this contest could decide who becomes Ontario's next premier.\\n\\nOn Saturday and Sunday, the Liberals' 37,831 paying members will vote for delegates to represent riding associations, student clubs and women's clubs at Leadership Election Meetings (LEMs). Those approximately 1,984 delegates, along with hundreds of ex-officio delegates, who automatically get to vote because they are former MPs and MPPs, the party's executive council, and other party brass, will choose the next leader at a convention on March 6 and 7.\\n\\nThe candidates — three former cabinet ministers and three others who have never held office — call the delegated model confusing and inaccessible and say that it discourages people from joining their party. Most political parties in Canada have moved to a one-member-one-vote system. The federal Liberals did so in 2009.\\n\\nHuffPost Canada Composite From left to right, the Ontario Liberal leadership candidates: Michael Coteau, Steven Del Duca, Kate Graham, Brenda Hollingsworth, Mitzie Hunter and Alvin Tedjo.\\n\\nFifty-seven per cent of Ontario Liberal members voted to abolish the system in June — but 66 per cent was needed to actually change it, per the party's constitution.\\n\\nFor sure, reform is needed, said candidate Steven Del Duca.\\n\\nHe said he didn't vote when the party considered a new system because he'd already announced his run for leader. But he watched carefully when a majority of members voted to change the system.\\n\\nDel Duca is considered the man to beat. He's a former minister who was first elected to represent Vaughan in the final weeks of Dalton McGuinty's premiership. Del Duca's campaign says there are 2,676 people running to be his delegates this weekend, out of the 5,500 total candidates the party says are on the ballots.\\n\\nThe F bomb 💣\\n\\nThe leadership race is fundamentally about showing voters that the Liberals are a clear and compelling alternative to the direction that Doug Ford and his friends are taking Ontario, Del Duca told HuffPost.\\n\\nFord's name appears all over Del Duca's website: Doug Ford claimed the deficit was billions of dollars higher than it is so he could justify cuts to OHIP+, hospitals and other health services … There's nothing that Doug Ford loves more than ripping up transit plans … Doug Ford brags he's done a lot for small businesses … The first thing Doug Ford tried to do was pave the greenbelt.\\n\\nCole Burston/Canadian Press Ontario Premier Doug Ford speaks at a news conference in Toronto on Jan. 16, 2020.\\n\\nHis main challenger, MPP Michael Coteau, disagrees that the premier should be central to the Liberal race. He has 1,234 potential delegates running in the LEMs this weekend.\\n\\nDoug Ford is not the centre of my motivation. I try not to say his name too much … To me, he just represents an ideology that I don't think represents the best interests of Ontarians, Coteau told HuffPost.\\n\\nSo I'm not focusing on Doug Ford. I'm not focusing exclusively on just the fight. What I'm focusing on is … having Ontarians think about where they want to be over the next 10, 15, 20, 30, 50 years. And reimagining Ontario by asking big, bold questions.\\n\\nThe meme factor 💻\\n\\nAs Del Duca has racked up endorsements from big-name Liberals, a movement to paint him with the same brush as Ford has popped up online. Even meme pages are getting involved.\\n\\nAn anonymous website called Cons4DelDuca was created in December to highlight the fact that some of Del Duca's donors also gave to Ford's campaign for PC leader. And the popular Facebook page National Meme Board of Canada has endorsed Coteau and candidate Kate Graham and written that Ford would probably choose Del Duca, because they do have the same rich donors backing them.\\n\\nDel Duca says it's the work of the Tories, an indication that he's the biggest threat to their chances in 2022.\\n\\nIt's hard to know for sure, but I'm fairly confident this is another example of Doug Ford and people around Doug Ford deciding that they want to unleash attacks against me, Del Duca said.\\n\\nHe noted that Transportation Minister Caroline Mulroney blamed him, the former transportation minister, in a government news release after she cancelled a Hamilton transit project in December.\\n\\nIn that moment, they made it crystal clear … that they view me as the most significant threat.\\n\\nThe barely there party 🧐\\n\\nDel Duca says he's the best person to rebuild the party after its whopping 2018 defeat that reduced it to seven sitting MPPs. Many Liberal stalwarts agree.\\n\\nHe's a known quantity who proved himself in cabinet and knows how to fundraise, said John Milloy, a former Liberal MPP who sat in Ontario's legislature from 2003 to 2014.\\n\\nHe represents the establishment and a tradition of central control, Milloy said.\\n\\nThat's not necessarily unwelcome when you're in the wilderness as we are … We are in a lot of trouble organizationally.\\n\\nLikewise, Del Duca said the most important thing the Liberals need is a leader who can hit the ground running as soon as the convention is over.\\n\\nWe are in a lot of trouble organizationally. - John Milloy\\n\\nThere's lots of polling showing that our brand remains resilient and strong. That's all positive and encouraging. But in those 26 months [before the next general election], we're going to have to be able to find well over 100 candidates who are not currently incumbents, we're going to have to raise millions of dollars, and we're going to have to find a way to put together a platform of ideas that are compelling for the people, he said.\\n\\nI'm strongly positioned to be able to do all of those things and prepare us for what I call 'the fight of our lives.'\\n\\nThe former minister says his biggest accomplishment in office was funding a massive expansion of public transit and investments in infrastructure like roads and bridges.\\n\\nThose two things I think stand as a remarkable achievement not just for me as an individual minister, but for our time in government.\\n\\nPaul Chiasson/Canadian Press Liberal leader Justin Trudeau campaigns with then-minister of transportation Steven Del Duca on Sept. 4, 2015 in Richmond Hill, Ont.\\n\\nBut he says there were times when the public found his government to be out of touch.\\n\\nWhen you're talking about a 15-year horizon, it's very easy for governments to become stuck inside the bubble of government, he said.\\n\\nThe only way we're going to restore the trust and rebuild that relationship with voters … is actually go and talk to everyday Ontarians in their neighbourhoods, in their communities and hear about their concerns.\\n\\nBaggage limit 🧳\\n\\nBut like the Ontario Liberal Party, Del Duca's name carries some baggage.\\n\\nThe province's auditor general found in 2018 that when Del Duca was transportation minister, he pressured Metrolinx to inappropriately recommend GO stations be built in Kirby and Lawrence East, even though the costs of building those stations outweighed the benefits. The Kirby station was in Del Duca's riding.\\n\\nAnd after he became minister of economic development in 2018, Del Duca was accused of giving a leg up to his former employer, the carpenters' union, at the expense of a rival union.\\n\\nThe other contenders 🗳️\\n\\nThere are five other challengers. Two of them, Coteau and Graham, have been quick to point out that delegated conventions often deliver unexpected results.\\n\\nThe next time someone tells you that one candidate has this leadership race 'in the bag' — ask them about Lyn McLeod or Dalton McGuinty or Kathleen Wynne, Coteau wrote in a message to supporters on Jan. 25. No 'frontrunner' has ever won our leadership race process.\\n\\nHere's more about the other contenders, in alphabetical order by last name.\\n\\nMichael Coteau\\n\\nLike Del Duca, Coteau is a former cabinet minister. As minister of social services, he oversaw the Liberals' program for children with autism and helped implement the basic income pilot project that Ford's government quickly cancelled.\\n\\nI think that overall, Liberals in Ontario have a lot to be proud of, he told HuffPost. But there were a few decisions that were made that weren't necessarily aligned with where people wanted to go; selling off Hydro One was one of those decisions.\\n\\nHe said his biggest accomplishments were passing a child protection bill that laid the groundwork for Indigenous-led child welfare agencies, reorganizing autism services and delivering the Pan Am Games in 2015.\\n\\nCoteauMichael/Facebook Ontario Liberal leadership contestant Michael Coteau with former premier Kathleen Wynne in a Facebook photo.\\n\\nHis biggest regret is that the Liberals' anti-racism plan is no longer being implemented under Ford.\\n\\nWe put in place the act which passed and Doug Ford has completely destroyed. He's just not acted on any of it … I really wish I could have explored more ways to lock it into the system so it'd be more difficult for him to dismantle.\\n\\nAs premier, he says he would hold town halls four times a year to hear directly from voters. He also says he'd create a more respectful legislature by meeting with opposition caucuses at the start of every session.\\n\\nSome of his other proposals are to:\\n\\nLower the voting age to 16;\\n\\nMake public transit free for youth and seniors within four years and free for everyone within 10 years;\\n\\nExpand health-care coverage to include dental work and prescription drugs;\\n\\nMake the Greenbelt bigger;\\n\\nMake it cheaper and easier to repair electronic devices like cellphones;\\n\\nCollect data about how Ontarians use public services, like health care, to improve delivery without selling the data to private companies.\\n\\nKate Graham\\n\\nAt 35, Graham is the youngest person running for the top job. But she says that's not the only thing that makes her unique.\\n\\nI am the only one who grew up in a small town ... We've lost basically every riding outside of Toronto and Ottawa and I'm the only candidate who comes outside of Ontario's two largest cities, the London, Ont., academic said.\\n\\nKateforleader.ca/Facebook Kate Graham, second from right, campaigns with Liberal supporters.\\n\\nShe also points out that she's not a former MPP or cabinet minister.\\n\\nI don't think we can win in 2022 and beyond if we look the same as we did in 2018, Graham told HuffPost. I've got a decade of experience in local government, developing public policy … but in an environment where people aren't part of a political party. People with different ideas actually have to get along.\\n\\nShe said she's motivated by a desire to fundamentally change the party, which she thinks has become all about winning elections and trying to buy people's votes.\\n\\nA Liberal government should focus on improving wellbeing instead of growing the economy, like the governments of New Zealand and Iceland have, Graham said.\\n\\nHer platform says she would apply rent control on all rental units, no matter when they were built, create an Indigenous housing strategy and immediately provide $100 million for emergency housing and homelessness prevention.\\n\\nShe also said she would borrow the other parties' best ideas on health care by:\\n\\nAdopting the Ontario NDP's Pharmacare for Everyone plan, which would cover 125 essential medicines like insulin, antibiotics and birth control;\\n\\nReintroduce the Liberal's 2018 drug and dental program, which would cover 80 per cent of prescription drug and dental expenses up to a maximum amount;\\n\\nTake on the Green party's plan to create more abortion clinics;\\n\\nUse the PCs' plan to help seniors and people with disabilities buy mobility devices and other health equipment.\\n\\nBrenda Hollingsworth\\n\\nHollingsworth is an Ottawa lawyer who describes herself as a lifelong Liberal but has never run for or held office before.\\n\\nShe says the fact that she comes from outside is what makes her different than the other candidates.\\n\\nI bring the perspective of a person who has lived with the consequences of a Liberal government for 15 years, the good and the bad, she told HuffPost. I know what it's like to struggle to meet a payroll, I know what it's like to worry about paying rent.\\n\\nShe said the previous Liberal government had some outstanding outcomes, especially full-day kindergarten, which she called its crowning jewel.\\n\\nI deeply regret that my kids were too old for that, Hollingsworth, who has two teenage sons, said.\\n\\nOn other issues, like auto insurance, Hollingsworth said the Liberals failed to help people and actually did harm.\\n\\nLiberalBrenda/Facebook Brenda Hollingsworth, in red, laughs with fellow Liberal leadership candidates Alvin Tedjo and Mitzie Hunter.\\n\\nThere were all sorts of changes made to reduce the amount of coverage that people have with a promise of reduced premiums that didn't materialize, Hollingsworth said. That has had very serious repercussions for lots of Ontarians.\\n\\nHollingsworth said that despite her lack of political experience, she has many applicable skills.\\n\\nI manage a staff. I make policy decisions. I am an expert negotiator. I have been an advocate for thousands of individual Ontarians over the last two decades.\\n\\nAs premier, Hollingsworth is proposing to:\\n\\nFund mass transit projects, including the Hamilton light-rail transit (LRT) project;\\n\\nDevelop more transit in rural areas;\\n\\nAggressively position Ontario as a tech innovation hub by creating a facility to train data analysts and cyber security specialists;\\n\\nGive more Ontario Student Assistance Program (OSAP) funding to students who study an area where there's a demand for labour;\\n\\nFund the health-care system at the rate of inflation.\\n\\nMitzie Hunter\\n\\nHunter is the third-term MPP for the Scarborough—Guildwood riding. She served as associate minister of finance, minister of education and minister of advanced education and skills development under Wynne.\\n\\nWe need positive change in Ontario. And that begins with education, she told HuffPost in an interview. It's not just about reversing [Ford's] cuts, it's about going further.\\n\\nMPPMitzieHunter/Facebook MPP Mitzie Hunter campaigns in Ottawa with Liberal supporters.\\n\\nAs premier, Hunter says she would aim to get the high school graduation rate up to 90 per cent from its current 87 per cent, bring in a school nutrition program and make sure there's a mental health worker in every high school.\\n\\nHunter says that both Ontario and the Liberal party need electoral reform.\\n\\nShe's pledging to make election day a statutory holiday and introduce ranked ballots.\\n\\nLast year, Hunter led an unsuccessful push to change the Liberals' delegated system so that all members could cast a vote in the contest.\\n\\nWe need to be a party that's open and that is inclusive, that's modern and youthful and ready to take on the challenges of the future. I think that moving to a one-member-one-vote system would really help.\\n\\nSome of Hunter's other policy ideas are to:\\n\\nEncourage seniors to rent spare rooms to students, in order to increase housing supply for young people and alleviate loneliness for seniors;\\n\\nRequire landlords to give tenants six months' notice and six months' rent if they are forced out of their apartment for renovations;\\n\\nEliminate yellow-belt neighbourhoods , where even low-rise apartment buildings cannot be built because they are zoned for detached and semi-detached houses only;\\n\\nPut in a provincial carbon tax that's equal to the federal government's system and rebate the money back to residents based on how little they pollute;\\n\\nLet anyone under 30 and survivors of gun violence access mental health services for free with their Ontario Health Insurance Plan (OHIP) card.\\n\\nAlvin Tedjo\\n\\nLike Graham, Tedjo is in his mid-30s and has never held public office.\\n\\nFor millennials, people under 40, people like myself, we need to give them a reason to vote for us. We need to give them a reason to vote at all, he told HuffPost.\\n\\nTeamTedjo/Facebook Ontario Liberal leadership candidate Alvin Tedjo says he will institute a universal basic income if he becomes premier.\\n\\nAnd I think the experience that we've seen is that unless we are going to be aggressive about climate change, unless we're going to have a real plan for education and the economy of the future, young people will vote elsewhere.\\n\\nTedjo has grabbed headlines for some of his bold proposals, which include merging the public and Catholic school boards and implementing a basic income based on the Wynne government's pilot project.\\n\\nThat would provide a no-strings-attached income supplement to anyone living on less than $34,000 individually or $48,000 as a couple.\\n\\nI'm the only one saying don't need any more studies, we need to do this right away, he said.\\n\\nAs the economy changes and technology evolves, we need an income floor … so that people can still maintain a certain dignity in their lives while they decide what to do if they need to get retrained.\\n\\nHe called the PCs' justification for cancelling the pilot — that it would discourage people from working — moronic.\\n\\nWages have been stagnant. People can't work enough with the additional cost of living going up, with housing prices the way they are, with rents the way they are.\\n\\nThe idea that low-income people are sitting on their couch playing video games is not a reality, he said.\\n\\nHis other policy proposals include:"}

Republicans used the act, known as the CRA, to hack away at Obama-era rules; before that it had only been used once, in 2001.\\n\\nI have no doubt that we will aggressively move forward to undo as many of the damaging environmental rules and executive orders as we're capable of undoing, Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) told HuffPost on Wednesday.\\n\\nCrucially, the CRA requires only a simple majority of senators to get a disapproval resolution through the Senate. That's good for Democrats, who will only control 50 seats in the Senate and have to rely on Vice President-elect Kamala Harris for tie-breaking votes.\\n\\nRepublicans made extensive use of the CRA in the early days of the Trump administration, after learning of a convenient loophole that let them review regulations and guidance that had been on the books for decades — as long as they hadn't technically been submitted to Congress yet. They nixed 16 regulations, including one that had been finalized in 2013.\\n\\nAccording to the Regulatory Studies Center at George Washington University, the new Congress could use the law to kill any Trump regulations that were published in the federal register on or after Aug. 22, 2020.\\n\\nThe CRA also makes it harder to revive those rules, prohibiting agencies from reissuing regulations that are substantially the same as ones stricken by the law.\\n\\nA Toxic Legacy\\n\\nClimate and environmental rules have been perhaps the biggest target of Trump's deregulatory agenda. Since taking office, the industry-friendly administration has scrapped, weakened or proposed rolling back nearly 100 environmental rules and regulations, according to a New York Times analysis.\\n\\nANDREW CABALLERO-REYNOLDS via Getty Images An oil and gas processing plant in Lake Charles, Louisiana. Among the Trump-era regulations that a Democratic-controlled Congress might be able to roll back is the decision to maintain rather than strengthen air quality standards for particulate matter and ozone, two toxic air pollutants emitted from power plants and vehicles.\\n\\nThat effort has ramped up in the weeks since the November election, with the outgoing administration scrambling to finalize dozens of additional environmental rollbacks.\\n\\nLast month, as the coronavirus pandemic overwhelmed hospitals across the country, the Environmental Protection Agency opted to maintain rather than strengthen air quality standards for particulate matter and ozone, two toxic air pollutants emitted from power plants and vehicles. It also finalized a rule requiring the agency to give greater consideration to economic factors when crafting new public health safeguards under the Clean Air Act.\\n\\nMore recently, Trump's Interior Department finalized a rule that permanently slashed protections for hundreds of species of migratory birds by legalizing all unintentional killings, including those caused by oil and gas infrastructure, power lines and wind turbines. And the EPA completed a so-called science transparency rule that will block certain peer-reviewed scientific studies from the rule-making process.\\n\\nAll of these could soon be targets of congressional Democrats. (EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler has claimed, dubiously, that his agency's transparency rule is not subject to the CRA.)\\n\\nRebuilding Worker Protections\\n\\nThe morning after the Georgia runoffs, Trump's Labor Department announced a new federal rule regarding the use of independent contractors by companies like Uber and Doordash. The new industry-friendly regulation would make it difficult for workers to prove through lawsuits that they are actually employees entitled to basic labor protections. It's slated to go into effect in March. Democrats could undo it through the CRA if they choose to, though not without provoking a fight from the gig companies and other businesses that use contractors.\\n\\nDemocrats may be more readily willing to spike a new rule from the Trump administration that allows religious institutions that take federal contracts to make hiring decisions based on faith. The Labor Department finalized that regulation in December. While the administration claimed the rule encourages the full and equal participation of religious organizations as federal contractors, groups like the American Civil Liberties Union said it amounts to a license for employers to discriminate.\\n\\nMeanwhile, advocates for agricultural workers may press Democrats to halt a new Trump rule that will drive down the minimum wage on farms. The outgoing administration has moved to phase out a survey that helps determine the base pay for agricultural guest workers; the new methodology will produce lower pay rates for poor migrant workers and slash farmers labor costs. The Labor Department finalized that rule in early November.\\n\\nHandout . / Reuters The Trump administration finalized a new rule that would lower base pay for agricultural guest workers. The Democratic Congress could overturn it.\\n\\nSaving The Social Safety Net\\n\\nThe Trump administration couldn't get any safety net cuts through Congress, so it used regulations to push changes to food, health and disability benefits. In November, the administration finalized a rule that could make it harder for Social Security Disability Insurance applicants to win appeals after they've been initially denied benefits.\\n\\nThe Office of Management and Budget is also reviewing a final regulation that would trim enrollment in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. Another pending final rule from the Social Security Administration would increase reviews of whether people who have already been awarded disability benefits are still disabled.\\n\\nBethany Lily, director of income policy for The Arc, a nonprofit that advocates for people with disabilities, said she has been checking OMB's regulatory dashboard daily to see if the disability rule moves forward.\\n\\nThe proposal is still at OMB and if they do finalize it in the next 15 days, we will be asking Congress to use the Congressional Review Act to rescind the rule, Lily said in an email.\\n\\nThe CRA Is Trump's Own Undoing\\n\\nDemocrats' newly won Senate majority will completely reshape the first years of Biden's administration and the CRA will likely play a significant role in its initial days.\\n\\nWhat is good for the goose is good for the gander, Nicholas Bagley, a University of Michigan Law Professor and regulatory law expert, said, noting the CRA will allow Biden's team to act quickly without going through the often-cumbersome regulatory procedure. It's just a matter of clearing the political hurdles of getting consensus among the Democrats in Congress over their willingness to get rid of the rules in the book.\\n\\nTrump's administration was creative with its implementation of the CRA, using it to undo agency rules that dated back to 2013. Now some legal scholars are evaluating how Biden's administration can stretch the law to undo some of the Trump administration's more extreme policies, even if they don't fall into the traditional definitions of a regulation.\\n\\nMatthew Lawrence, a law professor at Emory University, argued in the Yale Journal on Regulation this week that Biden's administration could even use the law to undo waivers granted to states to enact Medicaid work requirements — a policy change that would otherwise need the support of 60 senators.\\n\\nBiden's transition team did not respond by press time on its strategy for the Congressional Review Act. But with control of the Senate, it certainly makes the president-elect's campaign trail promises to undo Trump's regulatory legacy a little more likely."}
{"original": "A seemingly simple video is offering an important message about autism.\\n\\nOn March 8, mom and blogger Mandy Farmer posted a video of her 6-year-old son zipping his jacket on Facebook. In the caption, she opened up about the significance of this small task for her family.\\n\\nYou know how we say autism families don't take things for granted? This is what we mean, Farmer wrote.\\n\\nThe mom said her son's fine motor skills lag behind those of other kids his age. He can't write or draw a square and struggles with self-care tasks like opening packages, getting dressed and feeding himself with utensils.\\n\\nPeople have no idea how hard our kids have to work to be able to accomplish these tasks consistently, Farmer wrote. There are so many therapies that can help, but so many do not have access to those therapies. He has been doing this program for about a month and is now zipping independently, but I want you to be mindful of how much effort it still takes.\\n\\nThe mom concluded her post by noting that this type of milestone is the result of giving kids with special needs the opportunity to reach a higher potential.\\n\\nThe policy makers, school districts and insurance companies that refuse to invest in these therapies now are keeping these amazing individuals from becoming the most independent version of themselves, she wrote. It is so exciting to see him meet these milestones, even if they're met on a different timeline than that of his peers.\\n\\nThe video reached over 100,000 views on Facebook. The popular Love What Matters page also shared the post, giving it another 220,000 views.\\n\\nFarmer told The Huffington Post that it has been wonderful to see the overwhelming response to the video. The mom hopes it puts things into perspective for people to see how hard her son works to accomplish tasks that most people take for granted.\\n\\nWhile some people see him and think he's doing pretty well for someone his age with autism, onlookers don't always realize the countless hours of therapy it took to get him to that point.\\n\\nWe can tell people that it's still hard for him to use a spoon at 6 years old and that he still can't use a fork. We can tell people he still can't dress himself independently or snap his pants, she explained. But I think watching this video clip of how much effort, determination and perseverance he puts in to zip a zipper says it better than I ever could.\\n\\nFarmer is also happy that her video can help raise awareness about individuals on the spectrum. I hope legislators will see this and realize when they slash education funds, early intervention funds and Medicaid funds, these are the people they are hurting ― people who have all of the potential in the world if they are given the right tools to reach that potential, she said.\\n\\nI hope insurance companies see this and realize that when they deny an autistic child or child with dyspraxia or cerebral palsy therapy, this is the progress they are impeding, she continued. I hope therapists and special educators will see it and be proud that they make such a difference in autistic individuals' lives. And I hope others with children with special needs will be encouraged and know that milestones will come in their own time and with hard work the impossible is possible."}
{"original": "Two weeks removed from running the Interior Department ― a federal agency of 70,000 federal employees that manages one-fifth of the land in the United States ― Ryan Zinke this week landed a gig working for a little-known firm that invests in emerging financial technology fields like blockchain, the networks that underpin cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin and Ethereum.\\n\\nThe unlikely post-government service job for a man with no apparent background in the finance or technology sectors can be traced back to an old-fashioned case of swampy good fortune.\\n\\nOn a Friday afternoon in April, Zinke boarded a plane from Dallas to Atlanta after speaking at EarthX, an environmental conference. What Zinke likely didn't know was that the investment banker he sat next to on that leg of his flight home to Washington, D.C. would soon be his new boss.\\n\\nDaniel P. Cannon, CEO of technology and energy investment firm Artillery One, told HuffPost that he and Zinke spent the flight talking about American energy independence ― a favorite topic of Zinke's during his tenure in the Trump administration.\\n\\nWe discussed how U.S. soldiers dying for foreign oil was unacceptable to [President Donald Trump], Cannon told HuffPost in a text message, adding that the two did not talk business.\\n\\nThe former Navy SEAL and Montana congressman made an impression. His military service and qualities of leadership attracted me the most, Cannon said.\\n\\nA future job prospect never came up during the flight. But after hearing that Zinke would resign from his post on Jan. 2, Cannon reached out about having him join Artillery One.\\n\\nThe North Carolina-based company announced Zinke as its senior vice president and managing director in a Monday press release aptly titled Heavy artillery. The former interior secretary brings a wealth of experience and understanding of the workings of business and government and will help the firm continue to expand its consulting and finance business in the core areas of cybersecurity, energy, fintech and digital assets, Cannon said in an accompanying statement.\\n\\nWilliam Campbell via Getty Images It's an unlikely post-government service job for a man with no apparent background in the finance or technology sectors.\\n\\nThe company is all but nonexistent online. In October, it hosted a Blockchain Innovators Summit in Pebble Beach, California, which it described as the preeminent event in the history of blockchain. It is slated to host another blockchain conference in March in Palm Beach, Florida. The price tag for attendees is $2,000 apiece.\\n\\nBefore Monday's announcement, an online search of the company primarily turned up media coverage of the firm's failed attempt last year to rescue Swiss blockchain firm Monetas from bankruptcy. The deal was terminated in February after a feud between Cannon and Monetas' founder, SWI swissinfo.ch reported.\\n\\nIf the former chief steward of America's natural resources joining a blockchain investment firm wasn't odd enough, Zinke ― the loyal soldier of Trump's pro-fossil fuel energy dominance agenda for the last two years ― appears to have sold himself to Cannon as a someone who understands the immediate threat of climate change and is anxious to see the world transition to clean energy.\\n\\nSecretary Zinke understands the need for alternative, renewable energy as climate change is a clear and present danger, Cannon told ThinkProgress.\\n\\nAsked about climate change during an Environmental Protection Agency briefing a little more than a month ago, Zinke said he was proud the United States is now the largest oil and gas producer in the world ― and proud of the fact that we're going to get even better. He repeatedly downplayed the dire conclusions in the latest federal climate assessment, saying scientists relied on the worst scenarios. And while he pitched himself as a champion of public lands, he spent his time in the administration opening up millions of acres of public land to drilling and mining as he worked to pave a better future for the fossil fuel industry by rolling back environmental safeguards.\\n\\nAsked to elaborate on his comment to ThinkProgress, Cannon told HuffPost that he personally believes climate change is a serious threat.\\n\\nSecretary Zinke feels alternative energy away from fossil fuels is optimal wherever practical, he wrote. Natural Gas seems to be the transition fuel to alternative energy (wind, solar, geothermal, wave motion). We both share the opinion that U.S. Soldiers should not be fighting and dying over energy.\\n\\nAsked about Zinke's comment at the EPA briefing and if he's concerned about his new employee's history of questioning climate science, Cannon said, I'm aware that energy independence was/is the mandate of his former boss, President Trump.\\n\\nOn Monday, Zinke told the Associated Press he had joined a winning team.\\n\\nI am glad to be out of the swamp and free from the chains of office, he said.\\n\\nAside from blockchain, the company's investments include research at the University of California, Los Angeles, into supercapacitors and other technology that would boost battery storage, according to Cannon. And the firm is assisting some micro-nations that are switching from fossil fuels to cleaner renewable energy sources, he said.\\n\\nWe at Artillery One aspire to make the world a clean environment and reduce carbon emissions as much as technology will allow, Cannon said. We will continue to use our influence in financial and technological markets to achieve renewable energy optimization for the world.\\n\\nIn its press release, Artillery One said Zinke will be based in Montana and California but the job would also involve extensive travel overseas. And working with Cannon, Zinke will continue to follow the vision of President Donald J. Trump in Making America Great Again, by bringing economic development, jobs and opportunities for people, at home and internationally, the company said.\\n\\nZinke's first job assignment for Artillery One is a cushy one. He will travel to Switzerland this week to represent his new company at the Crypto Finance Conference, described as the world's most exclusive investor conference on cryptocurrencies and blockchain investments. The three-day event kicks off Wednesday and is held at a ritzy, five-star hotel in the resort town of St. Moritz.\\n\\nZinke exited the Interior Department on Jan. 2 under a cloud of ethics scandals and some critics speculated he would end up working in the oil and gas industry. Cannon told ThinkProgress reporter Kyla Mandel that he's not concerned about ongoing federal investigations into Zinke's conduct and policy decisions while at the federal agency, one of which was recently referred to the Justice Department for possible criminal violations. And when pressed about the Trump-MAGA mention in the company's release, Cannon answered, I have no opinion on that. I stay out of politics. However, I love our country.\\n\\nBut if the Artillery One press release and his personal Facebook page are any indications, Cannon is a vocal Trump supporter. And he and his new employee share disdain for former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. While Zinke once called Clinton the Antichrist and the real enemy, Cannon shared a meme months before the 2016 election that shows a dog defecating on the cover of her book, Hard Choices. And in January 2016 he peddled the debunked right-wing conspiracy that former President Barack Obama was born outside the U.S., sharing a meme with a picture of Clinton and the words, If I go down, the Kenyan comes with me."}
{"original": "If you're getting close to retirement age, it's perfectly normal to be excited. One day, you'll hand in your resignation at work and begin counting down the hours (instead of the weeks or years) until you're living life on your own terms. You've worked your entire life for this moment, so it's only natural to look forward to this change with gratitude and enthusiasm.\\n\\nBut, if you're like most Americans, there may be an issue. You may dream of restful mornings reading the newspaper and late night card sessions with friends, but that doesn't mean your bank account agrees.\\n\\nA recent study from the Economic Policy Institute (EPI) showed that, as of last year, the average household nearing retirement (ages 56–61) had only $163,577 in retirement funds stashed away, while the median was only $17,000. This is a far cry from what most people will need to truly retire, at least if they hope to quit working completely.\\n\\n8 Ways to Boost Your Income in Retirement\\n\\nIf you're nearing retirement and finding the math doesn't work out, it may be possible to find a semi-retirement solution that lets you leave your traditional job while earning money on the side. If you're already retired, on the other hand, there are plenty of ways to boost your cash flow so you're not struggling every month.\\n\\nAccording to some of the top financial advisors I know, some of the best ways to create multiple income streams in retirement require nothing more than some skill and outside-of-the-box thinking.\\n\\nNeed more money in retirement? Here are some options to consider:\\n\\n#1: Rent out your home — or a room — on AirBNB.\\n\\nIf you want to earn money in a non-traditional way and you live in an area with appeal for tourists, you could earn some side cash by renting out a room — or your entire property — on AirBNB.com. The best part about this strategy is that you get to set your rates and make all the rules. The downside is, you'll occasionally deal with an upset renter or an issue that needs fixed during a stay.\\n\\nNew York-based financial advisor Joseph Carbone of the Social Security Teacher Blog says some of his retired clients have had especially good luck renting out their primary residence in certain locations.\\n\\nMany of them rent out their home for the whole summer, says Carbone. They use the rent they receive to pay their mortgage for the whole summer if they have one, or use the income to help supplement their retirement.\\n\\nWhile their house is being rented, they can slow travel through cheaper parts of the country, visit kids and grandchildren, and use their profits to pay for their summer travel expenses. Doing so helps them create cash flow without having a traditional job, which allows them to keep their retirement accounts intact longer.\\n\\n#2: Drive for Uber.\\n\\nDuring retirement, you've got greater flexibility to enjoy your time, run errands, and take in more of your surroundings. How about making your own hours to earn some extra cash as you go along?\\n\\nIf you have a 2001 or newer model 4-door sedan and pass a vehicle inspection, you can make extra cash in retirement by becoming a driver for Uber, says Anthony Montenegro, Founder of Blackmont Advisors and author at FinancialHealthGuide.com.\\n\\nThe average hourly earnings for an Uber driver is $19.04. That's nearly 40 percent more than the $11.68 per hour median pay for taxi drivers and chauffeurs, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\\n\\nIf you're up for giving someone a ride to the mall, a park, or the airport, it's a great way to earn as you go and maybe add an adventure along the way.\\n\\n#3: Participate in focus groups and surveys.\\n\\nIf you're looking for ways to make easy money from your own home, it's hard to beat focus groups and surveys. Dozens of websites will pay you to provide feedback on various consumer products and services, although the details on each can vary quite a bit.\\n\\nSites like MySurvey.com and OpinionOutpost.com offer a good way to earn extra cash just by filling out surveys, says Sacramento financial planner Grant Bledsoe. And if you can find one, participating in a live focus group can earn you a few hundred dollars just for a few hours of your time.\\n\\nThis may not lead to a huge income, but any extra money you can earn in retirement will certainly help. Best of all, these opportunities are easy to take advantage of at home, and in your spare time.\\n\\n#4: Become an independent consultant.\\n\\nIf you loved your former career and have an established area of expertise, it's possible to use that experience to build a part-time consulting gig. The best part about consulting is that you can usually work on your own time, do your work in whatever way suits your talents and skills, and charge as much money as the market will bear.\\n\\nDepending on your former career and expertise, your knowledge may be in huge demand — even if you don't realize it. The key is, you may never know until you break out on your own and try.\\n\\nAlso, don't be afraid to charge a premium price for you experience and expertise, says Arizona financial planner Charles C. Scott. Since you're not on anyone's payroll, companies don't have to include all the employee benefits, so you could still look like a bargain to them.\\n\\n#5: Become a handyman (or handywoman).\\n\\nIf you worked in a blue-collar position before retirement, you may have honed some trade skills throughout the years. That could include a wide range of repairs around the home, odd jobs that can fill up your day, or any type of home maintenance work.\\n\\nMarket your areas of expertise by word of mouth and let people know that you're good at tasks such as painting, hanging shelves, installing drywall, etc. says Cedar Rapids, Iowa financial planner Anthony Reynolds. Additionally, you can search your local area for odd jobs and get an indication of what tasks people are willing to pay for.\\n\\n#6: Become an online freelancer or virtual assistant.\\n\\nMany retirees still have valid skills they can utilize to work as an online freelancer to generate an active income stream, says California financial advisor Michael Frick of Promenade Advisors LLC.\\n\\nThe big difference in today's world, however, is that there are a lot more opportunities to market yourself online. Websites like Upwork.com, Freelancer.com, and Fiverr.com allow in-demand freelancers with skills such as accounting, marketing, customer service, or copywriting to connect with potential clients around the globe.\\n\\nFreelancers can set their own rates for work, and they can decide whether they wish to select a particular project, says Frick.\\n\\nWith the rise of professional bloggers, working as a virtual assistant has also become a popular option, notes Colorado financial advisor Matthew Jackson of Solid Wealth Advisors, LLC.\\n\\nFor the most part, these jobs require basic knowledge of web-based tools like email and Wordpress, along with ability and desire to learn new skills quickly. Most virtual assistants make at least $15 per hour working from home, but many charge a lot more.\\n\\n#7: Teach a class.\\n\\nTeaching a skill or hobby can be both fulfilling and profitable, and the opportunities may be more varied than you think.\\n\\nSkills that used to be considered commonplace might now be in great demand, says Vancouver, WA financial planner Alex Whitehouse.\\n\\nNo matter what, don't discount your skill as something no one wants to learn. Many talents that you learned are now lost arts — things like canning, quilting, or carpentry, for example. If you're able to parlay old skills into a new course or class — either online or in-person — you could earn some serious side income.\\n\\n#8: Pick up items at a discount, then resell them for profit online.\\n\\nIf you're particularly knowledgeable about a specific type of used product — for example, antiques — you could make money buying at a discount and reselling with online websites like eBay.com.\\n\\nThere may be a learning curve to get started, but you could eventually hone your money-making skills with enough time and patience. And when it comes to finding discounted items to resell, it helps to know where to look.\\n\\nShoes, vinyl records, stuffed animals, Carhartt overalls and novelty pint glasses are all items that I've seen picked up for next to nothing at garage sales, and sold at a profit on eBay, says Minnesota financial advisor Jamie Pomeroy of Financial Gusto. After a while, you'll get a better feel for the hot selling items on eBay, and will be able to spot those at garage sales a mile away.\\n\\nc\\n\\nWhile many retirees and future retirees are set for life, others need to earn some money to supplement their retirement funds, pensions, and social security payments. Fortunately, it's now easier than ever to earn some extra cash without having to get a traditional part-time job or work for someone else.\\n\\nIt's also more common than ever, says Texas financial planner Shane Sullivan of TheDedicatedInvetsor.com. According to Sullivan, one of his retired clients works at a golf course, another works part-time at her church, and another works as a fishing guide in his community. And, guess what? They're all happier than ever.\\n\\nThe key to making work in retirement fulfilling, according to Sullivan, is for retirees to find something they love. And that might be the most important lesson of all — if you must work during retirement, you should strive to find something that's fulfilling and fun.\\n\\nThis post was originally published on money.usnews.com"}
{"original": "Nina Parks bought a VIP ticket for her first cannabis business conference in early 2015.\\n\\nIt was so expensive, I thought, I don't even know how I'm going to pay for this, she said, but she was new to the industry and hoped the meet-and-greet would offer networking opportunities with like-minded owners and operators in the growing medicinal market.\\n\\nI walked into that room, and I saw Amber, and she was the only one who had weed and the only woman of color, Parks said.\\n\\nAmber Senter, an entrepreneur and consultant in the business, was also the only woman of color on any of the conference's panels, which delivered industry insight to an audience that seemed to have little personal or political investment in the plant and a lot more money to spend than those who did.\\n\\nI was like, what is going on? Is this what the industry looks like? It's just white men in suits! Park recalls asking Senter. Many, many, many white men in suits.\\n\\nThis was not a reflection of the industry as they knew it. Parks and Senter were based in California, which became the first state to legalize medicinal marijuana in 1996. In 2013, the Justice Department under President Barack Obama, in a document known as the Cole memo, limited federal intervention in state-level legalization. The Green Rush hurtled toward the Golden State, and it was mostly white and male.\\n\\nRoxane Pasibe/East Bay Express Andrea Unsworth, left, Amber Senter, Tsion Lencho and Nina Parks formed the nonprofit Supernova Women in 2015.\\n\\nSenter was consulting for cannabis businesses when she met Tsion Lencho, an attorney, at an industry event. They both worked to help prospective businesses navigate tax and regulatory structures, and they were troubled by the lack of inclusion and how gentrified the industry could become with full legalization.\\n\\nAt the time, Parks, Lencho and entrepreneur Andrea Unsworth had tried to bring more of an activist focus to existing women's cannabis industry groups. We just saw that wasn't going to happen, and we weren't going to try to change that, Unsworth said.\\n\\nThe four women founded Supernova Women to fill the gap: a nonprofit organization by and for women of color in the emerging cannabis industry. The four women, each experts in their fields, work to lower barriers to entry for people of color in the emerging cannabis industry and advocate on their behalf in California's rapidly expanding market.\\n\\nSupernova Women Supernova Women helps people prepare applications for permits and licenses in a changing regulatory environment.\\n\\nUnsworth, who has an MBA and was a cannabis entrepreneur when the group began, said she wanted to advocate for those who were very present in the gray-market industry ― women and people of color ― but who were largely missing from conversations about the policies that would shape it.\\n\\nWe saw that there was more to be done than just networking, Unsworth said. We wanted the same women attending those events to come to city council meetings and have their stories told, not just in these women's meetings.\\n\\nAround the same time Supernova Women formed in 2015, California cannabis policy went into overdrive, and legalization seemed inevitable.\\n\\nLencho studied cannabis prohibition and policy in law school at Stanford. When she entered the field as an attorney providing guidance for cannabis businesses, she was surprised how little consideration was given to addressing the harms that had been caused by criminalization.\\n\\nWhen you came to the business side of things, there was a complete dearth of conversation about inclusion, even though social and racial justice were at the forefront of the talking points around why you should legalize and why you should allow local jurisdictions to give permits, Lencho said. But no one was talking about providing permits for those who actually went to jail for cannabis.\\n\\nIn November 2016, California passed Proposition 64, which legalized recreational, or adult use, marijuana and included sweeping measures to address harm caused by its prohibition. Localities would establish their own rules for approving licenses to sell recreational cannabis beginning on Jan. 1, 2018.\\n\\nLawmakers and advocates began to discuss what it might look like if legalization policies embraced restorative justice. How can communities of color, whose access to the networks and means required to start a business for cannabis had long been oppressed by the rules governing it, now benefit from what is projected to be the largest and most profitable market in the U.S.?\\n\\nChristina House/Los Angeles Times via Getty Images Customers line up in West Hollywood as the legal sale of recreational marijuana begins in California.\\n\\nThe existing industry was already inclusive of a lot black and brown faces, Unsworth said. We knew that people were just going to run in here and buy up all the property and just take it over. If nothing else, we wanted to slow it down and make sure that these other considerations were on the table.\\n\\nSupernova Women, based in Oakland, attended city council meetings across the Bay Area to advise localities on how they might preserve and promote the diversity in the industry, address disparities and even implement legalization policies that consider the disproportionate effect of criminalization on people of color.\\n\\nNo one was talking about providing permits for those who actually went to jail for cannabis. Tsion Lencho, attorney, Supernova Women co-founder\\n\\nIn early 2017, Oakland City Councilwoman Desley Brooks put forward a radical equity permit plan to address the harmful effects of prohibition on communities of color: When handing out permits, prioritize those who had been hit the hardest by marijuana criminalization.\\n\\nWhen you look across this country, the people who are making money in respect to cannabis and recreational marijuana are white men, Brooks told Rolling Stone earlier this year. The people who have historically gone to jail for the same activity are predominantly African-American and Latino.\\n\\nPrior to Jan. 1 and the implementation of Proposition 64, California state licensing policies prohibited anyone with a felony conviction for cannabis from starting a cannabis business, so any person previously in possession of a plant the state now considered legal was excluded from the legal market.\\n\\nNationally, black people are 3.5 times more likely to be arrested for marijuana possession than white people, even though the two groups consume cannabis at similar rates. In Oakland, 90 percent of cannabis arrests from 1995 to 2015 were people of color.\\n\\nOakland's newly created department of race and equity, led by Darlene Flynn, produced an equity analysis to see how outcomes for people of color might be improved by the kind of equitable cannabis policy Brooks had proposed.\\n\\nWe did outreach through the network of cannabis folks in the city of Oakland and sat with folks and asked them questions about what the barriers were and what it would take for them to overcome those barriers and to engage in the legalized cannabis market, Flynn told HuffPost.\\n\\nSupernova Women provided expertise and stakeholder perspectives for Flynn's equity analysis. The city finalized and adopted its equity permit program in May of 2016.\\n\\nThe program reserves half of medical and recreational marijuana business licenses for applicants who meet certain criteria: They must live in Oakland, make less than 80 percent of the area median income, and had either been convicted of a cannabis crime or live in an area of the city with disproportionately high marijuana arrests.\\n\\nIt also creates incentives for applicants who don't meet those criteria to incubate equity applicants and provide capital and real estate for their businesses. Those who qualify receive no-interest loans from the city.\\n\\nSupernova Women urged lawmakers in San Francisco to consider a similar program. Without equity language in place on Jan. 1, when cities could officially license adult-use cannabis businesses, the city might lose a chance to ensure that those who had been hurt by the racist criminalization of the plant were first in line to create wealth from it.\\n\\nParks, who owns a delivery service in the city, introduced herself to Nicole Elliott, the first director of the city's office of cannabis. She also created a working group with other operators in the area.\\n\\nWe sat down with every single one of the board members and their staff, and every day for almost three months, to create the guidelines Parks said.\\n\\nCity Supervisor Malia Cohen fiercely advocated for an equity program in San Francisco. When serving as acting mayor last September, Cohen halted approvals for new cannabis permits until steps were taken to ensure a more equitable process. She fought for and won continuances to set the city's cannabis policy, urging her colleagues to consider the consequences of letting a privileged minority sail ahead.\\n\\nA post shared by ...for the Higher US (@nina_parks) on Nov 29, 2017 at 9:17am PST\\n\\nThe city ultimately adopted Cohen's proposed equity program, which goes a step further than Oakland's by requiring existing businesses to reapply for licenses. Los Angeles has since adopted its own set of equity guidelines.\\n\\nThe programs are slightly different, but they all have the same basic themes, Lencho said. You can't exclude people who have been formerly incarcerated, you can't fail to provide certain technical assistance, financial assistance or real estate assistance to those people. And you have to figure out a system to prioritize those businesses getting into the market.\\n\\nReese Benton, a cannabis entrepreneur who owns a delivery service in San Francisco, said she'd thought about shutting down when she got a call from Malia Cohen's office to advise on an equity program.\\n\\nThat's when all the tables turned, she said. They told me, Oh, you cannot give up. You have to do this. You don't know what you have. Let us help you. I thought, this is a dream, this is the answer I've been waiting for.\\n\\nBenton, whose father was incarcerated on drug-related charges, is reapplying for her permit through the equity program and meeting with investors who want to help expand her business.\\n\\nA post shared by Reese (@thestylistreeseb) on Jan 4, 2018 at 5:38pm PST\\n\\nTsion Lencho, Malia Cohen, and Reese Benton\\n\\nWomen, and women of color specifically have led the charge in advocating for cannabis policy that allows for restorative justice and healing from the war on drugs.\\n\\nOutside of California, Ayanna Pressley, the first woman of color elected to the Boston City Council, worked with the Minority Cannabis Business Association to develop a model equity bill. In 2017, Shaleen Title, a marijuana attorney and legalization activist, was appointed to lead the Massachusetts Cannabis Control Commission.\\n\\nAlison Heckard Shaleen Title, a 34-year-old Indian-American, was appointed to lead the Massachusetts Cannabis Control Commision.\\n\\nDespite their leadership in advocacy and policy, women of color are still largely absent from mainstream images of the cannabis industry, where say they experience casual sexism and blatant racism.\\n\\nAs a black woman attorney who was educated at Stanford twice, I am repeatedly having to prove to people that I know what I'm talking about. I recognize that I may be viewed as a unicorn, but it's astounding that people aren't used to women attorneys, Lencho said.\\n\\nWhat you see in the general business sector with regard to sexism is exacerbated by cannabis because it's an ever-changing environment, she added.\\n\\nUnsworth said the greatest challenge women of color face when entering the cannabis industry is lack of access to networks and capital. For some, these issues are closely related to the war on drugs.\\n\\nIt's about who you know, just like any other industry. Whether it's telecom or cannabis. If you want to be a big player, you have to know folks and you have to commit capital. And when every male in your family has been in jail at one point in their life, it's very hard to build up capital, she said.\\n\\nRemembering those women of color who have been left behind when their men have fallen is another aspect of the war on drugs that gets forgotten about. Andrea Unsworth, Supernova Women\\n\\nNina Parks opened Mirage Medicinal after her brother, an aspiring cannabis entrepreneur, was arrested on a cannabis charge in 2014 and sentenced to a year at Riker's Island in New York.\\n\\nHe had a vision for a delivery service and lifestyle brand called Mirage Medicinal. He had all the paperwork done, she said. But under licensing laws at the time, his conviction would disqualify him from entering the legal market.\\n\\nI didn't want him to sit in jail thinking everything was lost, Parks said.\\n\\nParks procured the license for Mirage Medicinal in her name. Because of her brother's previous conviction, they'll be applying for a new license through San Francisco's equity permit program this year.\\n\\nOther sisters, daughters and wives of men targeted by the war on drugs are among those prioritized to receive permits to sell legal cannabis this year.\\n\\nRemembering those women of color who have been left behind when their men have fallen is another aspect of the war on drugs that gets left behind or forgotten about, Unsworth said.\\n\\nShanita Penny is the president of the Minority Cannabis Business Association and the CEO and founder of Budding Solutions, a cannabis financial consulting firm. She described women's outsized participation in industry activism as a necessity.\\n\\nThe movers and shakers in the industry and activist space are phenomenal women who broke down barriers in corporate America, politics and in every other aspect of life, out of necessity, she said. These women are mothers, partners, wives, sisters and daughters of the men killed and imprisoned and left with few options in life as the War on Drugs rages on. We don't have the option of not actively pursuing restorative justice in addition to creating an equitable industry. \\n\\nUltimately, these minority business owners hope the industry will respect their claim to the plant they helped bring out of the darkness.\\n\\nYou are going to respect this plant. You're not just going to come in here and grab on us. You're going to respect what we have to bring to the table, and we've been doing this a really long time, and you're not just going to come in here and grab it, Unsworth said. As women, we're finally getting the chance to scream that as a group."}
{"original": "nicoletaionescu via Getty Images Compared with other full-time employee benefits, a holiday party invite may seem a small matter, but it's a difficult-to-avoid, public indication of contractors' second-class status.\\n\\nThe office holiday party is where employees gather to celebrate the past year and look forward to the next. It can be a time to gossip and bond with colleagues and bring home stories and swag. And at major tech companies that are notorious for both their lavish holiday parties and widespread use of contract employees, it's yet one more perk those employees don't get to share.\\n\\nCompared with common full-time employee benefits like high-quality health insurance, paid family leave and retirement-plan employer contributions, a party invite may seem a small matter, but it's a difficult-to-avoid annual indication of contractors' second-class status. And it unfolds publicly.\\n\\nIn many cases, tech contractors work at the same buildings, work on the same projects and eat the same food as full-time employees, without getting the same perks and benefits. One Apple contractor said that he did not even know about the company's holiday party this year until after it took place. Jaime, a former Google contractor who asked that we not use her last name, said that contractors were not invited to the holiday party during her time at the company. She said the event, which took place in multiple rooms and multiple floors of a rented space, is one of the flashiest perks Google offers. Contractors could attend only if they were a direct employee's guest.\\n\\nAsking and waiting for a willing and able employee to extend an invitation could make a contractor feel like a charity case, said Jaime, who was unable to score an invite.\\n\\nTwo Google contractors, who declined to be identified out of fear of jeopardizing their employment, said the party policy for contractors continues. Google's 2018 holiday parties in California's Bay Area took place at San Francisco City Hall, the Contemporary Jewish Museum, the Palace of Fine Arts, the M.H. de Young Memorial Museum and the Galleria at the San Francisco Design Center, among other locations, according to people who attended.\\n\\nYou are doing work for this company on site full time, and it feels kind of arbitrary and kind of cruel. - Jaime, former Google contractor\\n\\nOnce we were there, it was fine, said a Google contractor who works on site and scored a plus-one. But the whole getting of the ticket felt far more burdensome than it needed to be. It felt desperate [to ask].\\n\\nThe purgatory of contract work\\n\\nContract workers outnumbered employees for the first time at Google last year, according to a Bloomberg report in July. One current Google contractor with access to the figures estimated that there are roughly 97,400 full-time employees and 97,300 contractors worldwide at Google's parent company, Alphabet, not counting workers in facilities, food service, security, transportation, travel and certain wellness services.\\n\\nSuch contracting is not a temporary annoyance; it can be a second-tier citizenship that can last for years. And members of this shadow workforce are growing increasingly disgruntled about their treatment, demanding better wages and access to all-staff communications, among other things.\\n\\nFor most [temps, vendors and contractors] here, it's not like we're a temp filling in for the week at the front desk. It feels like a regular job, one Google contractor said. But then there are everyday reminders ― like not getting invited to a company party ― that remind contractors theirs is not like a regular job with career development opportunities.\\n\\nIt's natural to feel like you have a foot in the door as a contractor, but TVCs are not seen as a pipeline to employment at Google, said a Google contractor.\\n\\nYana Calou is the director of training and engagement at nonprofit Coworker.org, which supports employees working toward improving employment conditions. Calou speaks with employees and contractors at Google, Apple, Facebook and others and said that employees may be discouraged from interacting with contractors.\\n\\nAt Google, for example, there are strict guidelines for how employees should treat contractors, The Guardian reported. Contractors may not get simple perks like company T-shirts. They may not be invited to team off-site events or all-hands meetings. And they must wear different-colored badges identifying them as contractors.\\n\\nNicole Sanchez, the CEO of Vaya Consulting, which works with companies on inclusion, outlined the hierarchal system that technology workers can get sorted into: At the top are salaried employees with full benefits, then professional-level contractors, then the service workers.\\n\\nThere are so many indications inside a company culture of where you stand in this caste system, and they are reinforced by things like the color of your badge, where you get to park, where you get to eat, and the holiday party is one of those things, Sanchez said.\\n\\nLilly Irani, a Google user experience designer from 2003 to 2007, said that even a decade ago, the contractor system created a hierarchical system where contractors were promised inclusion among the full-timers in exchange for taking depressed wages, strainingly competitive work circumstances and strict disciplinary structures. Full-time Google workers like me at the time were usually unaware of this tiered system unless we were friends with people on the other side.\\n\\nI think that really limits the kind of interactions you have and the kind of friendships that you would make where you would even be in a position where someone would ask, 'Do you want to be my plus-one?' Calou said. I think there is a fear instilled on the side of employees that they might be putting themselves or that contractor at risk by engaging like they would another colleague.\\n\\nGoogle declined to comment on whether contractors are invited to holiday parties. A Google spokesperson said, Temps, vendors and contractors are an important part of our extended workforce, but they are employed by other companies, not Google. Facebook and Apple — two other companies that reportedly rely on a large shadow workforce of contractors for their products — did not respond to questions about their holiday party policies.\\n\\nEach of these companies appeared on a 2019 Glassdoor list of the best places to work, based on reviews from all employee types.\\n\\nThe party invite signals who is valued and who is not\\n\\nThe social humiliation of getting excluded is less about going to the swanky office holiday party itself than what that invitation symbolizes: appreciation at the end of the year for employees' hard work. It is a social activity that is an indication of your enfranchisement as a full member of that community, Sanchez said.\\n\\nThey don't want the contractors to feel like employees. They don't want them to be motivated to feel like they could have the same benefits as the regular employees. - Veena Dubal, associate professor of law, University of California, Hastings\\n\\nRegular exclusion from meetings and off-site events fosters resentment and a sense of division for many contractors. Jaime called her experience as a contractor morale crushing.\\n\\nYou feel like there is this thing you should have access to. You are doing work for this company on site full time, and it feels kind of arbitrary and kind of cruel in its execution, Jaime said. I wish they would see that they have the same responsibility to their vendors and contractors that they do to their full-time employees.\\n\\nThe everyday slights and indignities that contractors experience can add up. Your company, should you decide not to include your contractors, is clearly indicating to your workforce who we value and who we don't, Sanchez said.\\n\\nThat demoralizing message could be delivered by design. Some legal experts suggest the rule may be borne of an extreme fear of misclassifying contractors as employees.\\n\\nGenerally, employers and contractors in the United States are distinguished by the amount of control and direction an employer exerts over the worker. In 2000, Microsoft found this out the hard way and had to pay $97 million in a settlement with the company's permatemps, who often worked more than two years at the company, doing work similar to employees' without getting the same benefits.\\n\\nIf Google was found to be a joint employer of its contractors, then the company could be held liable for them as employees. Silicon Valley companies may be trying to avoid this expensive obligation. Bob See, a former Google engineering recruiter, said as much in a 2015 Quora post. Contractors indeed aren't invited to company ski trips, the company holiday party, and other such company-funded social events ... to avoid co-employment misclassification that can have severe, negative legal, tax, and other financial implications on the company, he wrote.\\n\\nTerri Gerstein, a fellow in the Harvard Law School Labor and Worklife Program, suggested that contractor exclusion from holiday parties may happen because these companies are extra cautious to take every opportunity to differentiate between employees and people working for contractors or staffing agencies.\\n\\nFor Veena Dubal, an associate professor of law at the University of California, Hastings, the reasons for exclusion could be more strategic.\\n\\nMore than a legal fear is a fear of collective action, she said. They don't want the contractors to feel like employees. They don't want them to be motivated to feel like they could have the same benefits as the regular employees.\\n\\nKnowing one's place applies to employees too.\\n\\nThey do not want employees to form relationships with contractors, Dubal said, noting that those bonds that could lead to a large-scale mobilization.\\n\\nThe lasting division of not being invited\\n\\nContractors are working not just at technology giants. One 2018 NPR/Marist poll estimated that 1 in 5 Americans holds a job as a contractor. As employers increasingly outsource labor to cheaper contractors, temporary contractors working in purgatory arrangements are becoming a permanent part of work life. They could be working at your office too, as they are at mine. A spokesperson for Verizon Media Services, HuffPost's parent company, said in an email that only direct employees are invited to the company's holiday party, but they are each allowed a guest (so a contingent worker could attend as a guest if so invited).\\n\\nIf employers do not give workers with similar roles the same perks and benefits, workforces can reflect the same inequalities of haves and have-nots seen outside the office, Sanchez said."}
{"original": "This morning I testified as a witness before the House Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on the Constitution and Civil Justice on the topic of First Amendment Protections on Public College and University Campuses. Below is my oral testimony, including some of the slides I showed the members of the Committee. (As of this posting, the testimony is still in progress!)\\n\\nChairman King, Vice-Chairman DeSantis, Ranking Member Cohen and distinguished members of the subcommittee,\\n\\nMy organization, the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education, or FIRE, was founded in 1999 to defend free speech, academic freedom, and due process on America's college campuses. FIRE is a principled, nonpartisan nonprofit and this is reflected in both our staff and the cases we take. For example, our litigation project has recently defended the right of students to protest animal cruelty, and advocate for pot legalization, Second Amendment rights, and more.\\n\\nJust last week, we filed a lawsuit against Los Angeles Pierce College in California, which told a student that if he wanted to engage in free speech activities, he had to limit himself to a tiny free speech zone. The zone comprised only .003% of the campus. Put another way, if Pierce College were the size of a tennis court, free speech would be restricted to an area the size of a cell phone.\\n\\nSince our founding in 1999, FIRE has fought free speech zones—efforts by administrators to quarantine freedom of speech to tiny areas. And we've defeated many of them, including Texas Tech's infamous free speech gazebo, the University of Hawaii at Hilo's free speech swamp, and this sad little one at Blinn College, which was divided into even smaller halves by a bulletin board. Many institutions even require advance permission for students to speak inside the zones: For example, the University of Cincinnati asked for 10 working days' notice.\\n\\nOther speech codes comprise broad and vague restrictions on expression that practically anyone could be found guilty of violating. Take the University of West Alabama's prohibition on harsh text messages or emails, which is in force, or both the University of Connecticut and Drexel University's now-defunct prohibitions on inappropriately directed laughter.\\n\\nWhile many speech codes are absurd, fighting them—even at colleges bound by the First Amendment—has required more than 60 lawsuits since 1989. And all of the 56 suits that have concluded have resulted in either a speech-protective court decision or the repeal of the speech code.\\n\\nThe money and time public campuses waste defending these manifestly unconstitutional codes in court is a national scandal. Campuses should not have to be forced to respect students' First Amendment rights.\\n\\nBut there is good news: Since I last spoke with the Committee in 2015, and thanks in no small part to a letter Chairman Goodlatte sent to 161 colleges and universities across the country, (and many additional lawsuits), the number of speech codes on campus has decreased significantly.\\n\\nFIRE uses a simple red, yellow, and green traffic light system to rate colleges' written policies on expression. When we first published our findings in 2007, 75% of colleges maintained red light—or laughably unconstitutional—speech codes. In 2015, after years of fighting both inside and outside of court, the percentage of red light codes had dropped to around 55%. And since Chairman Goodlatte's letter was sent, that number has now dropped below 35% at public colleges. At the same time, the number of green light schools (colleges whose codes do not threaten protected speech) has nearly doubled.\\n\\nWhile there is no need to be fatalistic about speech codes, much work still has to be done, particularly as the Department of Education has championed a definition of sexual harassment that is so vague and broad that it seriously threatens campus speech. The Department of Education hailed this as a blueprint for all universities to follow, but it specifically eliminated the requirement that speech be both subjectively and objectively offensive, and it reduced the definition of harassment to any unwelcome verbal conduct (also known as speech) of a sexual nature.\\n\\nTo give you an idea of how broad such a code is, professor Teresa Buchanan was fired from her job at Louisiana State University for violating a policy just like this blueprint, allegedly because she explained in realistic detail the way that some parents talk to some teachers. She is currently suing Louisiana State University, with FIRE's help, and we believe that any judge looking at the Department of Education's blueprint definition of harassment would have to find it glaringly unconstitutional.\\n\\nThe House Judiciary Committee has already been a great ally in the fight for free speech on campus. Even in these polarized times, we hope that free speech on campus can be an issue that unites all parties.\\n\\nIn my written testimony, I recommend four approaches:\\n\\nWarn public campuses in each state that speech codes are unconstitutional and can unnecessarily cost the state money.\\n\\nSupport the CAFE Act to put a legislative end to free speech zones.\\n\\nCodify the Supreme Court's definition of student-on-student harassment, set forth in Davis v. Monroe County Board of Education.\\n\\nPass a federal New Voices Act to protect student journalists.\\n\\nThank you for your time."}
{"original": "A US drone aircraft lands at Afghanistan's Jalalabad Airport. (Noorullah Shirzada/AFP/Getty Images)\\n\\nThis post first appeared at BillMoyers.com.\\n\\nMary Anne Grady Flores is in jail today and American citizens everywhere can surely breathe a sigh of relief that we are safe from her criminal behavior at least for the next six months.\\n\\nThat's the length of the sentence this 59-year-old peace activist in upstate New York began on Tuesday -- one day after the United States honored Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., for his commitment to nonviolent civil disobedience. If he were here today, the martyred Dr. King would surely be shaking his head that America still has a problem with peaceful dissenters of conscience.\\n\\nAnd what exactly did Grady Flores do to warrant spending the next six months in jail? She photographed a peaceful protest outside Hancock Field Air National Guard Base near Syracuse, New York. The base is where the U.S. trains pilots to launch drone strikes in the Middle East, particularly in Afghanistan, Pakistan and Yemen. It wasn't a crime for her to be taking pictures of the demonstration, but when she briefly and unintentionally -- yes, unintentionally -- stepped onto a road that belongs to the base, she violated what authorities called an order of protection, which had been issued in 2012 to forbid protesters from approaching the home or workplace of Col. Earl Evans, a commander of the 174th Attack Wing of the Air National Guard. She had never met Evans, never threatened him, never showed any intention of harming him.\\n\\nVideo still from Mary Anne Grady Flores' press conference before reporting to jail. Via YouTube\\n\\nNonetheless, a town justice, David Gideon, issued the order to protect the Colonel from the activists. That's right -- the commander of a major military operation, piloting drones on lethal missions half-way around the world, requested a court order of protection against a group of mostly gray-haired demonstrators whom he had never met. In stepping briefly on the roadway at the base, Grady Flores violated that order, despite the fact that, as she says, We weren't at the security gate. We were out at the roadway.\\n\\nNow get this: The order issued by Judge Gideon was of the sort commonly used against victims of sexual or domestic abuse. The legal terms 'victim' and 'witness' have been expanded in this case in a way that's new and unique in the state of New York, said attorney Lance Salisbury at a press conference yesterday before Grady Flores was hauled off to jail.\\n\\nGrady Flores had protested outside the base before. She belongs to The Upstate Coalition to Ground the Drones and End the Wars, which has criticized the drone program since 2010, calling for a change in policy to uphold life and law.\\n\\nPresident Obama and the Pentagon insist that using drones in pursuit of terrorists causes minimal civilian casualties and protects American troops, but Grady Flores takes issue with that justification. She told us she had been moved, in particular, by reports of the staggering numbers of civilians killed by US drones, and she says her fears were confirmed by documents recently leaked to journalists at The Intercept revealing that during one five-month stretch, 90 percent of those killed in one part of Northeastern Afghanistan were not the intended target.\\n\\nGrady Flores says she was also shaken by the 2013 testimony before Congress of a family from Pakistan that had suffered a drone strike in North Waziristan. A grandmother of three herself, Grady Flores listened as Rafiq ur Rehman recounted his mother's death in the presence of her grandchildren. She was out in the fields picking okra with the kids around and a drone strike happened, and she was sent to four winds... now the kids live in terror, Grady Flores recalls.\\n\\nThat's why citizens are at the gates of Hancock, says Grady Flores. That's why we're there.\\n\\nGrady Flores was arrested in 2012, when she and 16 others blocked the entrance to the base, prompting the request from the military for the order of protection. When she was arrested again a year later -- not for protesting herself but for stepping on the road outside the base and taking pictures of others who were protesting -- she was found to be in violation of that protection order. And the protestors she was photographing? They were acquitted.\\n\\nJustice David Gideon threw the book at her. He sentenced her to a year, claiming in his five-page ruling that he didn't buy her First Amendment argument. Instead, he thought she was willing to 'break the law' to seek publicity for her cause. After an appeal, her sentence was shortened to six months.\\n\\nBefore she went to jail yesterday she told us: I asked my grandchildren, 'Do you know where I'm going?' and they said, 'yeah, you're going to jail, Nana.' She told us that it is difficult to leave her 88-year-old mother who is ailing, but that her mother appreciates her carrying on in the tradition of Dr. Martin Luther King and the iconic Catholic activist Dorothy Day, with whom her mother once worked. Day famously said, No one has a right to sit down and feel hopeless. There is too much work to do.\\n\\nGrady Flores says her mother's good-bye shared that sentiment, Mom said to me, 'I'll pray for you, I'll be with you in that cell.' She said it in a whisper, but she's grateful that I'm continuing the work.\\n\\nReporting by Gail Ablow and John Light."}
{"original": "President-elect Joe Biden is facing mounting pressure to drop a prominent lawyer currently working for one of the world's largest oil companies from the transition team's list of potential nominees for solicitor general.\\n\\nOn Monday, more than 50 environmental and faith-based groups sent a letter to Christopher Schroeder, the Biden transition team leader for the Department of Justice, urging the incoming administration against naming David Frederick as federal government's chief attorney responsible for arguing cases before the Supreme Court.\\n\\nAt issue is Frederick's current work defending Royal Dutch Shell against state and city lawsuits demanding the Netherlands-based oil giant pay for infrastructure damages caused by climate change.\\n\\nWe ask that you honor your pledge to support climate liability lawsuits by selecting a Solicitor General who has demonstrated their commitment to fighting for people, not polluters, read the letter, a copy of which HuffPost obtained. That means removing David Frederick, a corporate attorney who has represented Royal Dutch Shell against climate liability lawsuits, from your consideration.\\n\\nJonathan Ernst / Reuters David Frederick, pictured in the center, seen in 2008 outside the Supreme Court, where he was arguing a case on behalf of the now-defunct TV startup Aereo.\\n\\nHuffPost first reported last week that Frederick, 59, was under consideration for the solicitor general post. He previously served as a Clinton-era assistant to the solicitor general from 1996 to 2001 and appeared on the Obama administration's short list for the top job in 2008.\\n\\nNeither the Biden team nor Kellogg, Hansen, Todd, Figel & Frederick, the law firm where Frederick works, responded to emails requesting comment Monday morning.\\n\\nStates and cities started suing oil companies in 2015 after Inside Climate News and the Los Angeles Times published documents showing that oil giant Exxon Mobil Corp. understood fossil fuels caused global warming decades ago yet chose to ramp up drilling and fund a misinformation campaign smearing climate science. Three years later, the Dutch-language De Correspondent published a similar exposé on Shell.\\n\\nSince then, five states ― Connecticut, Delaware, Massachusetts, Minnesota, and Rhode Island ― and a number of cities ― including New York, Baltimore and Oakland, California ― have accused those companies of breaking U.S. law by hiding the reality of climate change.\\n\\nDuring the campaign, Biden repeatedly vowed to strategically support ongoing plaintiff-driven climate litigation against polluters as part of his pledge to wage a whole-of-government fight to curb planet-heating emissions.\\n\\nYet Frederick is arguing in court that states and cities don't have the legal authority to sue oil companies for climate damages. One environmental attorney compared the argument to stating that murder isn't illegal.\\n\\nFrederick's defenders say the progressive victories under his belt should outweigh his work for Shell. He won decisions in favor of Tyson Foods workers after the meatpacking giant didn't pay them their proper wages, and against tobacco companies advertising light cigarettes as safer.\\n\\nWe ask that you honor your pledge to support climate liability lawsuits by selecting a Solicitor General who has demonstrated their commitment to fighting for people, not polluters. Letter to Biden team from more than 50 environmental groups\\n\\nHe also defeated oil companies in court, blocking construction of a BP liquefied natural gas facility in Delaware, returning wages the firm Parker Drilling stole from an employee, and forcing Exxon Mobil to pay millions in fines for contaminating groundwater in New Hampshire.\\n\\nDavid is a stellar attorney, Michael Strauss, a California-based attorney with whom Frederick argued the Parker Drilling case, wrote in an email to HuffPost. David would be a fantastic Solicitor General.\\n\\nBut critics said it was that very record that made Frederick appealing to Shell.\\n\\nWhat Shell is purchasing in getting his time is a lawyer who is known to be a Democrat who had some good clients, and that provides a positive sheen to their cause, Jeff Hauser, director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research's Revolving Door Project, previously told HuffPost.\\n\\nThe groups that signed onto the letter said Frederick's willingness to defend Shell against the communities they harmed raises questions about what cases he'd champion as solicitor general.\\n\\nIf David Frederick is willing to argue against accountability for Shell in court, despite the copious evidence of the company's decades-long campaign to mislead consumers and the public about the existential threat of climate change, they wrote, his appointment would also have wider implications for all communities seeking redress from corporations that lied about the dangers they knew their products would cause."}
{"original": "WASHINGTON ― There's a way for the Trump administration to continue food assistance during the government shutdown ― at least according to one legal theory.\\n\\nThe conventional wisdom is that because the agency overseeing food aid is shut down, benefits for 38 million Americans may disappear after February. President Donald Trump has said the shutdown could continue for months or a year.\\n\\nThe people who get food benefits will go hungry if this happens. The late 20th century expansion of the food stamp program helped eradicate starvation in the U.S.\\n\\nBut Professor David Super, an expert on administrative and welfare law at Georgetown University Law School, argues that the conventional wisdom misreads the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program's underlying statute.\\n\\nSuper points to the text of the Food and Nutrition Act, which indicates more than once that anyone who is poor enough to qualify for benefits is supposed to get them. Assistance under this program shall be furnished to all eligible households who make application for such participation, the law says.\\n\\nWhile it may seem obvious that people should get benefits for which they're eligible, the wording is significant. It echoes the entitlement language in the Social Security Act that preserves health and retirement benefits for seniors even if the federal government is partially shuttered.\\n\\nSuper is not alone in his analysis.\\n\\nWe have long agreed with some legal experts that SNAP's authorizing law requires SNAP benefits continue during a shutdown, Dottie Rosenbaum, a senior fellow with the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, said in an email. The CBPP is an influential liberal think tank.\\n\\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture, which administers SNAP, did not respond to requests for comment. The agency has been mostly silent about what will happen to food assistance during a prolonged shutdown, except for a late December press release that only indicated it had funds for January's benefits. It's not clear what would happen in February if the government remains closed.\\n\\nIf the USDA reversed itself and said benefits would continue despite a prolonged shutdown, it would be in good company. The Internal Revenue Service had said it would collect tax revenue but not issue refunds ― until Monday, when officials said the agency would dish out refunds after all.\\n\\nASSOCIATED PRESS Past actions by Congress on food stamps could authorize the government to continue to offer food stamps even during a shutdown, according to legal experts.\\n\\nIf the shutdown continues and USDA determines it does not have the authority to extend SNAP in the absence of congressional action, many low-income households would be at risk of serious hunger and hardship, Rosenbaum wrote in a blog post, adding that food banks would see dramatic increases in needy families.\\n\\nEnding SNAP would not only cause material hardship for the program's beneficiaries ― most of whom are very young, elderly or disabled ― it would also rattle the economy.\\n\\nJoe Brusuelas, an economist with the accounting firm RSM, estimated a full year without SNAP benefits would reduce gross domestic product by as much as 1 percent. (For comparison, most analyses of the new Republican tax law said it would boost GDP by less than 1 percent in its early years.)\\n\\nA spokesman for House Agriculture Committee Chairman Collin Peterson (D-Minn.) declined to say whether the chairman agreed that food aid could continue to operate despite the shutdown.\\n\\nIt's not just the entitlement language that should protect SNAP benefits. Though lawmakers have appropriated money for SNAP annually, Super argues they have also amended the statute over the years to make SNAP less contingent on appropriations.\\n\\nThe conventional wisdom, that SNAP must terminate benefits absent an appropriation, was correct under the statute as it once existed, Super said in an email. But, as often happens, the conventional wisdom failed to update as Congress repeatedly amended the statute."}

{"original": "Edgar Su/Reuters\\n\\nFear of and misunderstanding about free trade and globalisation brought us a turbulent 2016. And the last few months have been a wake-up call about the dramatic slowdown in international trade, presaging a major change in global policies.\\n\\nIn its September forecast, the World Trade Organization (WTO) warned that it was worried world trade would only grow by 1.7% (in volume) in 2016. This is its lowest growth since 2009, the year of the global financial crisis, when international trade started retreating.\\n\\nWorse still is the phenomenon of international trade growing at a slightly slower pace than global production. The ratio of international trade-to-GDP, which indicates the relative importance of international trade in the economy of a country, has been falling sharply since 2009 except a gradual recover in 2010-2011.\\n\\nAccording to the October 2016 IMF World Economic Outlook, international trade in goods and services has grown at the mediocre rate of around 3% a year since 2012, less than half of the growth of the previous three decades. Between 1985 and 2007, world trade increased, on average, twice as fast as world production, whereas for the past four years it has just kept pace.\\n\\nThis is an historic change. If the WTO forecast for 2016 were to be confirmed, world trade would have risen less rapidly than world GDP, which grew between 2.2% and 2.9% in the first half of 2016.\\n\\nThe end of globalisation?\\n\\nThis could indeed be evidence for the beginning of globalisation going in reverse. The globalisation of trade means that countries trade more and more with each other, and that trade between them increases faster than their national production.\\n\\nHas globalisation, which is the modern form of the international division of labour, reached its peak? Those good old times when companies, mainly multinationals, achieve production efficiency and generated more revenue through outsourcing their labour-intensive work abroad than manufacturing at home.\\n\\nThe IMF suggests three explanations for the decline in trade regimes: the slowdown in global economic growth; the halt in trade and investment liberalisation agreements (which started long before the freezing of the Trans Pacific Partnership or the Trans Atlantic Trade and Partnership agreements); and the maturity of international production chains that would have exhausted their advantages.\\n\\nGeopolitical competition in global trade agenda-setting among the US, the European Union and emerging powers, such as China and India, and increasingly popular protectionism rhetoric in national trade debates also explain the failure or lack of cooperation in the multilateral trading system.\\n\\nThree types of explanations\\n\\nIMF experts estimate that the slowdown in economic growth since 2012, after the temporary catch up in 2010 and 2011, explains by itself about three-quarters of the dramatic slowdown trade.\\n\\nProof of this, they argue, is that it's investment products, and secondarily, durable household goods, such as cars, whose trade has slowed down the most. They note that slowdown of goods consumption affects 143 countries out of 171 under review, including China, Brazil and the nations in the Euro area, among others.\\n\\nIn this respect, the period between 2012 and 2016 will have been particularly volatile in terms of world trade, resulting from the collapse of oil and commodity prices. The IMF notes that this fall itself resulted in a 10.5% contraction of all international trade in 2015, when looking at all products.\\n\\nThis has resulted in considerable loss of purchasing power for many countries and billions of consumers, and thus a reorientation of demand at the expense of durable goods, which have become inaccessible to many. Added to this are national trade imbalances - the surpluses of some countries and the deficits of others - that have also acted as a brake on trade.\\n\\nThe second explanation for shrinking international trade stems from the general global climate, which has become more protectionist. The IMF notes that, in the 1990s, an average of 30 trade liberalisation agreements were signed annually between countries. But barely ten such agreements have been signed each year since 2011.\\n\\nFree trade agreements include deeper provisions that go beyond trade barriers and more partners can significantly reduce the cost of trade, which, in turn, helps boost trade flows.\\n\\nThe third reason for the brake on trade is the decline in the growth of global value chains, which is the idea that the process of production consists of many stages and occurs across borders. But this phenomenon, which developed at a very high rate after China's accession to the WTO in 2001 as the country emerged as a global supplier, has now reached cruising pace.\\n\\nSimilarly, the fall in the cost of cross-border transportation and international cost of telecommunications, which had contributed so much to trade, would also have met its limit. And they probably contribute modestly to the decline of global trade.\\n\\nBut even as they worry about the disappointing numbers, countries remain very divided on what to do next. In fact, we may be witnessing the return of an economic nationalism that threatens withdrawal from the global market.\\n\\nProspects for 2017\\n\\nIt seems, then, that the only diagnosis is that the global economy is slowing down and the risks to recovery are picking up. Challenges range from Brexit to the slowdown in emerging markets, from the collapse of commodity prices to rising geopolitical tensions.\\n\\nPart of the problem is that the level of public debt of countries is too high for them to have significant room for manoeuvre. And countries that have the means, such as Germany, refuse to spend more.\\n\\nAt least, in the last months of 2016 the G20 leaders' communique recognised the impact excess capacity has had on the global economy and there's now a chance of focusing on this problem. Excess global capacity in steel and other industries is mainly a result of falling demand, rising production and excessive government subsidies.\\n\\nThe impact of the crisis has been so severe on market demand that all G20 leaders are turning to overcapacity, following the example of China. Until current overcapacity is absorbed, the recovery will be slow.\\n\\nBut the remedy has the social cost of job loss, and that could fuel the already high risk in the United States and Europe of fragmented national politics.\\n\\nOn the bright side is the noteworthy G20 Guiding Principle for Global Investment Policymaking reached under Chinese presidency and endorsed by G20 heads of state. It lays out a roadmap for future investment policy and the correlation between investment and sustainable development.\\n\\nIn the 19th century, debates over drivers of economic growth - tariffs or free trade - dominated the political scene. Mercifully, the idea of free trade has persisted but it now faces serious challenges.\\n\\nIt seems that, at best, 2017 will be another difficult year. The most we may be able to hope for is that national trade-restriction measures will be compatible with WTO rules.\\n\\nIn any event, we have not finished paying for the consequences of the financial crisis. If history is any indication, trade deals, which are always better in the multilateral format (such as under the WTO), are the world's best hope for avoiding another global recession.\\n\\nThis article was originally published on The Conversation.

{"original": "Depending on your state, it is that time again ― time to waste students' school time on the Big Standardized Test. Whether it's the PARCC or the SBA or whatever mutant offspring of the testing industry that your state prefers, it's headed your way like a hungry wildebeast.\\n\\nMaybe you have opted your child out in the past. Maybe you've thought about it, but ultimately decided not to. Maybe you've even become comfortably numb about test-driven education. Consider opting out this year.\\n\\nIf you want to read more, wider, deeper perspectives on the movement, click on over to United Opt Out. If you want to find out the specific mechanics of opting out in your state, just google opt out and your state. For instance, if I look for opt out Pennsylvania, I find the basic instructions for the steps I must take to opt my children out of testing (since my children are currently Negative 3 Months old, it won't be an issue this year, but I like to be prepared).\\n\\nIf you opt out, you may will get grief and pushback for your choice. Here's why you should do it anyway.\\n\\n1) No Benefits for Children or Parents\\n\\nYour child is not allowed to discuss specifics of the test with anyone, so there will be no after-test conversation that would help her glean lessons through reflection. Your child will not get any specific feedback telling her which answers she got right, and which she got wrong. You will not get any feedback on the test except a single blanket score between 4 (super-duper) and 1 (not so great). Once this test is done, you will not know anything about your child that you did not already know.\\n\\n2) No Benefits for Teachers\\n\\nIn most states, we are not even allowed to lay eyes on the test, and we will receive a single score for your child. All of this is useless. We will learn nothing about your child, and nothing about your child's class (except how well they did on this test). If an administrator or a teacher tells you that the test results will give them valuable information about your child, ask them why they have not already collected that information by other means and if not, what they've been doing for the past eight months.\\n\\n3) Wasted Time and Resources\\n\\nWhat could your student have done with the time spent on preparing for the test, drilling for the test, taking the test? What could your state and local school system have done with the millions of dollars spent on giving the test? Students, parents and schools are paying big in both financial and opportunity costs.\\n\\n4) Warped View of School and Life\\n\\nTest-centric schooling leaves our students with the impression that they go to school to learn how to pass the test, and then to take the test. That is a terrible model for learning and for life. Contrary to what test supporters say, life is not all about standardized tests. You will not take a bubble test to get married or to have and raise children. Whatever your career, it will not involve a steady daily diet of test prep and test taking. Show your child that the Big Standardized Test is not the point of school.\\n\\n5) Don't Negotiate with Hostage Takers\\n\\nYou may hear that your child must take the test because otherwise it will hurt the school or the classroom teacher. This is simply hostage taking. And it's important to remember that every year this continues, schools and teachers continue to pay a price― in time, in money, in the growth of a pervasive toxic test-driven atmosphere. This argument is a bully who says, If you don't let me beat this kid up, I will beat him up even more. In any bullying situation, the person to blame is not the victim the person that the bully uses as an excuse to bully. The problem is not that your child isn't taking the test― the problem is the state that is threatening to punish the school and teachers. Deal with the real problem; don't enable it.\\n\\n6) Privacy Matters\\n\\nThis is certainly not the only mechanism being deployed to capture, collect and monetize data about your child. In fact, many folks who position themselves as opponents of BS Tests are actually doing so to build a case for other data collecting methods (but we'll talk about Competency Based Education another day). But opting out is certainly one clear and immediate way that you can keep some of your child's data out of the hands of the Big Data miners.\\n\\n7) The Value of Non-compliance\\n\\nIn this day and age, it is never too early for a child to learn that sometimes people in authority will demand that you comply with dumb actions. Unthinking compliance is unwise. It's good for all citizens to learn to say no, and the Big Standardized Test is a good practice case for all the reasons listed above. Compliance is not a virtue in and of itself; this is a great chance to practice rebelling just a little.\\n\\n8) Be a Snowflake\\n\\nIt's true― your opting out may well not get your state or school district to change policy, may not recapture all the time and money being lost to testing, may not change the course on which we're currently set. But then again― if you are one among many, it might. Put enough snowflakes together and you get an avalanche that crushes everything in its path.\\n\\nThe requirement to make schools test-centic, to put bad tests at the center of school's existence is foolish, on the order of demanding that all students wear silly hats. At this stage of the game, there can be no doubt― there are no benefits to the test and many unnecessary costs. It will not go away easily, because test manufacturers are making a ton of money on this giant time suck. It's time to make your life a source of friction in the machine.\\n\\nThis year, whether it's for the first time or the tenth, opt out."}
{"original": "On February 23, two Catholic feminist scholars debated whether the Catholic Church is anti-woman. To me that's akin to debating whether the Inquisition was anti-Semitic, but I was willing to suspend my disbelief to consider both sides of the discussion. The debate took place at the Aquinas Institute for Catholic Thought in Boulder, Colorado.\\n\\nAnnually, the Institute hosts a great debate about a topical issue. Past debates have considered whether doctor-assisted suicide should be legal, if the free market can adequately care for the poor, and the pros and cons of abolishing the death penalty. This year, Catholicism and feminism was on the docket.\\n\\nIt appears the Institute archives its debates, but that hasn't happened yet. So I'm relying on excerpted quotes.\\n\\nAccording to media accounts, both scholars made interesting points. Mary Anne Case, a law professor at the University of Chicago, pointed out, rightly in my view, that a church that fails to ordain women to the priesthood is failing a major litmus test. It's denying that women are equal to men, or that women even are worthy to be on the same ontological plane when it comes to serving as surrogates for Christ, raising the question of whether they even deserve salvation.\\n\\nIn my lifetime, Case said, the church that made me a feminist betrayed me.\\n\\nAlthough neither the early church nor the gospels were anti-women, Case noted, misogyny emerged later. Thomas Aquinas, for one, considered us women to be misbegotten males.\\n\\nBut for Case, the church's opposition to women crystalized in the 1970s, when church leaders made clear that the ordination of women to the priesthood was not going to happen. Adding to the limitations on women was Pope John II's insistence on complementarity, a theory that assigns specific roles to each gender.\\n\\nI, too, agree, that the theory of complementarity has been a huge stumbling block to women fulfilling their potential in the church. Complementarity gives clerics a vehicle for claiming that women are just as good as men, but different. Their role is to nurture and to offer a wounded world tender love.\\n\\nPope Francis is certainly more open to feminism than John Paul II was, but he's still very much into an image of woman as primarily nurturing mother. He says he's for feminism, but only if it doesn't demand uniformity or negate motherhood. He really has a thing for Moms, recently praising us for testifying to tenderness and unconditional self-sacrifice.\\n\\nEven the Vatican's recently issued sex education materials go this route, much to the disadvantage of the pre-teen girls who may be exposed to it. Indeed the materials go so far as to critique the quest for equality that has girls and boys vying with each other to see who can get farther and be better.\\n\\nI thought the remarks of debater Erika Bachiochi, a visiting fellow at the conservative-leaning Ethics and Public Policy Center were very telling. Bachiochi said that it was the institutional church's teachings on monogamy, divorce, and infanticide that attracted women in the first century into the Christian fold.\\n\\nYes, in the first century, the church was ahead of its time. But since then, women's rights have come a long way, and the church has not caught up.\\n\\nBachiochi did make a good point about the problem of clericalism in church, insisting that a priest has the authority to represent Christ in a sacramental way, and I have the authority to represent Christ in every other area of my life.\\n\\nPope Francis has strongly critiqued what he terms the evil of clericalism. Clerics feel they are superior, they are far from the people; they have no time to hear the poor, the suffering, prisoners, the sick.\\n\\nBut Bachiochi claimed that ordaining women to the priesthood would itself be buying into clericalism.\\n\\nI don't agree. Women have to deal with the world as it is, not as it should be.\\n\\nI'd like to end the role of money in American democracy. But I certainly would not be willing to deny women the right to run for office until we had solved that problem. Indeed, one hopes that more women candidates, knowing their own difficulty in the race for campaign funds, might be more sympathetic to campaign finance reform.\\n\\nLikewise, Catholic women can't wait for clericalism to go away to take their place as full-fledged participants in their faith.\\n\\nIn an ideal world all of us would be considered priests. But we're not there yet – and there's little to make me optimistic that we'll arrive at that ideal state any time soon. People do not give up power easily. Democracy in the church – where priests and laity equally decide its future – is a distant dream.\\n\\nIn our flawed institutional church, women need more power – now.

{"original": "The political outlook for President-elect Joseph Biden's first term changed dramatically this week when victory in two Georgia special elections gave Democrats 50 senators. With Vice President-elect Kamala Harris available to decide tie votes, the result means that Democrats will have control of the chamber.\\n\\nFor the first time in a decade, a Democratic Congress will be able to pass laws that a Democratic president can sign. And although Senate Republicans can still wield the filibuster, which requires 60 votes to overcome, Democrats can approve bills through reconciliation, under which legislation can pass the Senate with a simple majority vote.\\n\\nIn principle, Democrats can enact a significant portion of their agenda that way. One reason is that reconciliation is tied to the budget process, and Congress never actually passed a budget last year. The new Congress could take advantage of that by quickly passing a reconciliation bill for the current fiscal year, still leaving opportunities to pass reconciliation bills for fiscal 2022 and 2023.\\n\\nThat's not even the full extent of legislation Democrats could possibly pass, thanks to an obscure provision of the budget process that seems to allow for revisions to previous reconciliation bills within the same fiscal year.\\n\\nAnd it could all happen before the next midterms, when the Republicans will have their first chance to recapture one or both houses of Congress.\\n\\nBut reconciliation is a notoriously cumbersome and complex process, because of interlocking rules on what legislation can and cannot include. And although it's possible to alter those rules or challenge interpretations of them, doing so usually requires a series of votes from the full Senate ― and, in the best of scenarios, the assent of at least 50 senators.\\n\\nIn a practical sense, then, the ultimate limit on what Democrats can do through reconciliation isn't so much process as it is politics ― specifically, the ability of Democratic leaders like House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (Calif.) and incoming Senate Majority Leader Charles Schumer (N.Y.) to keep their caucuses united.\\n\\nHow Reconciliation Works And How It Has Evolved\\n\\nReconciliation dates back to the 1970s, a time when Congress worked a lot differently than it does now. There were two budget resolutions a year, not one, and the original purpose of reconciliation was to adjust revenue or spending bills in order to reconcile them with the overall budget plan.\\n\\nPart of why the procedures are expedited … is because the reconciliation bill was originally imagined to come between the adoption of the second budget resolution, on Sept. 15 and the start of the new fiscal year, on Oct. 1, Molly Reynolds, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, explained to HuffPost.\\n\\nNot long afterward, Congress shifted to one budget resolution a year. But it kept reconciliation as a way to keep revenue and spending in line with the overall budget ― and to do so quickly, without the risk of delaying tactics like the filibuster.\\n\\nThat opportunity has become a lot more valuable in the past two decades, because of broader changes in American politics and the way they have distorted the lawmaking process. Use of the filibuster has soared; the two parties have grown more internally homogeneous, geographically and ideologically, making compromise more difficult.\\n\\nJonathan Ernst / Reuters The best known, most restrictive rules for budget reconciliation date back to the 1980s and come from the late Sen. Robert Byrd (D-W.Va.).\\n\\nIn this highly polarized environment, reconciliation is the only way to pass many pieces of legislation.\\n\\nBut for legislation to pass through reconciliation, every provision must satisfy certain conditions, including several put in place by the late Robert Byrd, a Democratic senator from West Virginia who was concerned lawmakers were using reconciliation for uses too far removed from its original purpose of putting government finances in order.\\n\\nUnder the Byrd Rule, every provision of a reconciliation bill must have a direct, nonincidental impact on government finances. And the bill as a whole may not result in higher deficits once the congressional budgeting window is over. (These days, Congress uses a 10-year window, so that rule means a reconciliation bill can't lead to higher deficits at any point after 10 years.)\\n\\nReconciliation bills must comply with some other rules Congress has set for itself, including pay-go requirements that require offsetting new spending with cuts or revenue, and they are subject to narrower rules like a prohibition on changes to Social Security. Historically, reconciliation has only changed mandatory spending, which refers to entitlements like Medicare and other programs that don't depend on time-limited appropriations.\\n\\nThe details and implications of these interactions are so complex that even veteran Capitol Hill aides will concede they don't understand them fully, deferring to experts and scholars who focus on congressional procedure and the budget process. And virtually every rule has its exceptions and caveats. One example: Reconciliation guidelines don't explicitly prohibit changes to nonmandatory spending, several experts told HuffPost, and in principle Congress could make such changes if it wishes.\\n\\nTwo famous uses of reconciliation in modern American history were at the hands of Republicans, which used the process to pass tax cuts in 2001 under President George W. Bush and again in 2017 under President Donald Trump. In each case, Republicans had to use accounting gimmicks and to make key policy concessions ― in particular, having tax cuts end automatically after 10 years ― in order to satisfy the requirement that bills not raise deficits outside the budget window.\\n\\nThe other high-profile use of reconciliation in recent history came in 2010, when Democrats used it to finish up their work on the Affordable Care Act. The main legislation passed the Senate through regular order, with 60 votes. But the House agreed to pass the bill, as written, only on the condition that the Senate pass an extra set of changes. That supplementary bill, which also nationalized the student loan industry, passed through reconciliation.\\n\\nHow Democrats Might Use Reconciliation Now\\n\\nThe 2010 reconciliation vote came after a year in which President Barack Obama and Democratic leaders in the Senate undertook exhaustive negotiations with Republicans, over not just health care but also an economic stimulus package and climate legislation. In fact, Democrats had deliberately kept reconciliation as a last resort for their health care bill, in the hopes they could get GOP buy-in.\\n\\nIt never happened, on health care or virtually any other bills. Republican leaders like Kentucky's Mitch McConnell, then (and about to be again) the Senate minority leader, and Virginia Rep. Eric Cantor, then the House minority whip, admitted openly that their goal was to deny Obama and his allies the veneer of bipartisanship.\\n\\nThat remained the dominant Republican posture throughout Obama's two terms, and when Republicans in 2017 seized full control of both the presidency and Congress, they didn't even bother trying bipartisanship. They went right to passing legislation through reconciliation, using it for their tax cut and their ultimately failed attempt to repeal the Affordable Care Act.\\n\\nDemocrats seem to have learned a thing or two from that experience. They spent much of the 2020 campaign discussing how to pass legislation now that the filibuster has become a de facto supermajority requirement. Although a handful have said they would oppose ending the filibuster outright, nobody is squawking about the perils of reconciliation like many Democrats did in 2009 and 2010.\\n\\nThe questions are what parts of the Biden-Democratic agenda would make sense to push through reconciliation ― and then, when it makes sense to push them through.\\n\\nSome parts of that agenda clearly wouldn't fit under any close reading of the rules. The most obvious example would be a voting rights bill that, however worthy, would have only the most tenuous connection to government finances. Proposals that would fit more clearly under reconciliation guidelines include large swaths of Biden's climate and health care agendas. Key elements of proposed COVID-19 relief measures, including the $2,000 relief checks, aid to state and local government and new vaccine funding, would likely fit easily into reconciliation as well.\\n\\nThe word likely is important because initial judgments on what violates the rules are left to the Senate parliamentarian, a nonpartisan appointee who rules on the permissibility of individual elements as a judge might ― by looking at precedent and considering the nature of individual proposals. (That process is frequently called a Byrd bath, because it's connected to the Byrd rules.)\\n\\nAnd even the parliamentarian's word is not final. In practice, the way reconciliation debates work is that senators can raise objections to specific provisions, requiring rulings from the presiding officer, who typically follows the parliamentarian's counsel. Rulings of the presiding officer are, in turn, subject to votes from the full Senate.\\n\\nEven veteran congressional aides disagree a bit over what can and can't happen during challenges, because that involves so many different rules about how budgeting works ― and, potentially, breaking traditional understandings of how Congress operates. But it's at least possible that a simple majority could get its way on what ends up in a reconciliation bill, regardless of the parliamentarian's judgment, if the will to do so exists.\\n\\nWith 50-plus-one votes in the Senate, you can shape reconciliation in any way you want, a former leadership aide now consulting with Democratic lawmakers told HuffPost.\\n\\nWhy It All Comes Down To Political Will\\n\\nBut that really just brings the whole debate back to where it started ― that in order to pass something through reconciliation, Democrats have to keep their caucuses together. That will be a difficult task, in the House as well as the Senate, because 2020 election losses left Democrats with a majority of roughly a dozen.\\n\\nFriday produced a preview of the tricky politics, when The Washington Post reported that the most conservative member of the Democratic Senate caucus, Joe Manchin of West Virginia, was opposed to a new COVID-19 relief measure with $2,000 checks.\\n\\nIt's more conservative Democrats like Manchin who are most likely to balk at ambitious reconciliation bills, because they typically involve spending a lot of money, increasing the size of government or, as in the case of COVID-19 checks, giving people money with no strings attached ― things that will run against the lawmakers' own policy instincts, raise suspicions in the eyes of more conservative constituents, or both.\\n\\nTasos Katopodis via Getty Images Getting the 50 votes necessary to pass reconciliation will not be easy, since that's how many senators belong to the Democratic caucus as of now. A big focus will be West Virginia's Joe Manchin, whose voting record is the most conservative among Democrats.\\n\\nBut after that report appeared, Manchin called back the Post to say that he was talking more about making vaccine funding a bigger priority and that he was not absolutely opposed to $2,000 checks. That could mean that even more conservative Democrats like Manchin recognize that the best way to win over voters is to show progress and enact policies that help struggling people in material ways, like speedily and simply making up for lost income during a pandemic.\\n\\nIf Manchin and similarly thinking senators can keep that in mind ― and if Democratic leaders, starting with Biden, can figure out the right way to package major legislation ― then there is real hope for major legislation in the next two years, and certainly more than seemed possible just a few days ago."}
{"original": "Newly inaugurated President Joe Biden ordered his government to begin the process of reentering the climate pact former President Donald Trump exited.\\n\\nIt's part of a suite of executive orders on climate change, including ones that will block the Keystone XL pipeline and start assessing Trump's deregulatory legacy.\\n\\nHours after his inauguration Wednesday, President Joe Biden signed an executive order to rejoin the Paris Agreement, ending the United States' brief but symbolic exit from the global pact to slash planet-heating emissions that virtually every nation has joined.\\n\\nBiden's executive order kick-starts a relatively simple process. After sending a letter to the United Nations announcing its intentions to reenter the climate accord, the U.S. will again become a formal party to the global negotiations in 30 days.\\n\\nIt was the third executive order he signed in the Oval Office. In separate executive orders, Biden is expected to lay the groundwork for the part that comes next and is much more of a challenge: reversing the Trump administration's deregulatory legacy and setting ambitious new goals for decarbonizing the U.S. economy.\\n\\nThe executive actions include orders to pull permits for the Keystone XL oil pipeline, reestablish the Interagency Working Group on the Social Cost of Greenhouse Gases, and direct all agencies to immediately review all rules and regulatory guidances enacted under former President Donald Trump.\\n\\nThe Washington Post via Getty Images President Joe Biden issued a flurry of climate-focused executive orders in his first hours in office.\\n\\nThe new administration has vowed to ramp up domestic climate action, nominating Gina McCarthy, a respected former Environmental Protection Agency administrator and environmentalist, to oversee a transformational domestic agenda aimed at making electric vehicles mainstream and eliminating emissions from the power sector by 2035. He pledged to put the country on course to reach net zero emissions by 2050.\\n\\nThe details of that effort will likely form the backbone of the U.S. Nationally Determined Contribution to the Paris Agreement's emissions cuts, and give special climate envoy John Kerry, who helped broker the pact as the Obama-era secretary of state, concrete actions to point to as he embarks on his new climate-focused diplomatic mission.\\n\\nIvan Alvarado/Reuters An aerial view shows the brine pools of SQM lithium mine on the Atacama salt flat in the Atacama desert of northern Chile.\\n\\nThe ambition that the U.S. is putting forward goes beyond what other countries have added to the mix, said Ateli Iyalla, the managing director of CDP North America, a nonprofit that tracks carbon disclosures. We need to be able to show we have the ambition.\\n\\nPut Up Real Cash\\n\\nSimply cutting pollution, however, won't be enough to restore faith in a politically divided imperial superpower that seesaws between one party that accepts climate science and another that has for nearly two decades now rejected it whole-cloth. Under President Barack Obama, the U.S. pledged just $3 billion to the U.N.'s Green Climate Fund, a pot of money meant to help poor countries adapt to climate change and leapfrog over the fossil fuel phase of economic development. He had delivered just $1.5 billion by the time Trump took office and canceled all future payments.\\n\\nIncreasing payments to that fund could be one way to win back credibility ahead of the U.N. climate summit in Glasgow this year, where nations will convene to reassess emissions cuts and look back on the five years since the Paris Agreement was signed.\\n\\nLook Hard At 'Green' Supply Chains\\n\\nAnother could be prioritizing fair trade agreements with the countries whose raw materials currently fuel the green industrial supply chain. Biden looks likely to boost domestic mining of the materials needed to make solar panels and batteries for electric cars and homes. But the existing supply chains already cause significant environmental destruction overseas.\\n\\nLithium mined in Chile uses massive amounts of water in the South American country's desert regions, while Australia's toxic hard-rock resource is exported to China for processing, causing pollution. Cobalt mined in the Democratic Republican of the Congo is linked to human rights abuses and mistreatment of informal miners. Indonesia's nickel mines ― some of the world's largest ― are a major source of ocean pollution.\\n\\nKevin Lamarque/Reuters Former President Donald Trump announcing the United States' withdrawal from the Paris Agreement in the White House Rose Garden on June 1, 2017.\\n\\nThe Biden administration could implement new rules to track raw materials and prioritize mass transit over policies to promote electric vehicles, limiting what's expected to be a meteoric rise in demand.\\n\\nThe supply chains look like all supply chains under global capitalism: When you go to the extractive frontier, you see the hyper exploitation of labor, contamination of ecosystems and violations of Indigenous rights, said Thea Riofrancos, a political scientist at Providence College and author of a new book on extractive industries in South America.\\n\\nWhat I would like to see is for the Biden administration to let go of this idea that individual passenger electric vehicles solve climate, embrace a public electrification vision, and be realistic about how the global supply chains are organized right now, so they can lay out a vision of green and just trade, she added.\\n\\nCooperation, Not Cold War, With China\\n\\nThe administration's trade agenda will hinge significantly on its relationship with China. It faces major obstacles. Ties between the world's two largest economies reached their lowest point in decades under the Trump administration, which waged a haphazard trade war against China and, in its final days in office, declared Beijing's brutal repression of its Muslim Uighur minority a genocide. Biden will confront those challenges while both he and Chinese officials face pressure from nationalists at home to intensify what looks increasingly like a cold war between the two countries.\\n\\nYet brokering a cooperative peace between the U.S. and China will be key to any global decarbonization plan. Abandoning plans to contain China's growth and instead working together could help quickly deploy clean energy and climate solutions worldwide, said Jake Werner, a China researcher at Boston University's Global Development Policy Center. China's manufacturing capacity for clean energy products is unmatched and could be expanded, he said, while the U.S. controls the financial system and boasts an unrivaled network of formal alliances.\\n\\nIf we want to transition the global economy away from fossil fuels as fast as we need it to, we need China to be doing a lot of the heavy lifting because of how strong its new-energy production capacity is, Werner said. The U.S. would be able to move a global Green New Deal diplomatically and would be able to line up financing for it in ways that would be complementary to what China brings to that project.\\n\\nClean Up The U.S.'s Own CO2 Mess\\n\\nAnother novel approach the Biden administration could take to demonstrate its understanding of the U.S.'s disproportionate share of cumulative emissions would be to commit to funding and deploying technologies and policies to remove carbon from the atmosphere. Carbon removal broadly defines a set of approaches that range from nature-based ideas like planting new forests and adopting new soil farming techniques to technological solutions such as direct air capture, machines that suck CO2 from the atmosphere and transform it into a material that can be used in building materials or stored underground.\\n\\nThe ideal scenario ... is that the U.S. returns to the Paris Agreement not simply ready to enforce stringent emissions standards, but really ready to commit serious research dollars in the short term and deployment dollars in the medium and long term to carbon removal. Olúfẹ́mi O. Táíwò, Georgetown University\\n\\nDirect air capture is a nascent industry. But over the past two years, tech firms vowing to erase their legacy of climate pollution have stoked new interest, as have oil companies that invested in the technology as a means of extracting more oil and hedging against a future where demand for fossil fuels plummets. If that link to the industry most responsible for climate change weren't enough to make many environmentalists skeptical of direct air capture, the eye-popping projections for how much energy, water and land such facilities would require to suck CO2 from the sky at scale certainly do.\\n\\nWhile there's debate over how many gigatons of carbon need to be removed from the atmosphere to keep global temperatures from surging past 1.5 degrees Celsius (from roughly 1.2 degrees today), many experts agree on the need to deploy technology like direct air capture. Taking the lead on that costly effort could show developing countries whose poverty and history of colonialism make limits to fossil fuel use politically unpalatable that the U.S. is, in fact, doing its part to clean up its two centuries of pollution.\\n\\nThe ideal scenario, or at least a better scenario than the one we're likely to get in the status quo, is that the U.S. returns to the Paris Agreement not simply ready to enforce stringent emissions standards, but really ready to commit serious research dollars in the short term and deployment dollars in the medium and long term to carbon removal, said Olúfẹ́mi O. Táíwò, a researcher and assistant professor at Georgetown University who recently wrote an essay on why carbon removal would be good for African nations.\\n\\nThere's earnest scientific debate over how much more carbon dioxide the atmosphere can absorb before locking in 1.5 degrees Celsius of warming. At the end of 2017, U.N. scientists projected that a carbon budget of just 420 gigatons remained, and humanity has roughly spent that at a rate of 42 gigatons per year.\\n\\nRemoving some of that carbon while simultaneously halting increasing emissions would expand the carbon budget available to developing countries, Táíwò said.\\n\\nLow-income countries, developing countries, and small island states have different things at stake in the climate crisis, so there's a better rationale for them doing what they need to do even if it means using existing technologies that emit carbon to take care of their populations, he added. Places like the U.S. and Canada have contributed an outsize amount of historical emissions that have accumulated in the atmosphere. So there's a story to tell about responsibility."}
{"original": "The FBI should open a criminal investigation into President Donald Trump for solicitation of election fraud, House Democratic Reps. Ted Lieu (D-Calif.) and Kathleen Rice (D-N.Y.) said Monday.\\n\\nThe lawmakers sent a congressional letter to the FBI in response to an audio recording that showed Trump threatening Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger (R) with criminal prosecution unless he could find 11,780 votes ― one more vote than President-elect Joe Biden's margin of victory in the state.\\n\\nSo look, Trump said on the recording, first released to The Washington Post. All I want to do is this. I just want to find 11,780 votes, which is one more than we have because we won the state.\\n\\nLater in the call, Trump reiterated his demand for Raffensperger to manufacture votes for him. So what are we going to do here, folks? I only need 11,000 votes. Fellas, I need 11,000 votes. Give me a break.\\n\\nThe letter alleges Trump violated two federal statutes and one Georgia statute forbidding the solicitation of election fraud when he pressed Raffensperger to alter the vote total in order to declare Trump the winner of the state's 16 electoral votes.\\n\\nAs Members of Congress and former prosecutors, we believe Donald Trump engaged in solicitation of, or conspiracy to commit, a number of election crimes, Lieu and Rice wrote. We ask you to open an immediate criminal investigation into the President.\\n\\nIn America, no one is above the law ― not the president and not any former presidents, Lieu told HuffPost.\\n\\nThe call for a criminal investigation is among the strong reactions lawmakers and watchdog groups have expressed about the phone call. But Democrats and outside groups differ on how to hold Trump accountable for his misdeeds.\\n\\nTrump's effort to pressure Raffensperger merits nothing less than a criminal investigation, Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) tweeted Sunday night.\\n\\nThere's no question there is grounds for an investigation at the federal level and at the state level, said Stephen Spaulding, special counsel for public policy at the nonpartisan nonprofit Common Cause.\\n\\nA potential problem for prosecuting Trump's actions is that the person soliciting the crime must know that they are requesting election fraud to be committed. If Trump legitimately believes the falsehoods that he won Georgia by hundreds of thousands of votes, that thousands of dead people voted and that electronic voting machines invented votes for Biden, among other outlandish conspiracies, then it may not be possible to criminally prosecute him.\\n\\nAs with so many things in this presidency and president, the question is whether Trump is drinking his own Kool-Aid, election law expert Rick Hasen wrote on Slate Monday. Reading the entire one-hour rambling call transcript, it is hard to know if Trump actually believes the fever swamp of debunked conspiracy theories about the election or whether he's just using the false claims as a cover to get the political results he wants.\\n\\nASSOCIATED PRESS Two Democratic lawmakers are asking the FBI to investigate President Donald Trump for solicitation of election fraud during his phone call with Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger.\\n\\nIf it is not possible to prove Trump knowingly committed a crime, then his offense becomes a political abuse of power that can be addressed by Congress.\\n\\nIn that vein, Rep. Hank Johnson (D-Ga.) promised to introduce a resolution in the House to censure Trump for the effort to steal the 2020 presidential election. Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, or CREW, a liberal ethics watchdog group, went further, calling on the House to immediately impeach the president again.\\n\\nWhile the logistics of holding impeachment proceedings in the final two weeks of a presidency are admittedly hard to pull off, if this isn't impeachable conduct, then literally nothing is, Noah Bookbinder, CREW executive director, said in a statement.\\n\\nThe watchdog group is not solely focused on impeachment, as its lawyers are examining criminal statutes to determine whether to file a criminal complaint against the president.\\n\\nLieu said he believes Trump's actions amount to impeachable conduct, but he questions whether a second impeachment is necessary after Trump lost the election.\\n\\nThe purpose of impeachment is to remove the president and the American people already chose to do that in November, Lieu said\\n\\nThe threatening phone call to Raffensperger in many ways mirrors the phone call Trump made to Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky in July 2019 that led to his impeachment. On the call with Zelensky, Trump pressured the foreign president to publicly announce a corruption investigation into Biden by threatening to withhold congressionally approved military aid from the country.\\n\\nI would like you to do us a favor though, Trump told Zelensky after mentioning the military aid that Trump had illegally halted.\\n\\nDuring the House impeachment hearings, Stanford Law School professor Pamela Karlan explained that Trump's abuse of office as it related to Ukraine simply foreshadowed the threat he posed to domestic affairs by seeking to extract concessions from state-level officials with threats of withholding federal money.\\n\\nImagine living in a part of Louisiana or Texas that's prone to devastating hurricanes and flooding, Karlan said. What would you think if you lived there and your governor asked for a meeting with the president to discuss getting disaster aid that Congress has provided for? What would you think if that president said, 'I would like you to do us a favor? I'll meet with you, and send the disaster relief, once you brand my opponent a criminal.'\\n\\nTrump did threaten to withhold coronavirus aid from states with governors who spoke negatively about him. And now, Trump is threatening to brand and prosecute Raffenperger as a criminal in order to get the secretary of state to help him to steal the election.\\n\\nOne reason to pursue a criminal investigation, regardless of whether Trump believes his own lies, is because the scope of the president's effort to steal the election is not yet known.\\n\\nThe question is we've got this one tape, but how many other people received this call? Spaulding said. How many state legislatures received this call? What other secretaries of states, election officials received this call? Who else in the White House was involved?\\n\\nI find it hard to believe that Donald Trump called just one secretary of state, Lieu said, adding that the FBI should investigate any other calls they uncover.\\n\\nAn investigation could be led by Congress, the FBI, a special counsel appointed by the attorney general, or state-level prosecutors in Georgia.\\n\\nIt would not be extraordinary for the incoming Biden administration to open an investigation into criminal wrongdoing by the outgoing administration.\\n\\nPresident George W. Bush's attorney general, John Ashcroft, appointed James Comey as special counsel in 2001 to investigate President Bill Clinton's last-minute pardon of tax-dodging investor Marc Rich after Rich's wife made political and charitable donations that benefited Clinton. Attorney General Eric Holder, serving under President Barack Obama, appointed special counsel John Durham to investigate the torture program run by the CIA under the Bush administration.\\n\\n[The Biden administration] should let law enforcement do its job and pursue investigation, Lieu said. Once they get the facts they should let prosecutors decide what they want to do with it."}

{"original": "Is water a basic human right or something with an inherent economic value? The answer to this question has led to decades of conflict in Chile.\\n\\nIn September, the private Chilean energy company Endesa announced it has given up its rights over water exploitation in five significant hydropower projects.\\n\\nBut water rights activists met the news with caution. Their fight for water rights for the Chilean people, they know, is far from over.\\n\\nIf water scarcity troubles the capital, it's already and every day reality for Indigenous peoples in Chile. In the northern regions, the impact of mining and the lack of regulation of water markets have led to water scarcity and the contamination of watercourses in local communities.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAuthor provided\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nA water code rules by market economy\\n\\nSince the introduction of the 1981 Water Code in Chile, water resources have been governed by strict market rules, with the government powerless to intervene. The code enshrines free market water economics to facilitate resource use and secure property rights under competitive conditions.\\n\\nThe code is unique in South America in that it allows the extraction of water supplies (both surface and ground) under market rules, without providing environmental safeguards, such as instream flows - the ability to keep water running in a river.\\n\\nThis has consequences for agriculture, the local environment, and Indigenous peoples' sense of identity.\\n\\nIn practice, the code has failed to coordinate water use and resolve river basin conflicts, and has only increased private speculation, hoarding and the monopoly over water rights.\\n\\nIn 2005, the Chilean government attempted to address many of the issues with a set of tangential reforms, one of which forces water users to pay an annual fee to the state for unused water, in an attempt to avoid speculation. But the policy does not protect the water rights of Indigenous communities.\\n\\nThe Atacameño's struggle for river access\\n\\nThe application of the 1981 Water Code has already affected the future of Indigenous communities in the north of Chile, such as the Atacameño, de Aymara and the Quechua.\\n\\nThe case of the Atacameño is particularly dramatic. Although this community had historically developed agricultural and cultural activities along the Loa River, after the application of the 1981 code, the community lost access to a large amount of water, as people were not made aware of the need to register their water rights officially.\\n\\nIn fact, several communities were told to register their water rights only for agricultural purposes, under the threat that they would have to pay additional taxes.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMolina/2011, Author provided\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAlthough these communities applied for recognition of their traditional water rights under the 1993 Indigenous law, the situation proved intractable. They have tried to register their ancestral water rights with the local government since the early 1990s, but authorities did not recognise their ancestral use of the territory.\\n\\nConsequently, large amounts of water in the Loa river were officially deemed to be unused, and opened to reallocation to other sectors - something chiefly solicited by companies in the water-intensive mining sector. Now Indigenous communities have only secured a portion of their original provisions, which represents a significant loss in cultural and productive\\n\\nterms. In this context, they were allowed to irrigate only during the day and had to redirect water back into the river at night.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAuthor provided\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTensions rising\\n\\nThe conflict over water has increased local divisions and left Indigenous communities more vulnerable.\\n\\nIn the case of the Chiu-Chiu area, it can be seen how changes in water management have caused tensions in local relationships and generated internal differences, affecting overall social cohesion and ancestral property claims. For example, the fact that different age groups have been treated differently in terms of benefits has caused intergenerational conflict.\\n\\nMembers of Indigenous communities have responded to their straitened circumstances in creative ways. Artistic initiatives developed by younger generations have become a new way of claiming and demanding water justice, mixing ancestral claims over water and land with specific initiatives in housing and education.\\n\\nAlthough pressure from resource companies has redefined many local communities and created divisions between generations, when dealing with water issues, internal differences are secondary. Resistance against water inequality remains the top priority for the Indigenous people of Northern Chile.\\n\\nThis is part of our ongoing series about water conflicts.\\n\\nThis article was originally published on The Conversation.

{"original": "Today marks the day when America's women have finally caught up to men. They had to work full time until today, April 10 — about 20 percent of the way into 2018 — to make, on average, the same amount that men made last year.\\n\\nEqual Pay Day is meant to highlight the fact that women still make less than men in nearly every job, every industry and at every level of educational attainment. Yet, as we mark this symbolic day year after year, the gender wage gap hasn't budged much over the last two decades. And although pay discrimination is technically illegal, the tools we give women to fight the gap ― like the Equal Pay Act of 1963, which mandated equal pay for equal work, and the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, which extended the time period women have to file complaints ― are pretty weak.\\n\\nBut one state just armed women with a weapon that could actually make a difference.\\n\\nWith a near unanimous vote at the end of last month, New Jersey lawmakers shot their state to the top of the pack when it comes to cracking down on the gender wage gap.\\n\\nGov. Phil Murphy has indicated that he'll sign the Diane B. Allen Equal Pay Act (named for a retired state senator who herself experienced pay discrimination). Once he does, we will have the strongest legislation in the country, boasted Assemblywoman Pamela Lampitt, one of the main sponsors of the bill. Some of the new law's strength will stem from the fact that victims of discrimination will be able to seek payback for up to six years of underpayment (the current cap is two years), and monetary damages in court will be tripled.\\n\\nLampitt crafted and pushed for the legislation to actually move the needle on the gender wage gap, she said.\\n\\nThis seemingly small change in how states approach the gender wage gap comes with huge consequences.\\n\\nThe most notable part of bill, however, is a small change in wording that will have a big impact. Rather than requiring equal pay for equal work, as in most laws aimed at the gender wage gap, New Jersey will require equal pay for substantially similar work.\\n\\nThat means that if a New Jersey woman has a different title than her male colleague or even works in an entirely different department, but she performs the same kinds of tasks and shoulders the same levels of responsibility, she should be paid the same as he is.\\n\\nIf you are doing a job substantially similar to … someone who works in another division, you should be able to compare yourself against that person, Lampitt explained. There might be a slight terminology change in a job title, but, really, what does a job title say?\\n\\nThe comparisons aren't arbitrary. Lampitt described some of the qualities that make people comparable even if they hold different positions: the amount of revenue they oversee, or how many employees they manage or how much operational oversight they wield. Minnesota, which requires that state government employees be paid the same for comparable jobs, analyzes people's work based on how much knowledge, problem solving and responsibility is required, as well as the working conditions of particular jobs.\\n\\nThis seemingly small change in how states approach the gender wage gap comes with huge consequences. While women make less than men in basically any job they choose, nearly a third of the difference between what men and women make, on average, can be explained by the fact that they usually work in different jobs. Traditionally female occupations, such as teaching and nursing, employ 40 percent of all women and just 5 percent of men; traditionally male occupations, like carpentry and computer engineering, employ 44 percent of all men but just 6 percent of women. In order for there to be an equal gender split in the country's many different occupations, half of all women or men would have to switch jobs.\\n\\nJobs where workers are more than half female pay 15 percent less than those that are more than half male.\\n\\nThis matters for the wage gap because men's work simply pays better. High-skilled, predominantly male occupations pay nearly $10 more an hour, at the median, than high-skill occupations crowded by women. Jobs where workers are more than half female pay 15 percent less than those that are more than half male.\\n\\nHere's one telling example: housekeepers, who are mostly women, make 14 percent less than people who clean cars and equipment, who are mostly men. And yet they're doing essentially the same tasks.\\n\\nThis is not just because women choose to work in lower-paid jobs, picking passion over pay. Over a half century, the data show that if women enter a particular job that pays well en masse, wages drop. When women started working in parks and camps, for example, pay fell 57 percentage points. When men took over the previously female-dominated job of computing, on the other hand, compensation shot up.\\n\\nSo we simply can't talk about the gender wage gap without talking about the fact that even when women do the same work that men do, they get paid less. Women aren't self-selecting into lower pay; they are devalued no matter where they go. And it's not just happening in separate fields like teaching and computing, but also within companies themselves. New Jersey's law, which focuses not on comparing the exact same jobs but on ones that are basically the same, is designed to address that problem.\\n\\nWomen aren't self-selecting into lower pay; they are devalued no matter where they go.\\n\\nIt's worked before. In the late 1980s, state governments took up the cause of paying women equally for basically the same work, even if it was done in different positions than men. They dubbed it comparable worth. Between 1983 and 1992, those governments spent more than $527 million to lift women's pay so that it was level with men in other jobs doing similar work, and in turn they eliminated 20 percent of the gender wage gap. At the time, a paper found that a national comparable worth policy would erase 28 percent of the gap.\\n\\nBut the efforts faded out of sight by the 1990s. Even so, four states — Iowa, Minnesota, Montana and West Virginia — and Washington, D.C., still have comparable worth laws on the books. New Jersey will soon join this rarified group and, given the other strengths of its new law, stands ready to lead the pack.\\n\\nEven better would be a law covering all American workers. The Fair Pay Act, which would require equal pay for comparable jobs, gets reintroduced every session of Congress. But its main champion in the Senate, Tom Harkin (D-Iowa), retired in 2014, so now it has a sole sponsor in Rep. Eleanor Holmes Norton, the nonvoting representative in the House for the District of Columbia. These days, it rarely gets even a mention in conversations about the gender wage gap.\\n\\nIf we're serious about ensuring that women are paid fairly, however, we can't just stop at demanding equal pay for equal work, as important as that is. Women usually don't end up in equal work in the first place. To actually close the gender wage gap and do away with annual Equal Pay Day commemorations, we'll have to think bigger — and value the work women do wherever they are.\\n\\nBryce Covert is an independent journalist writing about the economy.

{"original": "Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds (R) on Tuesday called for a constitutional amendment to do away with the state's lifetime ban on voting for felons, a significant move that would further shrink the small group of states that continue to implement a policy critics say is antiquated and discriminatory.\\n\\nRoughly 52,000 people can't vote in Iowa because of a felony conviction, according to a 2016 estimate by The Sentencing Project, a criminal justice nonprofit. The Sentencing Project also estimated that nearly 1 in every 10 African-Americans in the state were disenfranchised. Nationally, an estimated 4.7 million people are estimated to be disenfranchised because of a felony conviction.\\n\\nReynolds' call comes amid increased scrutiny on felon disenfranchisement after Florida passed a constitutional amendment in November to do away with its lifetime felon voting ban. That change could affect up to 1.4 million people.\\n\\nIowa, Kentucky and Virginia are the only three states in the country where state constitutions permanently strip people convicted of felonies of their right to vote unless the governor chooses to restore that right. But in Virginia, the last two governors have moved aggressively to restore voting rights to former felons, so Iowa and Kentucky now stand alone.\\n\\nIowa's governor can restore voting rights to former felons on an individual basis, and Reynolds has done that for 88 people since taking office in 2017. In 2011, Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad (R) rescinded an executive order automatically restoring voting rights to people who completed their felony sentences.\\n\\nIn her annual Condition of the State address on Tuesday, Reynolds said the governor shouldn't have sole discretion in restoring voting rights.\\n\\nI don't believe that voting rights should be forever stripped, and I don't believe restoration should be in the hands of a single person, she said. Those who complete their sentences shouldn't have to wait for my say or any future governor's say before they get that dignity back, she added.\\n\\nOur founders gave us a process to amend the constitution, should the passage of time change our view. Let's begin that process now. I believe Iowans recognize the power of redemption; let's put this issue in their hands.\\n\\nI believe Iowans recognize the power of redemption; let's put this issue in their hands. Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds (R)\\n\\nReynolds' remarks set her apart from several other Republicans across the country. In Florida, former Gov. Rick Scott (R) made it much more difficult for felons to apply and get their rights back after he took office. In 2015, Kentucky Gov. Matt Bevin (R) rescinded an executive order from his Democratic predecessor automatically restoring voting rights to some former felons. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said on the Senate floor in 2002 that voting was a privilege and people with felony convictions shouldn't vote because they would dilute the votes of law-abiding citizens.\\n\\nIowa House Speaker Linda Upmeyer (R) neither endorsed nor rejected Reynolds' proposal.\\n\\nWe are going to take a thoughtful look at what the Governor is proposing. This is a new topic that warrants discussion and we will let the committee do its work, she said in a statement. We have to remember that there are victims involved in many of these crimes. It is important that restitution is a part of the discussion as we consider this topic.\\n\\nMark Stringer, the executive director of the ACLU of Iowa, praised Reynolds' comments on Tuesday.\\n\\nDenying Iowans the right to vote does nothing to keep our communities safer or make our democracy stronger. In fact, it does the opposite. It prevents thousands of Iowans from successfully reintegrating into society and becoming active, invested participants in our communities and our state, Stringer said in a statement.\\n\\nReynolds, who battled alcohol addiction and was arrested in 1999 and 2000 for drunk driving, recently told reporters she believed in the power of second chances.\\n\\nI believe that people make mistakes and there's opportunities to change, and that needs to be recognized. So it's something that I'm passionate about, she said, the Des Moines Register reported.\\n\\nTo amend Iowa's constitution, lawmakers must pass the proposed amendment in two consecutive sessions of the General Assembly before sending it to voters for approval.\\n\\nThis story has been updated with comment from Upmeyer.\\n\\nInterested in voting rights?

{"original": "As the coronavirus outbreak continues to spread with nearly 100,000 confirmed cases globally and more than 100 confirmed cases in the United States, people are increasingly wondering how COVID-19 might affect our food supply and eating habits.\\n\\nWe've reached out to some leading food safety and public health experts for their advice. If you've been questioning whether to stay home from restaurants or if any foods are unsafe, here's what you need to know:\\n\\nCan coronavirus be transmitted through food?\\n\\nResearchers are still learning the specifics of how COVID-19 is transmitted, but we do know that the disease can spread through droplets that are released from the nose or mouth when someone coughs, sneezes or exhales.\\n\\nDisease transmission becomes possible when someone inhales these droplets or touches their eyes, mouth or nose after coming into contact with surfaces where these droplets land. As of now, there's no evidence of COVID-19 transmission through food.\\n\\nWe are not aware of any reports at this time of human illnesses that suggest COVID-19 can be transmitted by food or food packaging, a spokesperson from the USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service told HuffPost and mentioned in a statement.\\n\\nAs of now, there's no evidence of COVID-19 transmission through food.\\n\\nBenjamin Chapman, a professor and food safety extension specialist at North Carolina State University, explained that because the mode of infection is primarily respiratory, the chance of getting COVID-19 from food is extremely low. In fact, we don't see evidence of any respiratory viruses being transmitted through food in the past, he said.\\n\\nAre there foods in grocery stores we should avoid?\\n\\nSince there's no known transmission of COVID-19 through food, you don't need to worry about avoiding any foods in particular. A bigger concern when shopping is the risk of coronavirus transmission from person to person.\\n\\nIf you have people that are sick, you have the possibility for somebody to go into an area like that and transmit, said Jason Kindrachuck, assistant professor in the department of medical microbiology and infectious diseases at the University of Manitoba.\\n\\nSo yes, there is the possibility of getting sick if someone infected with COVID-19 is standing right beside you and sneezes while you're both searching for a ripe avocado, or if a droplet from an infected person lands on a package of cereal that you touch and then proceed to touch your face before washing your hands. But we still don't know how much of the virus needs to be present in order for transmission to occur.\\n\\nSergei Gnatiuk via Getty Images We are not aware of any reports at this time of human illnesses that suggest COVID-19 can be transmitted by food or food packaging, a spokesperson from the USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service told HuffPost.\\n\\nThis absolutely doesn't mean you should stop shopping, but you should be cautious and follow simple protective measures like regularly washing your hands, not touching your nose and mouth if your hands aren't clean, staying home if you're sick, covering your mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing, keeping a distance of at least three feet from people who are coughing or sneezing, and seeing a doctor if you have a fever, cough and trouble breathing.\\n\\nOne piece of advice I've been repeating on a regular basis to people who are concerned is, 'What are you doing right now to manage your risk from regular flu?' said Don Schaffner, extension specialist in food science and distinguished professor at Rutgers University. Many of the current recommendations for avoiding transmission of COVID-19 are similar.\\n\\nIs it safe to eat in restaurants?\\n\\nIn most cases, there's no reason to avoid visiting a restaurant due to fears of COVID-19 transmission. It is just the same as it was before we knew about coronavirus, Schaffner said. In other words, nothing is absolutely safe.\\n\\nSchaffner pointed out that even If the coronavirus is present in your food, it will be destroyed with proper cooking. But as with going to the supermarket, you'll want to be diligent about taking precautions similar to those recommended to prevent the spread of seasonal flu.\\n\\nWith an estimated 34,000-plus deaths from flu in 2018-19, we have a long way to go in managing risks, Chapman said. The respiratory virus risk in restaurants is really more about being in the same location as a lot of people, some of who can be depositing the virus on surfaces like tables, doors, menus, and managing that with a hand washing and alcohol-based sanitizer regime is an effective step to reduce risks of both COVID-19 and Influenza.\\n\\nOne piece of advice I've been repeating on a regular basis to people who are concerned is, 'What are you doing right now to manage your risk from regular flu?' - Don Schaffner, Rutgers University\\n\\nKeep in mind that someone who is sick probably isn't going to be heading out to a restaurant, Kindrachuk said, so your likelihood of going in and getting sick or getting infected is really, really minimal.\\n\\nThis is different from going to some sort of large public gathering with tens of thousands of people when there's a cluster of cases in an area, he pointed out. In that case, the potential for transmission would be higher due to the large number of people.\\n\\nMost of us know by now that public health advice strongly encourages staying home when sick. But for some restaurant workers, this isn't an option because of America's lack of important social services, as Rep. Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) pointed out in a recent tweet.\\n\\nI used to work in the food industry.\\n\\n\\n\\nI can't tell you how many times the people who handle your food - who are already overworked & underpaid - show up sick to work because our country refuses to guarantee healthcare or paid sick leave.\\n\\n\\n\\nWe need #MedicareForAll. — Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) February 25, 2020\\n\\nThe U.S. is one of a select few countries in the world without a national policy that ensures paid sick leave, leaving many low-wage restaurant workers with little choice but to go to work even when they're sick. Many are also deterred from seeing the doctor due to being uninsured or having health insurance policies that leave them with expensive bills.\\n\\nThe result is that you could be at risk of transmission when you're dining out. As HuffPost reporter Emily Peck noted in a recent piece on this topic, this isn't a coronavirus problem; it's a policy problem.\\n\\nAre there any precautions to take when preparing food at home?\\n\\nThe biggest tips to keep in mind when cooking at home are to wash your hands as much as possible and don't prepare food for others if you're showing symptoms, unless it's absolutely necessary to do so.\\n\\nWhen handling or preparing food, the government recommends following standard food safety practices, like washing hands and surfaces often, separating raw meat from other foods, refrigerating food, and cooking food to the appropriate temperature.\\n\\nDo we need to stockpile food to prepare for a possible quarantine?\\n\\nFood and hand sanitizer have been flying off supermarket shelves as many people grow concerned that the coronavirus outbreak will make it harder to access food in the future. But is this necessary?\\n\\nOur experts agreed that if possible, it's not a bad idea to have some non-perishable food on hand in case a situation arises that prevents you from food shopping.\\n\\nDon Farrall via Getty Images There's no need to stock your pantry with more than a couple extra weeks' worth of food.\\n\\nIt's probably good to have a couple of extra weeks of supplies just so that you don't have to actually go and frequent these places if there happen to be cases that show up, Kindrachuk said. But he pointed out that storing enough supplies to last you months is likely going too far.\\n\\nThe recommendation to keep a reserve of food at home is largely based on avoiding crowds and potential disruptions to the food supply due to possible workforce shortages. It doesn't have anything to do with a fear of the food supply becoming contaminated, said Erin DiCaprio, assistant specialist in cooperative extension in community food safety at UC Davis.\\n\\nIf you decide to stock up, make sure to be reasonable with the amount of food you buy, and to use your food supply before it goes bad — food waste is still a problem, even in a time of a disease outbreak. I would hate for people to buy all of this extra food and then have it be something that goes to waste in the refrigerator, Dicaprio said.\\n\\nWhile you're resisting the temptation to empty store shelves, remember to exercise this restraint with masks, too. If you're not coughing or sneezing or caring for someone who is, you probably don't need to wear one.\\n\\nIt's imperative for us to understand that we need our first-line responders, especially those in hospital and clinical settings, to have access to those, Kindrachuck said. People need to have some restraint as well and understand that those supplies are going to be needed by the medical community.\\n\\nHere's what else to know."}
{"original": "Welcome to Donald Trump's nightmare.\\n\\nWhen the 116th Congress is sworn in on Thursday, the Democratic Party will control the House of Representatives ― and the new committee chairs are ready to finally conduct rigorous oversight of the president's administration for the first time.\\n\\nFor the last two years, the president has had no oversight, no accountability from Congress, Rep. Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.), the new chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, said on CBS This Morning on Wednesday. We're going to provide that oversight. We're going to use the subpoena power if we have to.\\n\\nDemocrats will almost immediately begin to investigate the many controversial policies and scandals of the Trump administration.\\n\\nAnti-Immigrant Policies\\n\\nNadler has promised to dig into the president's nativist policies targeting refugees, migrants and immigrants already living in the United States. This includes getting real answers about the administration's family separation policy that ripped migrant children from their parents at the border and investigating the inclusion of a citizenship question in the 2020 Census, the deployment of U.S. troops to the border and changes to asylum laws.\\n\\nRep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.), the new chairman for the House Oversight and Reform Committee, also plans to immediately send out document requests and subpoenas to get to the bottom of the family separation policy. His Thursday letter will demand the Department of Health and Human Services, Department of Homeland Security and Department of Justice provide documentation on every child who was separated from their parents at the border and where they are now.\\n\\nSecurity Clearances For Flynn And Kushner\\n\\nCummings also plans to ask the White House to explain how it approved security clearances for former national security adviser Michael Flynn and Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner. Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his contacts with the Russian ambassador during the transition in 2016 and for failing to file as a foreign agent for the government of Turkey. Like the president, Kushner retains a connection to his family real estate business, which has extensive debts and interests linked to foreign countries ― a major potential conflict of interest.\\n\\nASSOCIATED PRESS Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.), left, and Rep. Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.), right, will lead investigations into the Trump administration from their respective posts as chairman of the House Oversight and Reform Committee and House Judiciary Committee.\\n\\nTrump's Corruption\\n\\nThe president's many conflicts of interest will also come under the microscope. His refusal to divest from his business means that he still makes money when lobbyists, big corporations and foreign governments pay to use his properties. Trump's involvement in the decision not to move the FBI headquarters in downtown Washington, D.C., has also raised concerns about a conflict of interest as the building is across the street from the president's hotel. Cummings and Rep. Peter DeFazio (D-Ore.), the new chairman of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, will investigate these conflicts.\\n\\nThe House Ways & Means Committee plans to obtain Trump's tax returns ― although maybe not immediately. Trump was the first major party presidential candidate since Richard Nixon to refuse to disclose his tax returns to the public. A New York Times investigation found that Trump likely committed tax fraud with his father, Fred Trump, when the elder Trump transferred nearly half a billion dollars to his son in a manner that evaded taxes.\\n\\nThere is popular demand for the Congress to request the president's tax returns, Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said in December.\\n\\nTrump's Sidekicks\\n\\nAlmost every House committee will have the ability to dig into the widespread corruption that has characterized the Trump administration across practically every agency. Former Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke's conflict-ridden land deals with the oil-services company Halliburton and the casino operator MGM can be investigated now. Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Ben Carson's nepotism and cronyism are also fair game, as is the elevation of Matthew Whitaker from a non-Senate-confirmed aide who recently worked as a salesman for a company convicted of fraud and a pitchman for toilets designed for men with oversized genitals to the position of acting attorney general.\\n\\nI want to probe senior Administration officials across the government who have abused their positions of power and wasted taxpayer money, as well as President Trump's decisions to act in his own financial self-interest rather than the best interests of the American people, Cummings previously told HuffPost.\\n\\n'Presidential Harassment'\\n\\nTrump has already attempted to deflect these investigations by labeling them Presidential Harassment, a phrase initially coined by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.).\\n\\nAlthough every president has complained about congressional investigation, the practice of congressional oversight of the executive branch dates back to President George Washington's first term. In recent years, investigators have taken varying approaches from properly investigating policies and abuses to engaging in political theater and conspiracy mongering.\\n\\nFormer Rep. Dan Burton (R-Ind.) famously used his control of the oversight committee in the 1990s to follow every rumor and conspiracy theory about President Bill Clinton, whom he declared a scumbag. Burton believed that Clinton had ordered the assassination of White House lawyer Vince Foster (Foster committed suicide in 1993) and even re-enacted the invented murder by shooting a cantaloupe (or maybe a pumpkin or a watermelon) in his backyard.\\n\\nIn the 2000s, Rep. Tom Davis (R-Va.) and Rep. Henry Waxman (D-Calif.) separately helmed the oversight committee and undertook serious investigations of the George W. Bush administration ― often with bipartisan support. Davis helped investigate the Jack Abramoff lobbying scandals, while Waxman investigated the 2008 market crash and the lies that led the U.S. to invade Iraq.\\n\\nASSOCIATED PRESS President Donald Trump has taken to calling any efforts by Democrats to investigate his administration Presidential Harassment.\\n\\nUnder Obama, Republican Darrell Issa (Calif.) wielded the oversight gavel in a unilateral manner by sending out more subpoenas than the previous three chairmen combined. Meanwhile, Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.), the outgoing oversight chairman, led a special committee to investigate the death of Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans during an attack in Benghazi, Libya. The investigation uncovered nothing new that multiple previous investigations had not revealed. Instead, the committee was used as a campaign tool against 2016 Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, who was Secretary of State at the time of Stevens' death.\\n\\nEverybody thought Hillary Clinton was unbeatable, right? Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) admitted in 2015. But we put together a Benghazi special committee, a select committee. What are her numbers today?\\n\\nThe committee disbanded one month after Clinton lost the election.\\n\\nDemocrats hope to avoid the perception that their investigations are solely for political or electoral advantage — even if nothing will stop the president from labeling anything investigating him a witch hunt. That is one reason why the new committee chairs are reluctant to engage in any incipient discussions about impeachment.\\n\\nSpecial counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into whether the president conspired with foreign countries including Russia to influence the 2016 election to his benefit has already netted numerous high-profile guilty pleas of Trump's national security adviser, foreign policy aide and his personal lawyer and fixer. It has also led to the revelation that Trump lied during his campaign that he had nothing to do with Russia when he actually pursued a deal with the Russian government to build a Trump Tower in Moscow up until June 2016.\\n\\nThe special counsel's investigation is still ongoing. Democrats are willing to wait to see its conclusions before they start talking about impeachment.\\n\\nThere's certainly a lot of allegations, but we'll have to wait and see what the Mueller investigation comes up with and other investigations looking into it, Nadler told CBS on Wednesday."}
{"original": "It's 2017 and Fortune 500 companies are still dealing with the issues of sexual harassment and gender discrimination. While recent high-profile lawsuits are still in the news Qualcomm, KPMG, Microsoft – enter Uber with new headlines of sexual harassment and an unrestrained work culture.\\n\\nHere are five valuable lessons companies can learn from the Uber allegations and the unprecedented way it has played out.\\n\\nCEO completely unaware\\n\\n1) Uber CEO Travis Kalanick, has come out and announced the hiring an outside third-party firm to look into the issue. Of larger concern are the front-page headlines that he had no clue what was going on in his own organization. While CEOs cannot be expected to know all the minutia of day-to-day operations, it is incumbent on them to ask the right questions and hold people accountable. This clearly was not happening.\\n\\nThe lesson, CEOs must demand to see and own accountability for the creation and implementation of a women's leadership strategy. A key point in all of this is to have an active robust women's leadership resource group and use group as a sounding board for employee concerns and issues.\\n\\nHR culpable in cover- up\\n\\n2) As the details unfold it appears that HR could actually be culpable in not addressing and covering up a sexual harassment claim. In the blog post detailing her year at Uber, former employee, Susan Fowler, stated that she presented the company's human resources department with screenshots of inappropriate messages her team manager sent to her during her first few weeks on the job. According to Fowler, her manager was given a slap on the wrist for basically emailing a new female employee and suggesting they have sexual relations. HR knowingly covered up that this was his first offense when in fact it had happened multiple times before because he was considered a high performer and they didn't want to ruin his career.\\n\\nThe lesson, every company needs access to an outside third party Ombuds for employees to go to when HR fails to do its job. An external Ombuds provide an alternate channel for confidential, neutral, and informal dispute resolution services for an organization. What is still undetermined is who influenced HR to cover this up. HR alone did not make this decision. Someone, somewhere decided to protect this individual.\\n\\nThe impact of social media\\n\\n3) Fowler documents in detail on her blog all of the situations that have taken place. She is factual and paints a picture of rampant discrimination. In the world of social media today every company, every manager will be put under a microscope and needs to be on their best behavior. We joke that if it appears on the internet it must be true. I have no doubt the claims are probably factual based on the way things unfolded.\\n\\nThe lesson, your company, and its leaders are open to every blog, from every employee that works for it, or used to work for it. Sexual harassment is real in the workplace and the EEOC reports that 70% of incidents never get reported. Leaders need to hold their managers accountable before issues arise and well before someone posts a blog about it.\\n\\nThe Board of Directors was not asking the right questions\\n\\n4) High profile Uber board member, Arianna Huffington has come out and stated that she will take personal responsibility for holding Uber's feet to the fire to resolve the situation. Of greater concern is prior to this event, what questions was the Uber board asking? Uber's track record of recent claims of drivers sexual harassment, coupled with very low women in technology numbers and Uber's unwillingness to demonstrate transparency in those numbers all rest on the feet of the board. Why were these questions not asked before the incident surfaced?\\n\\nThe lesson, board members need to dial-up their pressure of holding the CEO accountable for people measures and metrics. Sadly most boards today serve the CEO and are considered the epitome of the good old boys club. How many board members are asking tough questions about the progress and advancement of women in the organization? This can't merely fall on the few female board members, it must be asked by senior male board leaders as well.\\n\\nAn industry under already under siege\\n\\n5) Silicon Valley was put on notice almost 5 years ago that their diversity numbers regarding women and minorities and technology were deplorable. And while several high-profile tech companies such as Apple, Microsoft, and Facebook have committed to demonstrating pay equity for women and publishing their numbers, most of Silicon Valley has not followed suit.\\n\\nThe lesson, in an industry that was already put on notice for bad practices, weak representation numbers and is seen as being slow to address these workplaces issues, the Uber situation is a cautionary tale for new and established organizations. Your company culture and policies matter. Your talent will talk and walk. What does your industry look like? How are you leading in the effort to promote women and minorities?\\n\\nIn summarizing these lessons, this could have been any one of 100 companies, today the bull's-eye falls on Uber and Silicon Valley but tomorrow it may be your industry or company.\\n\\nCEOs must take aggressive action now. Every CEO should draft and send a memo to their organization stating state that there is a zero-tolerance policy toward sexual harassment and that any instance will result in immediate termination. It must be strongly worded and access must be granted either directly to the CEO or to a third-party for validation.\\n\\nThe truth is sexual harassment is still very real in the workplace today and women are afraid of retaliation. In this age of social media, companies must make a real commitment and not just give lip service to this issue. It is better to resolve it quickly and thoroughly today rather than read a blog about it tomorrow.\\n\\nJeffery Tobias Halter is a corporate gender strategist.

{"original": "The Center for Migration Studies (CMS) has released its latest report on the U.S. undocumented population, authored by Robert Warren, the former Director of the Immigration and Naturalization Service's Statistics Division. The report derives its estimates of the undocumented from 2014 statistics on the foreign-born from the US Census Bureau's American Community Survey (ACS). It does not draw policy conclusions, but provides findings on the undocumented by country of origin and U.S. state. On a national level, it reports that:\\n\\n• The undocumented population declined by more than one million between 2008 and 2014, falling below 11 million in 2014 for the first time since 2004.\\n\\n• The number of undocumented US residents began to decline prior to the onset of the Great Recession and continued to fall during the economic recovery.\\n\\n• The decline has been largely driven by a decrease in the Mexican-born undocumented, from 6.6 to six million between 2010 and 2014.\\n\\n• The overall foreign born population has grown while the undocumented population has declined, which indicates that the number and percentage of legally present foreign born persons, including naturalized citizens, has increased.\\n\\nProponents of legal immigrants (on both sides of the debate) should welcome this latter development.\\n\\nAn earlier CMS report, based on 2013 ACS statistics, found that the growth in the undocumented population began to slow in the mid-2000s and that by 2008 roughly as many people were leaving this population as joining it. In each year between 2008 and 2014, more US residents left the undocumented population than joined it, which explains the overall decline in this population.\\n\\nThe earlier report also found that 60 percent of the undocumented had resided in the United States for 10 years or more, including 1.9 million for at least 20 years. The average length of residence of the undocumented will continue to increase into the foreseeable future. The 2013 study also found that more than one-half of the four million persons eligible for the Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents (DAPA) program and the 1.5 million eligible for the expanded Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program entered the United States prior to the year 2000.\\n\\nWhat to make of these numbers from a policy perspective? The CMS report suggests that the United States seems to have turned a corner on the undocumented population and, for a variety of reasons, should not witness the kind of large-scale unauthorized migration flows that it experienced in the 1990s and early 2000s. Indeed, the multi-year trend has been an overall decline in this population. As CMS's 2013 report shows, a far higher percentage of visa over-stayers now join the ranks of the undocumented each year (58 percent in 2012) than persons who cross US borders without authorization.\\n\\nAt the same time, undocumented persons with long tenure and strong family ties will not likely leave the country or secure status in large numbers. Thus, a path to legal status and citizenship for a large percentage of the undocumented constitutes the most effective and sound way to reduce this population. Of course, with far fewer out-of-status residents, DHS's massive enforcement infrastructure could be used to target primarily non-citizens who represent a security or public safety threat, to regulate US borders, and to tackle the challenge of visa over-stayers."}
{"original": "President-elect Joe Biden this week proposed a COVID-19 relief package that would deliver one-time $1,400 checks to most Americans.\\n\\nThe direct payments Congress sent most households last year in response to the coronavirus pandemic were so popular with the American public that lawmakers approved a second round of checks last month, and Biden promised to do a third.\\n\\nBut Biden paired the checks with an array of other policies that are more complicated and outright unwelcome among Republicans on Capitol Hill, who have panned the proposal despite some support for additional direct payments. Even with Democrats controlling the Senate, passing the bill would be difficult.\\n\\nBuried inside the Biden plan, however, is an obscure policy that could be the nucleus for a program of sending people checks every month. It's a proposal to expand the child tax credit, which currently pays working parents as much as $1,400 per child annually through refunds at tax time.\\n\\nBiden's plan would boost the refunds to up to $3,600 per child and make it easier for lower-income families to get the full amount.\\n\\nSome Republicans like the idea of expanding the child tax credit.\\n\\nA larger child tax credit is an excellent idea, Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) told HuffPost in a statement Friday. It will alleviate child poverty and continue to lower the parent tax penalty.\\n\\nBrooks Kraft LLC/Corbis via Getty Images Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah), shown here in a reenactment of his swearing-in ceremony, said that an expanded tax credit would alleviate child poverty and continue to lower the parent tax penalty.\\n\\nSen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) championed a more generous child tax credit in 2017 as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. (One reason other Republicans went along is that the credit helped offset the loss of other family-friendly tax provisions in the law's simplification of the tax code.)\\n\\nAnd Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) co-sponsored a bill with Sen. Michael Bennet (D-Colo.) to increase the tax credit in 2019.\\n\\nBiden's proposal resembles the American Family Act, proposed in 2019 by Bennet and Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), which would have boosted the maximum credit to $3,600 ― and instead of paying out after you file your taxes, the Internal Revenue Service would distribute refunds in advance, on a monthly basis.\\n\\nAnnual tax refunds are already one of the federal government's most important antipoverty programs. Under Bennet-Brown, low-income parents would get about $300 per month in cash and would not need any earnings to qualify. Switching to monthly support would make life easier for parents, and increasing the benefit would slash child poverty by 40%.\\n\\nBiden retained the earnings requirement and omitted advance payments from his proposal, which would only apply for this year, but Democrats did include advance payments in one version of a coronavirus relief bill that passed the House last year. It's not clear if the tax credit will remain a priority for Democrats.\\n\\nRecognizing that kids are expensive and that raising them presents obstacles to employment, most other countries pay parents a child benefit or child allowance. The U.S. could get there, however backwardly, through a set of changes to its complicated system of tax credits. (Already, the federal government cuts monthly Social Security checks to senior citizens.)\\n\\nThe idea of a big new federal program with monthly benefits has been poison in American politics, with lawmakers often doing social policy through the tax code, but the bipartisan love of checks in recent months suggests that might not be true anymore.\\n\\nMatt Bruenig, founder of a left-wing think tank called the People's Policy Project, has advocated transforming the various tax credits available to low-income workers into a monthly child benefit.\\n\\nThe checks have been wildly popular, he said. Now is the time to seize the energy and move the tax credits into a real benefit program."}
{"original": "Courtesy Tonya Hughes Tonya Hughes, 48, needed to stop working so she could take care of her son and help him with virtual school.\\n\\nTonya Hughes, a single mother in Rockville, Maryland, and a longtime substitute teacher, hasn't worked since March 13, when her state first announced shutdowns because of the coronavirus.\\n\\nPreviously, she'd worked for 10 years as a substitute, making about $18 an hour. Now, like so many women around the country, Hughes is at home with her son, a second grader with a learning disability who needs help with virtual school.\\n\\nThe 48-year-old could go back to work, remotely, and teach over Zoom. But she can't juggle supporting her son's school day while running a classroom full of other kids at the same time, she said. Do I take my son out of school so I can get my work done? she asked, rhetorically.\\n\\n\\n\\nMaybe she could get another job, outside the home after school, if she had child care. But Hughes is a single mother with no one to fall back on if she contracts COVID-19. If I get sick, if anything happens to me, forget it. Who's going to take care of my child? she asked. For now, the two of them are at home — only leaving to take the bus to the grocery store or walk over to the school, which provides free grab n' go lunches.\\n\\nFaced with shaky job prospects across so many industries and often with children home for virtual school, many women have simply given up on the idea of working. All told, 2.1 million women have left the workforce since this pandemic started, compared to nearly 1.7 million men.\\n\\nIn December, as coronavirus cases surged in the U.S., that dynamic got worse, according to data released by the Labor Department last Friday. All of the 140,000 jobs lost in December were held by women, according to the new data. Meanwhile, American men gained 16,000 jobs that same month.\\n\\nAnd though the pandemic has hurt all women, women of color are bearing the brunt of the pain. The December job loss was definitely concentrated among Black and Hispanic women. No question, said Heidi Shierholz, an economist and director of policy at the Economic Policy Institute. For white women, it's a total disaster, but that's dwarfed by what's happening in other demographic groups.\\n\\nDo I take my son out of school so I can get my work done? Tonya Hughes, 48\\n\\nThe unemployment rate for women overall, 6.3%, is twice as high as it was before the pandemic started. The unemployment rate is 8.45% for Black women and 9.1% for Latina women, according to Friday's report.\\n\\nIn December, 154,000 Black women left the labor force entirely. That's the largest drop in their employment since the beginning of the pandemic, the National Women's Law Center pointed out in a data brief released Friday. Meanwhile, 200,000 white women actually returned to the workforce.\\n\\nWomen have been leaving the workforce throughout the pandemic, though. Most notably, in September, 863,000 were forced out. But at the time, the majority of those workers were white women.\\n\\nNow it seems to be Black women's turn. What happened is concerning, said Jasmine Tucker, director of research at the National Women's Law Center. The reasons for the mass exodus aren't necessarily as obvious as in September when back-to-school caused a seismic shift for working women, she said.\\n\\nBut there are a few things going on: Because of systemic racism, Black and Hispanic women are concentrated in different occupations than white women, Shierholz explained. And those occupations are the ones that got hit harder by shutdown measures — the restaurant industry, for example.\\n\\nThose were the industries hit in December, she said, in a smaller-scale version of what the economy experienced last spring. An uptick in COVID-19 cases spurred job loss and an economic slowdown. In December, 500,000 jobs vanished in the leisure and hospitality sector alone.\\n\\nMeanwhile, the pandemic has caused a huge uptick in unpaid work. Mothers are now homeschool teachers, just like Hughes. And with COVID-19 rates disproportionately higher for Black Americans, it stands to reason that the burden of caregiving also falls hardest on their shoulders.\\n\\nHoping For Christmas, Part 2\\n\\nCourtesy Tonya Hughes I had to explain Santa was delayed because of COVID and the weather, Tonya Hughes said of not being able to provide Christmas presents to her 8-year-old son this year.\\n\\nWithout a steady income stream, Hughes has been getting by on a mix of resources, including federal food stamp benefits and a local food bank when things get really tight. In the spring, there were stimulus checks and beefed-up unemployment benefits. Those ran out long ago, however. Hughes, who is a member of the activist group Center for Popular Democracy, has been advocating for an extension for months.\\n\\nThe group has provided her with some support, too. It helps to have people she can just talk to right now, she said.\\n\\nThis past Christmas, Hughes wasn't able to give her 8-year-old son any gifts under the tree. I had to explain Santa was delayed because of COVID and the weather, she said, explaining that it was rainy on Christmas Eve.\\n\\nThat was fine with him until he had to log back on for school and wasn't sure what to tell his classmates about the holiday, she said.\\n\\nHughes did get a little bit of money from a member of her activist group, so she and her son took the bus to CVS to buy a few treats for themselves, like new gloves, a toy piano you can play with your feet and Santa hats for him and her 18-year-old daughter who lives nearby.\\n\\nShe is now waiting on another stimulus check. Congress authorized $300 payments at the end of the year, and Hughes is hoping she gets one soon. On Monday, Maryland's governor announced an aid package that would provide stimulus payments of $750 for families.\\n\\nHughes was pretty excited. She plans on buying extra groceries and stuff for her house; the money would also mean she could Uber to doctor appointments instead of taking the bus.\\n\\nAnd there would also be some cash for a Christmas 2, she said."}

{"original": "Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post via Getty Images Donald Trump's Make America Great Again myth became more real to his supporters than the literal actions of his presidency.\\n\\nA deranged mob of Americans, fueled by lies about election fraud peddled by the president of the United States along with multiple senators and House members, sacked the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday as part of an insurrection encouraged by Donald Trump to stop the constitutional process allowing for the peaceful transfer of power taking place within the building.\\n\\n[Y]ou'll never take back your country with weakness, Trump told the rioters immediately before they marched on the Capitol. You have to show strength and be strong.\\n\\nWe're going to try to give our Republicans — the weak ones, because the strong ones don't need any of our help — we're going to try and give them [the] kind of pride and boldness they need to take back our country, he said to the crowd on the National Mall.\\n\\nOn the grounds outside, rioters erected a giant wooden cross and a gallows with a noose. Reporters were beaten and threatened with death. Their cameras and equipment were smashed and burned. Echoing Trump's long-standing calls that the press were the enemy of the people, rioters scrawled Murder the media, on a Capitol doorway. A rioter murdered a police officer with a fire extinguisher. Another rioter was shot dead by a police officer while trying to break into House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's chambers. In perhaps the most indelible image, rioters commandeered a scaffold and used it to take down an American flag and replace it with a Trump Make America Great Again flag.\\n\\nThis was the catastrophic and prophetic culmination of the Make America Great Again myth.\\n\\nWin McNamee/Getty Images A rioter dressed in tactical gear carries zip-tie handcuffs in the Senate Chamber on Wednesday.\\n\\nEver since Trump descended the escalator in Trump Tower in 2015 to announce his presidential campaign with vicious, racist rhetoric and the tagline Make America Great Again, pundits and journalists have struggled to understand his appeal and the unthinking passion he inspired in the conservative base of the Republican Party and whether there was any true meaning or substance to what has been called Trumpism. The routine error in this effort has been to treat Trumpism as a fact to be understood intellectually or to be disputed. (Not to say that refuting his lies is pointless.)\\n\\nAs the right-wing billionaire Peter Thiel once said about understanding Trump, I think one thing that should be distinguished here is that the media is always taking Trump literally. It never takes him seriously, but it always takes him literally.\\n\\nThiel attempted to spin taking Trump seriously as meaning that his supporters heard his bombastic lies and racist jibes and thought about them in concrete policy terms. That was also wrong. Trump's supporters were not taking his words either literally or seriously, they were taking them mythically. When Trump entered the political fray in 2015, he gave the supporters of the conservative movement that came to dominate the Republican Party since the end of World War II a political myth they could die for. And myths, for the believer, cannot be refuted.\\n\\nA political myth is a narrative cast in dramatic form that provides a practical explanation of present events to a specific group at a time or place. Political myths provide meaning, direction and purpose through an interpretation of what the group of believers takes to be reality. They mythologize and interpret real events, and historical facts can be altered to suit the myth's purpose.\\n\\nThere are many kinds of political myths. There are foundation myths, like the Myth of the American Founding Fathers and the 1776 Revolution, the Roman Foundation Myth or the Soviet Myth of the October Revolution. And there are other political organizing myths, like the Myth of Norman Yoke, the Confederate Lost Cause Myth or the Myth of the U.S. Constitution.\\n\\nBut what Trump presents under the banner of Make America Great Again is an apocalyptic, or eschatological, myth. It is a myth foretelling a great and cataclysmic future event where deliverance will arrive through the exertion and sacrifice of the believers. The present order will be swept away and either a new one will take its place or an older order will be majestically restored.\\n\\nPoliticians have used you and stolen your votes, Trump said while campaigning in 2016. They have given you nothing. I will give you everything. I will give you what you've been looking for for 50 years. I'm the only one.\\n\\nANDREW CABALLERO-REYNOLDS/AFP via Getty Images A noose hangs from a makeshift gallows as supporters of President Donald Trump riot at the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday.\\n\\nThe French syndicalist theorist Georges Sorel provided the most detailed explanation and theory for eschatological political myths in his 1908 book, Reflections on Violence, which focused on socialism and the myth of the general strike.\\n\\nMyths like Make America Great Again contain all the strongest inclinations of a people, of a party or of a class, according to Sorel, that give an aspect of complete reality to the hopes of immediate action upon which the reform of the will is founded. They are not descriptions of things but expressions of a will to act. And believers always picture their coming action in the form of images of battle in which their cause is certain to triumph. These myths cannot be refuted, since they just reflect the convictions of a group.\\n\\nThese myths are also not to be confused with utopian stories, which direct men's minds towards reforms. Myths like Make America Great Again do no such thing but instead provide a narrative to lead men to prepare themselves for a combat which will destroy the existing state of things.\\n\\nTrump, from the beginning, as many have noted, had no specific policy program while running for president outside of symbolic proposals to build a wall on the Mexican border, ban Muslims from entering the country and let police beat up anti-racism protesters. But those symbolic proposals, along with his violent and racist rhetoric, galvanized the Republican Party's conservative base in a manner his primary competitors could not.\\n\\nThere was never a policy vision for a Trump administration, but he promised that his election would bring a glorious future for conservatives. But that's because he was not promising a presidential administration in any real sense. He promised a future in which he alone would make America great again by smashing the left, siccing security forces on Latin American immigrants, Black people and Muslims, and protecting and glorifying his supporters.\\n\\nThe MAGA myth urges immediate action to take back our country from, as Trump said in July, a left-wing cultural revolution … designed to overthrow the American Revolution. This battle should be waged without apology, he said then.\\n\\nThis country will be everything that our citizens have hoped for, for so many years, Trump said, and that our enemies fear.\\n\\nROBERTO SCHMIDT/AFP via Getty Images Demonstrators breech security before entering the Capitol to try to stop Congress from certifying the 2020 presidential election.\\n\\nThis must happen because it is the white conservatives who are the true victims of a liberal elite that disdains them.\\n\\nWe're all victims, Trump said on Dec. 5 about his reelection loss. Everybody here, all these thousands of people here tonight, they're all victims, every one of you.\\n\\nPrior to the election, National Review Editor-in-Chief Rich Lowry justified support for Trump because he was the only middle finger available that conservatives could brandish against the people who've assumed they have the whip hand in American culture.\\n\\nThese themes of victimhood from a leftist elite have suffused conservatism since religious, business and white racist conservatives came together in the middle of the 20th century in reaction to the New Deal, the civil rights movement and the women's and gay rights movements.\\n\\nThe John Birch Society, Sen. Joseph McCarthy (R-Wis.), Southern segregationists and countless others who helped create and fund the conservative movement propagated conspiracies of a secret communist cabal that included everyone from President Dwight Eisenhower to Chief Justice Earl Warren to Martin Luther King Jr. And, more recently, after the election of the first Black president, the tea party movement organized conservatives to take back our country while donning the symbols of the American Revolution, such as the Gadsden Flag and tri-corner hats.\\n\\nThis attitude helped to build and create the Republican Party coalition that won five out of six presidential elections from 1968 to 1988 and control of both chambers of Congress in 1994. But since then the party has increasingly relied on either non-democratic or un-representative elements of the American political system, such as the Electoral College, the U.S. Senate, the judicial branch and gerrymandering, to gain and hold power. The most glaring statistic to show this is that Republicans have now lost the popular vote in seven out of the last eight presidential races. They also have now lost the popular vote in four successive presidential elections, a feat surpassed only by the five straight wins by Democrats Franklin Roosevelt and Harry Truman. Conservatives, and specifically white conservatives, are increasingly a political minority. And they know it.\\n\\nTrump's Make America Great Again myth arrived for this weakened conservatism beset by its failure to reverse the advance of a multiracial democracy as a new vision of a future where all conservatives will win and all liberals would not only be defeated but imprisoned. Lock them all up, Trump said on the campaign trail in 2020. The present order of both parties would be swept away, and the old order would be restored. Just as Sorel described.\\n\\nWin McNamee/Getty Images A rioter holds a Trump flag inside the Capitol near the Senate Chamber on Wednesday.\\n\\nThe MAGA myth was made real when, against all odds, Trump shocked the media and Democrats and won the 2016 election, despite losing the popular vote. He had promised deliverance, and he had delivered. Trump would go on to describe that night at his subsequent rallies. This was a recitation of his victory as a dramatic narrative: a myth. The message is clear: Trump won where no one else could, and America was Great Again because of him. Trump was by himself the realization of the myth. As he said in 2016, I alone can fix it. Naturally, his reelection campaign picked Keep America Great as its new motto. Removal of Trump through democratic elections had become synonymous with the fall of the republic.\\n\\nBut Trump did lose reelection. As this complicated the MAGA myth, it could not possibly be true. Trump, through his symbiotic relationship with his base of supporters, both fueled their wildest fantasies by rejecting his loss with a steady stream of lies and amplified his supporters' conspiracies on social media. These lies had to be true because America had to be Made Great Again, his supporters believed.\\n\\nPeople who are living in this world of myths are secure from all refutation, Sorel wrote.\\n\\nAnd so Trump summoned his supporters to Washington on Wednesday to a rally meant to stop Congress from certifying President-elect Joe Biden's victory.

{"original": "Tom Williams via Getty Images President Barack Obama could use his final State of the Union address to announce an executive order requiring disclosure of dark money spending by federal contractors.\\n\\nWASHINGTON -- Every year since 2012, campaign finance reform advocates have cautiously anticipated whether President Barack Obama would use his State of the Union address to announce an executive order requiring the disclosure of some of the dark money funding campaigns. Each time, he has declined to do so.\\n\\nLeading up to the president's last address Tuesday night, reformers are mostly resigned to the fact that the president will decline to announce any such plan. They do believe that he could lay the groundwork for an announcement on the sixth anniversary of the Supreme Court's Citizens United decision, which opened the door to unlimited corporate, union and, ultimately, individual spending on independent electoral efforts.\\n\\nWhile I don't think we'll see groundbreaking policy announcements, I do think there will be foreshadowing for later, said Lisa Gilbert, the director of Public Citizen's Congress Watch.\\n\\nThe president's advisers, current and former, have weighed in on what could and should be in his final State of the Union.\\n\\nWhite House Chief of Staff Dennis McDonough stated that the speech will push for policies that allow every American has a chance to influence this democracy, not the select few, or millionaires, billionaires.\\n\\nObama's former top economic adviser, Gene Sperling, tweeted on Jan. 8 that the president should sign an executive order to reduce the amount of dark money funding elections.\\n\\nAgree w/ @Lisa_PubCitizen: An EO to deal w/secret money in elections is important & needed this month. @CAPAction https://t.co/BxpBhOT1U0 — Gene Sperling (@genebsperling) January 8, 2016\\n\\nWe are confident President Obama is as appalled by the Citizens United decision today as indicated in his first State of the Union, perhaps more so given the grotesque displays of influence buying we've seen since, said Common Cause Communications Director Scott Swenson. In many ways democracy/political reform makes sense for the White House to lead on as voters start to turn their attention to choosing his successor.\\n\\nA potential executive order came to light after the draft text of one was leaked to conservative lawyer and former Federal Election Commission member Hans Van Spokavsky in 2011. The order would have required all federal contractors to disclose all of their political donations, including those to nonprofits engaged in electoral campaigns that are not covered by disclosure laws, when submitting a bid. It was drafted after Congress failed to pass disclosure legislation in its previous session, failing to clear a Republican filibuster by a single vote.\\n\\nBusiness interests like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and conservative interest groups including those connected to the billionaire Koch brothers declared all-out opposition to the proposal. The chamber's top lobbyist, Bruce Josten, said in 2011, We will fight it through all available means.\\n\\nRepublicans in Congress have attempted to deny the White House the ability to issue the order through the appropriations process. Legislative language passed Congress that forbids the use of funds to enact or enforce an order requiring all federal contract bidders to disclose political spending. This language does leave open the possibility for the president to sign an order requiring contractors to disclose once they have secured the contract.\\n\\nSo far, though, the president has only provided heartening words in prior speeches.\\n\\nIn his 2015 State of the Union, Obama said, A better politics is one where we spend less time drowning in dark money for ads that pull us into the gutter.\\n\\nBut there was no policy announcement to go along with the statement.\\n\\nSome reform backers have taken a harsher line on the president as his administration has failed to produce a policy to limit the amount of undisclosed money coursing through politics.\\n\\nThe reform group RootStrikers launched a campaign to highlight Obama's poor record on campaign finance reform. The group points out that Obama endorsed his very own super PAC in his 2012 reelection bid, and effectively killed the presidential public financing system by becoming the first candidate to refuse to participate in it during a general election in 2008.\\n\\nIn support of the dark money executive order, RootStrikers and its partners have successfully obtained enough signatures to require a response from the White House through its We the People petition system. That response must come by Feb. 16.\\n\\nWe continue to hear the same rhetoric for his entire presidency -- that he detests the Citizens United decision, that it's incredibly harmful to the country, and yet he's done nothing, RootStrikers Campaign Manager Kurt Walters said. If he does not issue the executive order and continues to give the same empty rhetoric it will be a slap in the face to the millions of Americans he made promises to.\\n\\nFeb. 24, 2009 Pool via Getty Images\\n\\nJan. 27, 2010 Getty Images\\n\\nJan. 25, 2011 Getty Images\\n\\nJan. 24, 2012 Getty Images\\n\\nFeb. 12, 2013 Getty Images\\n\\nJan. 28, 2014 Getty Images\\n\\nJan. 20, 2015 Getty Images\\n\\nJan. 12, 2016 Pool via Getty Images"}
{"original": "The Pew Charitable Trusts Amber Sheldon, right, greets a frequent client at the harm reduction program at Glide in San Francisco. The program offers clean syringes, drug test strips and other supplies to frequent drug users. Sheldon and others in the city's harm reduction community help drug users learn how to protect themselves and others from fatal overdoses.\\n\\nBy Christine Vestal\\n\\nSAN FRANCISCO — Ever since the powerful synthetic opioid fentanyl started showing up in the U.S. illicit drug supply eight years ago, experts have surmised that drug traffickers were using the inexpensive white powder to boost the potency of heroin, sometimes adding too much and inadvertently killing their customers.\\n\\nIn a series of interviews with heroin users in Rhode Island in 2017, Brown University researchers reported that users described fentanyl as unpleasant, potentially deadly, and to be avoided. They concluded that demand for the deadly contaminant was low and that its presence in the drug supply was generating user interest in effective risk mitigation strategies, including treatment.\\n\\nBut here in San Francisco's gritty Tenderloin district, where fentanyl was only rarely seen until last year, drug users tell a starkly different story. For many of them, fentanyl is a high-value drug that, if used carefully, can prevent dope sickness and deliver a strong high for a fraction of the price of heroin.\\n\\nMore than half of drug users in San Francisco purposely seek fentanyl, despite its dangers, according to harm reduction workers who talk to hundreds of drug users every day. The drug is also making its way to other parts of the state, leaving deaths in its wake and prompting law enforcement and public health officials to gather and figure out how to prevent its spread and help users avoid the worse consequences.\\n\\nFifty times stronger than heroin and 100 times stronger than morphine, the synthetic opioid was rarely detected in U.S. illicit drug markets or in the bodies of fatal overdose victims just a decade ago. Last month, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed that fentanyl has become the biggest killer in the nation's raging drug overdose epidemic. The rate of overdoses jumped 113 percent each year from 2013 through 2016.\\n\\nTo be sure, many other drug-using San Franciscans say they try to avoid the deadly white powder, and some reported overdosing after unwittingly consuming a wide variety of fentanyl-laced drugs, including methamphetamines, cocaine and counterfeit Xanax and Vicodin pills.\\n\\nStill, an increasing number of drug users here say they are opting for fentanyl when it's available, a trend not reported elsewhere in the United States. And despite its powerful potency, fentanyl isn't killing nearly as many people here as it is on the East Coast and in Appalachia.\\n\\nIn San Francisco, the consumer preference for fentanyl and relatively low death rate likely stem in large part from the way the drug is marketed by dealers, said Phillip Coffin, director of substance use research at the city's public health department.\\n\\nFentanyl that is sold here is clearly labeled. It's rarely disguised as heroin, as it is on the East Coast and in Appalachia. As a result, users who buy fentanyl know what they're getting and, in most cases, take the necessary precautions, Coffin said.\\n\\nIt's still a much more dangerous drug than heroin, which is typically sold as black tar in California and tends to be inconsistent in potency and quality, he added.\\n\\nAnother reason for San Francisco's relatively low death rate from fentanyl is the city's entrenched and well-funded harm reduction community, Coffin said. After the first fentanyl outbreak here in 2015, public health and harm reduction groups joined forces to sharply increase the amount of Narcan, used to treat overdose, distributed to all drug users and intensify outreach programs.\\n\\nA better product?\\n\\nThe biggest concentration of intentional fentanyl users is in the Tenderloin, said Kristen Marshall, who runs a drug testing program for the Harm Reduction Coalition, a national organization that provides training and supplies to harm reduction groups.\\n\\nBut an increasing number of drug users in other San Francisco neighborhoods also are starting to opt for the powerful powder, she said.\\n\\nWith the help of harm reduction workers who supply Narcan and drug test strips, many fentanyl users have developed ways of protecting themselves from overdoses. And despite the drug's short-lived euphoria, they say they plan to continue using fentanyl, albeit carefully, primarily because of its value, Marshall said.\\n\\nFor drug users, it's just like you or I making decisions about the products we choose when we grocery shop, she said. Fentanyl is stronger, you need less of it, and it's cheaper. So why wouldn't I, as somebody with limited funds, want to spend my money on something that's a better value and therefore a better product?\\n\\nAs fentanyl started seeping into the city four years ago, Marshall said, the public health and harm reduction communities revamped their message to drug users. It was clear people were going to use it, so we decided not to scare people by saying that fentanyl will definitely cause an overdose. Instead, we said they should use it with caution.\\n\\nUse less of it, use it slower, use it with other people, and keep Narcan with you, Marshall said. It's also important to test your drugs. Even if you know you're getting fentanyl, you need to run additional tests to see what else might be in the mix.\\n\\nGrowing influence in California\\n\\nIn the past decade, as the opioid overdose epidemic ravaged much of the rest of the country, San Francisco and most of California seemed immune. Fentanyl started showing up in California only in 2015, and its death toll was limited. Appalachian and New England states were seeing fentanyl in 2011, and by 2013 it was killing people by the dozens in a single day.\\n\\nHere in California, we felt lucky we weren't seeing the same kind of devastation from the opioid epidemic that was occurring on the other side of the country, said Kelly Pfeifer, a physician and addiction expert at the California Health Care Foundation.\\n\\nFentanyl showed up in San Francisco early compared to the rest of the state. It was rarely seen in other parts of California until last year.\\n\\nIn April, that changed: Three people had died in downtown Los Angeles after snorting fentanyl-laced cocaine. And public health officials reported the substance had been found in methamphetamines as well.\\n\\nA month later, state law enforcement officials began meeting with researchers, medical examiners and public health leaders to develop better ways to detect the deadly illicit opioid in the drug supply, alert users and distribute more of the overdose rescue drug Narcan — similar to San Francisco's 2015 response.\\n\\nThe Pew Charitable Trusts Harm reduction professionals Amber Sheldon, left, and William Buehlman at their office in San Francisco, with dog Daydream.\\n\\nAt the same time, Daniel Ciccarone, a family physician and researcher at the University of California, San Francisco, was preparing to publish a paper on the fentanyl scourge that was killing thousands of drug users elsewhere in the country.\\n\\nHis conclusion: The vast majority of drug users don't want fentanyl. The third and deadliest wave of the opioid epidemic, Ciccarone and other researchers said, was driven by drug traffickers, not by user demand. The powerful white powder was mostly killing people who were unaware of its presence.\\n\\nThe fentanyl epidemic, Ciccarone said in a Stateline interview, is a supply problem. But since the war on drugs has proven unsuccessful, the solution is to address the demand side by making addiction treatment and harm reduction more available, he said.\\n\\nPfeifer agrees that better prevention and access to treatment is the solution to the epidemic, suggesting that part of the reason California has one of the lowest overdose death rates in the country is that the state expanded Medicaid to low-income adults in 2010, four years earlier than most other states, and has since built substantial treatment infrastructure in many parts of the state.\\n\\nIntense monitoring\\n\\nSan Francisco is unique in its method of drug surveillance and user education, said Daniel Raymond, policy director of the national Harm Reduction Coalition.\\n\\nMore than any other place I've seen, he said, San Francisco's harm reduction community systematically talks to drug users about their preferences and experiences and continuously feeds that information to the San Francisco Department of Health, which uses that intelligence to inform its message and overdose prevention strategies.\\n\\nThrough that feedback network, Ciccarone said he recently had heard that some users in San Francisco were actively choosing fentanyl. And though the dynamics of the local drug culture appear to be starkly different from what he encountered in Maryland, Massachusetts and West Virginia, where he conducted most of his research, Ciccarone said he wasn't surprised.\\n\\nFentanyl, like the rest of the illicit drug market, is a moving target, he said. You can't generalize from one region to another, and what may be true today may not be tomorrow.\\n\\nHe maintained that the nationwide fentanyl epidemic has been primarily supply driven. But for unknown reasons, the cartels decided not to push fentanyl in California until recently, he said. If fentanyl is starting to become a demand issue here in California, that could be really bad news.\\n\\nSome experts have speculated that because heroin is sold in a sticky black tar form west of the Mississippi, compared with a white powder in most of the rest of the country, fentanyl was not introduced because it was more difficult to mix with black tar.\\n\\nOthers argued that if drug traffickers thought there was a market for fentanyl, they would find a way. That market may now be emerging.\\n\\nDeath toll rising\\n\\nFentanyl is involved in more than half of overdose deaths nationwide, and its geographic reach is extending beyond the East Coast and Appalachia, where its death toll has been rising since 2011, to California, where the synthetic drug is involved in about 20 percent of deaths.\\n\\nIt wasn't a question of whether fentanyl would become a bigger issue here, but when, Ciccarone said.\\n\\nBy talking to users who had been coping with the life-threatening contaminant for years, he said, he hoped to help California users gird for the cheap synthetic drug's inevitable onslaught.\\n\\nAn addiction medicine expert at the University of California, Los Angeles, Steven Shoptaw, is building statewide coalitions of academics and public health and law enforcement officials to fortify the state's defenses against the deadly synthetic drug.\\n\\nWe know we're in a privileged position to have been spared a lot of the fentanyl mess, he said, and we want to keep it that way."}

{"original": "The use of Truvada as PrEP—pre-exposure prophylaxis to prevent HIV—is going gangbusters.\\n\\nBy the end of 2015, likely well over 80,000 U.S. residents had filled at least one prescription for the daily tablet. And given the steadily increasing rate of new prescriptions registered each quarter, the population of HIV-negative people who have at least tried PrEP has probably swelled considerably by now. This is fantastic news for the effort to stem the tide of HIV infections among men who have sex with men (MSM), whom data suggest make up the vast majority of PrEP users. While it's still too early to determine Truvada's initial impact on infection trends—PrEP started gaining popularity only in late 2013—clinics with large populations of high-risk MSM on PrEP have reported very low HIV rates among them.\\n\\nIndeed, this is fantastic news—for white MSM.\\n\\nThe picture has become increasingly clear: PrEP is largely failing to help those who need an HIV prevention game changer most desperately, namely Black MSM, in particular those younger than 25.\\n\\nAccording to an estimate from Gilead Sciences, which manufactures Truvada, about three quarters of the men who have filled a PrEP prescription are white while just 9 percent are Black. Considering the racial breakdown of the epidemic among MSM, these figures are gravely lopsided.\\n\\nWe're not starting from a very good place, says Eli Rosenberg, PhD, an assistant professor of public health at Emory University in Atlanta, reflecting on the initial demographic patterns of PrEP use.\\n\\nDuring dozens of interviews with stakeholders in the PrEP field, including clinicians, social service workers, nonprofit leaders and researchers, many expressed concern that an unexpected downside of PrEP's recent burst onto the scene is that the HIV prevention method is apparently on a path to widen already tragic racial disparities in infection rates among MSM.\\n\\nIn a nation facing a critical moment of reckoning with respect to race relations, the racial discrepancy in PrEP's use thus far may result in yet another example of whites benefiting from a major societal advancement while African Americans are largely excluded.\\n\\nHonestly, I believe that if HIV rates are lowered in the white gay community, they will definitely lose interest in lowering rates in communities of color, says Thomas Davis, a health education specialist at the Los Angeles LGBT Center who is African American. They've been leaving us out since the start of the epidemic and still do to this day unless they're called out for it.\\n\\n***\\n\\nUnfortunately, right now, the government, our health care system and our society in general are not focusing enough on putting resources into increasing PrEP uptake among Black folks—it's clear, says Ashwini Hardikar, MPH, director of prevention and outreach at the LGBT-focused Callen-Lorde Community Health Center in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan.\\n\\nCallen-Lorde has the largest PrEP program—2,400 people strong—in New York state, of whom only 12 percent are Black. We know that historically, Black lives have not mattered in this country, and we need to turn that around, especially when it comes to PrEP, Hardikar says.\\n\\nHIV among Black MSM remains a crisis in need of a response. An astonishing one quarter of the approximately 40,000 U.S. residents diagnosed with HIV annually are members of this minority within a minority. (MSM as a whole make up two thirds of new diagnoses.)\\n\\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recently projected that if current trends persist, half of all Black MSM will contract HIV in their lifetime, compared with 1 in 11 (or 9 percent) of their white counterparts. And in a CDC study of MSM in 20 major U.S. cities, 30 percent of Blacks were living with HIV, compared with 14 percent of whites.\\n\\nSo for Truvada to make the greatest possible impact on HIV rates, its use as prevention would need to reach a critical mass among at-risk Black MSM. Instead, PrEP has increasingly found its niche among white MSM, a demographic that has already long benefited from a dropping HIV diagnosis rate, to the tune of an 18 percent decline between 2005 and 2014. During that time, diagnoses among Black MSM rose 22 percent, with an 87 percent surge among young Black MSM. (In promising news, however, the HIV rate among Black MSM, including youths, has leveled off in more recent years.)\\n\\nThe fact that PrEP is largely used by men older than 25 further limits Truvada's power to prevent new infections among Black MSM, since 45 percent of new cases among Black MSM are in 13- to 24-year-olds, compared with just 16 percent among their white counterparts. PrEP is not even approved for those younger than 18, and recent research suggests that teen MSM have trouble adhering to PrEP unless they are seen for monthly clinic visits, a considerable undertaking.\\n\\nRegional disparities add yet another problematic layer. The South, with its high Black population and its woefully inadequate public health response to HIV, has become the hotbed of the epidemic among MSM.\\n\\nOut of the top 25 so-called metropolitan statistical areas with the highest rates of diagnosed HIV among MSM, all but four are in the South, according to Rosenberg's research. Rosenberg also recently estimated that 11 percent of all young Black MSM in Atlanta contract HIV every year.\\n\\nUnfortunately, PrEP has tended to make the greatest traction in major urban areas outside the South. And these cities are still often failing their local Black MSM populations with regard to PrEP.\\n\\nIn San Francisco and New York, which have undertaken concerted efforts to promote PrEP as a part of elaborate and costly epidemic-ending enterprises, reports from numerous sources show that use of Truvada among HIV-negative Black MSM remains disproportionately low compared with local infection rates among that demographic.\\n\\nAs HIV diagnosis rates continue an impressive fall in San Francisco, likely thanks in part to an estimated 12,500 residents going on PrEP, the number of diagnoses among African Americans has remained stable of late.\\n\\nSurveys have also found that Black MSM lag behind whites in their awareness of PrEP and, at least by some accounts, their willingness to take it. In various real-world studies of PrEP among MSM, adherence to the daily Truvada regimen has been poorer among Blacks than whites. By the end of one yearlong study of very high-risk 18- to 22-year-old MSM, African-American participants had all but abandoned taking Truvada.\\n\\nIn addition, Black MSM may be less likely than whites to stick to the schedule of quarterly medical visits required to maintain a PrEP prescription.\\n\\n***\\n\\nHarlem United, an HIV-focused community health center serving a largely Black community in Harlem and the South Bronx, has sunk $600,000 into a two-year promotional campaign to drive up local interest in Truvada as HIV prevention. Posters featuring PrEP tablets on the stuck-out tongues of grinning New Yorkers beckon with the flirty tagline SWALLOW THIS.\\n\\nFor all that money spent, few in real life have offered their own tongues in response, at least to Harlem United. A disappointing 60 to 90 people access PrEP from the organization at any given time.\\n\\nFrom the way Jason Cianciotto, vice president of policy and advocacy for Harlem United, categorizes the challenge at hand, it's going to take a lot more than advertising to work against the societal forces impeding PrEP's success among Black MSM in New York City and across the country.\\n\\nSlow uptake is intrinsically linked to larger issues around why Black MSM have higher rates of HIV, experience higher rates of incarceration, lower education, domestic violence, higher unemployment and housing instability, Cianciotto says.\\n\\nRaul Mejia, a PrEP specialist at Callen-Lorde, goes further. In addition to how inaccessible PrEP is, Black MSM are still Black people and as such deal with life-threatening issues such as racism, internalized homophobia, homophobia, hyper-masculinity, violence and police brutality on a daily basis, he says. This needs to be taken into account when attempting to serve this community.\\n\\nA critical problem facing PrEP promotion among African Americans is their overall disenfranchisement from the health care system. Frequently a by-product of poverty and unemployment, this alienation from what many progressives argue is a basic American right is often compounded by an accident of geography. Those with very low incomes who live in the 19 states with governments that have refused to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act (ACA, or Obamacare)—including almost all the states in the Republican-dominated South—have been summarily excluded from the recent mass expansion of the health care rolls.\\n\\nIf the Trump administration succeeds in its pledge to roll back Obamacare, African Americans would be particularly vulnerable to the wave of medical disenfranchisement that would devastate the country unless Congress passes robust legislation to properly replace the outgoing president's crowning achievement.\\n\\nIn addition, the insidious legacy of the Tuskegee syphilis experiment continues to wreak havoc on the overall health of African Americans more than 40 years after the sadistic, decades-long program was finally exposed. An inherited culture of mistrust of the medical establishment and propensity for medical conspiracy theories may leave Black MSM wary of HIV prevention that comes in a pill and requires routine medical care. Furthermore, many African Americans are raised with a strong bias against going to the doctor for anything but serious illness.\\n\\nChivas Michael, a PrEP navigator at CrescentCare Health in New Orleans, recalls the chilling words of an African-American client whose grandmother picked cotton as a sharecropper: He said, 'My grandmother told me that when you were sick, you were taken out to the back like a mule and shot.'\\n\\nIt's something in the water in the community that's become cultural: 'My arm isn't falling off, so I shouldn't go to the doctor,' Michael says.\\n\\nExperts believe that Black MSM may also shy away from seeking out PrEP for fear that having a Truvada prescription would expose them to scorn from homophobic family members. Black MSM considering PrEP may face further internal conflicts if they don't identify as gay. Fears that physicians holding the keys to a PrEP prescription may be yet another source of stigma and sex shaming could be quite justified in some cases, given the pervasive ignorance about PrEP in the medical field. And even though there are often ways to access PrEP for free, Black MSM may automatically assume that such an expensive drug is out of their reach financially and not even explore payment options.\\n\\nMichael, who is on PrEP, doesn't mince words when addressing the larger societal context into which PrEP has arrived. There is something very imperialistic about the way that PrEP has been rolled out, he says, because you can't get a young man of color to care about whether or not he contracts HIV when he doesn't feel good enough about himself to care about whether or not he lives or dies.\\n\\nAnd so it is a very—pardon the pun—tough pill to swallow, Michael continues. The public health community, we have to address helping people feel comfortable doing simple things like leaving their turning signal on too long, he says, alluding to Black men's fear of aggressive policing.\\n\\n***\\n\\nMany of the impediments to PrEP's uptake among Black MSM have also long plagued efforts to engage HIV-positive African Americans in care for the virus. Such parallels raise the question of whether the leadership behind PrEP's introduction failed to rely on basic intuition to anticipate PrEP's anemic rollout among Black MSM.\\n\\nAccording to LaRon Nelson, PhD, FNP, an assistant professor of nursing at the University of Rochester, the structure of the major studies responsible for the advent of PrEP did not prioritize investigating how Truvada could most successfully address the pressing needs of Black MSM.\\n\\nOf course, the initial clinical trials among MSM were first and foremost charged with proving that PrEP worked for MSM as a whole, rather than answering more nuanced questions about promoting uptake and adherence among a particularly high-risk subgroup.\\n\\nStill, the fact remains that the MSM study populations of the global iPrEx study of PrEP and its open-label extension (OLE) phase, as well as the subsequent U.S.-based PrEP Demonstration Project, were all made up of less than 10 percent African Americans.\\n\\nAs for the leadership of these three pivotal studies, out of the more than 50 authors of the associated published papers, none were African-American men. Neither of the iPrEx studies had a single Black author, while just two Black women are listed among the PrEP Demo Project paper's authors.\\n\\nIn this world, skin color is a category that shapes your experience, says Nelson, who is one of the four Black researchers at the helm of a recent study that, promisingly, has had initial success supporting PrEP uptake and adherence among African-American MSM. When you don't have diversity on your scientific team, those kinds of experiences are never brought to the table to form study designs, what questions you can ask, how questions get asked.\\n\\nThe head of iPrEx, Robert M. Grant, MD, MPH, a professor at the University of California, San Francisco, School of Medicine, all but acknowledges that his team was indeed ill suited to determine how to help PrEP succeed among Black MSM. Asked over email whether more research is needed into how better to promote PrEP uptake and adherence among Black MSM, he replies, No, not in my opinion and not in the way that research is usually funded. Does anyone really need white research network chairs and NIH leaders deciding what Black people want or need to know?\\n\\nA second wave of research has risen up to answer such questions, just as workers in clinics, nonprofits and the more progressive public health departments around the country have undertaken an extensive process of trial and error to see just what might be the magic formula needed to help PrEP succeed among Black MSM.\\n\\nThe solutions with the greatest promise tend to share a theme familiar from HIV care strategies for African Americans: taking care of the whole person. This means seeking to address the many life challenges, or so-called structural barriers, standing in the way of Black MSM using PrEP successfully, including accessing food, housing and employment, coping with racism and homophobia, and obtaining health insurance.\\n\\nWe're not just interested in them as a possible risk for HIV infection, says Nelson of his researchers' method of giving referrals to mental health services or other groups that could help study participants with myriad needs. We're interested in them as a human being. We're trying to help them figure out a way to live in this world.\\n\\nOf course, wraparound services and other forms of PrEP outreach aren't necessarily cheap; widespread use of PrEP among Black MSM will likely come with a much higher overall price tag than for their white peers.\\n\\nThe CDC, for one, is stepping up to the plate. PrEP promotion among Black MSM is a central focus of two major multiyear awards exceeding $300 million that the CDC has granted to health departments and social service groups in high-impact cities nationwide.\\n\\nHyman Scott, MD, MPH, medical director of Bridge HIV at the San Francisco Department of Public Health, is optimistic that the ever-scrappy national HIV prevention community will find a way to harness the power of PrEP among Black MSM.\\n\\nI think that we will reach a tipping point in the next few years, Scott says. But the faster we can reach this, the better. The racial and ethnic disparities in HIV infections among Black MSM necessitate a rapid approach.\\n\\nThis could be a pivotal moment, says Callen-Lorde's Mejia, to transform health care to work with and for Black communities and be able to limit the historical marginalization that has existed in this community in relationship to health care.\\n\\nThe stakes couldn't be higher. The health and well-being of tens of thousands of the most marginalized members of society hang in the balance, as does the promise that Black lives really do matter."}

{"original": "Alst via Getty Images A new study found that television advertising for unhealthy snacks and sugary drinks targeted to black viewers is up 50 percent from four years ago.\\n\\nCompanies that deal in the unhealthiest of foods are targeting television advertising at black and Hispanic youths, according to a new study, even after many of those corporations pledged their commitment to promoting healthier eating.\\n\\nFood companies spent $11 billion on television ads in 2017, and 80 percent of that, about $8.8 billion, was spent on their unhealthiest offerings ― sugary soda, fast food, candy and unhealthy snacks. What's more, black teens are more than twice as likely as white teens to see commercials for these items, the study found.\\n\\nThe report — released by the Rudd Center for Food Policy & Obesity at the University of Connecticut and co-produced by the Rudd Center, the Council on Black Health at Drexel University and Salud America! at the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio — looked at 2017 syndicated Nielsen market research for its findings.\\n\\nThis year's report follows up on research done in 2015, and compared with four years ago, television advertising for unhealthy snacks and sugary drinks targeted to black viewers is up 50 percent.\\n\\nThese food ads push foods that contribute to obesity, only worsening a public health crisis that disproportionately affects communities of color, said study author Jennifer Harris of the Rudd Center.\\n\\nIt's perpetuating the disparities that we all already see in kids' health. Kids are very vulnerable to advertising, much more so than adults, she said. It's making the public health community's job so much more difficult. It's making parents' jobs so much more difficult.\\n\\nTargeted marketing to low-income kids and kids of color is a significant public health threat, Jim Krieger, the executive director of Healthy Food America, told HuffPost. He decried food companies' predatory marketing practices.\\n\\nNo one spends billions of dollars if they don't expect it to have an impact, Harris concurred.\\n\\nThe big issue is you follow the money. Dr. Christopher Bolling, chairman, American Academy of Pediatrics section on obesity\\n\\nDr. Christopher Bolling, who chairs the American Academy of Pediatrics section on obesity, argued that this racial targeting comes down to a common denominator: poverty. He said kids of lower socioeconomic status are more likely to live in food deserts ― where healthy foods are largely inaccessible and there are the most fast food restaurants per capita. And African-Americans under 18 are three times as likely to live in poverty as white youths. Hispanic children are more than twice as likely as white kids to live in poverty, according to 2017 data from the Annie E. Casey Foundation.\\n\\nThe big issue is you follow the money, he said. The [companies] get better return for their buck by advertising heavily in those areas, as that's where people live and are going to have access to those foods.\\n\\nThe Rudd report also found that companies didn't spend any money to advertise healthy food options of their products on Spanish-language television.\\n\\nIt's just really tough when the cheapest thing to get adequate calories is through junk food, said Rafael Perez-Escamilla, a professor at the Yale School of Public Health. This is not about personal choice when there is no availability there.\\n\\nThese ad dollars are devastating in light of the ongoing obesity epidemic in America, which affects almost 26 percent of Hispanic children and 22 percent of black youths, compared with 14 percent of white children, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\\n\\nAnd attracting children at an early age makes them permanent customers by fixing their taste preferences, which are incredibly difficult to alter, Perez-Escamilla added.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen you have companies going after toddlers and infants, it's insane, he said. Once you hook people ― especially starting with young children, which is very upsetting ― essentially you start training them not only on your brand but on how sweet, how salty, how caloric they're going to like [their food] as they grow.\\n\\nAfter the first Rudd report on food advertising spending disparities for black and Hispanic youths was released in 2015, a number of companies — like Coca-Cola, Yum! Brands (which owns Taco Bell and KFC), Hershey and PepsiCo — announced corporate responsibility initiatives to promote health and wellness, as well as sponsorships. Yet since then, overall food-related spending on black television programming aimed at a black audience grew by 50 percent from 2013 to 2017.\\n\\nThe truth of the matter is the [companies] have plenty of opportunity to self-police and self-regulate, and over and over again we're seeing it just doesn't work. Rafael Perez-Escamilla, professor at the Yale School of Public Health\\n\\nHarris said that the self-policing and responsibility initiatives that major corporations promised after the last report are clearly not having the desired effect. Nor are they being extended to consumers of color, the report said.\\n\\nYou can now understand this is a trend, Perez-Escamilla said. The truth of the matter is the [companies] have plenty of opportunity to self-police and self-regulate, and over and over again we're seeing it just doesn't work.\\n\\nHe argued it was time to take another look at sugar taxes or follow Chile's example of cracking down on unhealthy eating. The country recently instituted strict marketing and labeling laws that make sugar and other unhealthy content abundantly clear.\\n\\nBut he warned that the current political environment ― one in which Donald Trump's administration has loosened health restrictions on school lunches and fought sugar taxes ― did not bode well for progress.\\n\\nBolling echoed those fears, saying, It scares me to death.\\n\\nFor Krieger, while there are limited options at a federal level to combat such marketing, he's heartened by new advertising attempts to counter the onslaught of unhealthy food ads ― much like the ads against tobacco that have proliferated on the airwaves in recent years.\\n\\nCombine that with the seven U.S. cities that have enacted sugary-drink taxes, he said, and there are reasons to be optimistic.\\n\\nBut for Perez-Escamilla, studies like this just reiterate how the U.S. continues to ignore the severity of its obesity crisis.\\n\\nChange is voluntary, he stressed. It's not going to stop unless we deal with it."}
{"original": "Anyone who studies The Wealth Of Nations hoping to glean insights on the mysteries and mechanics of the stock market will be disappointed. Adam Smith didn't discuss stock exchanges anywhere in the 1,100-plus pages of his foundational capitalist treatise. Nor did Karl Marx feel compelled to include the stock market among the damning contradictions and irrationalities of the capitalist system documented in Das Kapital.\\n\\nThe bestselling economics textbook ever written ― Paul Samuelson's adventurously titled Economics ― devotes just five of its 608 pages to the stock market, drawing the unhelpful conclusion: Anyone who can accurately predict the future course of business will prosper, but there is no such person.\\n\\nYet nothing captivates Americans like the stock market. We gape at the great fortunes won and lost on the exchanges, and broadcast the Dow Jones' minor movements on the nightly news. This week's wild swings in the market have alternately thrilled and alarmed us.\\n\\nThe stock market is a good story ― one of the best. But it doesn't mean what most people think it does. The stock market is not an important measure of national well-being, productive capacity or material wealth. It isn't even a reliable gauge for the health of specific companies, and is only tangentially related to helping them raise capital. The most iconic contemporary capitalist institution is, in truth, inessential to the operation of capitalism itself. The stock market, in the words of the late British economist John Maynard Keynes, is merely the outcome of the mass psychology of a large number of ignorant individuals.\\n\\nThe basics: A stock exchange is where people go to buy and sell shares of corporations. Buying stock gives you an ownership stake in a company, but this stake itself has no inherent value. It doesn't entitle you to proceeds from the firm's earnings, or provide you with a stream of revenue. The stock is worth whatever you can get somebody else to pay for it.\\n\\nCompanies issue stock to raise money for personnel, equipment, research and everything else that goes into providing goods and services. But after the stock is issued, its price is no longer directly involved in corporate finance. A company doesn't see any additional revenue when its stock price increases, or lose cash when it falls. Stock prices are determined by bidders in the stock market ― whatever a willing buyer and seller agree on ― and the profits and losses on stock accrue to those speculators.\\n\\nSpencer Platt via Getty Images Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange on Feb. 6 during a wild day of market swings.\\n\\nWe like to think that stock prices are closely connected to events in the real world, and that the values the market assigns are the concrete, reliable assessments of experts. As the market has rocketed this way and that this week, the commentariat has scrambled into action to explain the deeper meaning. Money magazine attributed Monday's sell-off to new inflation data. MarketWatch told its readers to keep their eye on the yield curve of Treasury bonds. The Guardian, with a bit more precision, explained that investors expect higher interest rates from the Fed.\\n\\nBut none of this is really true. When Keynes bemoaned the ignorance of stock traders more than 80 years ago, he wasn't insulting their education. He was pointing out that any precise value judgments about a company's future prospects require knowledge of the future ― something nobody possesses.\\n\\nA fall in oil prices might signal a profit boost for a shipping company, but not if political instability disrupts its trade route. The meaning and value of each new piece of data that traders evaluate is dependent on a flood of unknowable future data.\\n\\nThe point is that stock traders don't respond to new information, they respond to each other. When they bid on stock prices, traders aren't stating their beliefs about the true value of a company, but making inferences about how to play the reactions of other traders, who, in turn, are doing the same thing. When corporate earnings come in unexpectedly high, traders expect the stock to go up and bid accordingly. It has very little to do with a company's long-term or even near-term prospects. It's just what people do.\\n\\nThis means that the value of a company's stock, while based on an enormous amount of information, is inherently unstable and essentially arbitrary.\\n\\nAt the moment, a lot of people believe that the stock market is overvalued ― although this idea itself wrongly assumes there is some real stock market value that the market has pulled away from. Years of low interest rates from the Federal Reserve have discouraged people from buying interest-bearing bonds and spurred purchases of stock instead. When the GOP cut corporate taxes, it created the prospect of companies paying out dividends to shareholders or buying back stock to drive up the price. The Fed is now steadily raising interest rates, and plenty of stock experts think traders have gotten a little carried away with tax-cut enthusiasm. And so, while the economic data is pretty good, there is a consensus in some quarters that the market is due for dip.\\n\\nThis doesn't necessarily tell us anything about the real world, so more cautious economic analysts like Neil Irwin at The New York Times urge their readers to focus not on stock price swings, but on economic fundamentals ― things like employment, wages and interest rates ― in assessing the country's economic prospects. And if the stock market were, in fact, nothing more than a lightly regulated casino, this would be the end of the story.\\n\\nBut over the past half-century, we have instead imbued the stock market with an almost cosmic significance. We use stock prices to evaluate the performance of corporate executives. Business schools teach aspiring young men and women that shareholder value is the only appropriate pursuit for corporate leaders.\\n\\nBecause the business world believes stock prices reflect deep metaphysical truths about the state of commerce, big movements in the stock market do, in fact, affect real-world decisions about trade. Even if its revenues are strong, a company might pull back on major investments in the face of a declining stock market, worried about pessimism over corporate prospects in general. Bankers looking at a stock slump might decide to withhold loans from perfectly responsible businesses. Even if it's an ideal time to upgrade its equipment or expand its operations, a company might decide to be tight-fisted about expenses to prove its fiscal discipline to shareholders when the stock price is low.\\n\\nMost alarming, we have made the financial security of the elderly almost completely dependent on stock market values by making 401k plans and mutual funds the flagship operations of our retirement system. The value of your nest egg is dependent not on your thrift or prudence, but on when you happen to invest, and when you need to cash out.\\n\\nBut even with that, only about half of all Americans own stock, either directly or indirectly through retirement accounts. And the vast majority of stocks ― over 86 percent, according to People's Policy Project President Matt Bruenig ― are owned by the richest 10 percent of households. To the extent that the strange casino of the stock market does, in fact, create wealth, it almost exclusively circulates it among the rich.\\n\\nThe idea of using proceeds from business wealth to secure the well-being of society at large is, however, a good one. Instead of tying wealth to the speculative whims of the stock market, we might bind it directly to the productive activities of business. Instead of having individuals save for retirement by purchasing stock, we could have companies that are turning a profit pay a special dividend into a public fund. We could even call it a tax."}

The IOC has been resolute in its message, although it has a several-month window to decide.\\n\\nHard to imagine this will be defined by the end of May, but it could be, Dr. Ali Khan. an epidemiologist and dean of the College of Public Health at the University of Nebraska, told the AP in an email. Regardless, numerous sick athletes could not lead to a very interesting games.\\n\\nFrom what we know from numerous other mass-gathering events including sporting events, it is very easy to spread diseases worldwide from such events — from meningitis to Zika, Khan added. Besides welcoming athletes and spectators with their tiny microbes, there is and may be ongoing disease in Japan.\\n\\nKazuhiro Tateda, an expert on infectious diseases and a member of a Japanese government panel, said the virus may not die out quickly.\\n\\nUnlike the flu that disappears with warmer weather, the response to the new coronavirus, I think, will have to continue for half a year or a year, Tateda told Japanese broadcaster NHK on Tuesday.\\n\\nThe IOC Financially Prepared\\n\\nThe IOC has ample financial safeguards against cancellation, which has happened only in wartime since the modern Olympics began in 1896. Its latest annual report shows it has almost $2 billion in reserve that could cover running costs until the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing.\\n\\nThe IOC's annual reports show it paid almost $14.4 million in an insurance premium to protect against canceling the 2016 Rio Olympics and $12.8 million for a policy to cover the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea.\\n\\nIOC President Thomas Bach was asked last week after an executive board meeting if the insurance premium has risen to as much as $20 million for a Tokyo policy.\\n\\nI don't know, he replied.

The rest will have to be borne by the IOC.\\n\\nThe IOC controls the Olympics and has wide latitude to act. Its protection is spelled out in the 81-page Host City Contract, signed in 2013 with the city of Tokyo and the Japanese Olympic Committee.\\n\\nThe preamble to the contact states: the Olympic Games are the exclusive property of the IOC which owns all rights ... to their organization, staging, exploitation, broadcasting, recording, representation, reproduction ... whether now existing or developed in the future, throughout the world in perpetuity.\\n\\nThe contract also specifies that the IOC can terminate and withdraw from the city because of a state of war, civil disorder, or boycott ... or if the IOC has reasonable grounds to believe, in its sole discretion, that the safety of participants in the games would be seriously threatened or jeopardized for any reason whatsoever.\\n\\nPHILIP FONG via Getty Images A woman wearing a face mask walks in the tunnel of a metro station with a poster of Miraitowa, official mascot of the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo on March 11, 2020.\\n\\nAthletes most vulnerable\\n\\nVictor Matheson, a sports economist at the College of the Holy Cross in Worcester, Massachusetts, said athletes are the most vulnerable. The Olympics feature 33 sports, and many of the smaller ones have a limited following until games time.\\n\\nFor athletes, their career length isn't long and in many sports success in the Olympics is your one shot at a financial return, Matheson told the AP.\\n\\nMatheson said losses by hotels and other service businesses are unlikely to be insured. The billions on government spending on venues looks like a risky investment. The loss of the Olympics would negate the difficult-to-calculate goodwill that Japan and Tokyo might have won.\\n\\nAn Irish bookmaker is showing odds leaning slightly toward the Olympics not going forward. Odds are 4-6 it will not open on July 24 in Tokyo, and even that it will.\\n\\nTokyo is officially spending $12.6 billion to organize the Olympics, although a national government audit office says it's at least twice that much. The local organizing committee budget of $5.6 billion is private money, with the rest coming from Japanese taxpayers. About $1 billion in the local operating budget is to come from ticket sales, which would be lost if the games go ahead without fans in empty stadiums.\\n\\nSome combination of the IOC, the broadcasters, and the insurers will lose big, Matheson said. That loss is coming out of someone's pocket depending on how all of the contracts are written.\\n\\nAndrew Zimbalist, who teaches economics at Smith College in Northampton, Massachusetts, said some of the venues, such as the $1.43 billion national stadium, would have enduring value.\\n\\nBut virtually none of it would have made the list of the priority public investments, he said in an email to the AP, adding that if the games were canceled, much of the investment would be wasted.\\n\\nGames are on, says IOC\\n\\nThe IOC has said repeatedly the games will go on, and says it relies on advice from the World Health Organization. The WHO, the U.N. health agency, has so far resisted describing the crisis as a pandemic, which could force the IOC's hand. But many experts say that threshold has already been met.\\n\\nMore than 113,000 people have been infected worldwide from the virus, far more than those sickened by SARS, MERS or Ebola in recent years. More than 4,000 have died.\\n\\nFor most people, the new coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia.\\n\\nThe vast majority of people recover from the new virus. According to the WHO, people with mild illness recover in about two weeks. Those with more severe illness may take three to six weeks to recover. In mainland China, where the virus first exploded, more than 80,000 people have been diagnosed and more than 63,000 so far have recovered.\\n\\nAbout 73% of the IOC's income of $5.7 billion in the latest four-year Olympic cycle (2013-2016) was from selling broadcast rights. The U.S. network NBC makes up at least half of the broadcast payments. Another 18% of IOC income is from sponsorships.\\n\\nNBC parent company Comcast said that because of insurance and the way contracts are written, NBC won't suffer losses if the Olympics are canceled. But Comcast CEO Brian Roberts said the company would miss out on ad-driven profits, which were $250 million for the 2016 Rio Olympics. The ad profits for 2020 are expected to be larger.\\n\\nNBC signed a deal to pay $4.38 billion for four Olympics — 2014 through 2020. It has a new agreement to pay $7.75 billion for the following six Olympics — 2022 through 2032.\\n\\nChristopher Chase, an attorney based in New York who specializes in sports, intellectual property and media, said sponsors and broadcasters were unlikely to sue for breach of contracts if the games are not held, or the conditions were changed.\\n\\nChase, a partner in the law firm Frankfurt Kurnit, said many such contracts would have force majeure or changed circumstances clauses that spell out unforeseeable conditions that keep a contract from being fulfilled; these act as a defense for non-performance by either party, but in this case, more likely the event producer.\\n\\nThe IOC, much like other large properties such as FIFA and the NFL, the last thing they want to do is refund fees or lower the cost of what the sponsorship is, Chase told the AP. The last thing they want to do is give any money back or charge less. So typically what they try to do is negotiate some kind of make-good or substitute benefits.\\n\\nOver and above the IOC's major sponsorship deals, local sponsors have paid just over $3 billion to the organizing committee."}

The man asked Trudeau what he was doing about Canada's open border.\\n\\nYou're talking about my freedom and everybody's lives ... everybody who put their life down on the line, and you're saying, 'Eh, it's OK, it won't happen to us,' the man said. It's happening in France and it's happening all over.\\n\\nThe people are saying no, because these two cultures will not mix, the attendee added.\\n\\nThe man specified that the cultures he was talking about were Islam and Christianity ― a statement that elicited boos and heckling from the crowd.\\n\\nThey've openly stated they want to kill us, and you're letting them in, the man told Trudeau.\\n\\nAfter pausing to collect his thoughts, Trudeau said, Canada is a country that was built by immigrants.\\n\\nThe prime minister then delivered a brief history lesson, pointing out that the land had first been home to indigenous First Nations people before waves of Europeans fleeing religious persecution and wars arrived to build better lives for themselves.\\n\\nThese people always want the same thing: To be able to live in peace and raise their families, to create a better future for themselves and their communities, Trudeau said. This is what generations and generations of folks have done in Canada.\\n\\nTrudeau has prioritized increasing Canada's refugee admissions since his earliest days as prime minister. The country has resettled more than 40,000 Syrian refugees since his administration came into power in the fall of 2015. Canada's immigration minister, Ahmed Hussen, said in October that the country hopes to increase annual refugee admissions to 51,700 in 2021, CTV News reported.\\n\\nTrudeau said Thursday that Canada's immigration system owes some of its success to its private refugee sponsorship program, which has long been viewed as the global gold standard for similar community-led efforts. The program allows church groups, families, and other community groups to privately sponsor and help resettle refugees.\\n\\nStudies have shown that Canadians generally have positive attitudes about immigration and believe immigrants have a positive economic impact on their country.\\n\\nTrudeau told the town hall attendee that because of Canada's aging population, it needs new immigrants to help build its future. He refuted the idea that the country has an open border policy, stating that its immigration system does a very good job of performing security and screening checks on new arrivals.\\n\\nThere are always reasons to be concerned and reasons to be worried about someone different arriving in your neighborhood, Trudeau said. What Canadians have always known is that it's better for all of us if we are good neighbors.\\n\\nLeila Nasr, a spokesperson for the National Council of Canadian Muslims, told HuffPost that comments like the attendee's are deeply concerning to the country's Muslims ― especially in light of the Quebec City mosque shooting, which is approaching its second anniversary. The attack, carried out by a white, right-wing extremist, left six people dead.\\n\\nWhile it's important to acknowledge the economic contributions that immigrants make to Canada, Nasr said it's also important to tackle the foundations of Islamophobia by working to create greater cultural understanding between Muslims and non-Muslims.\\n\\nWhen we think about the real implications of the sorts of fears and anxieties the man expressed, we quickly see that Islamophobia cannot be rooted out using simple economic arguments about how Muslims and other immigrants benefit our country, Nasr told HuffPost in an email. We have to do so much more.\\n\\nThis article has been updated with comments from Leila Nasr."}
{"original": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Harold Brown, who as defense secretary in the Carter administration championed cutting-edge fighting technology during a tenure that included the failed rescue of hostages in Iran, has died at age 91.\\n\\nBrown died Friday, said the Rand Corp., the California-based think tank Brown served as a trustee for more than 35 years. His sister, Leila Brennet, said he died at his home in Rancho Santa Fe, California.\\n\\nBrown was a nuclear physicist who led the Pentagon to modernize its defense systems with weapons that included precision-guided cruise missiles, stealth aircraft, advanced satellite surveillance and improved communications and intelligence systems. He successfully campaigned to increase the Pentagon budget during his term, despite skepticism inside the White House and from Democrats in Congress.\\n\\nThat turbulent period included the Soviet Union's invasion of Afghanistan and the Iranian hostage crisis. An effort in April 1980 to rescue the hostages failed when one of the helicopters on the mission struck a tanker aircraft in eastern Iran and crashed, killing eight U.S. servicemen.\\n\\nI considered the failed rescue attempt my greatest regret and most painful lesson learned, Brown wrote in his book Star Spangled Security.\\n\\nASSOCIATED PRESS\\n\\nBrown faced numerous obstacles when he took the job as Pentagon chief, including pressure to reduce the defense budget both from within the administration and from influential congressional Democrats.\\n\\nWhen I became secretary of defense in 1977, the military services, most of all the Army, were disrupted badly by the Vietnam War, he wrote later. There was general agreement that the Soviet Union outclassed the West in conventional military capability, especially in ground forces in Europe.\\n\\nWary of the growing Soviet threat, Brown sought to withstand the pressure to cut defense and, gradually, managed to increase spending.\\n\\nThe constant Cold War competition raged hot during the Carter administration and preoccupied me throughout the four years, Brown wrote. He noted later that the Defense Department budget in real terms was 10 to 12 percent more when we left than when we came in, which he said was not an easy accomplishment.\\n\\nAnd he cited the technological advances in defense systems, especially such weapons systems as precision-guided cruise missiles, stealth aircraft and advanced satellite surveillance.\\n\\nSome of these came to visible fruition 10 years later during Desert Storm, which reversed Saddam Hussein's occupation of Kuwait, he wrote. The Carter administration initiated and developed these programs, the Reagan administration paid for their acquisition in many cases, and the George H.W. Bush administration employed them.\\n\\nBrown later maintained that his extensive work with the Soviets on the arms race was not wasted.\\n\\nWe also reached a specific strategic arms control agreement with the Soviet Union, he wrote. Though never formally ratified, the agreement was adhered to by both parties and limited Soviet threats that our other conventional and nuclear weapons programs were designed to counter.\\n\\nThe acting defense secretary, Patrick Shanahan, said in a statement Saturday that Brown's steady leadership piloted our nation through a consequential segment of the Cold War. His focus on deterrence through a strong nuclear triad facilitated long-term peace and stability in the United States and Europe.\\n\\nShanahan praised Brown for his devoted leadership and lifetime of service.\\n\\nBrown was born in New York City on Sept. 19, 1927, attended public schools and went to Columbia University on an accelerated wartime schedule, receiving an undergraduate degree in physics in 1945 when I was not quite 18, then going to graduate school at Columbia, receiving a doctorate in physics.\\n\\nNot long after graduation he moved to California and went to work on projects that related to the development of plutonium. He then went to work at a nuclear weapons lab. He worked his way up to director of the Lawrence Radiation Laboratory at Livermore in 1960.\\n\\nIn 1961, Defense Secretary Robert McNamara invited him to be director of defense research and engineering in the Kennedy administration. In 1965 he became secretary of the Air Force during the Johnson administration and, as he described it later, served in that role through some of the most difficult and divisive parts of the Vietnam War.\\n\\nAfter the 1968 election put a Republican, Richard Nixon, back in the White House, Brown accepted the position of president at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena serving until he went back into government work and was a delegate to the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks in the 1970s,\\n\\nCarter nominated Brown to be defense secretary in 1977. He was quickly confirmed and served throughout Carter's term. During the 1980 campaign Brown actively defended the Carter administration's policies, speaking frequently on national issues in public.\\n\\nAfter leaving the Pentagon, he remained in Washington, joining the Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies as a visiting professor and later the university's Foreign Policy Institute as chairman. He remained active in matters of national security, including service on the Defense Policy Board, which meets quarterly to offer perspectives to the current secretary of defense. He served as a consultant to many corporations, often as a member of the board of directors.\\n\\nCarter awarded Brown the Presidential Medal of Freedom. President Bill Clinton gave him the Energy Department's Enrico Fermi Award for achievement in science and technology.\\n\\nAt a farewell address from his job as defense secretary, Brown said, Most satisfying of all is that for four years our nation remained at peace despite the world tensions and turmoil that constantly pose challenges to our interest and peace."}
{"original": "TORONTO — The Chinese Flu. The Wuhan virus. The Wuhan coronavirus.\\n\\nThese are some of the names major media outlets have applied to a new illness originating in Wuhan, China whose official name doesn't exactly roll off the tongue — 2019-nCoV.\\n\\nMainstream media more often refer to it as a novel coronavirus or new coronavirus, while tweeters and bloggers have been more willing to posit their own colourful — and often culturally inappropriate — labels.\\n\\nThe World Health Organization says it temporarily dubbed this new virus 2019-nCoV (pronounced 20-19 EN-koh-VEE), a step the WHO employs for very new diseases so that inappropriate names do not become established.\\n\\nASSOCIATED PRESS Passengers arrive at Heathrow Airport in London after the last British Airways flight from China touched down in the UK following an announcement that the airline was suspending all flights to and from mainland China on Wednesday.\\n\\nDespite those intentions, the absence of a snappy handle is the very reason we've seen an array of monikers that are not always politically correct or accurate, say observers.\\n\\nThe problem is it's (2019-nCoV) a little clunky to use and people aren't really going to adopt it. And the longer the WHO wait before they come up with a conventional name that people use, the greater the risk that they'll lose control over naming it, says Steven Taylor, a clinical psychologist and author of The Psychology of Pandemics: Preparing for the next global outbreak of infectious disease.\\n\\nTaylor says names in general hold great psychological importance because they operate on several levels: they impart information about the disease, can imply the degree of threat involved, and invite the general public to learn about often complex health issues.\\n\\nBut they can also cause unnecessary cultural, regional or economic offence. Wuhan is already suffering a financial blow from the quarantine and a name like Wuhan Flu is unlikely to help.\\n\\nCarlos Osorio / Reuters Pedestrians walk in the Chinatown district of downtown Toronto on Tuesday.\\n\\nIn the spirit of the Hippocratic Oath first, do no harm, experts agree the name of a new disease should not single out ethnic or racial groups, geographic locales, trade and industry groups, or negatively impact animal welfare.\\n\\nThis is the presiding principle of the WHO's 2015 guidelines on naming infectious diseases, which stress the importance of picking names that don't offend while balancing science, communication, and policy.\\n\\nThat's a difficult bar to meet, says Nicola Bragazzi, a medical doctor and research chair at York University's Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council. Just look at the substantial number of names in wide circulation that are inspired by towns, cities, people, animals, jobs and groups: the Spanish flu, Legionnaires disease, Japanese encephalitis, and bird flu, among them.\\n\\nControversies abound, but these names are so well-established in the public consciousness there's no way to roll them back now, says Bragazzi.\\n\\nEven inadvertent offence is tough to avoid, he adds, noting that norovirus drew ire for unintentionally containing the widespread Japanese family name Noro. And this was after the diarrhea-causing flu bug was initially named the Norwalk Agent, in reference to the town of Norwalk, Ohio, where an outbreak emerged among schoolchildren in 1968.\\n\\nCarlos Osorio / Reuters Travellers wear masks at Pearson airport arrivals on Jan. 25.\\n\\nIn 2011, the flap pushed the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses — which oversees the creation and naming of virus species, genus and families — to strongly encourage the media, national health authorities and scientific community to use the name Norwalk virus instead.\\n\\nNaming viruses after the scientists who discovered them would seem to be a safe bet — such as the Epstein-Barr virus, named after Michael Anthony Epstein and Yvonne Barr. But this too, was problematic, because it failed to acknowledge the contributions of a third scientist, Bert Achong, says Bragazzi.\\n\\nAccording to the World Health Organization guidelines, most names of viruses sound inappropriate, he says, suggesting it may be best to stick to characteristics of the illness rather than where it originated or who it first affected.\\n\\nDifficult to find a suitable name\\n\\nThis is tough for something as new as 2019-nCoV, whose exceedingly clinical moniker was derived from the few irrefutable facts at hand: It emerged in 2019, it is novel or new, and it is part of a family of coronaviruses that can cause a variety of conditions.\\n\\nOf course the problem with calling something novel is that it becomes obsolete as soon as another new pathogen of that type appears, says Taylor.\\n\\nAllison McGeer, director of the Infectious Diseases Epidemiology Research Unit at Mount Sinai Hospital and a professor at the University of Toronto's Dalla Lana School of Public Health, says there are bigger issues to contend with than a virus' name.\\n\\nThe truth of matter is that we call bacteria by very complex and difficult names and we live with that all the time, says McGeer, who contracted SARS when she was on the front lines of the Toronto outbreak in 2003.\\n\\nI understand the desire for acronyms that roll off your tongue, but it's not necessarily what we should be doing.\\n\\nMcGeer says there is an international coronovirus group that has named new illnesses — including SARS, or Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome — but there is no formal body that is responsible for new human viruses and it's not clear when, or if, a new name for 2019-nCoV is coming.\\n\\nThe WHO says final names for diseases are set by the International Classification of Diseases.\\n\\nMost agree that if you want a new disease to resonate with the general public its name should be memorable, short and easy to pronounce, such as rabies or polio.\\n\\nIt all gets down to what you want your name to do, or what impact you want it to have on people. If you give it a technical name, it's only going to have meaning to the people who are involved in the study and treatment of the disease, says Taylor, also a professor in the University of British Columbia's psychiatry department.\\n\\nIf we want people to stop eating wild animals, which are a reservoir of viruses, (then) you can call it something like 'Wild Meat Coronavirus.'\\n\\nThere's little chance that would fly, Taylor quickly adds, noting that name could lead some fearful citizens to start culling wild animals to avoid the virus's spread.\\n\\nNaming a new virus in this day and age is no easy task, he agrees.\\n\\nThere are all kinds of complexities that need consideration."}

For the next land mine-filled arena Dreamers face is at the state and local level.\\n\\nRight now, Florida is considering passing a sweeping anti-immigrant piece of legislation known as HB9. Florida House Speaker Richard Corcoran (R) sponsored the bill that is designed to serve as a two-prong political strategy for his own benefit. First, HB9 is nothing but an unapologetic attack on immigrant communities, currently being promoted via an unapologetically racist television ad, aimed at capitalizing on Trump's and Miller's white nationalist view of America. The second goal of HB9 is to paint Corcoran as a no-nonsense conservative, allowing him to boost his political image even if his xenophobic bill tanks in the state legislature.\\n\\nI have written extensively about why Corcoran's bill would hurt Florida's tourism and agricultural economy. Further, it is yet another attempt from the Republican Party to supercharge Trump's desire to deport immigrants and people of color. Local organizations across the state, led by the WE ARE FLORIDA! campaign, are ensuring that state legislators get an earful about the destructive effects HB9 could have on immigrant communities if signed into law.\\n\\nIf Congress doesn't pass legislation to protect Dreamers, we will become targets for Trump's unchained deportation force at the state, local and federal levels.\\n\\nThe state of Texas is already feeling the consequences of the anti-immigrant law known as SB4.

If Congress doesn't pass legislation to protect Dreamers, we will become targets for Trump's unchained deportation force at the state, local and federal levels.\\n\\nBut states are not the only ones who can fight against Trump. Several local communities like Lucas County, Ohio, have passed resolutions in support of Dreamers.\\n\\nThe only way to ensure that we are protected against Trump's mass deportation efforts is to elect progressive leaders who are willing to stand up for immigrant communities. Otherwise, we risk putting Dreamers in the path of Thomas Homan, the acting director of ICE, who did not mince any words when expressing his views on legislation protecting Dreamers from deportation. If we get a clean DACA bill, shame on all of us, Homan told a crowd earlier this week.\\n\\nWhat Trump, Miller, Homan and the rest of the anti-immigrant restrictionists are overlooking is that an overwhelming majority of Americans still support allowing Dreamers to stay in the country. If congressional Republicans fail to enact sensible protections for Dreamers, these ordinary citizens, legal permanent residents and immigrants will hold them accountable ― and step up where necessary.\\n\\nJuan Escalante is an immigrant advocate and online strategist who has been fighting for the Dream Act and pro-immigration policies at all levels of government for the past 10 years."}

{"original": "There is plenty of data suggesting that education, particularly a college or university degree, leads to higher incomes. Less is known about the impact of higher education -- and specific schools -- on socioeconomic mobility, that is, moving from one rung of the income ladder to another.\\n\\nA new study by The Equality of Opportunity Project sheds valuable light on this question: Which colleges in America contribute the most to helping students climb the income ladder?\\n\\nMany Elite Colleges Have Chosen Affordability Over Access\\n\\nResearchers found that poor students who attend top (i.e. selective or elite) colleges do about as well in terms of income as their rich classmates, but many fewer lower income students attend these institutions. According to a New York Times article on the study, at 38 colleges in America, including five in the Ivy League - Dartmouth, Princeton, Yale, Penn and Brown - more students come from the top 1 percent of the income scale than from the entire bottom 60 percent.\\n\\nFurther, less than one-half of 1 percent of children from the bottom fifth of American families attend an elite college; less than half attend any college at all.\\n\\nAs Danny Yagan, one of the study authors, noted, Free tuition only helps if you can get in.\\n\\nThe authors of Mobility Report Cards: The Role of Colleges in Intergenerational Mobility tracked more than 30 million students born between 1980 and 1991, linking anonymized tax returns to attendance records for almost every college in America.\\n\\nThere are a number of interesting reflections on higher education policy that emerge from the interpretation of this data. The New York Times reports, These patterns are important because previous research has found that there are many highly qualified lower-income students who did not attend selective colleges--and because the low- and middle-income students who do attend top colleges fare almost as well as rich students.\\n\\nPut a different way, lower-income students end up earning almost as much on average as affluent students who attend the same college.\\n\\nThe New York Times also concluded, most Americans remain on a similar place on the income distribution graph from their late 30s through the end of their careers.\\n\\nCollege Mobility Rate Measures Graduates Movement Up Income Ladder\\n\\nThe researchers in the new study also developed a new data point -- a college's mobility rate - which combines a college's share of students from lower-income families with its success in moving them into a higher permanent level on an income earning's chart. A disparate collection of mainly mid-tier public colleges, including California State University - Los Angeles and the City University of New York System -- and not the Ivies -- have the best college mobility rates.\\n\\nOf course, any number of factors can come into play to affect these conclusions. Most Ivies are mid-sized institutions, for example, so the impact that they have on national rates reflects the aggregate number of students that they contribute to the national findings.\\n\\nStill, the findings raise important policy questions as American higher education continues to evolve and re-invent itself. For example:\\n\\nDo elite colleges have a special mission to educate broadly across all income levels as the justification for their continuing status as non-profits?\\n\\nIf so, should they be held any more or less accountable for their ability to do so given their sticker prices, the size of their endowments, and their published statements on institutional mission?\\n\\nWhat is more important: affordability or access?\\n\\nIt is widely accepted that public colleges typically educate the most first-generation students and those from the lowest socioeconomic class. In the race for students, do public and private colleges and universities really educate different students by income level or is the pool of applicants from which they select similar in 2017?\\n\\nIs there differentiation by income between public and private flagship research universities or between the research universities and four-year predominantly undergraduate institutions?\\n\\nDo non-elite institutions serve students from lower socioeconomic classes successfully?\\n\\nIf so, given the level of preparedness affecting the social, familial, cultural, psychological, and financial challenges that these students face, should different standards apply to admission, retention, and graduation rates across colleges and universities?\\n\\nIn fact, should a college's accountability be measured more fairly against the challenges that the college faces when working with students who require more attention than similar students at highly selective colleges?\\n\\nIs it the money that matters most in the free college tuition plans now being proposed, when retention and graduation rates do not support greater student success if only the financial barriers are lessened?\\n\\nIs a partial solution to design policies that better reflect institutional missions, intentions, and projected outcomes?\\n\\nShould state and federal governments set education, including higher education, as a much higher priority in planning and funding cycles given rising income inequality in America?\\n\\nFor the past several years, consumer and political polling have relied on high tuition sticker prices, rising debt, and anecdotal personal stories to shift the blame of higher education's failures on to America's colleges and universities.\\n\\nThere is plenty of blame to go around with a good share of it borne by higher education. But politicians and their policy planners must also accept their own failures to read the research, understand and anticipate the demographic shifts, and assess the impact of technology on American society.\\n\\nThere is a persistent and growing problem with income inequality in the United States.\\n\\nRather than police American higher education, perhaps our political, social and economic leadership should find a way to partner with colleges and universities on developing solutions. It begins by doing the homework necessary to ask the right questions.\\n\\nThis article first appeared on the Edvance Foundation blog."}

{"original": "I watched with the rest of the world this month as more than 150 women and girls gave stomach-turning accounts of mental and physical abuse at the hands of former USA Gymnastics doctor Larry Nassar.\\n\\nI also listened as multiple former gymnasts accused Nassar's longtime colleague John Geddert, head coach at Twistars USA in Lansing, Michigan, of mental and emotional abuse. Geddert required his gymnasts to see Nassar for treatment, some victims said, with one describing Nassar as the Bonnie to Geddert's Clyde.\\n\\nThen I helped my 9-year-old daughter, Luisa, pack her monogrammed Twistars travel bag and put on her matching Twistars warmups. I drove her to the airport, hugged her goodbye and entrusted her safety to several Twistars coaches as she and her team flew to Orlando, Florida, for a meet.\\n\\nHow could I?\\n\\nHOW DOES JOHN GEDDERT STILL HAVE A JOB???????? HOW HAS TWISTARS NOT BEEN SHUT DOWN??? — Lindsay Gibbs (@linzsports) January 22, 2018\\n\\nLuisa was supposed to be a skater, like her two older siblings. But she sought an escape from hours spent shivering in the bleachers at The Summit Sports & Ice Complex, and she found one on the other side of the facility: Twistars. As a toddler, she'd watch the big girls (the oldest of whom were only 17 or 18) flip, twist and soar. I want to do that, she'd say, and by age 4 she was out there with them, bouncing around in the little kids' area and making googly eyes at the big girls, some of whom were gymnastics celebrities.\\n\\nGeddert was the head coach of the United States' 2012 Olympic women's gymnastics team and the personal coach of 2011 world champion Jordyn Wieber. The U.S. women's team was heavily favored to win gold in London, and Wieber was a favorite for the all-around title, which was won by Gabby Douglas. Wieber inspired the awe of everyone in the gym.\\n\\nBoth those women have since revealed that Nassar sexually abused them.\\n\\nMy wife and I had been warned about Geddert's intensity from friends who had seen it firsthand. He was controlling, demanding, domineering, severe. He moved deliberately about the gym with impeccably slicked-back hair and an avian, all-seeing gaze. He pushed kids to and past their limits. If and when they broke, he had plenty of hopefuls lined up to take their place. He once told parents that he avoided coaching the younger kids because he tended to run them off.\\n\\nTwistars is a huge gym, with scores of kids enrolled at any given moment. Hundreds of kids would come and go over the years, most of whom would never be personally coached by Geddert. So we'd figured it would be years before our bouncy little grade-schooler would have to work with him directly.\\n\\nWe thought we were going in with our eyes wide open. But we never saw Larry Nassar coming.\\n\\nLansing is a hub city with nearly half a million residents within its ring of suburbs and exurbs, but it has a small-town feel. Nassar epitomized the pillar of the community cliche; he was involved in lots of local organizations and had a wide network of supporters and admirers. Even with sexual assault charges pending, he ran for the school board and got 21 percent of the vote. That means 2,730 of our neighbors voted to put the most prolific child predator in known history on the school board. When the Indy Star first reported that Rachael Denhollander had accused Nassar of abuse, the community closed ranks around him with breathtaking speed. As we saw last week, the full extent of Nassar's depredation was revolting. His reputation and the army of supporters who enabled him and defended him made it possible for Nassar to abuse so many girls for so long.\\n\\nJEFF KOWALSKY via Getty Images Rachael Denhollander at the sentencing hearing for Larry Nassar on January 24, 2018 in Lansing, Michigan.\\n\\nWe asked ourselves, over and over: Was our child abused? Could our child possibly have been abused? Did abuse occur at Twistars? Could anyone at the facility have known Nassar was abusing athletes? Did anyone to whom I'm entrusting my child's safety give a pass to the most prolific child predator our society has ever seen?\\n\\nFor months, the answers kept coming back: no, no, no, no and no.\\n\\nYour child's safety is, and has always been, the number one priority with our staff and management, Geddert wrote in an email to parents eight days after the Indy Star published its first piece naming Nassar. The email stated that policies and training were in place to prevent abuse. After Nassar's child pornography indictment and subsequent lawsuit, Twistars sent us another email saying employees were shocked and disappointed. They denied all allegations that Twistars had done anything wrong, simply because we didn't.\\n\\nWhen you trust your child to what you think is the best coaching and medical care money can buy, the violation of that trust is as shocking as it is horrifying.\\n\\nTwistars trumpets its role in coaching stars. The lobby displays framed pictures of, and news articles about, Jordyn Wieber. There's a banner proclaiming the gym her home. The walls are covered with Olympic memorabilia, and a banner for every time Twistars was named the No. 1 gym in the country. The message seems to be clear: This is a world-class training facility, so the only thing stopping you from being Wieber is you. But in decades of coaching, even Geddert has produced only one Wieber.\\n\\nOn another wall, you'll see the more realistic goal for most gymnasts: group pictures of Twistars athletes who have gone on to compete in college, wearing smiles and sweatshirts from the universities they'll attend. That's the wall Luisa hopes to be on someday.\\n\\n\\n\\nLuisa trains 18 hours a week, not counting six hours of extra conditioning. Still, she usually wants to go to open gym on Sundays so that she can work at her own pace on whatever skills she wants (or just goof around on the trampoline). We don't make her work this hard. In fact, we can't stop her from working this hard. She loves it. It's who she is.\\n\\nWhen Luisa needed to learn to jump from the low bar to the high bar, a scary skill that marks a progression to a more advanced kind of bars routine, she simply did it over and over until she got it.\\n\\nYoung athletes draw on all sorts of motivations: dreams of Olympic glory or millions of dollars, love of the sport, desire to win, the need for team camaraderie, the search for an identity, fear of letting down the adults in their lives. The same is true for parents: There are myriad reasons parents push their kids toward, or let their kids pull them into, the world of gymnastics. For me and my wife, it's the joy on Luisa's face when she does her best, and her almost insatiable drive to make her best better.\\n\\nGymnastics requires an enormous amount of dedication and trust from parents. Training and travel are expensive, and transporting kids to and from practice is time-consuming and complicated. Logistical and financial matters aside, gymnastics injuries can be severe, and the level of trust parents and kids must have in coaches is extreme. At Twistars, as at most gyms, parents sign a terrifying disclaimer listing all the horrible things that could happen to their kids: broken bones, paralysis, death. Those worst-case scenarios tend to flit through the mind when you watch your child hit the springboard or fall off the beam.\\n\\nIf Geddert and other key figures, like Michigan State University coach Kathy Klages, enabled Nassar, the faith and hope and love and dreams of the athletes and parents enabled the enablers.\\n\\nWhen the head coach of one of the most dominant Olympic teams in history tells you his staff is properly trained, you believe it. And when you trust your child to what you think is the best coaching and medical care money can buy, the violation of that trust is as shocking as it is horrifying.\\n\\nBrendan McDermid / Reuters Jordyn Wieber speaks at the sentencing hearing for Larry Nassar on January 19. It was the first time she had publicly identified herself as one of his victims.\\n\\nOver the months in which the allegations against Nassar progressed from one, to a handful, to several, Geddert maintained plausible deniability. But as so many more women came forward, some alleging abuse happened at Twistars, a few of those critical nos ― the nos that had let me and my wife sleep at night ― started turning into maybes.\\n\\nFor Luisa and her teammates, a year and a half of late nights and early mornings and long weekends and intrastate drives elapsed between the Indy Star publishing its story and Nassar's sentencing, at which so many women came forward to tell their stories ― including Wieber, for the first time publicly including herself among the victims. It wasn't until then that the scope of what had happened at the gym became clear. One gymnast said a Twistars coach fractured her hip, and another's testimony described repeated psychological and emotional abuse.\\n\\nMeanwhile, my nine-year-old is halfway across the country just gymnasticsing like crazy and loving every minute of it. pic.twitter.com/ygdDrryaJB — Ty Schalter (@tyschalter) January 19, 2018\\n\\nLuisa placed sixth in beam in Orlando, and her Level 4 team won first place ― just like five of the six Twistars girls squads that competed there. By the time she arrived home, Geddert had been suspended by USA Gymnastics for violations of the Safe Sport Policy. My daughter was safe in her own bed when Geddert sent parents an email announcing he was stepping away from the gym and from the sport.\\n\\nWe don't know what happens next. There's no other gym within reasonable driving distance that can help my daughter achieve her dreams. For us, it's Twistars or nothing.\\n\\nGeddert's wife, Kathryn, is now the sole owner of the gym. The athletes, coaches and parents remaining in the Twistars community ― some of whom are Nassar victims themselves ― will either begin a new era of positivity and respect, or the gym will fail. Likewise, I'd like to think that either USA Gymnastics and the culture of the sport as a whole will be reinvented, or the sport will go away.\\n\\nBut as the rest of the world wonders how on Earth I could possibly keep sending my child to Twistars, I watch her compete, and wonder how on Earth I could possibly stop.\\n\\nTy Schalter is a professional NFL analyst, youth soccer coach and very proud father of three.

{"original": "Lack of professional autonomy is one of the top reasons why people choose to leave teaching--or not to enter the career in the first place. It's a major contributor to America's perennial teacher shortage.\\n\\nWhen the topic of autonomy comes up, I've often heard teachers talk about freedom to make instructional choices in their own classrooms. And that's important.\\n\\nBut what if we took the concept of teacher autonomy one step further? Pressing for collective autonomy--where groups of teachers work collaboratively to make school-level decisions about a variety of factors--has even greater potential to benefit students. And to make teaching a more attractive career path. Given my own experiences as a mother of three and a teacher leadership advocate, I fear that autonomy for individual teachers won't empower them enough to bring forth the school cultures we need for all students to learn.\\n\\nNo classroom should be an island\\n\\nLike 70% of the American public, I trust my children's teachers in their classrooms. I trust them to keep my children safe and to foster educational attainment. I trust them to individualize my children's education as best they can (despite the pressure to teach to the middle and to the test). I trust them to work with me as a partner. By my own measures (and no doubt many others'), my children's teachers are top-notch.\\n\\nBut there's been one thing that's sorely lacking: these teachers haven't been able to overcome the limitations imposed by a system that isolates them from one another.\\n\\nThat's a big problem because students aren't confined to one classroom. Nearly all interact with many teachers and other adults in the course of a day, week, and year. Even elementary schoolers go to physical education or music class with specialty teachers. They work with aides. They go to the lunchroom where they interact cafeteria workers. They go to the front office. And eventually, they go into a new grade level and yet another teacher's classroom. But there are very few connections between these adults for the benefit of my children.\\n\\nEven the best teacher's autonomy in her classroom doesn't mean much when the supervisor on the playground doesn't know my daughter's name, or when her choir teacher isn't aware she is learning to master her social anxiety. Beyond grades and test score, no record of my children's strengths and areas for development is passed from one grade-level teacher to the next (especially in the social realm), or to the principal who makes the final decisions about class placement. That job is left to me, as their parent.\\n\\nAnd these are only the problems of my (privileged) young kids. Many students come to school hungry, lack heat at home, or don't dream of college because they don't believe they will live long enough to attend.\\n\\nExcellent teachers in most schools work to know and serve all students well. But even these teachers lack time and opportunities to share information about challenges (not to mention insights on how best to address them!). The system doesn't incent and support school employees to collaborate as a team in order to build a supportive culture around students' needs.\\n\\nWith collective autonomy, teachers can build bridges\\n\\nBut what could happen if--instead of focusing on their individual autonomy in the classroom--teachers embraced and advocated for collective autonomy? What if teachers asked policymakers, district school boards, charter authorizers, and their unions to create laws and practices that encourage teams of teachers to collaboratively design and run schools?\\n\\nSome have already secured collective autonomy through teacher-powered schools, now located in 15 states across the nation. More than 80 teacher teams are collaboratively making the decisions influencing school and student success--and in turn, they accept accountability for high performance.\\n\\nThe outcomes? Teachers in these schools choose to create student-centered learning programs, and design school policy and practice around the idea that each student must be known and supported across the community.\\n\\nYou can see the difference in how students experience these schools--and in the meetings where teachers determine their collective strategy for improving teaching and learning. You can hear it too. Teachers on these teams don't talk about my classroom. They talk about our school and our students and changing our profession. They make a point to communicate about students' individual needs and to implement solutions together. The work of teaching isn't contained to their individual classrooms but extends across the learning experience.\\n\\nTeachers describe high levels of satisfaction that come from having the time to collaborate effectively in this way, and a real capacity to do something about the issues holding students back.\\n\\nCommunities are responding favorably to teacher-powered schools, welcoming the changes for students and families. And a 2013 national survey showed that 85% of the American public think it's a good idea. After all, like me, the public has been trusting teachers to navigate (and work around) the system on behalf of students for years.\\n\\nTeachers should present the alternative\\n\\nThis movement toward collective autonomy could have reverberations beyond individual schools. Based on what teacher-powered teams are accomplishing policymakers should be willing to explore how collective autonomy for teachers could help resolve many of the current major issues in education policy (and in the process, help stem the tide of teacher attrition). Today, teachers' collective energy often is defensive--fighting against being held accountable for the results of systems they do not design and run.\\n\\nBut teachers shouldn't wait on policymakers to grant permission. Instead, they should lead the way, and present the alternative. First order of business: publicly embracing collective autonomy (not just autonomy in my classroom) as a means to improved student learning as well as an attractive and robust teaching profession.\\n\\nTeachers like my children's have the knowledge, skills, and definitely the will to make decisions that will improve student learning. But in isolation--empowered only to make choices about their own classrooms, if that--teachers in most American schools will still have to fight the system in order to do just a sliver of what they have the capacity to do. What we, as communities, want them to do. What their students so desperately need them to do.\\n\\nReframing how they envision and pursue autonomy, teachers could show everyone a way to change that."}

On Monday, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said nearly 4.6 million shots have been dispensed.\\n\\nNewsom's comments came Monday as the state's death toll topped 26,500 and confirmed cases neared 2.4 million since the pandemic began. The state's swamped hospitals held more than 22,000 coronavirus patients, including nearly 4,700 in intensive care units, the Department of Public Health said.\\n\\nEven as he acknowledged the state must do better, Newsom sought to shift some responsibility for the slow rollout, noting the vaccines don't arrive magically in some state facility.\\n\\nDr. Mark Ghaly, secretary of the California Health and Human Services Agency, said the state assigns the number of doses that local health jurisdictions will receive after getting an allocation from the federal government. The vaccine is then shipped directly to entities like hospitals or local public health offices. Pfizer distributes its vaccine directly, while Moderna uses the pharmaceutical company McKesson as an intermediary, which initially led to slow communication, Newsom said.\\n\\nASSOCIATED PRESS Healthcare workers wait in line to receive the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine at Seton Medical Center in Daly City, Calif.

In hard-hit Los Angeles County, the total COVID-19 death toll has reached 10,850 and confirmed cases topped 818,000.

County Public Health Director Barbara Ferrer said 206 facilities have received their vaccine doses and will administer the shots themselves and 60 more have asked for help in giving the doses.\\n\\nThere are a handful of others, among the county's more than 300 such facilities, however, that have not yet picked up their allocations or had their shipments delivered.

We should quietly prepare for this contingency should our policy of peaceful reduction of tensions fail.\\n\\nIf the government of North Korea collapses, the first issue we would anticipate would be to prevent mass starvation. We would be ready to assist in coping with this situation, and would hope that China and others would also.\\n\\nIn the longer term, a reunited Korea would have enormous internal issues to deal with. This process would, we anticipate, be much more difficult than the reintegration of West and East Germany. As this process unfolds, US military forces would stay where they are. As Korea stabilizes, the time may come when the Korean government no longer feels that it needs the reassurance of American troops stationed there. In that case, the U.S. will, of course, withdraw those troops. In no case will US troops be anywhere near the Yalu River.\\n\\nStability is in the interests of both China and the United States. However, wise planning suggests that a North Korean collapse might happen. If it does, the desirability of contingency plans to restore stability and to prevent adding to instability, suggests that China and the United States should discuss their mutual interests."}
{"original": "WASHINGTON — The House of Representatives easily enacted a set of rules on Thursday that included pay-go budget limits loathed by some progressive members of Congress and outside activists. Just three Democrats voted against it: Reps. Ro Khanna (Calif.), Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (N.Y.) and Tulsi Gabbard (Hawaii). An equivalent number of moderate Republicans voted for the rules.\\n\\nThese progressives object to the pay-as-you-go, or pay-go, rule because it would prevent legislative priorities like Medicare for All to come up for a vote unless they were paid for.\\n\\nHowever, the Congressional Progressive Caucus effectively decided it was not worth tanking the entire set of rules governing the new Congress to jettison pay-go, since they had received assurances from Democratic leaders that the provision would always be waived to allow progressive bills to proceed to the House floor.\\n\\nWith the assurances that PAYGO can be waived, we do plan to vote for the House rules package and proceed with legislation to fix the statute, CPC co-chairs Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) and Mark Pocan (D-Wis.) said in a Wednesday statement.\\n\\nProgressive congressional leaders have also noted that a change in House rules alone would not clear the path for deficit-increasing legislation to become law. Since pay-go is also written into the legal code, Congress would have to enact another law overturning it ― or otherwise exempting a particular bill from it.\\n\\nReps. Jayapal and Pocan promised Wednesday that they would introduce a bill overturning pay-go entirely.\\n\\nAsked about pay-go on Thursday, Rep. Hank Johnson (D-Ga.), a member of the CPC, likewise cited the need for a larger legal fix.\\n\\nCongress can always change that law. And I think I will be supportive of that move, he said.\\n\\nWhen Democrats re-took the House in 2007, they reinstated expired pay-go rules requiring any new spending to be offset. But following a decade of frustration with Republicans' willingness to discard their professed fiscal conservatism to cut taxes for the wealthy ― and a burgeoning field of research downplaying the importance of low budget deficits ― many Democrats have soured on pay-go as a vestige of a misguided era of centrist triangulation.\\n\\nThat's why Reps. Khanna and Ocasio-Cortez staged a last-minute protest to thwart pay-go on Wednesday, despite the CPC co-chairs' willingness to accommodate it (provided the co-chairs had the proper assurances from Democratic leaders).\\n\\nThe outspoken progressive members vowed Wednesday to vote against the bill, generating national attention that raised the possibility of another internecine Democratic showdown.\\n\\nOcasio-Cortez's staff claimed that she would try to rally the 18 no votes necessary to kill the package.\\n\\nBut Democratic leaders were confident they had the votes. By Wednesday night, it became clear that even incoming Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.), one of the freshman class's progressive firebrands, would be voting yes. In her statement, Omar noted that the rules package contained a change that would permit her to wear the Muslim headscarf, or hijab, on the House floor.\\n\\nKhanna insisted in an interview Thursday that his public statement was intended as an expression of principled disagreement, rather than a wager that he could stop the measure.\\n\\nPay-go is terrible economic policy. And I am voting what I believe is my conscience on the issue, Khanna told HuffPost.\\n\\nThe eleventh-hour effort by Khanna and Ocasio-Cortez showcased the potential power ― and pitfalls ― of would-be efforts to leverage a smaller ad-hoc group of progressive Democrats to shape Congress' agenda.\\n\\nThe CPC has eschewed emulating the far-right House Freedom Caucus, whose smaller but more ideologically coherent membership has allowed it to operate as a bloc capable of exercising veto power over any legislation GOP leaders introduce. The caucus instead welcomes all members, including some who belong to the business-friendly New Democrat Coalition, while permitting smaller groups to take stands of their choosing.\\n\\nThus far, the CPC has had more success when its co-chairs exercise their leverage in concert with outside activists.\\n\\nJayapal and Pocan demanded that CPC members receive proportional representation ― 40 percent of the seats ― on five influential committees in which they were previously underrepresented, in exchange for endorsing California Rep. Nancy Pelosi's speakership.\\n\\nThey also blessed a successful effort to block a rule that would have required three-quarters support in the House for any tax increase on all but the wealthiest Americans.\\n\\nOmar acknowledged the latter accomplishment in her statement about voting for the rules.\\n\\nI am pleased that the rules package will include important reforms I helped negotiate, Omar said."}
{"original": "SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — North Korea displayed new submarine-launched ballistic missiles under development and other military hardware in a parade that underlined leader Kim Jong Un's defiant calls to expand the country's nuclear weapons program.\\n\\nState media said Kim took center stage in Thursday night's parade celebrating a major ruling party meeting in which he vowed maximum efforts to bolster the nuclear and missile program that threatens Asian rivals and the American homeland to counter what he described as U.S. hostility.\\n\\nDuring an eight-day Workers' Party congress that ended Tuesday, Kim also revealed plans to salvage the nation's economy, hit by U.S.-led sanctions over his nuclear ambitions, pandemic-related border closures and natural disasters that wiped out crops.\\n\\nThe economic setbacks have left Kim with nothing to show for his ambitious diplomacy with President Donald Trump, which derailed over disagreements about sanctions relief in exchange for North Korean denuclearization steps, and pushed Kim to what is clearly the toughest moment of his nine-year rule.\\n\\nKim's comments are likely intended to pressure the incoming U.S. government of Joe Biden, who has previously called the North Korean leader a thug and accused Trump of chasing spectacle rather than meaningful curbs on the North's nuclear capabilities. Kim has not ruled out talks, but said the fate of bilateral relations depends on whether Washington abandons its hostile policy toward North Korea.\\n\\nAP Photo/Lee Jin-man A woman wearing a face mask walks past in front of a TV screen showing a news program reporting about North Korea's military parade, at Seoul Railway Station in South Korea on Jan. 15, 2021.\\n\\nNorth Korean state TV on Friday aired edited footage of the parade which showed thousands of civilians and troops roaring and fireworks exploding overhead as Kim stepped out of a building and took his spot at a podium in Kim Il Sung Square, named after his grandfather and the country's founder.\\n\\nKim, wearing a black fur hat and leather trench coat, waved and smiled widely as his troops chanted Let's defend Kim Jong Un with our lives! and Protect with our lives the Workers' Party of Korea's Central Committee led by Great Comrade Kim Jong Un!\\n\\nReports and video from state media suggested that Kim did not make a speech during the parade.\\n\\nHis defense minister, Kim Jong Gwan, said in a speech that North Korea's military would pre-emptively marshal our greatest might to thoroughly punish hostiles forces if they threaten the North's safety.\\n\\nMilitary aircraft flew in formation across the dark sky, using what appeared to be flares to form the symbol of the Workers' Party — a hammer, brush and sickle.\\n\\nFlag-waving spectators, unmasked despite a fervent domestic campaign to fend off the coronavirus, cheered as troops rolled out some of the country's most advanced weapons, including submarine-launched ballistic missiles described by the official Korean Central News Agency as the world's most powerful weapon.\\n\\nThe new type of submarine-launched missiles was larger than the ones North Korea previously tested.\\n\\nThe North also displayed a variety of solid-fuel weapons designed to be fired from mobile land launchers, which potentially expand its capability to strike targets in South Korea and Japan, including U.S. military bases there.\\n\\nKCNA said the parade featured other missiles capable of thoroughly annihilating enemies in a pre-emptive way outside (our) territory. But it wasn't immediately clear whether the description referred to intercontinental ballistic missiles.\\n\\nPhotos and video released by state media didn't appear to include weapons that could be definitely identified as ICBMs.\\n\\nDuring a previous military parade in October, North Korea unveiled what appeared to be its biggest-yet ICBM. Its previous long-range missiles demonstrated a potential ability to reach deep inside the U.S. mainland during flight tests in 2017.\\n\\nNorth Korea has been developing submarine-launched ballistic missile systems for years. Acquiring an operational system would alarm its rivals and neighbors because missiles fired from under water are harder to detect in advance.\\n\\nStill, Kim Dong-yub, an analyst at Seoul's Institute for Far Eastern Studies and a former military official who participated in inter-Korean military talks, said the North's presumably new submarine-launched missiles could possibly be engineering mockups that require further development before they are ready to be tested and deployed.\\n\\nWhile Kim Jong Un vowed during the congress to develop nuclear-powered submarines capable of firing nuclear-armed ballistic missiles, it would take considerable time for North Korea to overcome financial and technological difficulties and produce such systems, the analyst said.\\n\\nLeif-Eric Easley, a professor at Ewha University in Seoul, said the way North Korea featured the submarine-launched missiles in the parade suggests that a test related to them could be North Korea's first provocation for the Biden administration.\\n\\nSouth Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff said in a statement that it is studying the weapons displayed by North Korea but didn't immediately release a detailed assessment.\\n\\nJapanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Katsunobu Kato said Tokyo is monitoring North Korean missile developments with great concern.\\n\\nNuclear-powered submarines were just one of many advanced military assets on Kim's wish list during the congress, which also included longer-range ICBMs that could potentially target the U.S. mainland more reliably, new tactical nuclear weapons and warheads, spy satellites and hypersonic weapons.\\n\\nIt's unclear whether North Korea is fully capable of developing such systems. While the country is believed to have accumulated at least dozens of nuclear weapons, outside estimates of the exact status of its nuclear and missile program vary widely.\\n\\n___\\n\\nAssociated Press writer Mari Yamaguchi in Tokyo contributed to this report."}

The 2018 employment application also makes candidates sign a pledge not to engage in homosexual activity or violate the unique roles of male and female.\\n\\nMoral misconduct which violates the bona fide occupational qualifications for employees includes, but is not limited to, such behaviors as the following: heterosexual activity outside of marriage (e.g., premarital sex, cohabitation, extramarital sex), homosexual or lesbian sexual activity, polygamy, transgender identity, any other violation of the unique roles of male and female, sexual harassment, use or viewing of pornographic material or websites, says the application.\\n\\nThe application says that the school believes marriage unites one man and one woman and that a wife is commanded to submit to her husband as the church submits to Christ.

{"original": "For the first time, a U.S. state has legalized marijuana with the stroke of a pen, not a vote at the ballot box.\\n\\nVermont Gov. Phil Scott (R) on Monday signed into law House Bill 511, which legalizes the possession of up to one ounce of cannabis and removes penalties for possession of up to two mature marijuana plants and up to four immature plants. The legislation says nothing about creating a state market for recreational weed, however. The new law will go into effect in July.\\n\\nToday, with mixed emotions, I have signed H. 511, said Scott in a statement addressed to the state's General Assembly. I personally believe that what adults do behind closed doors and on private property is their choice, so long as it does not negatively impact the health and safety of others, especially children.\\n\\nWith Scott's signature, Vermont will join eight other legal-weed states, as well as Washington, D.C., in a growing movement away from federal law, which still classifies marijuana as a Schedule I substance, alongside heroin and LSD. Vermont legalized medical marijuana in 2004, and is currently among nearly 30 states, plus the territories of Guam and Puerto Rico, and the District of Columbia, with such programs in place.\\n\\nAlthough other states have legalized cannabis through ballot initiatives that have left the decision up to voters, Vermont does not allow for such a process. Over the past few years, lawmakers in the state have instead been working to address marijuana reform through legislation. A similar legalization bill made it to Scott's desk in 2017, but the governor vetoed it, citing concerns with weak language on punishment for the sale of marijuana to minors and its establishment of a commission to study how a regulated cannabis market would work in Vermont.\\n\\nThe final version of H. 511 clarified civil penalties for the sale of marijuana to individuals under 21 years old and removed the commission entirely. Scott has instead created his own marijuana task force, which is examining the state's involvement in recreational cannabis sales and focusing on developing comprehensive education, prevention and highway safety strategies.\\n\\nThere must be comprehensive and convincing plans completed in these areas before I will begin to consider the wisdom of implementing a commercial 'tax-and-regulate' system for an adult marijuana market, Scott said on Monday. It is important for the General Assembly to know that – until we have a workable plan to address each of these concerns – I will veto any additional effort along these lines, which manages to reach my desk.\\n\\nSome state officials say the composition of that commission looks to be biased against marijuana, which means recreational weed faces an uncertain future in Vermont.\\n\\nThere is frustration that the governor's panels appear to be predetermined in opposition [to a tax-and-regulate model for marijuana sales] versus the sentiment of the House and Senate, which was to move forward, said Vermont Lt. Gov. David Zuckerman, a Progressive/Democrat.\\n\\nThe governor's commission is expected to deliver a final report to lawmakers by the end of the year, which would guide them on future legislation to establish a market for cannabis. Under Vermont's two-step process of legalization, it could be a while before the state sees its first legal marijuana sale, said Matt Simon, the New England political director for the Marijuana Policy Project, a non-profit organization that advocates for cannabis reform around the country.\\n\\nThe tone of the commission all along has been, 'Let's figure out how to do this, regardless of whether we think it should happen or not,' he said. They're gonna come up with specific policy recommendations. Now whether the legislature decides to take those recommendations or not is a whole different story.\\n\\nIt's not yet clear if there would be enough support in the state legislature to pass a tax-and-regulate bill without Scott's support. Vermont requires a two-thirds vote in both chambers to override a gubernatorial veto. With statewide elections upcoming in November, these deliberations seem likely to become a key campaign issue in the coming months, though it's not yet clear if lawmakers will be willing to put themselves on the record as strong supporters of legal marijuana sales in Vermont.\\n\\nSome Republicans feel vulnerable if they support this kind of legislation, even though the support for this is majority across all parties, said Zuckerman. The cultural sentiment is still in some of those districts, and they don't feel the support is there yet.\\n\\nRecent surveys have shown strong support for relaxing marijuana laws in Vermont and nationwide. A January HuffPost/YouGov poll showed that 55 percent of Americans favor legalizing marijuana both nationally and in their own states. National support for legalization at the federal level hit a record high 64 percent in a Gallup survey from October 2017, including among a majority of Republicans.\\n\\nRecreational marijuana has already become a substantial revenue source in the states that have legalized it. Legal marijuana sales in the U.S. hit $6 billion in 2016, with tax revenue in Colorado and Washington, the states that have had legal cannabis markets for the longest, now bringing in hundreds of millions of dollars a year, according to an analysis by the Marijuana Policy Project. Another recent study projected that over a nine-year period, legal marijuana nationwide could provide 1 million new jobs and generate more than $132 billion in federal tax revenue, with nearly $52 billion in sales tax alone.\\n\\nWithout a system to tax and regulate cannabis sales in Vermont, all commerce involving marijuana would remain underground.\\n\\nMarijuana is widely available, widely used throughout Vermont. Vermonters spend an awful lot of money on marijuana and it all goes to the illicit market, said Simon. Why wouldn't we have a regulated system so that money would instead go to taxed and regulated businesses and the state would have some revenue to deal with any costs or issues that do arise?\\n\\nDespite the clear economic benefits of legal marijuana, the state-federal divide on cannabis laws has gotten deeper over the past month. Lawmakers in the Vermont House of Representatives passed H. 511 just a day after U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions released new Justice Department guidance giving federal prosecutors the go-ahead to crack down on state-legal marijuana operations. Although the announcement led to some anxiety in the fledgling marijuana industry, its practical effect remains to be seen.\\n\\nThat Justice Department action alone shows that the political stigma around marijuana reform still hasn't faded completely, said Zuckerman. But he hopes the Vermont legislature's successful move toward legalization could serve as an invitation for lawmakers in other states to pursue reform.\\n\\nThis is a significant signal to other legislative bodies around the country that legislatures can act in the interest of the general population without some of the fear that there will be electoral retribution, he said. In the world of making laws, that is often one of the things that lawmakers look at, that potential consequence.\\n\\nFor now, lawmakers are discussing how best to incorporate Vermont's progressive principles into any future system of state marijuana sales, Zuckerman said.\\n\\nThe very broad sentiment from right to left is that nobody wants Big Cannabis to own Vermont, and whatever we do end up drafting for a tax-and-regulate bill will be oriented toward smaller production facilities and a more broad distribution of the economic benefit throughout the state, as opposed to large out of state corporate version, he said.\\n\\nClarification: A previous version of this story indicated Vermont Lt. Gov. David Zuckerman governor is a Democrat. Zuckerman won both the Democratic and Progressive primaries for the position, and has been affiliated with both parties."}
{"original": "Aging Asian-Americans and Pacific Islanders may need to rethink how susceptible they are to fraudulent offers and scams.\\n\\nA new survey by the AARP, the nation's largest senior advocacy group, revealed that AAPI individuals are frequent targets of scammers, yet they are overly confident in their abilities to spot a scam.\\n\\nThe organization surveyed a sample of 1,120 AAPI individuals ages 50 and older from across the country and published its findings last week.\\n\\nAccording to AARP, 72 percent of those surveyed reported that they or their families were targets of fraud. Thirty-nine percent said they were victims of fraud ― and one-third of those people lost money (an average of $15,246).\\n\\nThe most common scams that participants encountered were foreign lottery winnings, requests for charitable donations, fake requests for IRS back taxes and email phishing scams.\\n\\nWhile a majority of participants (73 percent) said they felt confident they could identify fraudulent offers, 71 percent of people failed AARP's fraudulent offer knowledge quiz, which included six true-or-false questions on foreign lotteries, wiring money to strangers and other types of scams.\\n\\nRobert E. Roush, a professor of geriatrics at Baylor College of Medicine, told HuffPost in an email that he didn't know why the majority of AAPI individuals felt confident about identifying fraud when only a minority passed the test ― but he did warn that other factors, including dementia or head injuries, could have affected some of the participants' answers. Roush was not involved in AARP's study.\\n\\nAARP will use this new information to develop new programs within the organization.\\n\\nWe hope that the findings will also be helpful and useful to policy makers and the AAPI community to guide their work, Daphne Kwok, AARP's vice president of AAPI strategy, told HuffPost\\n\\nA new AARP survey finds that Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders are susceptible to financial fraud https://t.co/sfQOePkErp pic.twitter.com/Iz4N8RUSra — AARP AAPI Community (@AARPAAPI) January 31, 2018\\n\\nIt is no secret that scammers frequently target American seniors.\\n\\nA 2017 review of 12 studies found that 1 in 18 older Americans are victims of financial fraud every year. However, few studies look into how scams and fraud affect different groups of seniors.\\n\\nFraud is an issue that cuts across ethnic groups and older adults are particularly vulnerable to losing a lifetime of hard-earned savings, Kwok told HuffPost in an email, adding that fraud prevention is one of the organization's top priorities.\\n\\nSo far, AARP has only conducted this study for the AAPI community. The organization singled out AAPI elders first because there is not enough data or research on the AAPI community in general, according to Kwok.\\n\\nEspecially disaggregated AAPI data, she added, which is critical to truly address and understand the specific needs and challenges of the diverse AAPI community.\\n\\nFor the survey, AARP conducted phone interviews in English, Mandarin, Cantonese, Tagalog, Vietnamese and Korean with AAPI individuals ages 50 or over.\\n\\nWhile the study does not suggest that scammers are targeting AAPI individuals more frequently than people from other ethnic groups, it does reveal that they react in a particular way.\\n\\nCultural or language elements do seem related to the types of fraud that they are more likely to be hit by and also what the impact will be, Angela Houghton, AARP's senior research adviser and the survey's author, explained to HuffPost in an email.\\n\\nFor example, focus groups hosted by the National Asian Pacific Center on Aging, or NACPA, revealed that older AAPI individuals are worried that language barriers make them more likely targets for fraud.\\n\\nBut according to Houghton, the survey's results suggested that people with a limited understanding of English were also less likely to engage in activities that made them more vulnerable to fraud.\\n\\nBehaviors such as being more active with banking/financial transactions and being digitally connected tend to increase the risk of fraud, Houghton said.\\n\\nIronically, this results in lower exposure for some of the sub-groups normally expected to be more vulnerable [AAPI individuals who are older, less acculturated and with a limited English proficiency] because they are less likely to engage in them.\\n\\nHowever, languages barriers can still put AAPI individuals at risk: Houghton warned that those with a limited understanding of English may be less likely to identify a scammer if they do encounter one.\\n\\nAnd once fraud occurs, we saw that those with limited English skills are less likely to report it, Houghton added.\\n\\nLanguage barriers may also make it more difficult for AAPI people to learn about scammers and the risks of fraud, which is why AARP's researchers highlighted the importance of having in-language consumer information and access to culturally appropriate fraud resources in the community.\\n\\nAAPI seniors said they lacked access to these types of language-specific materials and resources in 2017, according to NACPA.\\n\\nAARP\\n\\nOne of the most concerning findings of the survey was AAPI seniors' reluctance to talk about or report incidents to authorities.\\n\\nOne in 3 victims did not tell anyone ― including friends or family ― about the fraud or how it affected them, though an overwhelming majority of victims (72 percent) said the experience hurt their physical, emotional and mental health. The effects included anger, stress or depression, feelings of shame and embarrassment, and family conflict or divorce.\\n\\nAAPI victims' reluctance to talk about or report fraud could be due to cultural barriers. According to NACPA, they may not report fraud because of immigration status, cultural behavior (such as a tendency to stay silent) or a belief that endurance and suffering is a virtue.\\n\\nParticipants in one NACPA focus group in 2017 described these cultural barriers: One Chinese participant told NACPA that Asian families are more reserved about their personal matters, which could make it more difficult for elders to seek help when they are exploited.\\n\\nRoush also agreed that cultural elements ― including the virtue of respecting elders, also known as filial piety ― may prevent AAPI victims from reporting fraud.\\n\\nFilial piety, a cultural trait common among Asians, could be a factor here: Elders are revered and expect to be taken care of by younger family members, Roush told HuffPost. So perhaps they are especially reluctant to tell others, especially family and close friends.\\n\\nAARP The types of scams that AAPI individuals were most exposed to included notices of foreign lottery winnings, requests for charitable donations and tech support for computer virus removal, according to AARP.\\n\\nMore needs to be done to educate AAPI seniors facing language barriers about the risks of scams and fraud, AARP's researchers concluded.\\n\\nThe researchers said it's important to distribute information in multiple languages, and warned of the emotional damage that fraud can cause.\\n\\nA significant number of AAPI fraud victims do not tell anyone about the fraud, the researchers wrote. By not telling anyone, victims are left to suffer alone and likely without gaining any wisdom about what steps to take next to protect themselves in the future.\\n\\nFor Kwok, educating the community is the best way to prevent people from falling victim to fraud.\\n\\nAwareness and education really is key to preventing fraud, she told NBC News.\\n\\nThe more conversations we can spark within the community and families around this issue, the less likely AAPIs will become victims.\\n\\nRead AARP's findings below.\\n\\nThis story has been updated with additional quotes from Daphne Kwok."}
{"original": "Depending on who you speak to, Priti Patel is either not very bright and doomed for the sack, or a force of nature who will survive, having shrugged off political storms and risen to a great office of state essentially on willpower. One thing is for certain – the home secretary's ability to attract controversy hasn't stopped her meteoric rise since being elected as MP for Witham in 2010. From being taken on as employment minister after co-authoring a book which described Britons as among the worst idlers in the world, to landing cabinet jobs at the international development department she wanted to abolish and heading the Home Office despite once supporting the death penalty, Patel's career has raised eyebrows. And while the bullying allegations mounting against her could be genuinely career-ending, many would still be reluctant to bet against a woman dubbed a piranha by her own husband (because she is small and combative). Patel, 47, has of course been here before – forced to quit as development secretary in 2017 after freelance meetings with senior Israeli government figures including PM Benjamin Netanyahu while on a summer holiday in the country. She attempted to ride out that storm but was rumbled when failing to disclose the full extent of the meetings to Theresa May. Despite the rolling Brexit chaos that characterised May's slow motion car-crash of a premiership, it was this incident that made the then-PM snap. As her former press secretary Paul Harrison wrote recently: May never succumbed to foul language even under the greatest of stress. However, the news I had just delivered – that ultimately saw Penny Mordaunt appointed international development secretary – led to probably the fruitiest expression I ever heard her say. It wasn't the first time Patel had enraged a prime minister, either, having been given a furious dressing down by David Cameron for her role in Vote Leave in the run-up to the 2016 EU referendum, which catapulted her into the limelight. HuffPost UK understands that Cameron was exasperated with Patel's role in the campaign because she was repeatedly attacking policies that featured in the Tory manifesto on which she had been elected just a year previously. It eventually cost her promotion to the cabinet – as employment minister she would have been a natural replacement for Iain Duncan Smith as work and pensions secretary when he quit – because Cameron did not want to reward bad behaviour.\\n\\nPA Priti Patel with Boris Johnson and Michael Gove visiting Farmhouse Biscuits in Nelson, Lancashire, during the Vote Leave campaign.\\n\\nBut Patel, true to form, was elevated to the cabinet by May within months. This brings us to the latest debacle, which had its early peak with Home Office permanent secretary Sir Philip Rutnam's explosive resignation on Saturday. Like May swearing, Rutnam's decision to turn down the offer of a six-figure payout in favour of quitting on camera and vowing to sue for constructive dismissal was unprecedented – and provoked by Patel. Rutnam accused her of bullying staff, briefing against him, and lying about her role in it.\\n\\nI have been the target of a vicious and orchestrated briefing campaign\\n\\n\\n\\nTop civil servant in the Home Office, Sir Philip Rutnam, quits and says he intends to sue the government for constructive dismissal https://t.co/9m4hL9nUcppic.twitter.com/U23fXTJnLT — BBC News (UK) (@BBCNews) February 29, 2020\\n\\nIt came after HuffPost UK reported that Patel had attempted to sack the Home Office director of communications Andy Tighe on Christmas Eve and had Rutnam's staff cut out of meetings. Allegations that Patel is brutal with some staff at the Home Office, berating and insulting officials and branding them useless and a joke have also been raised with HuffPost UK. She is said to have created a culture of fear that means officials are now afraid to challenge her or speak their minds because they are worried about being forced out like Rutnam. And the claims show no sign of stopping, with the BBC reporting that a former aide to Patel received a £25,000 payout after taking an overdose following bullying by the then-employment secretary in 2015. Fresh allegations have also emerged of Patel bullying staff around the time of her resigning from the department for international development. As those new claims emerged, a spokesman for the home secretary said she categorically denies them. But one senior former government adviser believes Patel's position is now untenable. No.10 told everyone to call off the dogs of war on Rutnam on Monday but she was still actively encouraging it, they say. The problem for her is the machine will probably do her in in the end. She's not that bright and, as you know, at the Home Office you get blamed for all kinds of things that aren't your fault. The ex-adviser concedes that in her desire to replace Rutnam, seen by some in Whitehall as a nightmare who unnecessarily blocks stuff, Patel was probably on the right side of the argument but was going about it the wrong way with her briefing campaign. In her defence I have not heard a single good thing about Rutnam from a variety of people – from other ministers who worked at the department who are measured individuals. Spads [special advisers] think he's a complete arsehole and quite vindictive, they say. But with Rutnam now out of the picture, Patel's former chief of staff James Starkie believes Boris Johnson, who launched a full-throated public defence of the home secretary at prime minister's questions on Wednesday, and his aide Dominic Cummings will not want to lose her.\\n\\nPA Patel sat next to Johnson as he defended her at PMQs on Wednesday"}

{"original": "Trying to figure out how COVID-19 vaccination is going in the U.S. is a lot harder than you might think.\\n\\nThere are, on the one hand, all those stories about problems across the country, whether it's pharmacies throwing away doses because they can't find people that fit eligibility criteria or it's senior citizens struggling with online questionnaires to get appointments.\\n\\nStill, it's possible that President Donald Trump's goal was never realistic, given the challenges of launching such a massive program in a country with such a notoriously underfunded public sector. The pace is picking up now and, in a few parts of the country, states are well on their way to vaccinating the highest priority groups.\\n\\nAlso, any assessment of U.S. performance has to take into account how other countries are doing. It turns out the U.S. is faring pretty well, relatively speaking. In fact, shots are getting into arms faster than in most of Western Europe, at least according to the available data.\\n\\nSo what's a fair assessment of progress to date? And what would it take to achieve something like herd immunity this summer, which feels like the best-case scenario right now?\\n\\nHere's a quick rundown of what we know, what we don't, and what it might take to make things go more quickly:\\n\\nHow Many Vaccines Have Been Administered?\\n\\nAs of Wednesday, nearly 11 million shots had been administered across the U.S., according to tracking by Bloomberg based on federal and state data. That is less than half of the total shots distributed to the states, which is obviously a big problem and has been ever since the rollout began.\\n\\nOne reason is that the Pfizer and Moderna shots, which are the two currently available in the U.S., require two doses. State and federal officials were holding back half the supply in order to make sure that everybody who got a first dose would also get a second one on the prescribed schedule. (That's three weeks later for Pfizer's, four weeks later for Moderna's.)\\n\\nPublic health experts and eventually the Biden transition team called for changing that practice, on the theory that vaccine supply will probably be steady enough to provide second doses on time without holding any back now. The Trump administration apparently agreed and, just this week, called for releasing the second doses.\\n\\nThat change should make a difference. And the pace of vaccination was already increasing. There were 852,000 shots given on Tuesday, according to Bloomberg's tally, which was one of the highest single-day totals yet.\\n\\nAre Other Countries Doing Better?\\n\\nAssessing the U.S. performance internationally depends on the context you choose ― or, more precisely, which countries are part of the comparison.\\n\\nAmong economically developed countries, the leader is Israel and it's not even close. As of Tuesday, more than 1 in 5 Israelis had received at least one vaccine dose, according to data from Our World in Data. And the rolling seven-day average for daily doses in Israel was 0.75 per 100 people. The comparable figure for the U.S. was 0.19.\\n\\nSo Americans are getting vaccines a lot more slowly than their Israeli counterparts. At the same time, they're getting them significantly more quickly than most of their European counterparts. Only the United Kingdom, where the rolling seven-day average was 0.29 on Tuesday, is putting more shots into arms per capita every day.\\n\\nThe international comparisons come with two very important asterisks. One is that not every country is tracking vaccine administration the same way or with the same accuracy. In many nations, including the U.S., data may be lagging behind actual shots.\\n\\nThe other asterisk is that different countries started vaccinating on different days because government approvals of vaccines didn't happen simultaneously. The U.K. started first, then came the U.S. and then, finally, the European Union. Adjusting for that factor, the performance of the U.S. comes closer to that of the U.K., but several European countries, like Denmark, Ireland and Italy, come close to or look better than the U.S.\\n\\nProbably the fairest way to judge the U.S. relative to its peer countries is to say that it matches or exceeds the highest performing countries in Western Europe but, like those countries, hasn't had nearly the success that Israel has ― again, assuming that the data is roughly accurate.\\n\\nWhat Can The U.S. Learn From Israel?\\n\\nIsrael's success starts with its national health system, in which every single citizen belongs to one of four large, nonprofit health maintenance organizations. These HMOs, which are different from their American analogues in many respects, do not merely pay for care. They provide it directly. They also have cutting-edge data and communications systems in place.\\n\\nWe immediately set up a data system that identified which people to summon as a first priority, who was second priority, and who could wait. The whole thing took 10 minutes, Sigal Regev Rosenberg, chief executive of one HMO, told The Times of Israel.\\n\\nMany other countries with national health insurance systems don't have that kind of capability, which is likely one reason that vaccination in countries like France and Germany has had a slower start. It may be no coincidence that the U.K., the European country administering shots the quickest, is also the one where, as in Israel, the government is heavily involved in the provision of care and not just its financing.\\n\\nAnother Israeli advantage is that the nation's population is schooled, from a young age, in crisis response. That includes its Arab citizens, although vaccination rates for them are reportedly lower. The main reason for that, according to officials, is that Arab Israelis don't trust the vaccine as much.\\n\\n(Vaccination in the occupied territories is a whole other story. Israel hasn't offered to provide shots there, according to media reports, and the Palestinian authorities who govern there haven't asked.)\\n\\nIsrael's small size may also be helping. With fewer than 8 million people living within a relatively thin strip of land, the national government can make and implement policy directly without a lot of delegation to lower-level governments, organizations and officials. That's not really practical in countries with many tens of millions, let alone the 330 million who live in the U.S.\\n\\nWhat Can The U.S. Learn From West Virginia?\\n\\nThe sheer size of the U.S. population helps explain why the Trump administration delegated not just actual vaccine delivery but also most of the planning for it to the states, which have then leaned heavily on local health departments. But that, in turn, helps explain why vaccine rollout has fallen so short of the initial goals.\\n\\nLocal health departments are overwhelmed, the states don't have extra money, and the federal government hasn't provided enough support.\\n\\nThis was never going to be easy, Jennifer Kates, senior vice president at the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation, told HuffPost. But the federal government basically punted the hard stuff to states who, left reeling from the ongoing impact of COVID-19, weren't able to mount a robust effort in most cases. In addition, many states in turn punted the hard stuff to counties. At the end of the day, everyone is playing catch up and the stakes are very high.\\n\\nSome states, naturally, have managed better than others. The three having the most success ― again, based on Bloomberg's tracking of vaccines administered relative to population ― are West Virginia, North Dakota and South Dakota. Other places doing relatively well include Connecticut and Maine. Alabama is where vaccines are getting into arms the slowest. California is really struggling too.\\n\\nThat ordering is not what a lot of people would expect, especially when it comes to the top three. The Dakotas, in particular, have some of the highest COVID-19 death rates in the country, even though they didn't face major outbreaks until relatively late, by which time the American health care system had learned a great deal about how to prevent and treat the disease.\\n\\nSo what are these top three states doing right? There's no single answer and, as with the international data, it's possible some state reporting is incomplete or slow, making it hard to draw definitive conclusions. But a common factor seems to be their approach to nursing homes. Most states in the U.S. are relying heavily on CVS and Walgreens, which are the official partners of the Trump administration's Operation Warp Speed. But because CVS and Walgreens don't always have a presence in rural areas, those three states are relying more heavily on other providers to reach nursing homes.\\n\\nWest Virginia, in particular, is working exclusively through small, independently owned pharmacies. That turned out to be a smart move because the independent pharmacies already had strong working relationships with the long-term care facilities. And that enabled them to deal with logistical issues quickly, starting with the need to get consent from patients or (when patients have diminished capacity) their families.\\n\\nWhen it got here, we already had pharmacies matched with long-term care facilities, so we were already ready to have vaccinators and pharmacists ready to go into those facilities and start providing first doses, Krista Capehart, director of regulation for the West Virginia Board of Pharmacy, told NPR.\\n\\nCVS and Walgreens were much slower to get started. And slow penetration into nursing homes is a big reason that vaccination rates are lower in so many other states.\\n\\nIt's an important lesson, but not one that's likely to help much in the short term. The reality is that the big pharmacy chains now dominate the market, especially in more densely populated parts of the country. That's a big reason why the Trump administration reached out to them.\\n\\nAnd the big chains do offer a big upside: their massive scale. They have a large workforce of pharmacists already trained to give vaccines, appointment systems already in place, and physical facilities all over the country. That's bound to help a lot in the coming months, as supply increases and many more people become eligible.\\n\\nWhat Can The U.S. Learn From Connecticut?\\n\\nConnecticut's success might be easier for other states to replicate. A big factor there was the discretion given to health care providers to deviate from eligibility criteria when the alternative was slowing down the process or discarding unused vaccines altogether.\\n\\nConnecticut has emphasized equity, but also pragmatism in their rollout, said Howard Forman, a physician and public health professor at Yale University who has followed the vaccine rollout closely (and actually administered shots himself). They have provided sufficient flexibility to health systems to make sure that vaccines are getting into arms of health care workers without overly mandating (or penalizing) rules of engagement.\\n\\nFlexible guidelines aren't a panacea, but they do seem to help and most states are moving in that direction now, with encouragement from the federal government.\\n\\nWhat Can The Biden Administration Do?\\n\\nThe next big challenge will come when supply ramps up, in late winter or early spring, and vaccines become available to a much larger swath of the public. At that point, the upper limit on vaccines will depend less on the amount of vaccine available and more on the ability to deliver it. The current plan is to use existing providers ― not just pharmacies, but also clinics, independent medical practices, and sometimes schools and employers ― and to supplement them with government-managed mass vaccination centers.\\n\\nThose centers are already starting to be established across the country, everywhere from Detroit to rural Tennessee to Southern California. (Officials just started giving shots at Disneyland.) The incoming Biden administration has pledged to support even more of these centers ― and to secure yet more funding, above and beyond the $8 billion that was part of the COVID-19 relief package that Congress passed and Trump signed in December.\\n\\nThat $8 billion can give overwhelmed state and local authorities the ability to hire extra staff, both for planning and for administering the shots. It would have been great to get the funding months ago, when public health experts and officials were begging for it, warning of precisely the sorts of problems plaguing the U.S. effort now. But the money will still help a lot ― especially because the pace needs to pick up a lot more.\\n\\nThe Biden team has said that its goal is 100 million vaccine doses within the first 100 days. That's not as audacious a goal as it seems, even though press reports suggest that members of the transition are worried about reaching it. The figure works out to a million a day, which isn't that far from where the vaccination effort is now. To reach herd immunity by summer, the pace probably needs to be twice as fast ― at least.\\n\\nPresident-elect Joe Biden's advisers may simply be setting low expectations ― which, after four years of an administration that chronically overpromised, might not be the worst thing in the world. But the reality remains the same: Getting back to normalcy in 2021 will require doing much, much more than the U.S. is doing now.\\n\\nCORRECTION: The original version of this article said the number of vaccinations by the end of 2020 was half of the 20 million target the Trump administration had cited in public statements. In fact, it was significantly lower than half ― perhaps as low as 3 million."}
{"original": "Participation by women in scientific research is rising--women now outnumber men majoring in biological sciences and the percentage of women awarded doctoral degrees in life sciences grew from 15% in 1969 to 52% in 2009. Yet women's participation in other STEM fields (science, technology, engineering and math) still lags; fewer than 20% of undergraduate majors in computer science and engineering are women, and as they rise through the ranks, disparities persist. Women are still underrepresented in faculty positions, female engineers publish in more prestigious journals but their work is cited less frequently, and editorial boards for journals in STEM fields remain overwhelmingly male.\\n\\nLooking beyond academia to consider broader social impact, indicators of unequal participation are worrisome. As women enter the workforce, we see even more differentiation by field, with women comprising 34% of environmental engineers but only 8% of mechanical engineers. Gender imbalances in the technology industry and financial sector are widely recognized. Three recent studies illuminate attitudes and practices limiting women's advancement in science and technology.\\n\\nConsider women's underrepresentation in patenting, an indicator of participation in tech commercialization. Although the situation is somewhat murky, since the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) collects no demographic information, a report released in November by the Institute for Women's Policy Research shows that patents with at least one woman inventor reached only 18.8% in 2010. This marks an increase over the rate in 1977, when 3.4% of patents listed at least one woman inventor; but at current rates, it will be 2092 before women reach parity (i.e., half of all patents will have at least one female inventor).\\n\\nWomen also face challenges in raising external equity for their startup companies. Women-owned businesses receive limited funding from venture capital investments--in 2016, 17% of total Series A rounds nationwide were for companies led by women. In the competitive Bay Area, women-led companies raised just 10% of Series A rounds, an uptick of two percentage points over the previous year. In a recent study on term-sheet negotiations, the authors considered factors influencing the amount of external funding raised, the percentage of overall goal this represented, and the amount of equity companies gave up. Two factors positively influenced raising at least 90% of capital sought: using the internet to research the negotiation process...and having a man serve as lead negotiator.\\n\\nPerhaps most poignant among recent studies is one published in Science last week, showing that shortfalls in girls' self-image regarding their intellectual aptitude begins as early as 6 years old. At age 5, children don't differentiate by gender who they predict will be really, really smart, but by age 6 a significant difference emerges among both boy and girl respondents, with both attributing the characteristic of being smart to boys/men more than girls/women. These aren't endogenous developments, of course, but rather are shaped by cultural attitudes from caregivers, family, and the media. A New York Times article by the study's authors adds an illuminating example: in 2014, Google searches for is my son a genius outnumbered searches for is my daughter a genius by two to one.\\n\\nWhat can be done to advance participation of women and girls in science? Organizations must improve data collection on gender diversity and publicize results, not just in patenting but in academic achievement and employment in STEM fields. Technology companies, consulting firms, and social science researchers have begun the work but more is needed, for we can't fix what we don't know. Highlighting accomplished women leaders in science and technology, as we have at CITRIS with the Athena Awards, will provide role models and help inspire the next generation: examples include director of the National Science Foundation France Córdova, former White House Chief Technology Officer Megan Smith, director of USPTO Michelle K. Lee, as well as leaders in elected office and the private sector. Grassroots advocacy efforts to improve gender diversity include the new international organization 500 Women Scientists. Parents, teachers and friends have opportunities to encourage girls' curiosity; tools include a spate of recent children's literature as well as toys designed to spark girls' exploration of engineering concepts and the natural world.\\n\\nMeaningful discoveries in science and technology promise to improve quality of life and maintain economic competitiveness -- for individual companies, industries, and the U.S. at large. These gains will be fully realized only by embracing the full expression of creativity and resourcefulness offered by men and women alike. On this day, recognized by the UN to promote Women and Girls in Science, leaders across sectors must commit to accelerate momentum for girls and young women to achieve this vibrant future."}

{"original": "A conversation with Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey can be incredibly disorienting. Not because he's particularly clever or thought-provoking, but because he sounds like he should be. He takes long pauses before he speaks. He furrows his brow, setting you up for a considered response from the man many have called a genius. The words themselves sound like they should probably mean something, too. Dorsey is just hard enough to follow that it's easy to assume that any confusion is your own fault, and that if you just listen a little more or think a little harder, whatever he's saying will finally start to make sense.\\n\\nWhether Dorsey does this all deliberately or not, the reason his impassioned defenses of Twitter sound like gibberish is because they are.\\n\\nBack in October, I sent a message to Dorsey to see if he'd be willing to sit down for an interview. I didn't really expect a response, partially because he'd just finished a media tour a few months prior but mostly because my previous DMs to him looked like this:\\n\\nMuch to my surprise, he agreed.\\n\\nMy only real goal was to get Dorsey to speak in specifics, about anything. In almost every interview he does, he'll lament his past mistakes and talk about his various high-minded visions for improving the platform: improving conversational health, reducing echo chambers, increasing transparency and about 10 other rote, buzzy phrases.\\n\\nBut press him for a clear, unambiguous example of nearly anything, and Dorsey shuts down. At one point, for instance, Dorsey explained that Twitter was working toward using machine learning to spot harassment before it's even reported. When asked how Twitter is handling the problem in the meantime, Dorsey had this to say:\\n\\nMost of our priority right now in terms of health, which is the No. 1 priority of the company, is around being proactive. How do we remove the burden from the victims or bystanders from reporting in the first place? It's way too mechanical. It's way too much work. ... But ultimately, we want to make sure that the number of reports that we receive is trending downward. And that will be because of two reasons. One, people are seeing far less abuse or harassment or other things that are against the terms of service. Or that we're being more proactive about it. So we want to do both. So a lot of our work is that, and then better prioritization in the meantime. A lot more transparency, clearer actions within the product.\\n\\nThose are certainly words, though none of them appeared to answer my question. It took some more prodding before Dorsey finally pointed to a specific action (that has not yet been implemented but that Twitter is... thinking about? It's unclear):\\n\\nWhat do you mean by clearer actions within the product? Just, you know, finding the report button isn't the most obvious and intuitive right now. So that certainly slows things down. But what's the alternative to that? Making it more obvious? I don't ... I mean, I'm not going to ... I don't know what it looks like right now, but we know what's wrong with it. So, you know, that's what we're working on.\\n\\nIn other words, the most the CEO of Twitter was able to tell me about specific steps being taken to solve the rampant, site-wide harassment problem that's plagued the platform for years is that they're looking into maybe making the report button a little bigger, eventually.\\n\\nOr consider later, when I asked whether Trump tweeting an explicit call for murder would be grounds for removal. Just as he seemed about to answer what seemed like an easy question, he caught himself. That would be a violent threat, he started. We'd definitely ... You know we're in constant communication with all governments around the world. So we'd certainly talk about it.\\n\\nThey would certainly talk about it.\\n\\nSimilarly, Dorsey knows that he's supposed to say Twitter has made some mistakes in the past in terms of its priorities, but stops short of taking responsibility for the platform itself. In our conversation, I asked him about Twitter attaching #falseflag to news about this summer's bomb scare.\\n\\nGod help us all pic.twitter.com/lLahdzqvWN — Max Weiss (@maxthegirl) October 24, 2018\\n\\nDorsey's initial response was we didn't add that, before trying to explain it away as people gaming the system. Twitter's algorithm promoting misinformation isn't some grand manipulation of the platform, though. It's the platform doing what it was built for. It makes sense, then, that Dorsey finds himself unable to talk about specific solutions. How can you fix something when you're not even sure what the actual problem is?\\n\\nIt seems clear that Twitter's current iteration, a machine learning-curated hell, isn't the website Jack Dorsey wants. He just refuses to say what that website actually is.\\n\\nThe conversation has been lightly edited for grammar and clarity. And if you work at Twitter, please feel free to get in touch.\\n\\nFirst, I noticed you unfollowed me on Twitter within the past couple of months or so.\\n\\nI did?\\n\\nYes, you did. Was there a reason why this happened?\\n\\nI, uh, was probably going through my list. I'm not sure why.\\n\\nHm.\\n\\nI don't know. I probably ... I probably went through a bunch. You know, I always clean things up.\\n\\nI see. Well, I want to talk a little bit about some of the work you've been doing with conservatives. Do you think there's any merit to their claim of bias against conservatives at Twitter? Basically I think it's conservatives.\\n\\nWell, I think it would be easy to believe a perspective if you only look at particular things. And you look at actions based on who you follow and whatnot.\\n\\nWhat do you mean?\\n\\nWell, I mean, people follow people that violate our terms of service and who we take action upon, and if you're only following those people and you're not following anyone else, you tend to see that and the perspective is strengthened. As I said in front of Congress, we do make some mistakes where our algorithms can be super aggressive. But do we build bias into our systems? No, it's not in our policies, it's not in our enforcement, and it's not in our algorithms. When we discover it, we remove it. And that's a field of research that we need to continue to invest in, bias in algorithms. So the main thing that we're focused on is how we stay transparent with our actions and continue to be impartial — not neutral, but impartial.\\n\\nRight. So it sounds like you're saying that there isn't any inherent bias in the platform itself against conservatives, but you've done a lot to reach out to conservative groups. Are you just trying to mollify them? What's your ultimate goal?\\n\\nNo, not at all. We did a bunch of conversations with the folks in the media that we — that certainly I — have never talked to before. So in the past, we do tend to stick with more of the financial press or the tech press. Both of which tend to be more on the other side of the spectrum. So, our default is probably to go to that, so we don't inherently reach out to everyone and talk to everyone. So one is having conversations, two is getting as much perspective as possible. To me, I think it's useful to hear perspective, even if I don't believe it, just to hear what other people are saying. I value that, so I'm not going to stop. But it's not an agenda to mollify, it's an agenda to listen and hear, like, what's being said and why it's being said.\\n\\nThere was a Wall Street Journal article the other day that came out about you speaking with Ali Akbar about the Alex Jones stuff. Did you consult him about it?\\n\\nYou know, during that time, I reached out to a bunch of people. You want to get as many thoughts as possible.\\n\\nWhat people besides him?\\n\\nI'm not going to disclose, but as many people as I know that would have opinions on the issue. And I want to make sure that I'm seeing the entire spectrum. People who I know who would probably be more favorable towards his situation, and those who are completely against it. And I want to hear everything in between. That's how you make good decisions, ultimately.\\n\\nWell, Ali Akbar's had a series of tweets, I'm just going to read a couple excerpts for you.

He has a whole series of these, and he seems like a very specific kind of figure to reach out to. Were you aware of his past comments and his tendency to identify which members of the media are Jews?\\n\\nI don't act on all of his comments. I listen, and I think that's the most important thing. I was introduced to him by a friend, and you know, he's got interesting points. I don't obviously agree with most. But, I think the perspective is interesting.\\n\\nBut do you think that by virtue of who you are and the fact that you, Jack Dorsey, are seeking input from this person, that it elevates him or validates his views?\\n\\nNo, no. I mean, if I followed his direction, then certainly. But it's just input.\\n\\nWell, before you banned Alex Jones, you said, We're going to hold Jones to the same standard we hold every account, not taking one-off actions to make us feel good in the short term and adding fuel to new conspiracy theories. I'm assuming those conspiracy theories were the allegations of bias against conservatives on the platform.\\n\\nWell, I think the conspiracy theory was that all companies were working in concert together to deplatform.\\n\\nOh, right, so general conspiracy theories about conservatives being targeted in media.\\n\\nRight, this is what I was referring to, in terms of all platforms working together. We definitely collaborate on methods, but particular actions, we don't.\\n\\nBut it seems like the desire to avoid fueling these was in the back of your head when thinking about these decisions. Is that accurate?\\n\\nNo. What I said is that there was an active conspiracy theory around all these companies working together. We want to state that we have a Terms of Service and that we are going to follow it. Then when we find that we need to take action, we'll take action. But there's no decision other than making sure that we stay true to our enforcement policies.\\n\\nI also wanted to ask you a little bit about the apology you made to Candace Owens a while back. You said, Hi Candace, I want to apologize for our labeling you 'far-right.' Team completed a full review of how this was published and why we corrected far too late. I think you'd be kind of hard-pressed to find anyone who would say Candace Owens isn't far-right, and I think she would agree with that if she was being honest. But even if you dispute that, getting an apology from the CEO of Twitter for something like this seems like an extraordinary step. I'm curious why you decided to intervene in this particular instance directly.\\n\\nWell, I apologized because we generally shouldn't be categorizing people. Our curation team should not be using our descriptions to categorize people. We should be describing what happened. We should be describing the instances, but we shouldn't be categorizing people ourselves.\\n\\nBut even just calling someone far-right isn't inherently negative.\\n\\nI'm not saying it's a negative. I'm saying we shouldn't do it, even if it was a positive, we shouldn't do it. We need to be descriptive as part of our curation guidelines, descriptive of what happened. Like, our whole role in that is to find the interesting tweets that show a story from all perspectives. The moment that we inject any sort of categorization, we've lost that promise.\\n\\nYou don't think even just identifying someone as a journalist or an actor, just in terms of—\\n\\nThat's dIfferent from what you said.\\n\\nIs it?\\n\\nThat's a role.\\n\\nBut it's categorizing someone.\\n\\nThat's a profession. That's the title that they're taking on that they self-proclaimed.\\n\\nBut far-right commentator is her profession.\\n\\nDoes she self-proclaim that?\\n\\nI mean, she would probably call herself a conservative commentator, but either way it's just a difference of degree.\\n\\nI don't know. When people self-proclaim something we might be more open to using it, but generally we should avoid categorizing people because we can be descriptive of the events.\\n\\nAlright, well a lot of people — myself included — were frustrated to see that because, for instance, if someone tweets out our home address or phone number, it's a crapshoot as to whether or not Twitter is going to do anything about it.\\n\\nThat's unacceptable, as well.\\n\\nRight, and we'll get emails back from Twitter support saying that it doesn't violate the private information policy.\\n\\nIt should. But again, we're not in a great state right now with our systems because they rely upon reporting. So we're not going to take any action unless it's reported. And then we take action, and we have a whole queue that we have to get through. We're moving to a world that's a lot more proactive by utilizing machine learning. But that will have errors and mistakes. So we don't feel good about anyone being doxed, certainly. We want to catch everything as much as we can, but there are limitations to how much we can do.\\n\\nBut what I'm saying is, people will very publicly share these instances when they happen, of Twitter saying that their address being posted doesn't violate the policy. And I'm sure you've seen some of them before. So why did Candace Owens' outrage about being labeled far-right compel you to address that so publicly, whereas the others might not have?\\n\\nWell, we make other apologies, as well. But this was ... You have to keep in mind, you know, someone doxing someone else on the platform and us missing it is a huge miss for us, and we should correct it as quickly as possible. But we took something and broadcast it to everyone, everyone on the service, in a way that was against our guidelines. So, that's why.\\n\\nWhile you're working on being more proactive about curbing harassment, there's still the instances where it is being reported and not acted upon. What happens to that in the meantime?\\n\\nSo, I mean, a lot of our work right now is looking at the prioritization of the queues and making sure that, No. 1, we're protecting someone's physical safety as much as we can and understanding the offline ramifications of using our service. So that's work in flight. Most of our priority right now in terms of health, which is the No. 1 priority of the company, is around being proactive. How do we remove the burden from the victims or bystanders from reporting in the first place? It's way too mechanical. It's way too much work. If people have to report, we should see it as a failure. If they have to mute and block that's another degree, it's a little bit less. But ultimately, we want to make sure that the number of reports that we receive is trending downward. And that will be because of two reasons. One, people are seeing far less abuse or harassment or other things that are against the terms of service. Or that we're being more proactive about it. So we want to do both. So a lot of our work is that, and then better prioritization in the meantime. A lot more transparency, clearer actions within the product.\\n\\nWhat do you mean by clearer actions within the product?\\n\\nJust, you know, finding the report button isn't the most obvious and intuitive right now. So that certainly slows things down.\\n\\nBut what's the alternative to that?\\n\\nMaking it more obvious? I don't ... I mean, I'm not going to ... I don't know what it looks like right now, but we know what's wrong with it. So, you know, that's what we're working on.\\n\\nAnd what do you mean exactly when you're talking about the health of the platform?\\n\\nSo it's this concept of conversational health. So it's what's pinned to my profile. We kicked off this initiative to first try to measure the health of conversation. And then second, as we build solutions around it, how do we tell if we're doing the right work? Because we don't have a lot of great metrics as to whether the things that we're doing are working well.\\n\\nBut how do you qualify conversational health?\\n\\nWell, it's in the thread. but I'll describe it as ... We can measure the level of toxicity, for instance, within a conversation. We can measure the level of perspective?\\n\\nRight, but how? What makes something toxic?\\n\\nWe have algorithms that can determine, based on the network, based on what people are doing elsewhere, based on the number of reports, based on mutes and blocks, whether this is a conversation that you'd want to stay in or you'd want to walk away from. And that doesn't inform any direct action, but it can inform enforcement actions and whatnot, like when a human has to actually review. So toxicity is one such metric, we call it receptivity. Like, are the members of the conversation receptive to each other? We have variety of perspective as an indicator. We have shared reality.\\n\\nHow do you determine someone's perspective?\\n\\nVariety of perspective.\\n\\nRight.\\n\\nYou have to ... Like, this is all conversations.\\n\\nRight, but I'm assuming that comes from which people are involved in conversations, or is that not right?\\n\\nUm, potentially. Right now we're just trying to determine what the indicators are. Like, temperature on your body — that indicates whether you're sick or not, right? So if you were to apply the same concept to conversations, what are the indicators of a healthy conversation versus a toxic conversation? That's what we're trying to figure out. We did this whole thing with outside researchers and RFP to get external help to determine these indicators. But this is all in the health thread, all the details.\\n\\nIn terms of Twitter itself promoting something, there have been issues in the past. Most recently when all these prominent Democrats were receiving homemade bombs, Twitter, in the related search terms, added #falseflag to the bomb scare. Things like this happen somewhat—\\n\\nWell, that's a related hashtag, isn't it?\\n\\nRight.\\n\\nWe didn't add that.\\n\\nWell, you did, because Twitter's algorithm picks it up. Is Twitter monitoring for when—\\n\\nYeah, we're monitoring. We're monitoring it. If we see something like that, we... We'll act on it. But these are the algorithms. We need to constantly improve them and evolve them. They're not going to be perfect, right?\\n\\nIs this all just reactive? Or is there an effort when this happens to—\\n\\nOh, there's a bunch you don't see because we caught them. I would say probably the majority, but every now and then there's going to be a new vector that we haven't trained our algorithms around. So we have to be reactive in those cases.\\n\\nBut do you feel any sense of responsibility for amplifying this sort of misinformation? Because this isn't just people saying something on the platform, it's the platform elevating whatever it is. And even if you catch most of them, there's still ones that get through and that have very real consequences.\\n\\nYeah, I mean, we feel a responsibility when people game our system and take advantage of it. So you know, this is not a ... That said, we'll never arrive at a perfect solution where our system is un-gameable.\\n\\nRight, but I don't know if this is entirely gaming the system.\\n\\nOh, it's gaming.\\n\\nI mean, there's lots of people who genuinely believe this, who genuinely think and want people to know that it's false flag but aren't necessarily trying to coordinate. And then Twitter picks it up because that's what it's built to do, to pick up what people are talking about.\\n\\nRight, yeah, we do. And we should. We should show what people are talking about, but we need to be careful in terms of what links we make and what we surface.\\n\\nI know Twitter just introduced a new tool for political ad transparency in India, but there's still sort of this question of what Twitter will do if politicians actively misuse the platform. Has that ever happened where a politician has been removed, and does Twitter have any plans for what to do if that happens?\\n\\nUm, I don't know about the cases. We can ... we can figure that out for you. But yeah, I mean, we're preparing for the Indian elections. It's going to be the biggest democratic election in the world. And Twitter is heavily used by the influencers and the politicians and the government in India, so we're very fortunate in that degree. And we want to make sure that we are doing what we can to make sure that we maintain the integrity of the conversation around the election.\\n\\nRight. But what do you do when it's the politicians that are promoting misinformation or—\\n\\nWe take action.\\n\\nSo then is there anything that, say, Donald Trump could do that would qualify as a misuse? Because I know the newsworthy aspect of it outweighs a lot of that. But is there anything that he could do that would qualify as misusing the platform, regardless of newsworthiness?\\n\\nYeah, I mean, we've talked about this a lot, so I'm not going to rehash it. We believe it's important that the world sees how global leaders think and how they act. And we think the conversation that ensues around that is critical.\\n\\nOK, but if Trump tweeted out asking each of his followers to murder one journalist, would you remove him?\\n\\nThat would be a violent threat. We'd definitely ... You know we're in constant communication with all governments around the world. So we'd certainly talk about it.\\n\\nOK, but if he did that, would that be grounds to—\\n\\nI'm not going to talk about particulars. We've established protocol, it's transparent. It's out there for everyone to read. We have, independent of the U.S. president, we have conversations with all governments. It's not just limited to this one.\\n\\nAll right, well, I want to move on to the some of the aftermath from your trip to Myanmar. Did anyone look over those tweets before they went out or was that just from you?\\n\\nThat's from me.\\n\\nWere you surprised at all by how people reacted, or were you taken aback at all?\\n\\nUm ... No. I mean, I think ... I wasn't overly surprised. You know, my intention was to share my experience, period.\\n\\nIn one of the tweets, you said part of the meditation technique was to answer the question, How do I stop suffering? I'm assuming that means in terms of the individual?\\n\\nWell, no, that was ... If you read the tweet, it was Buddha's question to himself.\\n\\nRight. But do you realize how that sounds to be repeating that question and talking about ending suffering as Jack Dorsey, the billionaire, while the U.N. is calling for military officials in this country to be prosecuted for genocide? I'm just wondering if you see how your role is actually larger than just yourself.\\n\\nI do, but I'm not gonna change the practice because of it and what people say. Like, this is the practice that Buddha laid out, and I'm not going to change it just because I have this particular role. I'm sharing what I practiced and what I experienced.\\n\\nI guess what I'm asking is more ... do you feel like you have more of a responsibility now, because of who you are, to bring up these topics because you have this huge platform and influence?\\n\\nYeah. I mean, I would love to go back and really understand that dynamic. I went for one particular reason which was meditation. And that's what I was sharing, that one thing right. It wasn't to represent Twitter, or—\\n\\nBut you do represent Twitter.\\n\\nI realize that, but I'm also human. And this practice is good for me and helps me learn and grow. So that's what I was sharing, and certainly act on all the feedback and everything that was going on. But that wasn't the point of this particular visit.\\n\\nWould you do anything differently if you were doing it again?\\n\\nIn terms of the practice? No.\\n\\nIn terms of the practice, yeah, or how you discussed it when you came back.\\n\\nYeah, I mean, not bringing it up was a miss, but I really wanted to focus the thread on what I experienced in the practice. I think I did a good job with that.\\n\\nThere was also another incident a few months ago in India where you got in some trouble for holding a poster that said Smash Brahmanical Patriarchy. A lot of people see these as a sort of institutional ignorance, or that Twitter doesn't really understand the responsibility of its role in the world. How how would you respond to that?\\n\\nWell, I think, you know, we are always learning more about our responsibility in the world. But that particular case where I was given a poster and then someone immediately said Let's take a picture.\\n\\nSure, but because of, again, who you are, are you ever more careful about any sort of photo you're in because of how your image could be used?\\n\\nWell, obviously not. I mean, what do I do, not accept anything from anyone? Not ever take pictures? I don't know. What's the solution?\\n\\nI mean, that, I guess. But also, I know you talk a lot about trying to raise up different perspectives in the platform. How are you going to account for that?\\n\\nWell, the biggest thing and I think we need to combat is filter bubbles and echo chambers. So, as an example, during Brexit, if you were to follow only Boris Johnson and Nigel Farage and all these other folks, you would only see tweets about reasons to leave. If we enabled you to do something like following a hashtag, like, #voteleave, 90 percent would be reasons to leave, but 10 percent would be reasons to stay. In the current mechanics of the system, we don't allow that reality. We don't even allow different perspectives because you have to do the work to find the other accounts. So you could say, well, people could just go the hashtag. People don't do that. It's not easy for them, and they're only going to do what's easy. But we don't make it easy. So, that is one simple thing that we could do to increase the amount and the variety perspective. Where, it might be that they see that, they follow the #voteleave tag, and they see the reasons to stay and that further emboldens them into leaving. Or it might be the case that they say, wait a minute, why are we doing this? We don't know. But we haven't even given people a chance to decide and have that experience.\\n\\nOn a different note, I think you were out of the country for this, but were you made aware that Laura Loomer handcuffed herself to the Twitter building in New York?\\n\\nI was.\\n\\nWhat'd you think about her protest?\\n\\nUm ... [laughter] I don't know. I mean, she believes that we've done her wrong, and I respect the fight and pushing back on us.\\n\\nWell, she wasn't fighting that hard, she only handcuffed herself to one of the doors.\\n\\nI don't know the details but, um, yeah. I appreciate when people speak up when they think that, you know, someone has done them wrong. Speaking truth to power is something that has flourished on our platform, and she believes we've done wrong by her, and she took action. So, I respect that. I don't agree with most of the things she says, but, you know.\\n\\nAnd is there any situation at all in which you would decide to delete the site?\\n\\nNow I remember why I unfollowed you! Because that's all you DM me, delete the site.\\n\\nWell, that's ... Maybe half the time.\\n\\nBut how is that going to help?\\n\\nThat's the question, though. Is there a situation where you would just decide that it's better to be free of this?\\n\\nShould we just delete all the negative things in the world?\\n\\nAre you saying Twitter is a negative thing?\\n\\nWell, that's what you're assuming when you say that.\\n\\nNot necessarily.\\n\\nWhat would you use if we deleted it?\\n\\nI don't know, I'd have a lot more time on my hands.\\n\\nWhat would you do with that time?\\n\\nI really can't even begin to imagine.\\n\\nI just ... I don't think it's constructive. I'd rather hear constructive ideas on what we could fix. We get a lot of complaints. We get a lot of issues, and they're all coming from a good place of good intent. But we have to dig under and figure out what the patterns are that we need to prioritize and fix. Because we can only do so much at once. So when somebody constantly tells me, delete the site, it's just not helpful. Whereas other folks tell me, Hey, you know if you do this one thing you would just have a massive impact.\\n\\nWell, deleting the site would have a massive impact — but that's fine, we can agree to disagree. I know we're running out of time, but I just have two more questions. I know there was a report recently that you mailed some of your beard hair to Azealia Banks. Did that happen?\\n\\nNo.\\n\\nYou didn't?\\n\\nNo.\\n\\nThat's disappointing. And last, I'm just wondering, what use of your platform has horrified you the most, or that you didn't expect the most?\\n\\nI mean that we weren't expecting any of the abuse and harassment, and just the ways that people have weaponized the platform. So, all that is horrible. And you know, we feel bad about that and we feel responsible about it. So that's that's what we intend to fix."}
{"original": "WASHINGTON -- In the rush to present a legislative response to last year's terrorist attacks in Paris, lawmakers passed a bill in December denying visa-free entry into the U.S. to foreigners who are dual nationals of Iran, Iraq, Sudan or Syria -- or who have visited any of those countries in the past five years.\\n\\nUnder the current visa waiver program, citizens of 38 countries, mostly in Europe, can visit the U.S. for up to 90 days without undergoing the lengthy process of applying for a visa. But under the changes, people from these exempted countries who also happen to be citizens of Iran, Iraq, Sudan or Syria would be forced to obtain one.\\n\\nThe new visa waiver restrictions aim to ensure that people with ties to countries thought to pose a terror threat cannot travel to the U.S. with minimal screening. But the short-sighted legislation affects a slew of people who have never traveled to Iran, Iraq, Sudan or Syria and who have no ties to terrorist groups.\\n\\nBecause Iranian, Sudanese and Syrian nationality is inherited from one's father rather than determined by one's country of birth, even individuals who have never traveled to any of the four blacklisted countries could lose their visa-free travel privileges, according to the American Civil Liberties Union. The law doesn't bar these individuals from visiting the U.S., but they have to get a visa first -- a more time-intensive process.\\n\\nDespite civil rights groups' opposition, the bill passed 407-19 in the House in December, with the Obama administration's support. It was later tacked onto the must-pass omnibus spending bill at the end of the year and then signed into law.\\n\\nBefore the visa waiver changes even became law, members of Congress began to have misgivings about their support for the bill. Thirty-three House Democrats, including 13 who voted in favor of it, wrote to Senate leaders less than a week later, warning that the bill could have unintended consequences.\\n\\nSpecifically, the signatories of the letter said that the new provisions discriminated against people based on their ancestry and could affect people who had legitimate reasons to travel to Iran, Iraq, Sudan or Syria as journalists or on business.\\n\\nThe Department of Homeland Security announced last week that it can waive the restrictions for journalists, humanitarian workers and people conducting business in any of the four countries -- but the exemptions are considered on a case-by-case basis and do not offer guaranteed protection to people who have these specific reasons to travel.\\n\\nA group of five House Republicans slammed the possible exemptions as inappropriate and contrary to the plain language of the end-of-year bill in a letter sent Thursday to President Barack Obama.\\n\\nMeanwhile, some members of Congress who initially supported the bill are now pushing to reverse the provision that applies to dual nationals.\\n\\nOn Jan. 14, Reps. Justin Amash (R-Mich.), Thomas Massie (R-Ky.), John Conyers (D-Mich.) and Debbie Dingell (D-Mich.) introduced a different bill that would remove the prohibition on dual nationals of Iran, Iraq, Sudan or Syria. Amash and Massie supported the initial visa waiver changes in December, while Conyers and Dingell voted against them. Sens. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.), Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), and Cory Booker (D-N.J.) are backing a parallel measure in the Senate.\\n\\nIn a press release announcing the new measure, Durbin explicitly acknowledged that the initial visa waiver changes weren't sufficiently thought through. The unfair provision was rushed through the House in the wake of the horrific terror attacks in Paris, and won't make our country safer, he wrote.\\n\\nIt's far from certain that the new bill will gain enough support from Republicans to pass and replace the language passed in December. The website GovTrack gives it a seven percent chance of passing. In the meantime, the unintended consequences of the visa waiver changes are all too clear.\\n\\nI officially feel like a sub-EU citizen: my #ESTA visa now reads not authorized to travel to US under #VisaWaiver Program #HR158 — Ellie Geranmayeh (@EllieGeranmayeh) January 22, 2016\\n\\nEllie Geranmayeh, a policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations, tweeted that the changes made her feel like a sub-EU citizen.\\n\\nBBC reporter Rana Rahimpour, who was born in Iran and is a British citizen, told The New York Times that she has been unable to safely travel to Iran because of her work with the BBC -- making her ineligibility to travel to the U.S. without a waiver particularly ironic.

{"original": "To reverse the rapid loss of species around the globe, world governments should protect nearly one-third of all lands and oceans and slash major sources of pollution by the end of the decade, according to a new United Nations proposal.\\n\\nThe draft plan, released Monday by the U.N. Convention on Biological Diversity, outlines a path for combating the biodiversity crisis that many scientists say is the start of Earth's sixth mass extinction. The 2030 goals include safeguarding 30% of all land and sea, with at least 10% put under strict protection; combating the spread and introduction of invasive species; and cutting nutrient and plastic pollution by at least 50%.\\n\\nThe post-2020 framework will be taken up at a United Nations biodiversity summit in China in October and could replace 2020 goals that countries agreed to in 2010 and largely failed to achieve.\\n\\nA sobering United Nations report in May found that up to 1 million land and marine species could be wiped out by human activity if present trends continue. The rate of extinction is up to hundreds of times higher than it has averaged over the past 10 million years, according to the three-year study authored by nearly 500 scientists.\\n\\nThe draft text comes as Australia battles unprecedented bushfires that have already killed an estimated 1 billion animals, including many endangered species.\\n\\nLisa Maree Williams via Getty Images A dead koala is seen among Blue Gum trees in the bushfire-ravaged outskirts of the Parndana region on Jan. 8 on Kangaroo Island, Australia.\\n\\nThe loss of the natural world is inextricably linked to global climate change, and scientists warn that together the two crises pose an existential threat to human civilization. In a 2017 report, U.N. Special Rapporteur John Knox, a human rights expert and professor of international law at Wake Forest University, wrote that biodiversity loss has grave and far-reaching implications for human well-being, including reduced fishery and agriculture yields, depleted sources of medicine and increased infectious diseases.\\n\\nThe proposal Monday was met with mixed reactions from environmental groups.\\n\\nAimee Delach, a senior policy analyst at Defenders of Wildlife, said the organization supports the plan and is encouraged by the concerted global effort to put biodiversity on a path to recovery.\\n\\nWe must commit ourselves to protecting our natural resources, and taking actions to achieve a target of protection of 30% of our lands and oceans by 2030 are an important step in the right direction, she told HuffPost in an email.\\n\\nSusan Casey-Lefkowitz, chief program officer at the Natural Resources Defense Council, said the language is a good start but not ambitious enough.\\n\\nWe are witnessing whole swaths of a continent burning ― devastating entire species before our eyes ― and the need for dramatic change could not be more blatant, she said in a statement. To reverse the cataclysmic changes occurring in nature, countries around the globe must heed scientists, who warn that heading off this rapid decline will require transformative action.\\n\\nWhile the goals of the U.N. proposal are clear, the draft offers few details about how nations can implement actions necessary to halt current declines. Among other things, it urges parties to integrate biodiversity values into national and local planning and notes that governments and societies need to determine priorities and allocate financial and other resources, internalize the value of nature and recognize the cost of inaction.\\n\\nA separate plan released Monday by the Center for Biological Diversity urged the United States to do its part to end the extinction crisis by investing $100 billion in species protection; creating 500 new national parks, wildlife refuges and marine sanctuaries; and restoring the full power of the Endangered Species Act.\\n\\nIn August, President Donald Trump's administration finalized a sweeping overhaul of the 1973 bedrock conservation law that makes it easier to remove recovered species from the protected list, opens the door for more extractive development and potentially limits federal agencies' ability to account for the impacts of future climate change. High-ranking officials in the administration have histories of slamming the ESA, calling it a sword to tear down the American economy and likening species listings to incoming Scud missiles.\\n\\nThis article has been updated with comment from Delach."}
{"original": "LONDON, Feb 12 (Reuters) - Britain said it would force social media companies such as Facebook, Twitter and Snap to do more to block or remove harmful content on their platforms.\\n\\nFollowing a consultation, the UK government said on Wednesday it planned to legislate to ensure companies had systems in place to tackle harmful content such as child abuse, cyber bullying and terrorist propaganda.\\n\\nThe policy, which will be developed in the coming months, would not place an undue burden on business, the government said. Penalties had not yet been decided, but it said the new rules would be enforced in a fair, proportionate and transparent way.\\n\\nGovernments globally are wrestling over how to better control content on social media platforms, often blamed for encouraging abuse, the spread of online pornography and for influencing or manipulating voters.\\n\\nGermany introduced tough regulations on social media in 2018, which can see platforms fined if they do not review and remove illegal content within 24 hours of it being posted. Australia has also legislated.\\n\\nAs the internet continues to grow and transform our lives it is essential that we get the balance right between a thriving, open and vibrant virtual world, and one in which users are protected from harm, Britain's Digital Minister Nicky Morgan and Interior Minister Priti Patel said in a statement.\\n\\nThe new regulations will apply to platforms on which user-generated content is shared, for example through comments, forums or video sharing.\\n\\nThe regulator, most likely media watchdog Ofcom, must be able to take action against tech bosses who did not take online safety seriously, the government said, adding that it will set out its position on senior manager liability in the coming months.\\n\\nBen Packer, a lawyer at Linklaters who has advised technology companies, said the proposals showed Britain was committed to implementing one of the most ambitious regulatory frameworks yet, which would have a significant impact on tech giants.\\n\\nFACEBOOK BACKS BETTER REGULATION\\n\\nFacebook and Google said they would work with the UK government on the new regulations.\\n\\nFacebook said it had long called for better regulation.\\n\\nNew rules are needed so that we have a more common approach across platforms and private companies aren't making so many important decisions alone, said Rebecca Stimson, Facebook's head of UK public policy.\\n\\nThis is a complex challenge as any new rules need to protect people from harm without undermining freedom of expression or the incredible benefits the internet has brought.\\n\\nKeeping people safe was something Facebook took extremely seriously, she said, and in recent years the company had tripled the number of people working on the issue to 35,000 and was using artificial intelligence to find and remove harmful content.\\n\\nSocial media companies have largely self regulated, as the law has struggled to keep up with technology.\\n\\nThe managing director of Google's YouTube UK, Ben McOwen Wilson, said the platform looked forward to working with the government to ensure a free, open and safer internet.\\n\\nTo help keep our community safe, we haven't waited for regulation; we've created new technology, hired expert reviewers, worked with external specialists, and reviewed our policies to ensure they are fit for the evolving challenges we face online, he said.\\n\\nBritain first announced last year that it would develop new online safety laws, saying they would be the toughest in the world.\\n\\nPacker said the proposals announced on Wednesday moved away from the previous debate about whether social media companies should be classified as 'publishers', and therefore subject to libel and other laws, and focused instead on making platforms responsible for the systems they had in place to deal with harmful content.\\n\\n(Editing by Guy Faulconbridge/ Louise Heavens/Susan Fenton)"}

{"original": "The Democratic presidential candidates didn't come to the debate Wednesday in Las Vegas to be nice.\\n\\nThe feistiest debate of the 2020 presidential election cycle came three days before the Nevada caucuses, and it's understandable why. The first two contests of the primary race, in Iowa and New Hampshire, were a wash. And in two weeks, a third of all the delegates in the Democratic primary will be decided in one day, likely sealing the fate of most of the candidates in the race.\\n\\nThere were six presidential candidates on the debate stage in Nevada: former Vice President Joe Biden, billionaire media mogul Michael Bloomberg, former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, and Sens. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.). Each one still sees a path to the White House, but the clock is ticking.\\n\\nIt was Bloomberg's first Democratic debate. The former Republican New York City mayor made it on the debate stage after the Democratic Party changed the qualification rules to focus more on poll numbers instead of grassroots donations (Bloomberg is self-funding). From the get-go, the other Democrats on the stage made it clear Bloomberg wasn't getting a first-timer's free pass.\\n\\nSo I'd like to talk about who we're running against: a billionaire who calls women 'fat broads' and 'horse-faced lesbians' — and, no, I'm not talking about Donald Trump. I'm talking about Mayor Bloomberg, Warren said in her first remark of the night.\\n\\nBut then again, the candidates weren't giving any of their fellow competitors a free pass either. Warren went after just about everyone on stage — twice over. Buttigieg seemed to have it out for Sanders and Klobuchar. And Biden and Sanders took their turns punching at Bloomberg, like the rest of them.\\n\\nHere are five takeaways from Wednesday's debate:\\n\\nJohn Locher/ASSOCIATED PRESS Former New York Mayor Mike Bloomberg and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) try to get in their time at the Democratic presidential primary debate Wednesday in Las Vegas.\\n\\nBloomberg took a punch. And another punch. And then another one. And another one.\\n\\nPeople of color, women and his exorbitant wealth: the three areas of Bloomberg's record that came under attack Wednesday night. And the attacks were unrelenting and from every direction.\\n\\nSanders got to take the first swing at Bloomberg: He went after Bloomberg's record on police policy when he was New York mayor. Namely, the stop-and-frisk policy, the directive to police to stop, question and search suspicious people that disproportionately targeted Black and brown teenagers. It increased sevenfold under Bloomberg's tenure from 2002 to 2013.\\n\\nMr. Bloomberg had policies in New York City of stop-and-frisk that [targeted] African American and Latino people in an outrageous way, Sanders said. That is not how you're going to grow voter turnout.\\n\\nWarren and Biden took their turns. They hit Bloomberg on stop-and-frisk and his record with women. Over the past several decades, 64 women have brought forward nearly 40 sex discrimination and sexual harassment lawsuits against Bloomberg and his company. Women at Bloomberg LP have reportedly been bound by nondisclosure agreements (NDAs), which Bloomberg refused to break when pressed on the debate stage.\\n\\nHe has gotten some number of women ― dozens, who knows ― to sign nondisclosure agreements, both for sexual harassment and for gender discrimination in the workplace, Warren said. So, Mr. Mayor, are you willing to release all of those women from those nondisclosure agreements, so we can hear their side of the story?\\n\\nBiden pressed on the NDA issue further.\\n\\nLook, let's get something straight here. It's easy. All the mayor has to do is say, You are released from the nondisclosure agreement, period, Biden said. You think the women, in fact, were ready to say I don't want anybody to know about what you did to me? That's not how it works. The way it works is they say, look, this is what you did to me, and the mayor comes along and his attorneys said, I will give you this amount of money if you promise you will never say anything. That's how it works.\\n\\nBloomberg should have expected these hits. His record with communities of color, his wealth, and his record with women have all come under intense scrutiny in the last week. Yet he appeared unprepared on all fronts. He was muted in his defense of stop-and-frisk policies. He chalked up the harassment complaints to maybe they didn't like a joke I told, refusing to free the women at his companies from the NDAs they'd signed, and didn't have an answer for why he has yet to release his tax returns other than to say he's working on it.\\n\\nRemember, I only entered this race 10 weeks ago, Bloomberg said. All of my associates here have been at this for a couple of years.\\n\\nThat only opened him up to further attack.\\n\\nThat's right, we have, Buttigieg jumped back. Engaging with voters and humbling ourselves to the backyards and diners.\\n\\nElizabeth Warren came ready to fight.\\n\\nJohn Locher/ASSOCIATED PRESS Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) wasn't the only one to take a jab at debate stage newcomer Mike Bloomberg, but she hit him early and hard.\\n\\nNo one was holding back, but Warren was in a particular fighting mood, and it was a notable shift from past debates.\\n\\nHer hits on Bloomberg were numerous and incisive, but on multiple occasions, Warren literally went down the line of competitors alongside her on stage, picking apart their campaigning styles, records and policy platforms.\\n\\nMayor Buttigieg really has a slogan that was thought up by his consultants to paper over a thin version of a plan that would leave millions of people unable to afford their health care, Warren said of his so-called Medicare for All Who Want It public option plan. It's not a plan; it's a PowerPoint. And Amy's plan is even less. It's like a Post-it note, insert plan here.\\n\\nWarren later added Klobuchar's plan was only two paragraphs to really drive the point home.\\n\\nShe even took a jab — albeit a smaller one — at Sanders, whom she has often buddied up with on the debate stage.\\n\\nBernie has started very much — has a good start. But instead of expanding and bringing in more people to help, instead his campaign relentlessly attacks everyone who asks a question or tries to fill in details about how to actually make this work. And then his own advisers say, eh, probably won't happen anyway.\\n\\nWarren has had a hard time finding her footing in the race. She had an epic rise in early fall of 2019, when her brand as the woman with the plans made her look like a favorite for the early contests in Iowa and New Hampshire. Then her support fled to other candidates, such as Buttigieg and Klobuchar. And her third- and fourth-place finishes in Iowa and New Hampshire, respectively, stifled any momentum she had in earlier months of campaigning.\\n\\nWarren's campaign made it clear that they see this primary process in the long term, and Warren herself made it clear that she's not standing down.\\n\\nButtigieg and Klobuchar really don't seem to like each other.\\n\\nIt's been clear for a couple of debates that Klobuchar and Buttigieg have some sourness toward each other. Early on, Klobuchar questioned whether Buttigieg had the experience to hold the nation's highest office.\\n\\nOn Wednesday night, Buttigieg seemed to imply Klobuchar didn't have the intelligence, highlighting a moment last week when the senator couldn't name the president of Mexico.\\n\\nYou're staking your candidacy on your Washington experience, Buttigieg said. You're on the committee that oversees border security. You're on the committee that does trade. You're literally in part of the committee that's overseeing these things and were not able to speak to literally the first thing about the politics of the country to our south.\\n\\nAre you trying to say that I'm dumb? Or are you mocking me here, Pete? Klobuchar retorted.\\n\\nAnd that wasn't the only tense moment between the two.\\n\\nJohn Locher/ASSOCIATED PRESS Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) got into a dust-up with Pete Buttigieg over a gaffe last week about the name of Mexico's president.\\n\\nThe Medicare For All fight you have definitely heard before isn't going anywhere.\\n\\nLike at every Democratic debate, the health care fight Wednesday was about Medicare for All, and, drum roll please, how the country can pay for it.\\n\\nButtigieg seemed most eager to pick this fight with Sanders, especially in light of recent news about the Culinary Workers Union — a powerful organizing force in Nevada that said it received harassing messages from Sanders supporters after signaling to its members that Medicare for All would be bad for them.\\n\\nWe can actually deliver health care without taking it away from anyone, Buttigieg said. And we can build a movement without having legions of our supporters online and in person attacking Democratic figures and union leaders alike.\\n\\nButtigieg brought up the subject again later in the debate, focusing on the cost of Medicare for All.\\n\\nHe's said that it's impossible to even know how much it's going to cost, and even after raising taxes on everybody making $29,000, there is still a multitrillion-dollar hole, Buttigieg said.\\n\\nFor close watchers of the debate, Buttigieg is repeating an attack that Sanders, and Warren, have confronted before. As proposed, Sanders' Medicare for All plan, which would move all Americans to a single government-run health insurance program, is more generous than most private-sector plans. He has not identified a payment plan but instead cites a list of possible taxes he supports. And for unions with even stronger health care plans, Sanders has since said he would include a provision mandating companies with union-negotiated health plans to enter contract negotiations under the National Labor Relations Board.\\n\\nDemocrats have been in a seemingly never-ending debate about the appropriate future of health care in the United States. That fight doesn't seem to be going anywhere.\\n\\nBernie Sanders isn't going anywhere either.\\n\\nSanders is a leading candidate. He's rising in the polls. He looks poised to win the caucuses in Nevada and have a strong showing on Super Tuesday, March 3.\\n\\nSanders faced some difficult subjects. He was met with familiar attacks on his health care plan and his self-proclaimed democratic socialism. And he was asked yet again to answer for angry online supporters.\\n\\nWe have over 10.6 million people on Twitter, and 99.9% of them are decent human beings, are working people, are people who believe in justice, compassion and love, Sanders said. And if there are a few people who make ugly remarks, who attack trade union leaders, I disown those people. They are not part of our movement.\\n\\nBut Sanders was doing just as much of the attacking Wednesday. He came to the debate already a winner of a primary contest and with the momentum behind him.\\n\\nSeeing how feisty the rest of the field was, it's clear that some of the other candidates got that message, too: If things continue as they are, the race could consolidate around Sanders in a couple of weeks.\\n\\nOr it could be completely up for grabs."}

It shows that the rankings' indicators and methods of measurement are highly flawed and that the rankings often contradict one another.

In fact, ALEC's 20 best states are actually poorer than its 20 worst states, as this graph from Grading the States shows.\\n\\nThe ALEC agenda is the basis of Kansas' income tax cut experiment, which has undermined the state's ability to invest in areas like K-12 education and balance its budget. The state is in a precarious fiscal position, and the promised boost to the economy hasn't materialized -- and probably never will. That's because big, broad-based income tax cuts are a poor strategy for economic growth, as both recent history and the preponderance of research show.\\n\\nGrading the States exposes the rankings for their disservice to state policy debates and offers evidence for what really matters for state economic growth -- investing in kids, infrastructure, and a healthy, productive workforce.\\n\\nThis post originally appeared on Off the Charts, the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities' blog."}

{"original": "The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is escalating its campaign against kratom with the release of new information describing a series of deaths involving the popular herbal drug.\\n\\nThe FDA says the incidents underscore the serious and sometimes deadly risks of kratom, but the list contains a number of events in which kratom played an uncertain role, including a case in which a teenager hanged himself, and another in which a drug overdose victim tested positive for nine different substances.\\n\\nAs a whole, the data suggests the FDA is basing its warnings about kratom's fatal harms on a patchwork of loosely sourced anecdotal reports that say very little about how the drug is responsible for the fatalities ― or even whether it is at all.\\n\\nIn a press release Tuesday, FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb sought to reinforce a November public health advisory in which he claimed there was clear data on the increasing harms associated with kratom. At the time, the FDA said it was aware of 36 deaths involving kratom, which it held up as evidence of the gravest of the drug's potential harms. The FDA has found eight additional cases since then, Gottlieb said Tuesday, bringing the total number of kratom-associated deaths to 44. He also announced the agency had conducted a novel scientific analysis of kratom that further supports the FDA's characterization of the substance as an opioid.\\n\\nThis new data adds to our body of substantial scientific evidence supporting our concerns about the safety and abuse potential of kratom, said Gottlieb. As the scientific data and adverse event reports have clearly revealed, compounds in kratom make it so it isn't just a plant — it's an opioid.\\n\\nKratom is an herb derived from the leaves of a Southeast Asian tree related to coffee. It's sold in the U.S. as an unregulated herbal supplement and commonly taken in powder form in capsules or tea. Kratom has opioid-like effects and is often used as a mood enhancer, or for its stimulant or sedative qualities, which can vary depending on the dose and strain. Supporters regularly tout it as a natural treatment for conditions like chronic pain, anxiety and depression. Others claim it's a safer alternative to traditional opioids, both legal and illegal, which has also contributed to kratom's increasing popularity as a step-down treatment off of painkillers or heroin.\\n\\nBut due to the lack of regulations around herbal supplements, kratom is largely free from consumer standards on quality or dosing, leading to fears about the possible adulteration of products and problems related to improper self-medication or misuse by youth. The FDA has maintained that kratom is dangerous, and has pointed to the lack of an approved medical use as justification to impound numerous shipments of kratom products into the U.S.\\n\\nAlissa Scheller An assortment of kratom products. The FDA says its aware of 44 deaths associated with kratom.\\n\\nOn Tuesday, Gottlieb reiterated concerns about kratom's potential for abuse, addiction, and serious health consequences; including death. As proof of the drug's deadly harm, the FDA released reports on 36 deaths involving the use of kratom, culled from academic research, medical examiner reports and adverse event reports. Gottlieb also said the FDA plans to release the eight newly received reports.\\n\\nAlmost all of the FDA's cases involve subjects who were found to be on multiple substances at the time of their death, with the vast majority including either illicit or prescription drugs that carry well-known fatal risks.\\n\\nOne incident describes a teenager who had hanged himself after struggling with depression and prescription drug abuse. He tested positive for a variety of drugs, including kratom, as well as alcohol and a handful of prescription drugs.\\n\\nFDA A passage from a medical examiner's report on a case the FDA includes in its list of kratom-associated deaths.\\n\\nAnother case involves a man who had fallen out a window, broken his arm and refused treatment before dying. He was ultimately found to have had nine different substances in his bloodstream, among them mitragynine, the primary psychoactive substance in kratom.\\n\\nFDA's list of kratom-related deaths also includes a 43-year-old man determined to have died from complications due to deep vein thrombosis. He had a long list of medical problems, including chronic back and shoulder pain and a history of alcohol and prescription drug abuse. At the time of his death, he'd recently been prescribed five different medicines. His toxicology test came back positive for opioids, benzodiazepines ― best known as Xanax ― anti-depressants and a medication apparently used to treat his Tourette's syndrome. He also tested positive for kratom.\\n\\nFDA The FDA considers this individual's death related to his kratom use, though the report details a lengthy medical history of medical problems, including prescription drug abuse.\\n\\nOne case the FDA listed as a kratom-related death, which has been completely redacted in the document, appears elsewhere in an agency database as a death by homicide due to a gunshot wound to the chest.\\n\\nNine of the FDA's 36 documented deaths were related to a string of fatal overdoses in Sweden in 2010, which involved a controversial kratom-based product that had been adulterated with a dangerous synthetic opioid. An additional eight cases that FDA previously released to HuffPost consisted largely of voluntary reports, including accounts from family members who simply suspected their loved ones had died from kratom use.\\n\\nJust one of the FDA's cases appears to involve the presence of kratom alone, though the report includes no information on the death apart from the subject's age and ethnicity. The report shows the individual tested positive for high levels of mitragynine, but as in the rest of the cases, says nothing about how the substance was determined to have contributed to his death. The FDA denied HuffPost's request for additional information on that case.\\n\\nIn his Tuesday statement, Gottlieb said the agency is investigating another kratom-related death involving an individual who had no known historical or toxicologic evidence of opioid use, except for kratom.\\n\\nTaken together, the FDA case reports provide no clear picture of the deadly risks the agency claims kratom poses. There's also a certain irony in the fact that so many of the deaths the FDA associates with kratom also appear to have involved prescription drugs, which it argues must be safer than kratom.\\n\\nIn fairness to the FDA, it has acknowledged the limitations of the reporting systems used to compile these deaths. On its website, the FDA says the inclusion of a case doesn't imply a causal relationship between a product and an event. It also notes that reports do not always contain enough detail to properly evaluate an event.\\n\\nGottlieb appears to be at least somewhat aware of these constraints.\\n\\nMany of the cases received could not be fully assessed because of limited information provided, he said in the statement, adding that a few cases raise concern that kratom is being used in combination with other drugs.\\n\\nCases of mixing kratom, other opioids, and other types of medication is extremely troubling because the activity of kratom at opioid receptors indicates there may be similar risks of combining kratom with certain drugs, just as there are with FDA-approved opioids, Gottlieb said.\\n\\nGlottlieb specifically referenced prior FDA warnings about kratom's side effects, including seizures and respiratory depression. But these potentially deadly symptoms don't appear in any sort of discernible pattern in the cases the FDA cites, and they're not well-documented elsewhere. While scientific studies on the effects of mitragynine on humans are still lacking ― largely because it's difficult to get funding for research on a plant that can't be patented ― most of the emerging science on kratom has found it to be largely benign, especially when taken in low or moderate doses.\\n\\nAndrew Kruegel, a Columbia University chemist, has authored a number of studies on the pharmacology of kratom. On Tuesday, he questioned Gottlieb's conclusion that the substance is simply an opioid, a conclusion the commissioner based off the FDA's use of computational modeling on the chemical structures of kratom's compounds.\\n\\nThey don't have to do this to claim that kratom is an opioid, because it is, said Kruegel. But the question is whether it's an atypical opioid, which is my preferred terminology. Does it have a better side-effect profile than the classical opioid drugs like morphine that we use every day? That's the key question here.\\n\\nKruegel added that the FDA's analysis was an order of magnitude less rigorous than many of the studies that had already been conducted on kratom. He said the FDA's claim was akin to saying that all opioid agonists have the same effect, which is not true based on what we've learned about these compounds. (Opioid agonists provide pain relief by binding to opioid receptors.)\\n\\nThe FDA's presentation of kratom-related deaths appears to follow a broader practice, in which officials seem to be determining that any fatal incident involving kratom must therefore be related to the drug. But this haphazard characterization of kratom's supposed deadly risks does nothing to expand our understanding of how the drug supposedly kills people, if it does at all. And in fact, lumping these cases together despite their obvious dissimilarities may end up producing a misleading narrative about kratom's actual effects, said Leo Beletsky, an associate professor of law and health sciences at Northeastern University.\\n\\nYou have to identify and isolate the effect of the drug, and the only real way to do that is through randomized controlled trials or really robust observational evidence, he said. We don't have that.\\n\\nFDA's data could have severe implications for the future of kratom. The latest press release comes as the agency appears to be leading a push to ban the substance under federal law. Following pushback, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration postponed a move to place kratom in Schedule I, alongside drugs like heroin and LSD. But the FDA recently completed an analysis that may help determine how the DEA proceeds. A spokesperson for the DEA said Tuesday that it could take months or even years for the agency to reach a final decision on scheduling.\\n\\nBased on the FDA's recent public actions, however, it appears to favor outright prohibition, a move that would cut off millions of Americans ― many of whom have struggled with opioids or other prescription drugs ― from their preferred method of treatment. Some drug policy experts and a handful of congressional lawmakers have said the damage caused by forcing people away from kratom, and possibly back onto other prescription or illicit drugs, would far outweigh the current harms. Furthermore, if kratom were to be banned, many individuals would simply continue buying and using it illegally. If feds are worried about controlling kratom now, driving it onto the black market will only make that harder.\\n\\nBeletsky admitted there was still a lot of uncertainty surrounding kratom, and said it warrants further research to better understand its full range of effects and possible harms. But considering there are an estimated 3 to 5 million kratom users around the U.S., according to industry figures, he added that the relatively low number of supposed kratom-related deaths ― even in questionable cases like these ― could actually suggest that kratom is not very harmful.\\n\\nThe only times we've found kratom to be involved in adverse events are times when even in the absence of kratom, you'd still have really deleterious effects, he said. I worry that by taking these kratom-involved adverse events and painting them as kratom-caused adverse events, we're going to run into a misclassification of what the problem is, and then, as a result, we're going to deploy policy solutions that are based on that faulty classification."}
{"original": "A gay Mormon who became famous for his mixed-orientation marriage has announced that he's divorcing his wife and hopes to fall in love with a man.\\n\\nMormon blogger Josh Weed was formerly a poster child for mixed-orientation marriages in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, which views queer relationships as sinful. But in a blog post published last week, he said he came to realize that he could no longer be married to his partner, Laurel Weed, who is a straight woman.\\n\\nTogether, the pair also apologized to queer Mormons for the way their story has been used to bully others.\\n\\nWe're sorry for any degree that our existence, and the publicity of our supposedly successful marriage made you feel 'less than' as you made your own terribly difficult choices. And we're sorry if our story made it easier for people in your life to reject you and your difficult path as being wrong, the Jan. 25 blog read. If this is you, we want you to know: you were right.\\n\\nYou listened to your gut and to God and did a brave, brave thing. Now I'm following your example.\\n\\nGeorge Frey via Getty Images A pride flag flies in front of the Salt Lake Temple of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Utah.\\n\\nIn 2012, Josh Weed wrote a viral blog post in which he came out as a gay Mormon who was very happily married to a straight woman. He wrote that his wife, a childhood friend, knew about his sexual orientation before they were married and that he decided to marry her because he believed in the doctrines of the Mormon church, wanted to have a traditional family and genuinely loved his wife.\\n\\nThe story attracted a flurry of media attention, leading to features on ABC's Nightline and the VH1 reality television show I'm Married To A...\\n\\nNow, he says his former approach toward queer sexuality was a manifestation of lingering internalized homophobia. While he believes his marriage was beautiful and he still thinks of his wife as his very best friend, the relationship contained an undercurrent of pain the pair were not able to see clearly for years, he said.\\n\\nHe also wrote that he had always thought of himself as a broken straight person ― someone who was meant to be straight and whom God would one day fix. But he realizes now that viewing himself as fundamentally broken has led to overwhelming sadness in his life and at times, to suicidal thoughts, he added.\\n\\nThe things I talked about in my coming out post in 2012 weren't false. The joy I felt was real! The love I felt was real, but something in me wanted to die, he wrote. It's the thing that wants to die in all of us when we don't have hope for attachment to a person we are oriented towards.\\n\\nAfter about 15 years of marriage, the idea of going for decades more without experiencing authentic romantic and sexual attachment was finally too great a burden to bear ― for both of them, the couple said.\\n\\nIn the post, Laurel Weed wrote about how being married to her husband had brought her both immeasurable joy and pain. There was a void in their connection, and it wasn't just about sex, she wrote.\\n\\nPlatonic love is simply not enough, no matter how much we hoped it was, she said. God designed us to need and want romantic attachment.\\n\\nA post shared by Josh Weed (@the_weed) on Jan 1, 2016 at 12:06am PST\\n\\nThe pair also wanted to acknowledge how their story had caused pain for others in the queer Mormon community.\\n\\nWhen they went public with their story in 2012, Josh Weed said that he and his wife had very little exposure to gay people. But not long after their post went viral, they began to receive messages from queer Mormons about how the Weeds' mixed-orientation marriage had been used as an impossible standard.\\n\\nKathy Carlston, a queer Mormon from Syracuse, Utah, told HuffPost she feels the Weeds have often spoken against their story being used as an example for other queer Mormons. Still, she said that didn't prevent straight Mormons from holding it up as a standard and implying that, if they can do it, so can you.\\n\\nCarlston said she had been publicly out of the closet for about a month when the Weeds' original blog post went viral in 2012. At least 10 different members of her church sent it to her as if they had given me the panacea for my gayness, she said.\\n\\nI personally felt insulted and unheard, as none of those who had sent me the link had taken time to ask me what my experience had been like as a queer Mormon, Carlston said. Admittedly, the experience at the time was a bit humiliating. I had never found myself to be a lightning rod for folks to unleash their evangelizing before. It showed me a bit of what would lie ahead for me in the church: people who were uninformed or unconcerned about the realities and direness of the queer Mormon experience.\\n\\nIn November 2015, the Mormon church clarified its approach toward same-sex relationships with a series of policy changes. Mormons in same-sex relationships were declared apostates. The church also resolved that the children of these couples would not be allowed to be baptized until they were 18, at which point they would need to move out of their parents' home and disavow their parents' relationship to be considered for membership in the church.\\n\\nThe church made its position on queer sexuality even clearer in 2016, when it updated a web page meant to serve as a resource for gay and lesbian Mormons and their allies. The website emphasized that the church believes it's OK to be Mormon and gay ― as long as members don't act out on what the church calls same-sex attraction. The page shares the stories of Mormons who identify as gay but have pledged to pursue a life of celibacy or who have committed themselves to mixed-orientation relationships.\\n\\nEntering into a mixed-orientation marriage or remaining celibate were held up as the only acceptable goal to achieve throughout my youth and young adult life, and continue to be held up as the standard, Carlston told HuffPost.\\n\\nA post shared by Josh Weed (@the_weed) on Oct 2, 2015 at 8:14pm PDT\\n\\nIn his post, Josh Weed wrote that this conservative religious approach toward queer sexuality was both cruel and dangerous. He said the church's stance can fill queer Mormons with self-loathing and internalized homophobia.\\n\\nThe thing that is most cruel to religious LGBTQIA folks is not the lack of partners, but the lack of hope for a partner—that is the thing that makes them want to die, he wrote. Not the loneliness, per se, but the decades and decades before them with no hope of attachment.\\n\\nIt is for this reason that comparisons of gay people to simply single people who have not married yet are so woefully lacking in nuance. I once heard the difference between these groups stated this way and it's always stuck with me: single Mormons go to bed every night pleading with the Lord that they will fall in love with someone tomorrow; gay Mormons go to bed every night pleading with the Lord that they will never fall in love with someone.\\n\\nHe said that he and his wife have felt that God is calling them to separate from each other and pursue true love. They hope to continue raising their children together. The plan is to acquire a property that will accommodate their family and the addition of future partners if that time comes.\\n\\nHe also said that he isn't sure whether the Mormon church will continue to accept him or allow his two youngest children to be baptized if he ends up in a same-sex relationship. Still, he said he would like to be a part of the church, though the institution itself might consider me an outsider, he wrote.\\n\\nFive years ago, he said, he believed that a gay person could choose to live the life of a straight person. But now he knows that isn't possible without serious consequences to mental health.\\n\\nInstead, he said he's focusing on the things he can choose.\\n\\nI can choose to love Lolly with every ounce of love a gay man can have for a woman. And I can choose to find a partner and love him as well, adoring him and attaching to him in the beautiful way I was always intended to.\\n\\nIf you or someone you know needs help, call 1-800-273-8255 for the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline.

{"original": "As the coronavirus outbreak continues to spread with nearly 100,000 confirmed cases globally, people are increasingly wondering how COVID-19 might affect our food supply and eating habits.\\n\\nWe've reached out to some leading food safety and public health experts for their advice. If you've been questioning whether to stay home from restaurants or if any foods are unsafe, here's what you need to know:\\n\\nCan coronavirus be transmitted through food?\\n\\nResearchers are still learning the specifics of how COVID-19 is transmitted, but we do know that the disease can spread through droplets that are released from the nose or mouth when someone coughs, sneezes or exhales.\\n\\nDisease transmission becomes possible when someone inhales these droplets or touches their eyes, mouth or nose after coming into contact with surfaces where these droplets land. As of now, there's no evidence of COVID-19 transmission through food.\\n\\nWe are not aware of any reports at this time of human illnesses that suggest COVID-19 can be transmitted by food or food packaging, a spokesperson from the USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service told HuffPost and mentioned in a statement.\\n\\nAs of now, there's no evidence of COVID-19 transmission through food.\\n\\nBenjamin Chapman, a professor and food safety extension specialist at North Carolina State University, explained that because the mode of infection is primarily respiratory, the chance of getting COVID-19 from food is extremely low. In fact, we don't see evidence of any respiratory viruses being transmitted through food in the past, he said.\\n\\nAre there foods in grocery stores we should avoid?\\n\\nSince there's no known transmission of COVID-19 through food, you don't need to worry about avoiding any foods in particular. A bigger concern when shopping is the risk of coronavirus transmission from person to person.\\n\\nIf you have people that are sick, you have the possibility for somebody to go into an area like that and transmit, said Jason Kindrachuck, assistant professor in the department of medical microbiology and infectious diseases at the University of Manitoba.\\n\\nSo yes, there is the possibility of getting sick if someone infected with COVID-19 is standing right beside you and sneezes while you're both searching for a ripe avocado, or if a droplet from an infected person lands on a package of cereal that you touch and then proceed to touch your face before washing your hands. But we still don't know how much of the virus needs to be present in order for transmission to occur.\\n\\nSergei Gnatiuk via Getty Images We are not aware of any reports at this time of human illnesses that suggest COVID-19 can be transmitted by food or food packaging, a spokesperson from the USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service told HuffPost.\\n\\nThis absolutely doesn't mean you should stop shopping, but you should be cautious and follow simple protective measures like regularly washing your hands, not touching your nose and mouth if your hands aren't clean, staying home if you're sick, covering your mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing, keeping a distance of at least three feet from people who are coughing or sneezing, and seeing a doctor if you have a fever, cough and trouble breathing.\\n\\nOne piece of advice I've been repeating on a regular basis to people who are concerned is, 'What are you doing right now to manage your risk from regular flu?' said Don Schaffner, extension specialist in food science and distinguished professor at Rutgers University. Many of the current recommendations for avoiding transmission of COVID-19 are similar.\\n\\nIs it safe to eat in restaurants?\\n\\nIn most cases, there's no reason to avoid visiting a restaurant due to fears of COVID-19 transmission. It is just the same as it was before we knew about coronavirus, Schaffner said. In other words, nothing is absolutely safe.\\n\\nSchaffner pointed out that even If the coronavirus is present in your food, it will be destroyed with proper cooking. But as with going to the supermarket, you'll want to be diligent about taking precautions similar to those recommended to prevent the spread of seasonal flu.\\n\\nWith an estimated 34,000-plus deaths from flu in 2018-19, we have a long way to go in managing risks, Chapman said. The respiratory virus risk in restaurants is really more about being in the same location as a lot of people, some of who can be depositing the virus on surfaces like tables, doors, menus, and managing that with a hand washing and alcohol-based sanitizer regime is an effective step to reduce risks of both COVID-19 and Influenza.\\n\\nOne piece of advice I've been repeating on a regular basis to people who are concerned is, 'What are you doing right now to manage your risk from regular flu?' - Don Schaffner, Rutgers University\\n\\nKeep in mind that someone who is sick probably isn't going to be heading out to a restaurant, Kindrachuk said, so your likelihood of going in and getting sick or getting infected is really, really minimal.\\n\\nThis is different from going to some sort of large public gathering with tens of thousands of people when there's a cluster of cases in an area, he pointed out. In that case, the potential for transmission would be higher due to the large number of people.\\n\\nMost of us know by now that public health advice strongly encourages staying home when sick. But for some restaurant workers, this isn't an option because of America's lack of important social services, as Rep. Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) pointed out in a recent tweet.\\n\\nI used to work in the food industry.\\n\\n\\n\\nI can't tell you how many times the people who handle your food - who are already overworked & underpaid - show up sick to work because our country refuses to guarantee healthcare or paid sick leave.\\n\\n\\n\\nWe need #MedicareForAll. — Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) February 25, 2020\\n\\nThe U.S. is one of a select few countries in the world without a national policy that ensures paid sick leave, leaving many low-wage restaurant workers with little choice but to go to work even when they're sick. Many are also deterred from seeing the doctor due to being uninsured or having health insurance policies that leave them with expensive bills.\\n\\nThe result is that you could be at risk of transmission when you're dining out. As HuffPost reporter Emily Peck noted in a recent piece on this topic, this isn't a coronavirus problem; it's a policy problem.\\n\\nAre there any precautions to take when preparing food at home?\\n\\nThe biggest tips to keep in mind when cooking at home are to wash your hands as much as possible and don't prepare food for others if you're showing symptoms, unless it's absolutely necessary to do so.\\n\\nWhen handling or preparing food, the government recommends following standard food safety practices, like washing hands and surfaces often, separating raw meat from other foods, refrigerating food, and cooking food to the appropriate temperature.\\n\\nDo we need to stockpile food to prepare for a possible quarantine?\\n\\nFood and hand sanitizer have been flying off supermarket shelves in the US as many people grow concerned that the coronavirus outbreak will make it harder to access food in the future. But is this necessary?\\n\\nOur experts agreed that if possible, it's not a bad idea to have some non-perishable food on hand in case a situation arises that prevents you from food shopping.\\n\\nDon Farrall via Getty Images There's no need to stock your pantry with more than a couple extra weeks' worth of food.\\n\\nIt's probably good to have a couple of extra weeks of supplies just so that you don't have to actually go and frequent these places if there happen to be cases that show up, Kindrachuk said. But he pointed out that storing enough supplies to last you months is likely going too far.\\n\\nThe recommendation to keep a reserve of food at home is largely based on avoiding crowds and potential disruptions to the food supply due to possible workforce shortages. It doesn't have anything to do with a fear of the food supply becoming contaminated, said Erin DiCaprio, assistant specialist in cooperative extension in community food safety at UC Davis.\\n\\nIf you decide to stock up, make sure to be reasonable with the amount of food you buy, and to use your food supply before it goes bad — food waste is still a problem, even in a time of a disease outbreak. I would hate for people to buy all of this extra food and then have it be something that goes to waste in the refrigerator, Dicaprio said.\\n\\nWhile you're resisting the temptation to empty store shelves, remember to exercise this restraint with masks, too. If you're not coughing or sneezing or caring for someone who is, you probably don't need to wear one.\\n\\nIt's imperative for us to understand that we need our first-line responders, especially those in hospital and clinical settings, to have access to those, Kindrachuck said. People need to have some restraint as well and understand that those supplies are going to be needed by the medical community.\\n\\nHere's what else to know."}
{"original": "Although 95 percent of people who own homes carry homeowners insurance, only 41 percent of renters have renters insurance, according to the Insurance Information Institute, which put the annual cost of a policy at an average of $188 in 2015. One reason for the disparity is that mortgage lenders often require homeowners to carry insurance on a property they're financing, while there is usually no such equivalency when leasing a property owned by someone else. But just because no one is making renters buy insurance, is that actually a reason not to? Unfortunately, the value of insurance often eludes us until we need it. Here are some things to consider if you're debating whether renters insurance is right for you: 1. How valuable are your belongings? There's a good chance you would weep harder if an airline lost your suitcase containing all your favorite clothes than if something wrecked your thrift store sofa. But what about a fire that comes along and destroys your apartment, wiping out all of your belongings and leaving you with ash and rubble? How much would it cost you to replace everything you lost? Most people think only of their big-ticket items like electronics and furniture. But the average renter owns $30,000 worth of possessions, according to Allstate. When you add up the value of all of your stuff, you may find that you would not be financially able to replace everything at once. Generally speaking, the older you are, the more possessions you've acquired. So take stock of what you have. And while you're logging your inventory, take photos of the big-ticket items and consider using a home inventory app. Should a fire actually occur, having a digital record will ease the claim-filing process. 2. What exactly will a renters policy cover that isn't covered by your landlord's insurance? Plenty. Generally speaking, renters insurance covers you against losses from fire or smoke, lightning, vandalism, theft, explosion, windstorm and certain types of water damage (such as from a burst pipe, or when the tenant upstairs leaves the bathtub running and floods your apartment). Most renters insurance policies do not cover floods or earthquakes. Flood coverage is available from the National Flood Insurance Program and a few private insurers. You can get earthquake insurance as a separate policy or have it added as an addendum to your renters policy, depending on where you live. And don't look to your landlord's policy to cover your personal losses. The landlord's insurance will probably cover replacing a window broken by a burglar, but it will not cover the laptop and TV the burglar stole. Your landlord's insurance will cover the physical structure of the building ― say, if a tree falls on the roof. A renter's policy wouldn't cover the roof repair, but it would cover any damage that the collapsed roof caused to your personal belongings. 3. What is an actual cash value policy, and is that the kind of insurance you need?\\n\\nAn actual cash value policy means that insurance will cover the actual current value of your items. So the Mac laptop you bought new in 2015 for $1,500 will be replaced not at $1,500, but at whatever its value is today. And there's a very good chance that amount won't be enough to replace it new.\\n\\nHowever, you can ask for a replacement cost value insurance policy, which would cover the cost of repairing or replacing your belongings at as-new prices. If a leak from your neighbor's broken pipe destroys your couch, insurance would allow you to buy a new couch, rather than just paying you the depreciated value of your current, damaged couch.\\n\\nBecause replacement cost value policies pay out more, they also cost more.\\n\\n4. Will a renters policy cover everything?\\n\\nNot hardly. Your policy may have an overall ceiling on the total amount it will pay out per claim, and may also set limits on individual categories of loss. For example, there may be a cap on jewelry. If that's the case and Grandma's diamond ring is stolen from your apartment, your policy may limit your claim to $1,000, even though the ring was valued at $3,000. The way to get around these limits is to have a personal property endorsement for extra coverage on an item. And yes, that will cost more.\\n\\nConfusion may be the biggest problem with renters insurance. Between different exclusions and limits, it can be hard to figure out what's covered. And who wants to pay money for something they don't understand? Go over your contract with your insurance agent and ask questions. Put the ball in their court, and ask them why you need renters insurance; let them spell out various scenarios. And if you have particular concerns ― are you covered if your iPhone goes for a swim in the toilet? ― raise them.\\n\\n5. Do you really need coverage for additional living expenses?\\n\\nWhen an event or natural disaster makes your apartment unlivable ― even for just a few days ― will you have another place to stay, or will you need to head to the nearest motel? Many renters insurance policies cover your housing expenses if you are displaced. Keep in mind that staying in a hotel for more than one night may cost more than your annual renters insurance premium. Plus, not all your friends will welcome you if you have pets, and the couch in your mom's house was never really all that comfortable anyway.\\n\\n6. Why would a renter need to carry liability insurance?\\n\\nBecause, quite simply, you are liable and you don't want to be on the hook for legal or medical bills if someone injures themselves in your apartment. Basic liability and medical payment coverage is standard in most renters insurance policies, which means when your cat leaves a gash on your soon-to-be-ex's face, you are covered. You are also covered when your friend slips and falls on your rug.\\n\\n7. What's the alternative?\\n\\nThe only alternative to having a renters policy is to not have one! That means you'd better be prepared to handle losses on your own if something happens. Some people manage by putting aside a little each week for an emergency fund, should they ever need to replace or repair their belongings. The problem with that is you likely wouldn't have enough saved to replace everything all at once: A 2016 Federal Reserve study found that half of Americans don't have enough savings to cover a $400 emergency.\\n\\nThere is some psychology involved in insurance. Most people don't want to feel they are wasting money, and there is no tangible reward for carrying insurance unless you use it. So it really comes down to this: Is your peace of mind worth 50 cents a day? That's about what a policy will cost."}
{"original": "In the swinger community, a single female swinger is called a unicorn because of her rarity. Generally speaking, most swingers are couples. Couples that are looking to play with a single female swinger are sometimes said to be unicorn hunting.\\n\\nI know because I spent just over four years as a unicorn and learned a lot about relationships, both in and out of bed. And, more important, a lot about myself and what I do and don't want.\\n\\nWhen I was 23, a friend I've known since middle school had discovered a swingers club in the heart of downtown Cleveland, and neither of us could resist the lure of doing something that would firmly divorce us from the good girls we used to be.\\n\\nAfter registering online for an individual annual membership (which was $10 for single women and $75 for single men or couples), we read the lifestyle rules while waiting for our e-passes. The club was BYOB with a strict no-drug policy. You left your bottle of choice with the bartender, and the club supplied the mixers.\\n\\nDuring the summer of 2008, I was really into Champagne and Red Bull, so my friend and I had a few Champagne cocktails before heading downtown. By the time we got to the club, we were already high on post-adolescent rebellion and liquid courage. After leaving a bottle of Andre with the bartender, we commenced le grand tour.\\n\\nThe setup was pretty boring. There was a bar, a dance floor, a room with surprisingly good canapes and a variety of private rooms down dimly lit hallways.\\n\\nWhere was the trapeze-like sex apparatus hanging from the ceiling? Or the dominatrix with clamped nipples and the obligatory whip? Or the sketchy middle-aged white guy jacking off into the dessert? It was nothing like I imagined based on romance novels and Skinemax. We came prepared for a den of iniquity and instead were faced with normal people and a normal club.\\n\\nAfter some dancing and a few more drinks, we decided to check out the private rooms.\\n\\nGood sex clubs are all about consent, and there are rules in place to make sure everyone feels safe and comfortable.\\n\\nA closed door means the party is full. An open or cracked door means you can come in and observe. If you like what you see, you can ask the couple/group if you can join them. Whatever their response is, it is not to be contested. My girlfriend and I had no interest in participating that night. We just wanted to watch.\\n\\nOwl-eyed and giggling, we poked our heads into every room with an open door. We saw a man getting a blow job from two women, an erect penis sticking out of a glory hole like some disembodied phallic fantasy, a woman sitting on a nightstand while a man knelt before her.\\n\\nWhen we got back to the bar, a middle-aged woman was on the dance floor in nothing but a body stocking, encouraging men to pinch her nipples and pet her body through the mesh. I was intrigued.\\n\\nThis woman who was easily 20 years my senior, with her imperfect body and questionable rhythm, danced with confident abandon. She owned her sexuality in a way I yearned to.\\n\\nAfter that night, I got into the habit of checking the swinger club's event page. Every weekend for almost five months, I hyped myself up and talked myself out of going back. I was tempted by the idea of Dungeon night and Day-Glo night, but I could resist them.\\n\\nWhat I couldn't resist was the Sybian. A Sybian is a vibrator on steroids. It's a saddle-like device with an electric motor stronger than most lawnmowers. A wriggling, rotating dildo protrudes from the center of the device. Vibrating pads at the base of the seat provide additional clitoral stimulation. The closest I'd been to one was watching women use it in porn.\\n\\nWomen's faces sell porn. Either they look enraptured or ashamed, depending on the genre. Sybian porn is different. Women riding Sybians have ugly, real orgasm faces.\\n\\nBarring a sudden six-figure windfall, I would never be able to purchase a $1,500 sex toy. This really was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.\\n\\nI had to go back to the club. This time, I was alone.\\n\\nThere was a line of women waiting to try the Sybian and a circle of men in the room to watch. I was close enough to the door to see the women having a good time. Their faces were contorted with ecstasy. One woman actually cried. They looked so free.\\n\\nFinally, it was my turn. The Sybian had been disinfected and covered with a condom, ready for my use. The man operating the machine offered me lube.\\n\\nI don't need any, I said with a wink, wanting to impress the crowd.\\n\\nHere's a tip: When someone offers you lube, the answer is always yes.\\n\\nThere were so many eyes on me, I couldn't relax. It felt good, but I also kind of felt like I needed to pee. I wasn't anywhere near turned on enough to squirt, so I was pretty sure I had to pee. I was going through the motions, making sure my breasts bounced attractively while thinking, Don't pee! Don't pee!\\n\\nThe man directly to my left asked if he could play with my breasts. I said yes. It felt good, but like the Sybian, it wasn't going to get me off.\\n\\nI was not having the ride of my life. I was too inside my head, and orgasm was slipping away like the sun over the horizon. But I had waited in line for almost an hour, and there were all these men around me, excited, expectant, awaiting my pleasure.\\n\\nI faked an orgasm to avoid disappointing them, never realizing how much I was letting myself down.\\n\\nI went back once or twice a month after that, determined to have a real orgasm at the club. In that time I met:\\n\\nThe guy who only used technical terms during sex. Him: Do you want me to kiss your pretty brown anus? Me: Um, no.\\n\\nThe guy who kept apologizing for slavery. Awkward.\\n\\nThe really hot guy who never got fully hard. (We met up twice outside of the club. I have a three-strike rule).\\n\\nNo matter what I tried, I could never relax enough to actually come. Don't get me wrong, I was enjoying the sex I was having, the kissing and skin to skin contact as well as the act itself, I just wasn't having orgasms.\\n\\nThen, in October of 2008, I got a DUI in the parking lot of my building. (To the officer's credit, I did throw up on her.) I had spent the better part of the evening taking shots of tequila with a bartender I wanted to bang.\\n\\nI was kicking ass at work, but my personal life was spiraling out of control. So, naturally, I decided to drown my sorrows in anonymous sex. But the more I went to the club, the more random people I slept with, the less I liked myself.\\n\\nI may have been a unicorn, but my life was no fantasy.\\n\\nDon't get me wrong, there is magic to be found in a sex club, especially between partners who both honestly enjoy swinging. I experienced this once with a couple I picked up in the summer of 2011.\\n\\nBy that time, I had gotten pretty good at giving women orgasms. There is something about a female orgasm that gives you a sense of accomplishment you just don't get with men.\\n\\nThis particular husband and wife both enjoyed sex with women. Most of the couples I had been with were men with heterosexual wives who had voyeuristic tendencies. This couple both wanted me, and that was a heady feeling.\\n\\nI was having sex with the husband when the wife started coming. She sat straight up, locking eyes with her husband as I expertly stroked her.\\n\\nYes, baby, he said. You're so beautiful.\\n\\nI love you! she replied. They were sharing an incredibly intimate moment, and I was just... there. I was the voyeur. He was inside me, and I was still the third wheel. I went home and cried.\\n\\nI should have stopped then, but anonymous, unsatisfying sex had become my drug of choice. Sex was cheaper than drugs. No one at church could smell sex on my breath or coming out of my pores. I wasn't hurting anyone important, only myself.\\n\\nI kept escalating until one night I agreed to have rough sex with two guys. I was bruised and sore the next day, but a part of me felt like I had gotten what I deserved.\\n\\nI broke down and told my therapist I was sleeping with random strangers.\\n\\nIs the sex good? she asked. I shook my head. Well, then why are you doing it?\\n\\nI didn't have an answer for her. I decided to be celibate until I figured it out.\\n\\nEventually I realized how severe my trust issues were. Sex was just the latest in a string of narcotics I was using to satisfy my hunger for unconditional love. The club wasn't the problem. I was.\\n\\nThe majority of singles and couples I met in the lifestyle visited clubs to explore their sexuality in a safe and judgment-free environment, deepen their intimacy with their partner, or have consensual, no-strings-attached sex. The majority of people are in the right place for the right reason, and within that context, sex clubs can be empowering.\\n\\nI wasn't in the majority. I was deeply depressed and emotionally fragile. I used the sex club as a way to avoid the intimacy and vulnerability of a relationship. I didn't believe anyone would want to be around me for longer than it took to get off, since I could barely stand to be around myself.\\n\\nLooking back on it now, I realize that I was searching for something I should have been generating. The dancing woman in her bodystocking and the couple whose intimacy moved me to tears already knew what I'm finally discovering: Unconditional self-love is the safety net that supports freedom ― sexual or otherwise.\\n\\nDo you have a personal story you'd like to see published on HuffPost?

{"original": "When Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos addressed the Conservative Political Action Conference on Thursday, she began her remarks with a brief introduction.\\n\\nI'm Betsy DeVos. You may have heard some of the 'wonderful' things the mainstream media has called me lately, she said. I, however, pride myself on being called a mother, a grandmother, a life partner, and perhaps the first person to tell Bernie Sanders to his face that there's no such thing as a free lunch.\\n\\nWhile DeVos' free lunch statement was a joke meant to make her right-wing audience chuckle and to highlight the price tag on government programs, her choice of words was very troubling to many parents, educators and child welfare advocates.\\n\\nBecause the fact of the matter is, for millions of children in the United States ― all of whom she's pledged to serve as education secretary ― there is such a thing as a free lunch. And the important role it plays in their education and well-being is no laughing matter.\\n\\nChristian Science Monitor via Getty Images In 2012, more than 31 million children received meals through the National School Lunch program.\\n\\nIn 1946, President Truman signed the National School Lunch Act, which established the National School Lunch Program. The meal program provides free and reduced-price lunches to children from low-income backgrounds. In 2012, more than 31 million children received meals through the program on a daily basis.\\n\\nFor many of these children, that free lunch at school is the only meal they will eat that day. According to the nonprofit No Kid Hungry, about 13 million kids in the U.S. struggle with hunger. Data from the National Center for Education Statistics shows that the amount of public school students living in poverty rose from 17 percent to 22 percent between 2000 and 2013.\\n\\nKnowing the importance of free lunch programs, many Twitter users criticized DeVos' choice of phrase as ignorant and chastised her for using a reality faced by so many children in poverty as a punchline for a joke.\\n\\nFor those of us who were in great need of the free lunch program when we were in #school, @BetsyDeVos's stmt is offensive & ignorant. https://t.co/cYD4VuKb1R — Christa Avampato (@christanyc) February 23, 2017\\n\\nLiterally, millions of public school children in poverty get free lunch at school because otherwise they won't eat. https://t.co/nKOQxotab9 — Soledad O'Brien (@soledadobrien) February 23, 2017\\n\\n@NBCNews it's free to the children who need to eat, and that is the important part. — Carol Pumpian (@capumpian) February 23, 2017\\n\\nAs a child who received free/reduced lunch, that's not something to joke about.

She was then taken to Washington, according to her elder son, Hossein Hashemi.\\n\\nThe FBI said in an email that it had no comment on the arrest of the woman who was born Melanie Franklin in New Orleans and has worked for Iran's state television network for 25 years.\\n\\nHossein Hashemi said his mother lives in Tehran and comes back to this country about once a year to see her family, usually scheduling documentary work somewhere in the U.S. as well.\\n\\nWe still have no idea what's going on, said Hashemi, a research fellow at the University of Colorado who was interviewed by phone from Washington. He also said he and his siblings had been subpoenaed to appear before a grand jury.\\n\\nThe incident comes as Iran faces increasing criticism of its own arrests of dual citizens and other people with Western ties. Those cases have previously been used as bargaining chips in negotiations with world powers.\\n\\nATTA KENARE/AFP/Getty Images Journalists photograph and film a poster depicting Marzieh Hashemi, during a press conference by her employer Press TV in Tehran on Jan. 16, 2019.\\n\\nFederal law allows judges to order witnesses to be arrested and detained if the government can prove their testimony has extraordinary value for a criminal case and that they would be a flight risk and unlikely to respond to a subpoena. The statute generally requires those witnesses to be promptly released once they are deposed.\\n\\nMarzieh Hashemi, an American citizen, had not been contacted by the FBI before she was detained and would absolutely have been willing to cooperate with the agency, her son said.\\n\\nAsked whether his mother had been involved in any criminal activity or knew anyone who might be implicated in a crime, Hashemi said, We don't have any information along those lines.\\n\\nHashemi said his mother was arrested as she was about to board a flight from St. Louis to Denver. A spokesman for St. Louis Lambert International Airport declined to comment and referred questions to the FBI.\\n\\nThe constitutionality of the material witness law has never been meaningfully tested, said Ricardo J. Bascuas, a professor at the University of Miami School of Law. The government only relies on it when they need a reason to arrest somebody but they don't have one.\\n\\nNo matter the reason for Marzieh Hashemi's detention, she should have been granted a court appearance by now, Bascuas said.\\n\\nShe apparently was unable to call her daughter until Tuesday night. The family is trying to hire an attorney, but it has been difficult because she has not been charged with a crime, her son said.\\n\\nIran's state broadcaster held a news conference and launched a hashtag campaign for Hashemi, using the same techniques families with loved ones held in the Islamic Republic use to highlight their cases.\\n\\nWe will not spare any legal action to help her, said Paiman Jebeli, deputy chief of Iran's state IRIB broadcaster. Iran's Press TV aired footage of her anchoring news programs and discussing the war in Syria, set to dramatic music.\\n\\nThere were no references to any case against Hashemi in U.S. federal courts, nor in Missouri.\\n\\nHashemi describes herself online as having studied journalism at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge. She converted to Islam in 1982 at age 22 after meeting Iranian activist students in Denver.\\n\\nShe married a man she met while in journalism school. They had two sons and a daughter.

{"original": "Hindustan Times via Getty Images File image of Home Minister Amit Shah.\\n\\nIt has finally happened. Almost two days after the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) won just eight of the 70 seats in the Delhi elections, 37 short of his prediction, home minister Amit Shah has said that hate remarks such as goli maaro and India-Pakistan match should not have been made during the campaign.\\n\\nSuch remarks may have resulted in the party's defeat in the elections, he admitted during a programme organised by Times Now.\\n\\nUnion minister Anurag Thakur had encouraged a crowd to chant the incendiary slogan during a rally in Delhi, later telling The Indian Express that he had merely asked people what should be done with traitors of the country. He did not face any official rebuke from the BJP.\\n\\nDespite his statement last month that Shaheen Bagh protesters will rape, kill your sisters, BJP MP Parvesh Verma was allowed to initiate a debate on the Motion of Thanks to the President's address in the Lok Sabha.\\n\\nEven discounting the party's tacit and active encouragement of leaders who made all attempts to polarise the Delhi electorate, Shah's comments are ironic because, as Frontline has pointed out, the Home Minister led this hate campaign. At a rally in Delhi, he had said that people should press the EVM button with such anger that the protesters in Shaheen Bagh feel the current.\\n\\nWhen asked about his remark on Shaheen Bagh at the Times Now event, Shah said it wasn't about actually electrocuting someone.

{"original": "Report Card Day.\\n\\nIf you're like me, just hearing the name brings back memories of grade school and the carbon copy sheets of paper that would be handed out at the end of each marking period.\\n\\nWhile these report cards might not have always had the A that I wanted, they helped me, and my parents, better understand where I was doing well and where I needed a bit more help.\\n\\nOf course report cards aren't only for students; schools, districts and states all receive annual reports detailing their performance. And now in Tennessee, future educators are excited to see a new kind of report card -- one that rates the very teacher preparation programs that will prepare them for the classroom.\\n\\nBack in December, the Tennessee State Board of Education, with support from Tennessee Commissioner of Education Candice McQueen, debuted their newly redesigned 2016 Teacher Preparation Report Card. Having served as the dean of the college of education at Lipscomb University, Commissioner McQueen knows firsthand that to improve student outcomes, the state needs to get better at preparing the state's educators. Supporting the new Teacher Preparation Report Card is part of that effort.\\n\\nIn March, the Department will follow-up the release of the Teacher Preparation Report Card with its own Annual Report that will allow preparation providers to focus on effective interventions to drive improved outcomes. These Annual Reports will also be used to determine ongoing approval for all providers. The Teacher Preparation Report Card and the forthcoming Annual Report are two steps Tennessee has taken to accomplish better transparency and focus on continuous improvement for educators. As a member of the Council of Chief State School Officers (CCSSO)'s Network for Transforming Educator Preparation (NTEP), Tennessee has committed to strengthening educator preparation through specific policy levers, including how teachers are prepared, licensed and equipped to help kids on day one. Now in its fourth year of existence, NTEP currently connects 13 states and experts from over 20 national education organizations to elevate best practices in transforming educator preparation.\\n\\nTennessee's new Teacher Preparation Report Card is one of the innovative ways the state is using data to guide improvements to teacher preparation across the state. The report measures how each teacher preparation provider -- whether a college or university or an alternative route -- is meeting the needs of future teachers and classrooms. This includes how well a program is able to prepare a more diverse pool of educators and meet district staffing needs in high-demand subject areas.\\n\\nThe report card also measures a provider's impact by tracking whether graduates secure jobs in Tennessee public schools. Most importantly, the report cards highlight how well graduates positively impact student achievement during their early careers.\\n\\nWith this information, aspiring teachers can determine which preparation program and partner district would best support their pathway to enter the profession and better serve all students. Preparation programs and local school districts can also use the information in the report card to identify what is working well and what they need to do differently to better prepare teachers for the experiences they'll face in the classroom.\\n\\nTennessee's stakeholders agree with this approach. Across the state, educators, teacher preparation programs and stakeholders, like the State Collaborative on Reforming Education (SCORE), have helped to build momentum for these changes. SCORE's recent report, Prepared For Day One: Improving the Effectiveness of Early-Career Teaching, uses current research to outline specific recommendations for the future of Tennessee's educator preparation system. These recommendations align closely with Commissioner McQueen's vision and echo the goals laid out by state education leads in CCSSO's task force report, Our Responsibility, Our Promise, which provided the foundation for our NTEP work.\\n\\nTennessee is truly at the forefront of using data responsibly and effectively to drive improvement within its teacher preparation programs. The Tennessee Department of Education and State Board of Education provide a strong model for other states looking to incorporate similar changes by not only showcasing effective use of data-driven improvements, but also through highlighting the importance of buy-in and collaboration among stakeholders.\\n\\nJust like I used my own report card to inform my studies, states, like Tennessee, can use the data from their teacher preparation report cards to better equip teachers with the knowledge and skills they'll need to be successful on the job.\\n\\nI look forward to hearing more from states about how these data-driven approaches are driving improvements in preparation."}
{"original": "After easily winning a third term in November, Rep. Kathleen Rice (D-N.Y.) spearheaded a revolt against likely House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), arguing that the California lawmaker's ascent would jeopardize this hard-fought majority that we finally got of moderate women in suburban districts like hers.\\n\\nYet new polling suggests white, suburban women in Rice's own southwestern Long Island district could turn on the Democrat if she refuses to back a Green New Deal, the umbrella term for the sweeping policy to combat climate change and overhaul the economy that Rep.-elect Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) has championed.\\n\\nA survey of 300 likely Democratic primary voters in New York's 4th Congressional District described a Green New Deal as a plan to invest trillions of dollars into the development and distribution of green energy, creating millions of new high-wage jobs while preventing catastrophic climate change. The survey then told participants that Rice does not currently support a Green New Deal, and asked, How does this information impact your vote in the 2020 Democratic primary for Congress?\\n\\nThe results suggest the overwhelming popularity of Green New Deal-style policies could propel upsets in districts beyond the diverse, left-leaning urban bastions that gave rise to socialist darlings like Ocasio-Cortez and others in her cohort. The findings also indicate potential challenges of selling moderate Democrats from more conservative districts on the populist branding of policies packaged in a Green New Deal.\\n\\nData for Progress\\n\\nForty-seven percent of survey respondents were more likely to vote for a candidate who supports a Green New Deal, while only 18 percent vowed to back someone who opposed the policy. Another 22 percent said support for a Green New Deal had no impact on their vote, and 13 percent were not sure.\\n\\nThe polling ― conducted between Dec. 17 and Dec. 27 by the left-leaning think tank Data for Progress and shared exclusively with HuffPost ― shows particularly strong support for a Green New Deal among women in the suburban portions of the Nassau County district abutting the New York City borough of Queens.\\n\\nForty-eight percent of women and 44 percent of men supported a pro-Green New Deal candidate. Yet 30 percent of men said they'd back a candidate who opposed a Green New Deal, compared to just 10 percent of women who said the same.\\n\\nForty-nine percent of suburban voters in the district supported a Green New Deal candidate, compared to just 31 percent of urban voters. By contrast, 14 percent of suburban voters said they'd support an anti-Green New Deal primary candidate, while 43 percent of urban voters said they'd do the same.\\n\\nOlder voters, whites and Asians made up the strongest base of support for a pro-Green New Deal Democrat. Such a hypothetical candidate garnered 57 percent support from voters over 65 and 55 percent among voters aged 55 to 64.\\n\\nSeventy-five percent of Asian voters in the sample said they'd support a pro-Green New Deal candidate, followed by 51 percent of whites, 39 percent of blacks and 33 percent of Hispanics.\\n\\nThe strongest margin of support are older suburban women, said Evan Roth Smith, co-founder of the polling firm Slingshot Strategies, which conducted the poll. That is the constituency for a Green New Deal in her district.\\n\\nRice did not join a handful of other Democrats in the New York delegation in supporting Ocasio-Cortez's resolution for a select committee on a Green New Deal. But in a statement to HuffPost, Rice said she supports robust federal investment in energy-efficient infrastructure projects and training for green energy jobs and said members of Congress committed to this fight should no longer accept campaign contributions from oil and gas companies.\\n\\nIn my view, there is no plan too bold or too ambitious. Rep. Kathleen Rice (D-N.Y.)\\n\\nFighting climate change isn't about politics, it's about protecting our homes and jobs and preserving our communities for future generations, she said. In my view, there is no plan too bold or too ambitious.\\n\\nThe survey found Rice has a 70 percent approval rating ― higher than Pelosi's, as The Washington Post first reported. Still, Nassau County activist Siela Bynoe said she is considering a primary challenge in 2020.\\n\\nThe polling is the first in a series surveying districts where incumbent Democrats could be vulnerable to a progressive primary challenge in 2020.\\n\\nRice, who has built a strong base of support over the last five years, has not faced a primary challenger since she made her inaugural bid in 2014. The former Nassau County prosecutor's votes in favor of environmental legislation and against deregulatory efforts earned her a 100 percent score on the League of Conservation Voters' 2017 ranking. Her lifetime score is 95 percent.\\n\\nIn 2015, she crusaded against plans to build a liquefied natural gas terminal off the coast of Jones Beach. In 2017, she co-sponsored legislation to mandate 100 percent renewable energy by 2035. Rice proposed legislation last year to prohibit members of Congress from serving on public companies' boards, and fought for more aid to victims still struggling to recover from 2012′s Hurricane Sandy.\\n\\nBut Rice has long wooed Republicans. In the four years leading up to 2013, she accepted donations from Donald Trump totaling $53,000. Her father, a contractor who became the building commissioner of New York's Archdiocese, registered as a Republican after moving to once deep-red Nassau County. Because New York's primaries are closed to nonpartisans, he registered as a Democrat only when his daughter ran in a primary for district attorney, according to a New York Times profile from March 2014.\\n\\nRice won endorsements from a handful of GOP officials in her district in 2016. Since 2016, she's voted in favor of legislation Trump pushed just over 30 percent of the time, according to a FiveThirtyEight analysis, which predicted, based on Trump's support in her district, that figure would be closer to 48 percent.\\n\\nSunrise Movement Rep.-elect Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) joined a protest led by the climate justice group Sunrise Movement in November, helping to propel a Green New Deal into the mainstream political debate.\\n\\nHer vulnerability to a challenge could speak to the changing nature of the Democratic electorate. Support for a Green New Deal unites disparate primary voters from the 2016 election. Among New York 4th Congressional District voters who picked Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) in 2016, 55 percent said they would support a pro-Green New Deal candidate, compared to 8 percent who wouldn't. Among voters who picked former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in the 2016 primary, support for a Green New Deal proponent hit 46 percent, compared to 19 percent who don't.\\n\\nThe results mirror support for Ocasio-Cortez, whose surprise primary victory over the summer skyrocketed the 29-year-old to national fame. In Rice's district, 52 percent of those polls viewed Ocasio-Cortez favorably, of which 56 percent said they'd support a Green New Deal proponent in a 2020 primary.\\n\\nOcasio-Cortez has clearly broken through, Sean McElwee, the co-founder of Data for Progress, said by phone. People like Ocasio-Cortez are more than willing to primary a Democrat for not supporting a Green New Deal.\\n\\nBut reaching a point where there's enough organic buzz around a Green New Deal that it's a topic of discussion beyond the direct actions of a primary opponent, will require a lot of work, said Jeff Hauser, a veteran progressive strategist.\\n\\nThe policy stormed into mainstream political debate over the past two months after activists staged sit-ins in Pelosi's office and Ocasio-Cortez proposed a resolution to establish a select committee charged with drafting a Green New Deal. Eighty-two percent of Americans said they had heard nothing at all about a Green New Deal, yet 81 percent of registered voters said they supported the policies outlined under early proposals, according to a survey released last month by the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication and George Mason University.\\n\\nNinety-two percent of Democrats supported the Green New Deal, including 93 percent of liberal Democrats and 90 percent of moderate-to-conservative Democrats. But, more surprisingly, 64 percent of Republicans backed the policy, including 75 percent of moderate-to-liberal Republicans and 57 percent of conservative Republicans.\\n\\nThe poll found that as the policy becomes more associated with leftist politicians like Ocasio-Cortez, support among conservatives is likely to wane.\\n\\nMost of the Democrats likely to run for president in 2020 are now giving their support to a Green New Deal. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), who this week announced an exploratory committee for a potential bid, became the latest on Tuesday when she told Axios she supports the idea of a Green New Deal.\\n\\nBut convincing voters that punishing a Democrat like Rice who opposes the policy is a boon to a Green New Deal's chances of implementation is another challenge altogether, Hauser said.\\n\\nIt is seems more than plausible to me but rather very likely that if made salient to voters, opposition to a Green New Deal would be deeply dangerous for the primary chances of any incumbent Democrat, Hauser said by email. However the work of making it salient is no small task.\\n\\nThis story was updated to include earlier polling that showed Rice's favorability rating."}
{"original": "Just before she was slated to get an IUD last summer, a teenage girl in New Mexico was prescribed three medications by her doctor: a pain-reliever, an anti-anxiety medication and Misoprostol, the generic name for a drug that is used to treat stomach ulcers, but sometimes used to prep the cervix before an IUD is placed, particularly in women who have never been pregnant. It is also one of the two medications that, taken together, make up what is commonly known as the abortion pill.\\n\\nBut when the girl's mother went to her local Walgreens, only the prescriptions for the mild pain reliever and anti-anxiety medication had been filled. When she asked why, she was allegedly told that Misoprostol was in stock, but the pharmacist on duty would not fill it because of his personal beliefs.\\n\\nOn June 2, the American Civil Liberties Union of New Mexico and Southwest Women's Law Center filed two complaints on behalf of the teenager and her mother, arguing that the pharmacist's refusal to fill the prescription constitutes sex discrimination. The complaint claims it is inconceivable that the pharmacist would have denied service if he believed the medication was being used to treat stomach ulcers—the only reason why a man might get such a prescription.\\n\\nThe ACLU argues:\\n\\nRefusing to serve a woman and forcing her to travel to an alternate pharmacy for her medication is discrimination, no matter how conveniently located the alternate pharmacy may be. In addition to the significant inconvenience of having to travel to another location, M.S. [the mother] and her daughter experienced the real and lasting emotional impact of being denied a service and turned away because of sex.\\n\\nAccording to the complaint, the girl's mother drove through rush hour traffic to another Walgreens in order to fill the prescription—which she was able to do successfully—but while driving became increasingly upset about what had happened. She returned to the original Walgreens where she asked to speak with the pharmacist directly. He confirmed that he had refused to fill the prescription based on his personal beliefs, the complaint claims, and that he had a pretty good idea what her daughter would use the medication for.\\n\\nAfter the incident, the ACLU of New Mexico and Southwest Women's Law Center wrote to Walgreens to tell the company about the incident and ask more about its policies. In April of this year, Walgreens responded that when a pharmacist at one store refuses to fill another prescription and another pharmacist is not on duty, customers can be sent to another location, the ACLU suit says.\\n\\nIndeed, in a statement e-mailed to HuffPost, a spokesperson for Walgreens explained it is the company's policy to allow pharmacists and other employees to step away from completing a transaction to which they may have a moral objection, and requires the pharmacist or other employee to refer the transaction to another employee or manager on duty to complete the customer's request.\\n\\nThe spokesperson also said Walgreens hopes to work closely with the ACLU of New Mexico, and that it has retrained all pharmacists and employees in New Mexico on their policies and procedures related to conscientious objection.\\n\\nThe girl's mother previously explained to the Albuquerque Journal that her daughter had been prescribed the IUD to help manage difficult period symptoms.\\n\\nCORRECTION: An earlier version of this story misspelled the stomach ulcer drug Misoprostol."}
{"original": "A damning new lawsuit against Baylor University suggests that Baylor went to great lengths to protect its football players, at the expense of alleged victims of sexual violence.\\n\\nThe lawsuit was filed by Baylor alumni Elizabeth Doe, who was allegedly gang-raped by two Baylor football players in 2013.\\n\\nThe suit alleges that at least 52 instances of rape, perpetrated by at least 31 different football players, occurred between the years of 2011 and 2014, and that the football program both enabled the behavior and refused to acknowledge the pervasiveness of sexual violence.\\n\\nAccording to the lawsuit, the Texas university invested heavily in its football program when it hired former head coach Art Briles in 2008, who turned the team into one of the best ones at the collegiate level. But, for many of Baylor's women students, that reputation came at a price.\\n\\nIn Briles' attempt to bolster the program, the lawsuit alleges that potential Bears players were treated like royalty.\\n\\nIn order to ensure that a last place team could recruit the players needed to win football games, recruiting efforts used sex to sell the program, the lawsuit reads.\\n\\nTom Pennington via Getty Images Former head coach Art Briles was fired from Baylor in May of 2016.\\n\\nBaylor football coaching staff allegedly arranged for women to have sex with recruits on their official campus visits, and used the promise of sex with women in recruiting trips.\\n\\nDo you like white women? Because we have a lot of them at Baylor and they love football players, Coach Briles' son, assistant coach Kendal Briles, is reported to have said on a high school recruiting trip in Dallas. (His coaching career has continued to flourish. It was announced in December 2016 that he'd taken a coaching position at Florida Atlantic University.)\\n\\nThe Baylor Bruins program, a campus group that describes itself as an organization which hosts prospective athletes during visits, reportedly recruited attractive young women as unofficial campus liaisons for visiting football recruits. And Elizabeth Doe says these women often ended up being the target of a culture of sexual violence, as Doe found out after signing up to be a Bruin herself.\\n\\nThough the Bruins had an official policy of no sexual contact with the recruits or football players, Baylor had an unofficial policy of looking the other way when there was sexual intercourse between the Bruins and the football players, the lawsuit reads.\\n\\nOn April 13, 2013, Doe, who had been a Bruin since the fall prior, was allegedly raped by football players Tre'Von Armstead and Shamycheal Chatman after a huge spring party at the apartment of fellow football player Shawn Oakman. Oakman had been recruited by Briles after being asked to leave Penn State, where he had an alleged history of violence against women and was rumored to have raped a woman. Armstead and Chatman reportedly offered to walk the heavily intoxicated Doe back to her apartment, and then, allegedly, proceeded to rape her.\\n\\n(It's worth noting that Oakman was later indicted for raping a woman at the same apartment at which he'd hosted the spring party at Baylor, and Chatman had already been accused of raping a student sport's trainer, according to the lawsuit. Instead of facing any punishment, the trainer was sent to work for a female sports team.)\\n\\nDoe says that she endured the after effects of sexual assault for the rest of her time at Baylor: panic attacks, anxiety, and a fear of running into her rapist. (Armistead was still on campus, Chatman had left). She graduated in 2015.\\n\\nIn an equally damning investigation from 2016, it was made public that it took Baylor two years to investigate Doe's gang rape, and Armstead and Chatman both left the university before any investigation occurred.\\n\\nThe lawsuit alleges that under Briles, the culture of Baylor football and rape became synonymous, and Doe's experience was sadly not unique. In recent years, several women have filed Title IX lawsuits against the university, and many of them allege they were assaulted by football players.\\n\\nThat culture of violence got so bad that former Title IX coordinator Gabrielle Lyons left her post after just a few months because she was just appalled at the level of violence taking place to rampantly at the institution.\\n\\nLyons alleges that her position as the Title IX coordinator left her incredibly vulnerable on campus, and she left at the behest of the Baylor Police Department, who believed she was no longer safe on campus given her involvement in investigating the instances of sexual violence. Lyons has also filed a complaint against the university.\\n\\nIn the years since Doe's assault and iin the wake of subsequent lawsuits, both coach Art Briles and then-President Kenneth Starr were let go from their posts in May of 2016 after the publication of the internal audit that proved campus officials were aware of sexual violence and yet did nothing to stop it.\\n\\nDoe is suing Baylor for six separate claims, all related to Title IX violations and negligence.\\n\\nRead the lawsuit in its entirety below.\\n\\nThe Huffington Post reached out to Baylor University for comment but did not hear back by the time of publication."}
{"original": "NATO Ministerial meeting on December 2, 2015, at NATO Headquarters in Brussels, Belgium.\\n\\nAfter five decades of its existence and as an alliance that consists of 28 independent countries -- including three permanent UN Security Council members -- the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) is one of the largest and the strongest collective defense alliance of its kind. The adversaries of the Allies have contested their formation, development, and existence. NATO was known as an alliance against the Soviet Union only. So, why has the Alliance expanded and strengthened even three decades after the collapse of the USSR? Does such an alliance still need to exist?\\n\\nFounded in 1959, NATO is a political and military alliance. The three principal reasons for the creation of the Alliance were deterring former Soviet Union's expansionism, forbidding the revival of nationalist militarism in Europe, and encouraging European political integration. Since its creation, the Alliance has played diverse roles, including defensive, political and a tool for the stabilization of Eastern Europe, Africa, Central and South Asia through partnerships, crisis response and peacekeeping operations.\\n\\n\\n\\nWorld War II ended with the death of around 36.5 million Europeans and it left Europe devastated with social, economic, security, and political crises. The Former Soviet Union has expanded its influence through aggression and suppression in the region. In May 1985, the USSR formed the Warsaw Pact (The Treaty of Friendship, Co-operation, and Mutual Assistance), a collective defense treaty among the Soviet Union and seven Soviet satellite states in Eastern and Central Europe. The USSR assumed that the Union and the Pact would defeat NATO, but on the contrary, the Pact dissolved in 1991. The former USSR was defeated in the Cold War and NATO has succeeded in its first objective.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn the 1990s at the request of the United Nations, NATO became involved in the Bosnian conflict. The first peacekeeping experience of the Allies in the region, but it was firmly criticized and opposed by Serbia and NATO's adversaries. Finally, NATO's cooperation in the Balkan Peninsula de-escalated the conflicts. The region experienced years of conflicts, but the presence of a NATO-led forces have minimized the clashes and casualties. Today most of these nations live in harmony. The Allies consider forbidding the revival of nationalist militarism in the Balkan Peninsula as a historic achievement.\\n\\n\\n\\nThrough encouraging European political integration policy, the Alliance has contributed to the transition of some former Soviet Union and the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (SFRY) states to democratic nations. Among 28 NATO member countries, only Canada and the US are outside of the continent, and 22 of its member countries are EU members.\\n\\n\\n\\nA joint airborne operations exercise between U.S. and Estonian paratroopers in Nurmsi, Estonia, photo by U.S. Army Sgt. Juana M. Nesbitt.\\n\\nBeyond its borders, NATO has carried out disaster-relief operations and missions to protect populations against natural, technological or humanitarian disasters. It responded to the 2005 earthquake in Pakistan; it has engaged since 2001 in the war on terror and countering insurgency in Afghanistan. And since 2008, the Alliance has been supporting countering piracy around the Horn of Africa and in the Indian Ocean to ensure that the sea lines of communication are secure and open.\\n\\n\\n\\nAfter the collapse of the USSR and during the late 1990s, NATO's future, its purpose, and survival have been debated among the Allies. Even after the 9/11 terrorist attacks in the US followed by Istanbul, Madrid, and London bombings some opinion makers in Europe has not considered these attacks as a threat to the sovereignty and freedom of their states, but a tool for possible insecurity. However, Russian's military aggression in Georgia in 2008 has alerted the Alliance and defense analyst.\\n\\n\\n\\nLatest Changes of the international borders and annexation of Crimea by Russia through the use of force and unprecedented air operations of Russian air force near Turkey's borders with Syria has increased the threat level for NATO members. Furthermore, the recent Russian military buildup and its decision for placing new air-defense radar systems and deployment of missiles in Kaliningrad, as a strategy of anti-access/area denial could be a serious matter of concerns for The Alliance and in particular to Poland and Lithuania, which border Kaliningrad.\\n\\n\\n\\nA Patriot missile battery sits on an overlook at a Turkish army base in Gaziantep, Turkey, Feb. 4, 2013.\\n\\nUnderstanding the level of threats, NATO has been preparing for any response through numerous joint military exercises in Europe. During the Wales Summit in September 2014, Heads of State and Heads of Government of NATO member countries agreed on a guideline to spend a minimum of 2% of their Gross Domestic Product (GDP) on defense. Meeting this goal will further strengthen the Allies and it will seriously challenge Russia, which has been suffering from lower oil prices, the cost of operations in Syria and economic sanctions.\\n\\n\\n\\nRussian military buildup on the borders of NATO, President Putin's ambitions of prolonging his power, expanding his territory and projection of power through an aggressive military strategy require a balance of power in the region. So, the intention and capabilities of Russain military pose a direct to some NATO Allies and this could rapidly change public opinion across the Europe and it may end many debates and skepticism about the importance, strength and survival of NATO over the years and even for the decades to come."}
{"original": "Scott Stringer, an early front-runner for New York City mayor, pledged to completely phase out fossil fuels, drive private utility companies out of the nation's largest metropolis, and electrify everything in a near total embrace of climate activists' demands ahead of this year's election.\\n\\nThe 34-page proposal Stringer laid out Sunday would transform the five boroughs, glazing the rooftops with solar panels and battery units, prioritizing bike lanes and pedestrian walkways over highways, and providing new programs to make electricity cheaper and green jobs more plentiful for the city's squeezed working class.\\n\\nThe time for pie-in-the-sky platitudes is over, he said in a Zoom press conference. The time for incrementalism has passed.\\n\\nHe promised to block all new fossil fuel infrastructure, including a controversial pipeline currently under construction in Brooklyn, and vowed to ban all gas hookups in newly built and renovated construction. He called the city's network of roughly a dozen gas- and oil-burning power plants relics of the past, and that's where I'll put them, and promised a fleet of electric buses and subway improvements. He said he'd implement a standing proposal to shutter the infamous prison on Rikers Island and convert the facility to a solar farm and target aid to communities that suffered the worst excesses of both polluters and policing.\\n\\nEmissions are up since 2017, we're still putting pipelines in the ground, and air emissions have led to more COVID deaths in the Bronx than anywhere in the country, Stringer said. To move forward, we must turn the page on decades of environmental racism. We gotta say it, it's true. The buck stops with me. No more excuses.\\n\\nSteven A Henry via Getty Images Scott Stringer, the New York City comptroller now running for mayor, embraced a full-fledged Green New Deal platform as more candidates crowd into the race.\\n\\nThe plan marks something of a transformation for Stringer. A fixture in Manhattan politics for more than three decades, the 60-year-old Democrat forged his most significant climate policy in 2018 at his current post as the city's comptroller, kick-starting the process of divesting New York's pension funds of fossil fuel stocks.\\n\\nBut in an increasingly crowded field of mayoral hopefuls, Stringer has distinguished himself as an enthusiastic ally of the city's influential Green New Deal movement, joining protests against new fossil fuel infrastructure and racking up endorsements from unions and socialist firebrand lawmakers alike.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt's a model that worked for Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.), whose fealty to Green New Deal activists revitalized his 44-year record in Congress and helped him beat back a spirited primary challenge last year from Democratic Rep. Joe Kennedy, who had been favored to win.\\n\\nThe climate proposal, the first major plan the campaign has rolled out, so impressed Food & Water Action that the progressive environmental group suspended its candidate screening process and now plans to give Stringer its backing in an announcement Monday.\\n\\nErik McGregor via Getty Images Thousands of New Yorkers marched for climate action on the fifth anniversary of Superstorm Sandy.\\n\\nI read it and started thinking, 'Who on Earth are we going to endorse? No one else is going to have this kind of plan,' Alex Beauchamp, Food & Water Action's Brooklyn-based regional director, said by phone. This plan is the best I've seen from virtually any candidate for any office. It seemed obvious.\\n\\nThe Climate Election\\n\\nClimate change already looked set to become a defining theme of this year's election. Term limits opened 60% of the 51-seat City Council and barred Mayor Bill de Blasio from running again. Since the end of November's historic national election, candidates have rushed into what's expected to be a heated six-month contest ahead of the June 22 Democratic primary.\\n\\nBrad Lander, the progressive city councilman from Brooklyn running to succeed Stringer as comptroller, released the first major climate proposal in the race, laying out a detailed plan to complete the city's fossil fuel divestment, expand public financing for clean infrastructure and create a new auditing department to hold city agencies and companies accountable to climate goals. In western Queens, city council hopeful Tiffany Cabán made implementing a Green New Deal one of her three top priorities, while southeast Queens candidate Moumita Ahmed listed climate justice as the third plank of her platform.\\n\\nOther contenders for mayor have signaled concern about the issue. Maya Wiley, the former mayoral counsel and MSNBC host, promised to place making New York more resilient in the face of climate change among her top priorities as mayor, a spokesperson said. Another mayoral contender, former Obama-era Housing and Urban Development Secretary Shaun Donovan, highlighted his work overseeing the recovery from 2012's Superstorm Sandy. Andrew Yang, the failed 2020 Democratic presidential contender, was spotted filming his own mayoral announcement on the Coney Island waterfront last month.\\n\\nThe emphasis shows how far climate change has come as a political issue in the past few years.\\n\\nThe climate movement underwent an unprecedented surge since 2018, when United Nations scientists warned that governments had a decade to cut planet-heating emissions in half or doom the world to catastrophic, irreversible warming. The findings made clear that politically unpopular schemes to put a price on carbon emissions and incrementally transition from fossil fuels, which had until then dominated the climate policy mainstream, could not alone deliver the economic changes needed.\\n\\nIn response, youth activists and a new cadre of progressive lawmakers, led largely by the Bronx's own Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), outlined an alternative. The Green New Deal, a policy framework for the kind of federal industrial policy not seen since World War II, quickly gained steam. By the time Democrats began declaring their bids for president the next year, nearly every major candidate embraced the framework, including the ultimate victor, President-elect Joe Biden.\\n\\nYana Paskova via Getty Images Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) speaks to residents in Queens about her bill to invest in greening the city's public housing complexes — legislation Stringer vowed to champion if elected mayor.\\n\\nThe movement took root locally, too. In 2019, City Council lawmakers enacted a package of measures requiring landlords to slash climate pollution from the city's biggest buildings, making it easier to build solar panels and small turbines on rooftops, and establishing a new loan program for renewable energy. Months later, New York state passed one of the ambitious climate laws in the country, mandating a carbon-neutral economy in less than 30 years.\\n\\nThe city's 2020 Democratic primary cemented climate as a winning issue. Green New Deal backers won more than half a dozen seats in the state legislature and in the U.S. congressional delegation, unseating entrenched incumbents.\\n\\nAdvocates, meanwhile, upped the ante. Groups such as New York Communities for Change and the local chapters of Democratic Socialists of America and the Green New Deal-crusading Sunrise Movement started demanding the government replace Consolidated Edison and National Grid, the investor-owned utilities that currently deliver the city's electricity and heating gas, with government-run alternatives. And activists stepped up fights against new gas pipelines into the city, including one currently under construction in North Brooklyn.\\n\\nThe time for incrementalism has passed. Scott Stringer\\n\\nAs the COVID-19 pandemic wreaked havoc across the city, other groups authored a 40-page plan for a green recovery, urging the city to spend $16 billion over the next three years retrofitting buildings for energy efficiency, expanding bike lanes, and boosting green manufacturing on Brooklyn's industrial waterfront.\\n\\nCity On The Hill\\n\\nIf elected, much of what he proposed, including new spending and the establishment of public utilities, would require Stringer to marshal allies in the City Council, Albany and Washington to enact new legislation. And the executive job in a city with an economy bigger than that of most countries offers a powerful bully pulpit.\\n\\nStringer told HuffPost he envisioned a reset with Albany after nearly a decade of bickering and intransigence between de Blasio and Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D), and he said the young progressive lawmakers elected to the state Assembly and Senate would provide a pathway for advocating his agenda.\\n\\nWe can no longer play checkers when everyone like the governor is playing chess, Stringer said. We have to sell this plan the way we never have before.\\n\\nBut advocates say the things Stringer could do unilaterally as mayor are some of the most promising pledges in his proposal. Ramping up enforcement of laws against lead paint in low-income housing, creating new regulations on indoor air pollution, and implementing a new fast-track process for green permitting all fall under the mayoral purview, and could dramatically improve life for New Yorkers suffering the worst exposure to toxic pollution.\\n\\nThis is a good day for the Green New Deal movement, said Daniel Aldana Cohen, a University of Pennsylvania sociologist who published a study tracking the evolution of New York City climate policy in the journal Environmental Politics in September.\\n\\nHe said Stringer should consider giving more emphasis to express bus lanes, the only part of the public transit system that the city controls directly.\\n\\nStringer's opposition to new fossil fuel infrastructure is another good sign to advocates.\\n\\nThere's a commitment to fight against all new fossil fuel infrastructure, including references to revoking existing city permits, Beauchamp said. We've been pretty disappointed with the city's response to this so far. That's been a thing that the current administration says is a nonstarter.\\n\\nCosta Constantinides, the Queens councilman behind the city's major 2019 climate bill, said he is now serving as Stringer's climate adviser.\\n\\nYou have a track record of getting things done, Constantinides said. And that's what we need in the next mayor on climate."}
{"original": "Digital First Media/Orange County Register via Getty Images via Getty Images African-Americans are more likely than other racial or ethnic groups to work for the federal government: They constitute 18 percent of federal workers and 13 percent of the population, write Angela Simms and Shamus Khan.\\n\\nThese economic costs take a severe toll on everyday people. Today, some 380,000 American families have a member sitting at home without a paycheck. At a time when around 80 percent of Americans live paycheck to paycheck, in large part because the cost of living continues to rise at rates outstripping increases in worker pay, that's hundreds of thousands of family crises waiting to happen. It means families may not have sufficient money for rent or mortgages, groceries, transportation or school supplies, among other needs.\\n\\nThe federal government distributed sample letters for furloughed workers to send to landlords, banks and other financial institutions like student loan agencies, as they seek leniency for late or partial payments. Many will weather this income loss by using credit cards and other loans with high interest rates, which can lead families into a financial downward spiral.\\n\\nBlack communities, many of which are still recovering from the Great Recession, stand to be among the hardest hit―again. African-Americans are more likely than other racial or ethnic groups to work for the federal government: They constitute 18 percent of federal workers and 13 percent of the population. Furthermore, Black-owned businesses disproportionately rely upon government contracts, though they remain underrepresented among federal contractors. And Black Americans, due to their disproportionate levels of poverty stemming from centuries of exclusion from the most rewarding jobs and underinvestment in their communities, are in greater need of federal support, even when the economy is booming.\\n\\nAfrican-Americans are more likely than other racial or ethnic groups to work for the federal government: They constitute 18 percent of federal workers and 13 percent of the population.\\n\\nBecause they experience considerable labor market discrimination, African-Americans have long relied upon the public sector—federal, state and local government—for steady employment in good jobs. Government civil service work is an essential pillar in the foundation of the Black middle class, so furloughs stand to harm Black people significantly. This kind of racially disparate impact of government policy has a long history.\\n\\nFor generations, the federal government has invested more directly in the White middle class than in the Black middle class. The mid-19th century Homestead Acts gave White Americans access to western lands, many of which were expropriated from Native American tribes, for minimal or no cost. The Social Security Act of 1935 provided unemployment insurance and old-age pensions. And the Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944 (commonly known as the GI Bill) offered returning World War II soldiers education benefits and low-interest mortgages. In each of these cases, the federal government either explicitly excluded Black people or failed to intervene when racist state or private industry practices were carried out.\\n\\nEven the much-lauded New Deal was a site of racial discrimination by the federal government. The Federal Housing Administration erected barriers preventing Black Americans from taking out home loans—where most of Americans' familial wealth is located. From the 1930s to the early 1960s, 98 percent of all home loans went to White families. The federal government insured loans in White neighborhoods, making loans more financially viable for banks. Consequently, these neighborhoods grew in wealth and businesses flocked to them, reinforcing these communities' wealth accumulation. Decades of investment in White communities, and disinvestment in Black communities, is why the average Black family has $1700 in wealth, while the average white family has $116,000. That means many White families have savings allowing them to ride out hard times, like a federal government furlough. But most Black families do not.\\n\\nMany White families have savings allowing them to ride out hard times, like a federal government furlough. But most Black families do not.\\n\\nThen there's the fact that Black people who are struggling to afford a government shutdown are more likely to live around other people who are struggling financially. Fifty years after major efforts toward integration, our communities remain stubbornly racially segregated. The post-civil rights era integration achievements of the 1970s and 1980s have stagnated, and in many metropolitan areas eroded, even as Black Americans have become a majority suburban population. Today more than half of the Black population would need to move to attain full integration. This means the furlough will not only disproportionately affect Black families, but it will also be concentrated in Black communities. Racial segregation, itself the consequence of racist policies and practices, will only compound the negative effects Black Americans will likely experience.\\n\\nDue to the concentration of Black households affected by the furlough, majority-Black counties should brace themselves for acute harms. County workers, like teachers and police officers, won't be furloughed, but they are at risk if the recession is protracted and the county's revenue declines because furloughed federal workers reduce their economic activity and perhaps even experience downward economic mobility as they become unable to pay for household expenses.\\n\\nDuring the Great Recession, in the predominantly African-American Prince George's County, in Maryland, right next to Washington, D.C., teachers and parents lamented that their schools were in disrepair and that teacher turnover was increasing in the face of frozen wages. Church pastors said there was more demand for the food in their pantries. But as the foreclosure crisis slashed county tax revenue, the county government and nonprofits could scarcely keep pace with resident demand. The Black middle class, unlike the White middle class, already tends to live in communities with more poverty. When the Black middle class is distressed, Black communities' already fragile stability is further undermined.\\n\\nMost furloughed workers will likely eventually receive backpay for the time they were forced not to work. But backpay can't make up for certain damages, such as ruined credit, increased interest rates on mortgages because of late-payments, or eviction for not paying rent. Black people with less wealth and concentrated in majority-Black communities, will endure these hardships more than other Americans.\\n\\nThroughout U.S. history, Black America has experienced combinations of discrimination, exploitation and federal government neglect. With the current furlough, Black people are experiencing collateral damage from President Trump's willingness to close swaths of the government unless he receives funding for a wall along the U.S. southern border. His decision affects all Americans who rely on government's regular order, but Black people are particularly vulnerable. These hardships represent a continuation of centuries-long trends. And for many Black families and the communities they call home, these effects could be devastating.\\n\\nAngela Simms is a doctoral candidate at the University of Pennsylvania.

{"original": "MANDEL NGAN via Getty Images President Donald Trump greeted fellow Republican Josh Hawley in Springfield, Missouri, during Hawley's successful Senate campaign in that state. Hawley became a major player in Trump's bid -- based on lies -- to overturn Joe Biden's win in November's presidential election. Even after Trump incited a mob's attack on the U.S. Capitol last Wednesday, Hawley pressed the fraudulent effort to decertify election results.\\n\\nIn the aftermath of Wednesday's violent insurrection at the U.S. Capitol, top voices on the American right have issued a call for lawmakers to move on without resorting to an impeachment proceeding against President Donald Trump. National Republican Campaign Committee Chairman Rep. Tom Emmer (R-Minn.) has said the impeachment bid would divide us as a country, a call Fox News host Brian Kilmeade and other conservative personalities quickly echoed.\\n\\nThat Trump bears responsibility for that assault on the Capitol is not in question. The president constantly broadcasted lies about the results of November's presidential election from his bully pulpit and across social media, fomenting fury. On Wednesday he repeated those lies to a mob of thousands, telling them to show strength, fight like hell, and strike fear into the hearts of lawmakers who refused to overturn Joe Biden's win in the election. He then dispatched them to the Capitol.\\n\\nWhen a great crime is committed, society can only move on when those responsible have been held accountable. This is a basic tenet not only of criminal law, but of truth and reconciliation commissions and other projects aimed at national healing. What exactly constitutes accountability and responsibility are, of course, dependent on the nature of the crime and the roles different figures played in its execution. But the principle is based on the idea that to be forgiven, one must first acknowledge responsibility and, in many cases, endure punishment. Without accountability, social wounds will not heal, but fester.\\n\\nRepublican leaders are not, in fact, asking the country to move on from the insurrection in any meaningful way. They are asking everyone to politely pretend that nothing happened, so that the conservative movement and elected GOP officials can avoid unpleasant consequences for their actions and rhetoric. Kilmeade's point that people are ready to explode is, in this light, better understood as a threat than a plea for calm.\\n\\nThe political nature of the Capitol attack demands that accountability take political form.\\n\\nLet us be clear: Trump did not act alone. At the pre-riot rally on the National Mall, his lawyer, former New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, urged the mob to pursue trial by combat to overturn the election results. Trump supporters who invaded the Capitol chanted Hang Mike Pence! for the vice president's refusing to throw out the electoral votes that made Biden president-elect. One rioter was photographed wearing a Camp Auschwitz T-shirt; others brought zip-tie handcuffs for detaining hostages. Still others brought a gallows to the Capitol, scrawled Murder the Media on its walls and beat a Capitol police officer to death with a fire extinguisher.\\n\\nBut the violence itself is only one dimension of Wednesday's horror. What shocked the world was its political intent. This violence was committed as part of a concerted effort to overturn an election's outcome at the direction of the losing candidate.\\n\\nThe political nature of the Capitol attack demands that accountability take political form. While the judiciary should handle criminal charges against individual insurrectionists, those who empowered and encouraged an assault on the legislative branch of the U.S. government should face consequences in the legislative branch. For Trump, there is no alternative to impeachment by the House and a conviction by the Senate.\\n\\nThe list of elected Republicans who voted with the mob is frighteningly long: eight senators and 139 House members voted against certifying the election results.\\n\\nThe president is not the only bad actor here who must face punitive measures. Sens. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) and Ted Cruz (R-Texas) led the attempt in their chamber to overturn the election results, championing Trump's conspiracy theories. Hawley gave a now-infamous fist-pump to the assembled mob shortly before they began rioting. Reps. Mo Brooks (R-Ala.) and Madison Cawthorn (R-N.C.) both spoke at the Trump rally ahead of the attack and spread the lie that the election had been stolen from the president through mass fraud. All four men have decried the violence that ensued, but none have apologized for their role or even acknowledged any responsibility for the insurrection. If any of them respected their offices, they would resign. Since they will not, the House and Senate should expel them and let their constituents select replacements.\\n\\nThose are the easy cases. But from there accountability gets tricky. The list of elected Republicans who voted with the mob is frighteningly long: eight senators and 139 House members voted against certifying the election results. These votes were cast after the insurrection, when it was abundantly clear to the entire country exactly what kind of reaction those votes would encourage. On Monday night, Capitol Police briefed Democrats on three more conspiracies to overthrow the government ahead of Biden's inauguration on Jan. 20, potentially involving tens of thousands of armed terrorists, including one plot aimed explicitly at murdering Democrats to give Republicans control of the government.\\n\\nThe inescapable conclusion is that the lunatic fringe of the Republican Party is no longer a fringe.\\n\\nThe further down-ballot you go, the uglier the picture of the Republican Party gets. In Michigan alone, the GOP state party chair, statehouse legislators and local election officials went to extraordinary lengths to discredit Biden's victory in the state and twist the legal system into overturning his win. The Rule of Law Defense Fund, a dark money organization Republican state attorneys general created in 2014, made robocalls encouraging people to attend the Wednesday rally and stop the steal. A Republican member of the West Virginia House of Delegates was even among those who stormed the Capitol (he has since resigned his seat).\\n\\nThe inescapable conclusion is that the lunatic fringe of the Republican Party is no longer a fringe. It's the party. For decades, members of the GOP elite have believed that leaders committed to tax cuts and deregulation could maintain control over their coalition by indulging its crank elements on what they saw as minor points and deceiving them on others. Trump's election made clear, however, that the popular constituency for free trade and free markets in today's America is vanishingly small. And so the party's elite has become increasingly beholden to violent extremists, culminating ― so far ― in Wednesday's outrage.\\n\\nNot all of these extremists, of course, think of themselves as murderous neo-Nazis. Early news reports were filled with stories and images of people who infiltrated the Capitol gawking at its opulence like tourists, or patiently explaining various conspiracy theories to reporters rather than assaulting them (though other members of the mob did attack journalists).\\n\\nBut the attack on the Capitol made clear that once-disparate elements of the conservative coalition have fused into a common culture with a violent hostility to the American government at its core. The Proud Boys knelt in prayer before storming the barricades as Confederate flags intermingled with a Jesus 2020 banner. Militant fascists, devout white evangelicals, disaffected working people and ultrarich small business owners recited QAnon lies to each other.\\n\\nEach of these different factions initially rallied to Trump for different reasons, citing different grievances, some real and some imagined, some motivated by hate and some by frustration. Trump has cemented them as a political unit and persuaded them that American democracy itself is their enemy.\\n\\nTrump may well be right, in a sense. Wednesday's naked violence will make it still more difficult for his coalition to reach anything like a national majority. Trump lost the popular vote by more than 3 million in 2016. In 2020 he lost by 7 million. It is not hard to imagine a near-future in which the Trump coalition won't need to believe a demagogue's lies to be motivated into action against democracy, but will instead reason their way to it out of political self-interest.\\n\\nIn this they would be imitating Republican leaders, who got in bed with Trump back in 2016 knowing he was their best bet for achieving long-standing conservative economic and foreign policy goals.\\n\\nThey got what they wanted, and American democracy is paying the price. If the political system cannot or will not hold the instigators of Wednesday's horrors accountable, more leaders will make that calculation in the future, with a more violent movement behind them."}
{"original": "In his first official acts as president, Joe Biden is signing executive orders on a broad range of issues, from the coronavirus pandemic to climate change and immigration, to fulfill campaign promises.\\n\\nHighlights of actions Biden is taking Wednesday:\\n\\nTHE CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC\\n\\nMASK REQUIREMENT: Biden is requiring the use of masks and social distancing in all federal buildings, on federal lands and by federal employees and contractors. Consistently masking up is a practice that science has shown to be effective in preventing the spread of the coronavirus, particularly when social distancing is difficult to maintain.\\n\\nHe is challenging all Americans to wear a mask for the first 100 days of his administration. That's a critical period, since communities will still be vulnerable to the virus even as the pace of vaccination increases in pursuit of Biden's goal of 100 million shots in 100 days.\\n\\nWORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION: Biden also is directing the government to rejoin the World Health Organization, which Donald Trump withdrew from earlier this year after accusing it of incompetence and bowing to Chinese pressure over the coronavirus.\\n\\nSymbolizing Biden's commitment to a more prominent global role, White House coronavirus coordinator Jeff Zients announced that Dr. Anthony Fauci will deliver a speech Thursday to the WHO as head of a U.S. delegation. Fauci, the government's top infectious disease expert, will lay out how the administration intends to work with the WHO on reforms, supporting the coronavirus response and promoting global health and health security\\n\\n___\\n\\nCLIMATE\\n\\nPARIS CLIMATE ACCORD: Biden will sign an executive order to rejoin the Paris climate accord, fulfilling a campaign pledge to get back into the global climate pact on Day One. Trump, a supporter of oil, gas and coal, had made a first priority of pulling out of global efforts to cut climate-damaging fossil fuel emissions.\\n\\nIt will take 30 days for the U.S. to officially be back in.\\n\\nREVIEWING TRUMP ROLLBACKS: Biden's Day One plans also include a temporary moratorium on new Trump administration oil and gas leasing in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, moving to revoke a presidential permit for the Keystone XL oil and gas pipeline and reviewing a Trump administration freeze on vehicle mileage and emissions standards. Biden also is setting in motion an evaluation of another Trump move that cut boundaries and protections for some national monuments.\\n\\nAgencies will be directed to consider impact of climate change on disadvantaged communities and on future generations from any regulatory action that affected fossil fuel emissions, a new requirement.\\n\\n___\\n\\nIMMIGRATION\\n\\nENDING BAN ON MUSLIM TRAVELERS: Biden is ending what is variously known as the travel ban or the Muslim ban, one of the first acts of the Trump administration. Trump in January 2017 banned foreign nationals from seven mostly Muslim countries from entry into the country. After a lengthy court fight, a watered-down version of the rule was upheld by the Supreme Court in a 5-4 decision in 2018.\\n\\nThe new administration says it will improve the screening of visitors by strengthening information sharing with foreign governments and other measures.\\n\\nBORDER WALL: Biden is immediately ending the national emergency that Trump declared on the border in February 2018 to divert billions of dollars from the Defense Department to wall construction. He also is halting construction to review contracts and how wall money might be redirected.\\n\\nDespite Trump's repeated promises that Mexico would pay for the wall, U.S. Customs and Border Protection says Americans have committed $15 billion for more than 700 miles (1,120 kilometers). It is unclear how many miles are under contract and what penalties the government would have to pay for canceling them.\\n\\nThe Supreme Court has scheduled arguments Feb. 22 on the legality of Trump's diverting Defense Department funds for counter-narcotics efforts and military construction projects to wall construction.\\n\\nDACA: Biden will order his Cabinet to work to preserve the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which has shielded hundreds of thousands of people who came to the country as young children from deportation since it was introduced in 2012.\\n\\nTrump ordered an end to DACA in 2017, triggering a legal challenge that ended in June when the Supreme Court ruled that it should be kept in place because the Trump administration failed to follow federal rule-making guidelines in undoing it. But DACA is still facing legal challenges.\\n\\nIn his presidential proclamation, Biden is calling on Congress to adopt legislation that gives DACA recipients permanent legal status and a path to citizenship. There are currently about 700,000 people enrolled.\\n\\nDEPORTATIONS: Biden is revoking one of Trump's first executive orders, which declared that all of the roughly 11 million people in the country illegally are considered priorities for deportation. The Department of Homeland Security will conduct a review of enforcement priorities. Biden's campaign site says deportations will focus on national security and public safety threats.\\n\\nThe order says nothing about a 100-day moratorium on deportations that Biden promised during the campaign. Susan Rice, who is tapped to run the White House Domestic Policy Council, says any decision on moratoriums would come from Homeland Security.\\n\\nCENSUS: Biden is reversing a Trump plan to exclude people in the country illegally from being counted in the 2020 Census. The once-a-decade census is used to determine how many congressional seats and Electoral College votes each state gets, as well as the distribution of $1.5 trillion in federal spending each year.\\n\\nBiden's team says the new administration will ensure the Census Bureau has time to complete an accurate count for each state and that the apportionment is fair and accurate.\\n\\n___\\n\\nSTUDENT DEBT\\n\\nBiden is asking the Education Department to extend a pause on federal student loan payments through at least Sept. 30, continuing a moratorium that began early in the pandemic but was set to expire at the end of January.\\n\\nBorrowers, who owe a collective $1.5 trillion, would not be required to make payments on their federal student loans, their loans would not accrue any interest, and all debt collection activity would halt through September.\\n\\nCongress paused student debt payments last March as part of a virus relief package, and the Trump administration extended it twice.\\n\\nBiden's order does not include the type of mass debt cancellation that some Democrats asked him to orchestrate through executive action. He has said that action should come from Congress.\\n\\n___\\n\\nHOUSING FORECLOSURES\\n\\nHousing foreclosures and evictions would be delayed until at least March 31, 2021. Almost 12% of homeowners with mortgages are late on their payments, while 19% of renters are behind, according to a Census Bureau survey of households.\\n\\nThe federal moratoriums would ensure that people could stay in their homes even if they cannot afford their monthly bills. Biden is also calling on Congress to extend assistance to renters. While the moratoriums have aided several million Americans during the pandemic and helped to contain the disease, they have also meant that billions of dollars in housing costs have gone unpaid.\\n\\n___\\n\\nAssociated Press writers Ricardo Alonso-Zaldivar, Ellen Knickmeyer, Ben Fox, Elliot Spagat, Matt Lee and Josh Boak contributed to this report."}
{"original": "UPDATE: Jan. 7 ― The IRS will likely begin paying out tax refunds in the coming weeks after the White House decided to reverse past IRS policy on Monday, according to The Washington Post. Previously, the IRS was prohibited from issuing refunds during a shutdown while the majority of employees were on furlough. However, Trump administration lawyers decided it was legally permissible to proceed with processing tax returns. The IRS employees who return to work in order to process these returns will not be paid during the shutdown. Final details are still up in the air, including how many workers will be recalled and when the official tax filing season will begin.\\n\\nPREVIOUSLY: Today we reach the two-week mark of the partial government shutdown, the result of a standoff between Congress and President Donald Trump over funding of a border wall that he originally said Mexico would pay for.\\n\\nIn addition to the 420,000 government employees who continue to work without pay, the shutdown has left an estimated 380,000 government workers on furlough, including nearly all Internal Revenue Service employees.\\n\\nSo what does that mean for your taxes? As you might have guessed, it's not great news.\\n\\nHow The Government Shutdown Affects Tax Refunds\\n\\nAccording to the government's shutdown plan, only 12.5 percent of IRS employees are authorized to work during the current non-filing season. The plan also states that processing certain tax refunds and issuing tax refunds are non-excepted activities during this time, meaning that the employees responsible for performing those duties will be furloughed during the shutdown.\\n\\nJay Williams, a West Virginia-based financial adviser who focuses on tax-advantaged investing, noted there are a few exceptions. Specifically, the government will continue processing of returns that are deemed necessary for the safety of human life or protection of government property.\\n\\nCurrently, there's no official plan for how tax returns would be handled in the event that the shutdown extends into tax filing season, which begins Jan. 15 ― an unprecedented situation, according to Fox Business.\\n\\nSo what does this mean for the majority of taxpayers expecting a refund? The government shutdown won't impact the ability to submit a tax return, but it will impact the issuance of refunds, said Jeff Fosselman, a certified financial planner, certified public accountant and senior wealth adviser at Relative Value Partners. Refunds don't start getting issued until mid-January, so depending on how long the shutdown lasts, this may or may not impact early filers.\\n\\nWilliams predicts that if shutdown lasts past Jan. 15, the potential delay would be one and a half days for every one day of continued shutdown. Past February 1, that delay could balloon to an extra two days per one day of shutdown, he said.\\n\\nAnd if the shutdown rolls into March ― Trump threatened Friday to continue for months or even years ― there's really no telling what could happen. Playing catch-up could be a nightmare for the IRS and consumers, Williams said, noting that the issue would disproportionately affect Americans in lower-income brackets who count on refunds to pay down debt, save money or simply stay afloat.\\n\\nWhat If You Owe Taxes?\\n\\nHere's the real kicker: Though Uncle Sam could indefinitely dole out IOUs to tax filers awaiting refunds, those who owe taxes will be expected to pony up by the usual deadlines, regardless of whether or not the government is shut down.\\n\\nThere's no language in the IRS plan for a shutdown that calls for payments to be withheld or delayed, Williams said. Filing deadlines most certainly still apply, and the IRS takes postmarks very seriously."}
{"original": "Bill Green/The Frederick News-Post. Police respond to a shooting in Maryland on April 2. It was one of three domestic violence murder-suicides that day.\\n\\nOn April 2, Joseph Zujkowski ignored Maryland's stay-at-home order, put his rifle in his car and drove 30 minutes to his estranged wife's house. When Heather Zujkowski, a 36-year-old Army veteran arrived home, he opened fire on her in the street, killing her and a teenage neighbor who was practicing lacrosse in his front yard. Then Zujkowski drove home and shot himself too.\\n\\nThe same day, in Georgetown, Texas, Ruben Tobias retrieved a handgun from his room and began firing on his girlfriend and her 15-year-old daughter. Then, he turned the weapon on himself. His girlfriend escaped with injuries, but her daughter, described as a fun loving free spirited child, did not.\\n\\nSimultaneously, in Lockport Township, Illinois, officers responded to calls for a wellness check for a married couple. They found Cheryl Schriefer, 59, shot in the back of the head at close range. Her husband was dead of a self-inflicted gunshot wound. Family told police that he had been afraid that the couple had contracted the coronavirus. Neither had it, according to their autopsies.\\n\\nAs the U.S. tracks the mounting death toll of the coronavirus pandemic, which reached 20,000 on Saturday, there is another list of casualties that is steadily rising, mostly hidden from view: Victims of domestic violence.\\n\\nFor weeks, experts have warned that domestic violence would increase during the outbreak, as victims are forced to shelter with abusers and crucial support services ― such as courts, shelters and even other family members who serve as a type of protective shield from violence ― are out of reach.\\n\\nNow, there are some preliminary warning signs that lethal domestic abuse is already on the rise.\\n\\nIn an average week in the U.S., around 11 murder-suicides occur. The vast majority of murder-suicides — when a person kills someone else (or multiple people) and then themselves — occur within intimate partners or families. The perpetrator, usually a man with a gun, targets his spouse or girlfriend or other family member before taking his own life.\\n\\nBetween March 27 to April 2, as the majority of states ordered the public to stay home, there were at least 19 murder-suicides (including four attempted ones), according to a HuffPost analysis. Almost all of the incidents involved a man killing his wife or child before taking his own life.\\n\\nHuffPost identified murder-suicides using Google alerts and gun violence databases. It is likely additional incidents exist.\\n\\nHuffPost Illustration HuffPost tracked murder-suicides — which often involve a perpetrator killing someone else, usually a family member, before dying by suicide — over one week when much of the nation was sheltering in place.\\n\\nExperts warned that it is too early to tell if the coronavirus crisis has ushered in a statistically significant increase in fatal acts of domestic violence. However, paired with the spike in calls to hotlines and surging gun sales across the country, many who spoke with HuffPost feared the worst.\\n\\nSeveral years ago, a colleague facetiously said, 'If you want to reduce crime in the streets, you take away the streets,' and that's essentially what we've done, said James Alan Fox, a criminology professor at Northeastern University who studies homicides. We've seen a drop in violence between strangers. At the same time, when you put people in close proximity, there's a greater opportunity for conflict. One would anticipate that domestic homicide and murder-suicide would increase in this kind of situation.\\n\\nIn the seven-day period analyzed by HuffPost, there was at least one domestic violence murder-suicide incident every day. Most days, there were two or three.\\n\\nIn some cases, the pandemic appeared to be a factor in the killing. On March 30, a 38-year-old Pennsylvania man who was upset over losing his job due to the crisis ambushed his girlfriend on the porch. I already talked to God and I have to do this, he allegedly told her, before shooting at her four times and then killing himself. One bullet hit her but she survived the homicide attempt.\\n\\nWhile it's too soon for reliable nationwide data, the spike in domestic violence reports in a number of cities in the U.S. is concerning, said Deborah Vagins, president and CEO of the National Network to End Domestic Violence. In New York state, the epicenter of the pandemic in the U.S., domestic violence calls to the police have risen by as much as 15 to 20% in recent weeks, according to state officials.\\n\\nRight now, the entire world is telling everyone to stay at home, she said. But there's a portion of our communities for whom home is not a safe place.\\n\\nJohn Dukes Photography Heather Zujkowski was killed by her estranged husband on April 2. An online fundraiser for her children described her as a kind, selfless soul that touched everyone who has ever known her.\\n\\nVagins noted that other countries, including France, China, Australia and Greenland, reported increased rates of domestic violence once they implemented shelter-in-place policies. Natural disasters in the past have also corresponded to increased rates of domestic violence. After Hurricane Harvey hit Houston in 2017, for example, domestic violence murders spiked.\\n\\nVictims have fewer options to escape abuse during the coronavirus crisis, said Allison Randall, the vice president for policy and emerging issues at the National Network to End Domestic Violence.\\n\\nHouses of friends or extended family are less available due to social distancing. Victims may not want to go to a domestic violence shelter and live with strangers during a public health crisis. At the same time, many are experiencing mounting financial insecurity due to job losses.\\n\\nRandall said advocates have heard many stories of perpetrators using the isolation and fear about the coronavirus to control and intimidate their victims.\\n\\nThey're telling survivors, 'If you leave, you're going to get the virus' or burning their insurance cards or preventing them from going to the doctor for testing, she said.\\n\\nRandall stressed that support services are still available, and urged victims to reach out to the National Domestic Violence Hotline either by phone (1-800-799-SAFE) or text LOVEIS to 22522.\\n\\nHer organization also put together a slew of online resources for victims, including a sheet on navigating court proceedings during COVID-19.\\n\\nIf you have a situation where someone is experiencing abuse and their partner buys a gun, that's just throwing gasoline on the fire. Kristen Rand, legislative director for the Violence Policy Center\\n\\nDomestic violence experts interviewed by HuffPost were particularly concerned by reports of increased gun and ammunition sales during the coronavirus crisis.\\n\\nNearly 4 million gun background checks were performed in March, the highest number since the federal government began tracking them.\\n\\nOf the top five days ever, two were Black Fridays and the other three have been during the outbreak, said Susan B. Sorenson, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania and director of the Ortner Center on Violence & Abuse.\\n\\nA lot of gun purchases are motivated by fear, she said. People are being told to stay in their homes, that thousands of people will die, and that this may go on for an extended period ... It is completely understandable to be afraid.\\n\\nBut while the public may purchase guns to protect their families, research suggests that guns are far more likely to be used to intimidate or threaten a family member than to ward off an intruder, she noted.\\n\\nAccording to one study, abusers with firearms are five times more likely to kill their victims. Firearm purchases are also associated with an increased risk of suicide for at least six years following the sale, Sorenson said.\\n\\nIf you have a situation where someone is experiencing abuse and their partner buys a gun, that's just throwing gasoline on the fire, said Kristen Rand, legislative director for the Violence Policy Center, which tracks murder-suicides in a report called American Roulette.\\n\\nRand cautioned that it is too early to know if murder-suicides have risen during the coronavirus crisis. Typically, the number of incidents fluctuate week to week, she said. But during the same time period in 2017 ― the last year for which there is data ― there were only 11 such crimes.\\n\\nI hope researchers will do a peer-reviewed study on what happened with domestic violence during this period, Rand said. It would be valuable.\\n\\nIt's not that the coronavirus crisis is causing people to become violent, noted Casey Gwinn, a national expert in domestic violence and the president of Alliance for Hope International. But the conditions could exacerbate an already dangerous situation.\\n\\nYou don't go from healthy, functional relationship to fear of COVID-19 to murder-suicide ― those things don't go together, he said. Most of these offenders have high levels of rage and now they're out of a job and they're stuck at home.\\n\\nVictims are especially vulnerable as many are not at work and don't have the protective factor of other family members.\\n\\nThey end up more isolated with the abuser, Gwinn said.\\n\\nIn the case of Heather Zujkowski, the Army veteran shot down outside her home last week, her murder was preceded by years of alleged abuse.\\n\\nShe had a protective order against her estranged husband, which required him to surrender his firearms, but it expired in January. According to court records, he strangled and stalked her in the past.\\n\\nHe also threatened to kill her.\\n\\nNeed help?

{"original": "Backside of a fiber can. Guess you could call them tubes if you consider it glass inside some other glass. Those cables are about the thickness of a headphone wire.\\n\\nLittle more than a month after many of us were at the Paris climate summit, there are several familiar faces in Davos. The Paris accord set a firm path that will allow commitments to become reality, even with its shortcomings. For business leaders that means investment decisions will become easier to make. And they know that meeting in Davos presents the best chance to get into specifics.\\n\\nAs Dominic Waughray wrote on these pages recently, the World Economic Forum has played a strong part in bringing together businesses, investors and policy makers, including forming an alliance of CEO Climate Leaders. Last night it put the circular economy at the forefront of delegates' minds by hosting the Circulars, the awards that recognize individuals and organizations that have contributed significantly to new business models and mindsets that decouple growth from the consumption of scarce natural resources.\\n\\nIn their second year, the Circulars seek to highlight how achieving the ambitious aims agreed in Paris does not require a trade off with growth. That's because circular business models drive growth. And they unlock the revenues we are otherwise throwing away by pursuing the traditional 'take, make, waste' model of doing business.\\n\\nFor forty years until the turn of the millennium, business got used to commodity prices decreasing as growth surged. But this pattern then reversed dramatically, as the rise of urbanization intensified shortages of many resources while putting others such as water and soil under great stress. In recent years, prices have skyrocketed and crashed dramatically. Prices for metals like copper, iron, tin and nickel, have nearly doubled between 2000 and 2015. The real price of oil in August 2015 was still 55 per cent higher than in August 2000.\\n\\nWe face a shortfall of 8 billion tons in constrained resources by 2030. That translates to $4.5 trillion of lost growth that year, or as much as the U.S. consumes annually today.\\n\\nThe circular economy is about more than recycling and managing landfill. We need to look at all four dimensions of waste as an opportunity. Find value in wasted resources that could become renewable, such as biofuel. Exploit the wasted capacity in property or assets that could find a market, such as the 60 percent of Europe's truck capacity that remains empty most of the time. Reduce the wasted lifecycles that currently see products discarded rather than refurbished, often because they are not built to last. Finally, secure the wasted embedded values by finding uses for otherwise rejected materials.\\n\\nFor some companies, like Method, winner of a Circulars award last year, cradle to cradle practices allow it to create fabric and personal care products entirely sustainably. Many innovators are making progress with entirely new business models. Take vertical urban farming that stacks plants, hydrates with mist and uses LED lighting to boost yields with a fraction of the space and resources required in traditional farming.\\n\\nOr the sharing economy that uses analytics to better manage supply and demand. Some use the sharing economy simply to make use of otherwise redundant assets -- from cars to property. Others use it because it allows them to recover products for improved rates of recycling and re-use. By offering products as services, companies are incentivized to prolong product lives.\\n\\nMany of these and other circular business models are dependent on new technologies. Networked sensors that generate granular data can help track resources in supply chains or manufacturing processes. Cloud computing helps data-based innovations to scale up massively. 3D printing helps make local repair more cost effective than product replacement. And materials sciences are creating long lasting materials or biodegradeable alternatives.\\n\\nAt Davos, as we begin to understand the meaning of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, it is worth considering the breadth of its relevance. In the report on the digital transformation of industries for which Accenture has partnered with the World Economic Forum, we estimate that the societal and environmental gains of digital and other technologies could be many times greater than the benefits to industry.\\n\\nThe circular economy is a digital revolution as much as a sustainable one. It is at the heart of the Fourth Industrial revolution. The beauty of the circular economy is that it delivers clear benefits for the environment while simultaneously driving entirely new revenues and business models. That is the circular advantage.\\n\\nTo learn about the winners of the Circulars, please visit www.thecirculars.org.\\n\\nThis post is part of a series produced by The Huffington Post and The World Economic Forum to mark the Forum's Annual Meeting 2016 (in Davos-Klosters, Switzerland, Jan. 20-23).

{"original": "This entry has been co-written with Dr. Heikki Koskenkylä and Dr. Peter Nyberg.\\n\\nThe 1st of January 2017 marked the 18th anniversary of the European common currency, the euro. Despite its success from 1999 to 2007, after 2008 the euro has become a burden for many of its members. For example, living standards in Italy and Greece are below the levels when they joined the euro. Finland is the only Nordic country using the euro and it is also the only Nordic country which has not yet recovered from the financial crash of 2008.\\n\\nThere have been many proposals on how to fix the euro and the EMU, but they are politically unpopular and unrealistic. In this blog-entry, we will argue that the euro will almost surely fail; we just do not know the exact timing of its demise.\\n\\nProblems of the euro are structural and persistent\\n\\nThe problem of the euro can be visualized in the development of the GDP per capita (see Figure 1). Germany has been successful in the Eurozone, while Greece and Italy have not. France is not doing well either. The jury is still out for Finland.\\n\\nFigure 1. Source: European Commission, Ameco database\\n\\nThe different growth paths are a symptom of a general problem that has haunted currency unions for centuries. Competitiveness and productivity develop at a different pace in different countries. Over time, this leads to large competitiveness differences among the members of a currency union. These differences do not usually pose a problem during economic booms, because strengthening aggregate demand supports ailing fields of production. However, when a currency union faces an economic downturn or a crisis, falling aggregate demand hits less competitive industries and countries hard and the financing costs of less competitive countries jump. This is an asymmetric shock.\\n\\nThe detrimental effects of asymmetric shocks can be mitigated by transferring funds from prosperous to declining member states. When the dollar union of the US threatened to fall apart during the Great Depression, federal government enacted federal income transfers from prosperous states to aid ailing ones. The federal budget also increased rapidly and, in practice, income transfers became permanent. The no bailout policy of crisis-hit states had already been enacted earlier.\\n\\nAccording to the ECB, competitiveness of the German economy has improved by around 19.3 percent, Greece's competitiveness has improved by around 6.5 percent, France's around 3.9 percent, Finland's around 1.7 percent and Italy's around 0.9 percent since 1999 . Thus, the differences in competitiveness are large. For survival in its present form and size the Eurozone needs a similar income transfer system, that is, a full political union as in the US.\\n\\nThere is no European-wide polling data on a political union, but it appears that the support for the EU is diminishing in its core. In a recent survey, 40 percent of Finns wanted to leave the EU. Also, only 53 percent of Dutch are against a new referendum on the EU, which means that 47 percent are either for it or do not know their stand. For permanent income transfers, you would need to change the Maastricht Treaty and ratify it in each member country or to negotiate several bilateral agreements. There is only a very small likelihood that these would go through, for example, in Finland and in the Netherlands.\\n\\nFunds, unions and reality\\n\\nBecause there is no public support for a federal European Union, many have envisaged alternative ways to fix the euro. The CEO of the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) Klaus Regling has proposed that euro could be saved by a combination of the banking and capital market union and a rainy day fund. This fund would allegedly be used when asymmetric shocks occur. The fund would be financed jointly by all euro countries. However, because of the persistent differences in competitiveness, its transfers would become permanent, like in the US. Only the most competitive members of the Eurozone would have sufficient income to finance the fund. Any financing through the European Central Bank (ECB), would need to be covered by European tax-payers later, when it would become evident that weaker countries are unable to pay back their loans and when seigniorage revenues would be unable to cover the losses of the ECB.\\n\\nThus, in practice, there are only two ways to fix the euro: A far-reaching political union proposed in the Five President's report in 2015 or returning to the system described in the Maastricht Treaty, where member states would be responsible for their own economies only (no bail-out).\\n\\nIn a full political union, there would be concentration of economic policy decision making and it would require major structural changes in the Eurozone and its member countries. Tax and social policies would be unified, labor unions would be dismantled or unified as a European-wide system, a European debt relief system and banking union would be set up. These would ensure the flexibility of wages, prices and labor agreements and guarantee convergence of competitiveness and living standards. This could work, in theory. But, the likelihood of getting all the member states to agree that their wages, debt and living conditions would be negotiated at the European level is extremely small.\\n\\nReturning to the Maastricht Treaty and to the no bail-out rule would mean that persistent differences in living standards and market based debt restructurings would be enacted. ESM and the European Financial Stability Facility would be wound down after their current programs would end. ECB support (QE and OMT) programs would stop. This would lead to the default of Greece and its likely exit from the euro. In the long-run, asymmetric shocks and persistent income differences would be likely to force several additional countries to leave the euro.\\n\\nThe Eurozone is in a stalemate. A federal union would be needed to fix its problems, but there is no public support for it. Returning to national fiscal responsibility would lead to defaults and exits. Half-way solutions will prove insufficient but expensive and obfuscate the issues. Therefore, there may be no way to avert the partial or complete break-up of the Eurozone in the years to come. The fate of the euro may already have been sealed."}

Elizabeth Warren is finding friendly faces in unfriendly territory for Democrats on her first trip to Iowa since announcing she will almost certainly challenge President Donald Trump in 2020.\\n\\nThe Massachusetts Democrat on Friday and Saturday spoke to overflow crowds that appeared eager to hear her economic populist pitch and her denunciations of corporate greed and a corrupt Washington.\\n\\nWashington keeps working great for people with money, but not for anyone else, Warren said to a round of applause at a packed theater in Sioux City, promising to end lobbying as we know it.\\n\\nWe need to call it out for what it is: It is corruption, pure and simple. And it needs to stop, she said.\\n\\nAlthough she is the first major candidate to announce a likely bid, Warren's visit ― complete with a throng of reporters following her, a full complement of staff assisting her, and vendors hawking political merchandise outside the rallies ― seemed to also mark the kickoff to a caucus season that will consume the party for the next year and could see dozens of candidates enter the Democratic fray. Former Housing Secretary Julian Castro is expected to formally announce a bid soon, and other candidates ― including everyone from former Vice President Joe Biden to California Sen. Kamala Harris to South Bend, Ind. Mayor Pete Buttigeg ― could launch campaigns in the coming months.\\n\\nThis is how it starts. Person to person. Town to town. Across Iowa and then across America, Warren told a crowd of about 500 in Council Bluffs.\\n\\nWarren's itinerary took her through western Iowa, starting in Council Bluffs and Sioux City, two midsize cities on the Missouri River that border Nebraska, before a jaunt to Storm Lake, a meatpacking town with a significant immigrant population. All three locales are in counties Trump won handily in the 2016 election, and Storm Lake and Sioux City are in the congressional district of notorious GOP Rep. Steve King.\\n\\nIn Sioux City, she grounded her pitch in her own family's life story, relating how they almost fell into poverty when her father had a heart attack in middle age and her mother feared losing their house, which was saved when her mom got a minimum wage job.\\n\\nToday, a minimum wage job in America, full time, will not keep a mama and a baby out of poverty, she said, arguing the fight for the middle class has been her life's work as a teacher, professor and U.S. senator. And it is wrong, and that's why I'm in this fight.\\n\\nShe also boasted about her work creating the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, her defeat of GOP Sen. Scott Brown in 2012, and legislation she passed that will drastically lower the cost of hearing aids.\\n\\nASSOCIATED PRESS Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) speaks at McCoy's Bar Patio and Grill in Council Bluffs, Iowa, on Jan. 4.\\n\\nWarren's travels continued with an event Saturday night in the state capital of Des Moines that drew more than 1,000 people. On Sunday, she'll meet with a group of female leaders in the rapidly growing suburb of Ankeny. The trip is her first to Iowa since 2014, when she campaigned for former Rep. Bruce Braley in Iowa's Senate race.\\n\\nThe events were not without hiccups ― Warren's mic cut out for five minutes during her Council Bluffs event, a Trump supporter was arrested outside the Storm Lake event for striking a person with a selfie stick, and the candidate was beginning to lose her voice by midday Saturday. But the toughest moment for Warren came when a voter questioned her about her decision to get a DNA test to prove her Native American ancestry.\\n\\nWhy did you undergo the DNA testing and give Donald Trump more fodder to be a bully? a woman asked.\\n\\nI am not a person of color, Warren responded. I am not a citizen of a tribe. Tribal citizenship is very different from ancestry. Tribes ― and only tribes ― determine tribal citizenship, and I respect that difference.\\n\\nShe then shifted back to her core message: What I can do is I can be in this fight for all of our families. What I think 2020 is going to be about is not my family, it's about the tens of millions of families across this country who just want a level playing field.\\n\\nTrump has signaled he has no plans to stop his attacks on Warren's heritage. This week, he tweeted out a fake bumper sticker mocking the senator. For the most part, Warren avoided direct attacks on the president – she never mentions him by name in her stump speech.\\n\\nWith the pivotal caucuses still more than a year away, Warren is the first major candidate to travel to the Hawkeye State. Dozens of candidates, including many of Warren's fellow senators, are likely to enter the contest. Early opinion polls of Iowa place Warren in the mix, but position Biden and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders as the Democratic front-runners. Warren is expected to draw support from both former backers of Sanders and voters who backed eventual nominee Hillary Clinton in 2016.\\n\\nIn her appearances throughout the state, there were also hints of how she would differentiate herself from Sanders, who could be her main rival for the votes of progressives. While the Vermonter almost never mentions his own life experiences on the trail, Warren dwelled heavily on her own biography: She rued her decision to drop out of college at age 19 to get married and referenced her efforts to potty-train her 2-year-old daughter and her time as a fifth-grade Sunday school teacher.\\n\\nAnd while Sanders' biggest applause lines typically come when he mentions one of his signature policy pushes ― expanding Medicare for people over the age of 65 to the entire American population ― Warren avoided directly mentioning the issue, instead repeatedly discussing the importance of Medicaid. Warren has co-sponsored Medicare for All legislation in the Senate.\\n\\nNo one's raised it, Warren told reporters in Sioux City when asked why she hadn't mentioned the plan. But I have had a chance to talk about Medicaid. We've had a national conversation about health care, and I think it's been enormously valuable.\\n\\nStill, few people at any of the events were ready to commit to vote for Warren a year from now, with many hoping to hear from former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke, Harris or other candidates.\\n\\nTim Daugherty, a post office worker from Council Bluffs, said he thought Iowa voters would appreciate Warren's fighting spirit.\\n\\nShe's not afraid to stand toe to toe with Trump, he said.\\n\\nWoodbury County Democratic Party Chair Jeremy Dumkrieger, who attended the Sioux City event, said he was pleased Warren started out in western Iowa.\\n\\nIt shows all of us that she understands Iowa is a lot more than just Des Moines, he said. And he anticipated voters would be ready for Warren's message. After a couple of years of Trump, we're ready to just say what we believe.\\n\\nThis story has been updated with additional details."}

The bill addresses the crime of lynching ― extrajudicial executions carried out by a mob. According to the NAACP, lynching was used after the Civil War to resolve some of the anger that whites had in relation to the free blacks. At least 4,742 people, predominantly African-Americans, were reportedly lynched in America from 1882 to 1968.\\n\\nSince a new session of Congress has begun, the Senate-approved act and a corresponding bill in the House that's still in committee will likely have to be reintroduced.\\n\\nAs of now, the Senate bill defines lynching as two or more people willfully caus[ing] bodily injury because of the victim's actual or perceived race, color, religion, national origin, disability, gender, sexual orientation or gender identity.\\n\\nStaver told OneNewsNow that if passed, the Justice for Victims of Lynching Act would be the first federal law to mention gender identity and sexual orientation.\\n\\nPizer said LGBTQ Americans still urgently need comprehensive and explicit federal anti-discrimination laws.

{"original": "Last month the nation watched, transfixed, as more than a hundred women stood before a Michigan courtroom to describe how Larry Nassar altered their lives with his abuse. They were heard and heeded. The judge listened, the media listened, the world listened, and those girls and women were told that their suffering mattered. Many women who are sexually abused get their day in court, but on a different side of the judge ― when they're defendants in a criminal case. And their abuse, it seems, counts for little.\\n\\nA staggering number of incarcerated women are victims of childhood sexual abuse. Studies suggest that between 47 and 82 percent of women have endured that crime. Other studies say 94 percent of incarcerated women have been victimized sexually, some as children, others as adults.\\n\\nBecause women have long been lumped in with male prisoners in correctional and prosecutorial planning for years, it's only recently that researchers culled data that show what's really happening to incarcerated women. Last year, the Prison Policy Initiative painted the first landscape of female incarceration. What they found was disturbing.\\n\\nJail, as opposed to prison, has become a correctional catch basin for women: Sixty percent of women in jail are unsentenced, left behind bars because they are unable to afford bond. The remaining 40 percent of female jail detainees are sentenced but have not been moved to a prison because they are low-risk inmates. In 2016, the Vera Institute of Justice conducted surveys of that jail population and found that 86 percent of them reported being sexually violated before being incarcerated.\\n\\nThe United States has made a practice of locking up victims.\\n\\nIn other words, the United States has made a practice of locking up victims. The blame for that practice can be laid at the feet of the burgeoning opioid crisis; the war on drugs, which has a disparate effect on women; and our widespread insistence on ignoring girls when they report sexual abuse.\\n\\nThe Campaign for Trauma-Informed Policy and Practice has detailed the connection between opioid addictions and childhood sexual abuse. Victims of childhood trauma are more likely to report debilitating physical pain and be prescribed pain medication, and 80 percent of people seeking treatment for opioid addiction have experienced at least one form of childhood trauma, including sexual abuse. Childhood sexual abuse, particularly among women, is highly correlated with opioid abuse. Women are increasingly likely to turn to opioids for relief from pain, be it physical, psychic or both. Between 2002 and 2013, heroin use among women doubled.\\n\\nDuring roughly that same time, between 1989 and 2009, drug possession arrests among women tripled (for men, they doubled). Women who are imprisoned for heroin possession are not a danger to the community; that's why they're allowed to stay in jails rather than in higher-security prisons. Eighty-two percent of women in state prisons have been convicted of nonviolent offenses.\\n\\nWomen in state prisons are more likely to be incarcerated for a drug or property offense (like theft) than men are. According to The Sentencing Project, 24 percent of women in state facilities have been convicted of a drug offense, compared to 15 percent of male prisoners. When it comes to property crimes, 28 percent of incarcerated women have been convicted, compared to 19 percent among incarcerated men.\\n\\nThe failed war on drugs has targeted women at the very moment that illegal drugs are more widely available to women who are seeking relief from profound suffering.\\n\\nWe have the beginnings of a tailor-made solution to this problem before us right now. Unlike past reforms, which used a one-policy-fits-all-genders mode, the Dignity for Incarcerated Women Act seeks to address the unique needs of this swelling population. Introduced last summer by Senators Cory Booker (D-N.J.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and co-sponsored by Sens. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) and Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), the bill recognizes the history of sexual abuse shared by so many women behind bars.\\n\\nThe Dignity Act insists that incarcerated women be viewed through a lens of trauma; for example, it bans cross-gender strip searches and other re-traumatizing security measures and mandates that inmates who menstruate receive sufficient feminine hygiene products. Even though it hasn't been scheduled for a hearing, the Dignity Act has already had demonstrable impact: within a month of its introduction, the Federal Bureau of Prisons issued a memo promising to provide adequate and free menstrual supplies. While the Dignity Act and all of its state-level progeny are revolutionary legislation and deserve a hearing and a yea vote, these laws do little to prevent the fact that the women it's trying to dignify probably shouldn't be incarcerated in the first place.\\n\\nAn even better approach to justice reform laws is to treat women in the justice system with a filter of trauma — rather than a lens. This means pulling out female arrestees who have been abused before they reach a correctional facility and referring them to appropriate treatment. In addition to respecting victims' experiences, such a shift in practice would slow the out-of-control rate of growth of the female incarcerated population.\\n\\nMany people will balk at such a solution because it doesn't roar with accountability for offenders; female arrestees broke the law, after all, some in very serious ways. But the fever for accountability ― the fever that spiked as Nassar's victims described their suffering with such eloquence and rage ― needs to be brought down. One way to do that is to recognize that our thirst for justice in an extreme case like the Nassar scandal is at odds with how we treat many victims of child sex abuse.\\n\\nOur sympathy for sexual abuse victims, while we're in the throes of punishing their abusers, is righteous. But it seems to fade away when they self-medicate because the pain of their victimization is too much to bear. It disappears when victims respond to their pain in ways that are less socially acceptable than testifying at their abuser's sentencing. All victims of sexual abuse deserve our compassion ― and they need help, not punishment.\\n\\nChandra Bozelko is the author of Up the River: An Anthology and writes the award-winning blog Prison Diaries.

{"original": "Jeff Greenberg via Getty Images The Manhattan skyline glowing with electric power, as seen from the Long Island City side of the Queensboro Bridge.\\n\\nASTORIA, N.Y. ― A top New York City councilman is preparing to introduce a bill mandating that the city come up with a plan by the end of the year to phase out nearly two dozen gas-fired power plants and replace them with renewable sources of electricity.\\n\\nThe legislation would require the city to carry out a study on the feasibility of replacing existing in-city gas-fired plants with renewables that use battery storage, according to a draft HuffPost obtained. By Dec. 30, 2019, the city would have to lay out a plan to swap those gas-fired generating stations for new wind or solar units paired with batteries.\\n\\nThere's no guarantee the study will result in a workable proposal. But the impact could be huge. Of the 24 power plants in New York City, 21 burn gas, contributing to the roughly 30 percent of the city's greenhouse gas emissions that come from the utility sector, according to city data. The other three burn petroleum, an even dirtier fuel, and would likely be affected by any policy aimed at drastically shrinking fossil fuel's share of the city's electricity production.\\n\\nReached by phone on Monday, Councilman Costa Constantinides, the Queens lawmaker who authored the bill, confirmed its existence but declined to comment on its details.\\n\\nDonald Trump may love power plants, but we know the 21st-century future is a green grid, said Constantinides, who chairs the council's Committee on Environmental Protection.\\n\\nThe bill, announced Tuesday and set to be introduced Wednesday, marks a significant step toward weaning the nation's largest and most economically influential city off fossil fuels. Six cities across the United States already generate 100 percent of their electricity with renewables. The city council in Washington, D.C., passed a bill last month requiring the city to offset 100 percent of its electricity purchases with renewable energy credits by 2032. But it would be a historic first for a metropolis like New York to shutter existing gas plants like these, and the city's move would likely ripple far beyond the five boroughs as other big cities sought ways to slash climate-changing emissions.\\n\\nSome small cities have managed to shift to renewable electricity but nothing on the scale of New York, said David Pomerantz, executive director of the nonprofit Energy and Policy Institute, which tracks the utility sector.\\n\\nIt's unclear whether an overhaul of New York's power stations would trigger utility cost increases for ratepayers, but industry groups likely to oppose the bill are expected to argue that it would.\\n\\nThe legislation calls for researching at least six different types of batteries to store excess wind or solar power for times when the wind doesn't blow and the sun isn't shining. That would, in theory, offer the increased energy reliability needed to replace a network of gas-fired peaker plants on the New York waterfront. Those plants provide backup power when demand is high or there's a malfunction at power stations upstate.\\n\\nAlexander C. Kaufman / HuffPost Councilman Costa Constantinides announced a bill to reduce emissions from big buildings at a City Hall press conference last year.\\n\\nBut a large share of New York City's locally produced electricity is generated by two power plants in the densely populated northwestern corner of Queens that Constantinides represents. The plants, located in the councilman's native Astoria and neighboring Long Island City, each burn a mix of gas and fuel oil. The stations annually burn a combined 6.3 million gallons of No. 6 fuel oil ― a thick, viscous blend considered one of the most polluting energy sources in the world. The Long Island City plant, called Ravenswood Generating Station, was ranked the state's largest carbon polluter in 2014.\\n\\nThe bill's announcement comes nearly two weeks after an equipment malfunction at a Consolidated Edison substation next door to the Astoria Generating Station released an electric arc flash that illuminated the city sky with an eerie neon blue. The accident, the result of a broken voltage monitoring system, had no direct connection to the neighboring power plant.\\n\\nBut the incident ― on which Constantinides is scheduled to hold a Feb. 11 hearing ― raised new concerns about the risks of burning fossil fuels for electricity in a residential neighborhood and cast a new light on existing public health problems linked to power plant pollution.\\n\\nSpeaking at a press conference outside a utility complex in Astoria on Tuesday morning, Constantinides said, It's time for a greener future here in western Queens.\\n\\nAstoria Borealis was a spotlight on the issues of what we're dealing with in our community, he said.\\n\\nIn 2015, Astoria and Long Island City suffered from higher pollution levels than the rest of the borough and the city, according to New York City Department of Health findings. The levels of PM2.5 ― a fine-grain pollutant that wedges into lung tissue when inhaled, making it one of the most harmful types of particulate matter ― hit 8.9 micrograms per cubic meter, higher than the 8.4 average for Queens overall and the 8.6 average citywide.\\n\\nQueens officials, including Constantinides, have long blamed the plants for the two neighborhoods' high levels of asthma, which earned one part of northern Astoria the nickname Asthma Alley. In 2017, the city council passed legislation requiring the utility operators to stop using No. 6 fuel oil by 2020 and No. 4 oil by 2030. The new bill would be the first to lay the groundwork for phasing out the plants altogether.\\n\\nBloomberg via Getty Images An electric arc released by an equipment malfunction at a ConEdison substation in Astoria illuminated the New York skyline late last month.\\n\\nMeanwhile in Albany, the new Democratic majorities in both houses of the New York Legislature are preparing to push the Climate and Community Protection Act, a bill that would mandate 100 percent renewable energy across the state by 2050. The CCPA has repeatedly passed in the state Assembly since it was first introduced in 2016, but the previous Republican majority in the state Senate refused to hold a vote on it. Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D), who now says he wants to shift the state to 100 percent carbon-free electricity by 2040, declined to champion the legislation last year.\\n\\nNew York state generates just 5 percent of its electricity from wind or solar. The New York City area consumes roughly 60 percent of all power in the state, but produces just 40 percent.\\n\\nDemocratic state Sen. Jessica Ramos, a newly elected legislator from Queens, vowed to co-sponsor the CCPA and consider other ways to provide state-level support to Constantinides' legislation.\\n\\nWe're looking into what can be done as a state measure as we speak, she told HuffPost on Monday. It's exactly what we should be doing.\\n\\nState agencies are already making a push. Last June, New York's Department of Public Service issued a report outlining an energy storage roadmap. In December, the state's Public Service Commission released a plan requiring utilities such as ConEdison to procure a total of 350 megawatts of storage as part of a broader blueprint to decrease the state's dependence on fossil-fueled peaker plants. The New York State Energy Research and Development Authority earlier vowed to conduct a study on how to move every sector in the state to 100 percent renewable energy, although Politico reported last week that the report had not been made public by the end of 2018 as promised.\\n\\nPete Sikora, a senior adviser to the grassroots group New York Communities for Change, said it's critical for the city to conduct its own study to put more pressure on state agencies.\\n\\nIt's all about politics, Sikora said after Tuesday's press conference. And it's important that it's in the city's hands.\\n\\nThe power plant bill will be the second major piece of energy legislation from Constantinides in a little over five weeks. In November, he introduced legislation to cut emissions from buildings of more than 25,000 square feet by 80 percent by 2050. That would set what could be a new standard for cities around the world and form the backbone of what proponents have dubbed the Green New Deal for New York City.\\n\\nThe legislative push builds on high-profile efforts from other top City Hall officials. In December, New York City Comptroller Scott Stringer announced a significant next step in divesting the city's $200 billion pension funds from the oil and gas sector as he issued a request for a proposal to analyze the city's fossil fuel risks.\\n\\nLast January, Mayor Bill de Blasio decided to sue five major oil companies over infrastructure damage linked to sea level rise. A federal judge dismissed the suit in July, but California and seven other states signed on to New York City's appeal in November.\\n\\nPomerantz, of the Energy and Policy Institute, suggested that the deadline in the power plant bill is key.\\n\\nThe question of speed makes all the difference in the world for climate change, he said. If New York City is serious about its climate goals, that's exactly what it needs to do, is look at the question and say, 'How quickly can we get out of gas and into renewables?'\\n\\nThis story was updated with details from the press conference and comment from Pete Sikora."}

{"original": "Home purchasers who were obliged to take out private mortgage insurance (PMI) because their down payment was less than 20% of the price have the right to cancel it, ridding themselves of the monthly premium. Borrowers should take advantage of the opportunity if they can but they must meet the cancellation rules.\\n\\nCancellation Rules\\n\\nUnder Federal law, lenders are required to cancel private mortgage insurance on most home mortgage loans made after July 29, 1999. Cancellation will occur automatically when amortization has reduced the loan balance to 78% of the value of the property at the time the loan was made. The borrower cannot accelerate this process with extra payments.\\n\\nUnder another provision of this law, lenders must terminate insurance at the borrower's request when the loan balance hits 80% of the original value. Borrowers can accelerate the process of getting to 80% by making extra payments.\\n\\nWarning: A lender need not accept a request for cancellation if the borrower has taken out a second mortgage or had an excessive number of delinquencies in the prior two years, or if the property has declined in value.\\n\\nIf Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac own the mortgage, the cancellation rules apply to the current appraised value of the property rather than the value at the time the loan was made. Borrowers can request cancellation after two years if the loan balance is no more than 75% of current appraised value, and after 5 years if it is no more than 80%. The ratios are lower if there is a second mortgage, if the property is held for investment rather than occupancy, if the property is other than single-family, or if the borrower has had recent delinquencies.\\n\\nPaying Off PMI as an Investment\\n\\nHomeowners should view paying off PMI as a potential investment that can yield a high return. Until now, figuring out how large that return was exceeded the capacities of almost all borrowers, but no longer. My colleague Allan Redstone has developed a PMI payoff spreadsheet, which shows the investment required to eliminate PMI, and the rate of return on that investment, for each of three rules: 80% of original value, 75% of current value after 2 years, and 80% of current value after 5 years. The spreadsheet is on my web site and is available for anyone to download.\\n\\nA unique feature of PMI payoff as an investment is that the amount of the investment is a specific dollar amount. Hence, the borrower's decision must consider not only the rate of return but also whether or not they have the exact amount required.\\n\\nHere is an example. Three years ago, the borrower purchased a house for $200,000 with a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage of $190,000 at 4%, and a monthly mortgage insurance premium of $65. She expects to be in the house another 4 years. The house is now worth $225,000, requiring an investment of $11,098 to bring the loan balance down to $168,750, which is 75% of $225,000. The return on investment in dollars is the $65 a month insurance premium for 68 months, plus the $14,280 difference in the loan balance in month 84 when the owner expects to sell the house. The rate of return is 8.96%\\n\\nNote that the $65 monthly saving in mortgage insurance extends for only 68 months because in month 69, the ratio of loan balance to original property value falls below 78%, which under the law requires the lender to cancel the policy.\\n\\nBorrowers Paying Higher Premiums Earn a Higher Return\\n\\nThe example described above applied to a relatively low-risk transaction that carried a very modest mortgage insurance premium. The transaction assumed a single-family home, a purchase for occupancy, and a credit score of 800.\\n\\nBorrowers with poor credit pay more when they borrow, but there is a reverse side to that coin. When they invest in reducing their obligations, the rate of return is correspondingly high. If the purchaser in my example intended to rent the house rather than occupy it, and if her credit score was 620 rather than 800, her insurance premium would be almost 6 times larger. In that event, the rate of return on the investment required to eliminate the insurance would be 39.26%.\\n\\nHow the Passage of Time Affects the Investment\\n\\nIntuitively, it would appear that the sooner you pay down the balance and rid yourself of the PMI premium, the better off you will be, but this may or may not be the case. It depends on the circumstances and preferences of the borrower.\\n\\nConsider the example given earlier where after three years the borrower earns 8.55% on an investment of $11,098. If the same borrower decided to make the investment after 4 years instead of 3, her dollar savings would be smaller because both the number of PMI premium payments and the balance reduction in the payoff month would be smaller. On the other hand, the required investment would be $7326 instead of $11,098, which might make it affordable, and the rate of return on investment would be 10.52% as compared to 8.55%.\\n\\nIn general, the longer the borrower waits to pay down the balance to the point where the PMI is eliminated, the smaller is the savings in dollars and in the investment required, but the higher is the rate of return on investment. The power of the spreadsheet is that it allows each individual borrower to adopt the payoff strategy that best fits her needs and capacities.\\n\\nComparison with Other Investments\\n\\nIn comparison to other investments, an investment in PMI payoff ranks very high on default risk, because there is none, and on expected return. The drawback has been the complexity of the process, which has made it difficult to determine exactly what the rate of return is. Eliminating this uncertainty is the reason we developed the spreadsheet.\\n\\nFor more unbiased advice on mortgages, visit my website The Mortgage Professor."}
{"original": "A new pathogen that is believed to have originated in a seafood and live animal market in Wuhan, China, late in December has spread to at least 15 countries including Canada, the U.S., France and Singapore.\\n\\nThe Wuhan virus is a new form of coronavirus — a term for a group of viruses that have crown-like spikes on them and cause illnesses as benign as the common cold and as severe as SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome).\\n\\nWhat is it?\\n\\nThis strain of coronavirus has infected more than 6,000 people globally and killed at least 132. In some people, it causes symptoms similar to the common cold — such as coughing and fever — but in more severe cases it gives patients pneumonia-like symptoms.\\n\\nCoronaviruses often spread between animals, but some make the jump from animal to human when they mutate, which appears to be the case here, according to Steven Hoffman, a professor of global health, law and political science at York University.\\n\\nASSOCIATED PRESS The Wuhan Huanan Wholesale Seafood Market, where a number of people related to the market fell ill with a virus, sits closed in China's central city of Wuhan on Tuesday.\\n\\nInitially, the disease wasn't readily transmitted from person to person and all patients had visited the market believed to be the source of the outbreak. But the virus appears to have mutated, giving it the ability to transmit more easily between people and having infected some health-care workers. However, all transmissions are still first and secondary. That means so far, people who got sick either went to the market or were in contact with someone who was at the market, which has been closed for disinfection since Jan. 1. No one has gotten it from third or fourth degree transmission, Hoffman said.\\n\\nViruses and other pathogens evolving is one of the challenges when it comes to managing and curing them, but it happens often.\\n\\nThe important thing to note is this isn't abnormal … this kind of development is exactly what the world has been preparing for because we know that these things are going to happen, Hoffman added.\\n\\nASSOCIATED PRESS An employee works to prevent a new coronavirus at Suseo Station in Seoul on Friday.\\n\\nSymptoms of the disease include coughing, fever, difficulty breathing and lesions on the lungs that can be seen during medical imagery.\\n\\nResearchers and doctors are still searching for answers regarding this new coronavirus, including what animal passed it on to a human. Investigations into the disease's origins, range of effects and types of transmission are still in their beginning stages.\\n\\nIs Canada concerned?\\n\\nOn Jan. 25, health officials confirmed a man in his 50s who had travelled from Wuhan to Toronto had contracted the virus — the first reported case in Canada. Officials said the man was in stable condition in a negative pressure room at a Toronto hospital. A second case in Toronto — the first patient's wife — as well as a case in B.C. have now also been identified.\\n\\nDr. David Williams, Ontario's chief medical officer of health, said the province's health system acted as it should and the risk to Ontarians is still low.\\n\\nThe Public Health Agency of Canada is monitoring the situation as it progresses but also said the risk to Canadian travellers and Canada is low. A spokeswoman from the agency said the country is well positioned to deal with the disease.\\n\\nWe have been preparing with the provinces and territories since we heard about the first cases in China. We began implementing new measures to mitigate the risk of introduction of the virus into Canada and to control and prevent its spread, said Maryse Durette, the agency's senior media relations advisor.\\n\\nASSOCIATED PRESS In this Wednesday file photo, a staff member moves bio-waste containers past the entrance of the Wuhan Medical Treatment Center in China.\\n\\nCanada's robust public health infrastructure means the country is prepared to deal with it, Hoffman noted.\\n\\n[The system] is ready to identify cases, diagnose them, isolate people if needed, and provide the full range of care for those who find themselves sick.\\n\\nHoffman said there's no need to panic. However, health agencies must be ready, which is why investing in public health even between outbreaks is so vital.\\n\\nThis is the new normal in the sense that we live in a globalized world where people are travelling and carrying pathogens and bacteria with them, which do not carry passports. So we just need to be prepared.\\n\\nFederal health agencies have already planned with their territorial and provincial counterparts on what actions to take if more cases start to appear in Canada.\\n\\nIf a case is identified, the ministry will convene several co-ordination and communication processes, including the clinical team treating the case to ensure they have the scientific and technical expertise and support that they need. We will also share communications with our broader health-system partners for their situational awareness, David Jensen, a spokesman for Ontario's Ministry of Health, said before the virus reached the province.\\n\\nThis map below from Johns Hopkins University shows the global spread of the new coronavirus. Story continues below.\\n\\nOther provinces are deploying similar measures.\\n\\nIn Alberta, we have proactively issued a province-wide advisory to doctors to ensure physicians are aware of the virus, are able to take recommended actions and promptly alert public health officials if they encounter a suspected case, Tom McMillan, a representative for Alberta Health, told HuffPost Canada.\\n\\nThe Chief Medical Officer of Health is also working with Alberta Health Services to ensure that the health system is ready to respond effectively if needed, he added.\\n\\nHow can Canadians protect themselves?\\n\\nLike other coronavirus strains, the Wuhan virus can be spread through coughing, sneezing or general contact with someone carrying the pathogen. Experts recommend taking all the regular precautions that people should be taking during flu season anyway — washing hands often, coughing into your elbow instead of your hand, not going to work if you're feeling unwell, avoiding contact with sick people, and seeing a doctor as soon as possible if you're showing symptoms.\\n\\nMasks might make you feel better, but they aren't particularly helpful, as most are more likely to protect the person wearing them from spreading the infection rather than catching it.\\n\\nASSOCIATED PRESS Passengers wear masks amidst an outbreak of a new coronavirus in a subway station in Hong Kong on Wednesday.\\n\\nWhat now?\\n\\nA vaccine could take years of research and testing to develop. MERS, for example, which emerged in 2012 and has already killed 851 people, still doesn't have an approved inoculation. SARS, which was identified in 2002 and killed 774, mostly ran its course on its own by the end of 2003. Most people with various forms of coronavirus recover on their own, but older people and those with chronic disease are more likely to be hit with severe forms of the illness.\\n\\nBut Canada and other countries are more prepared to deal with this virus than they were in 2002 when SARS was active. Communication between nations is open, and the specific strain of coronavirus already has a diagnostic test available.\\n\\nWhat's most important is that we're monitoring, keeping up to date on what's happening, trying to learn as much as possible and sharing that information with everyone who needs that. What we're seeing is a lot of communication between the federal governments and provincial and territorial governments, as well as between Canada and other countries and the World Health Organization, Hoffman noted.\\n\\nThe first step of being prepared for a potential future pandemic is to have that information and have the mechanisms to share it.\\n\\nA Canadian travel advisory recommends travellers to China avoid high-risk areas that have animals such as farms, markets and butchers, avoid contact with living and dead animals, and avoid surfaces with animal waste on them. The advisory also reminded travellers to wash their hands frequently and monitor their own health carefully during and after their trips. Travel in and out of China was expected to increase around the Lunar New Year holiday on Saturday.\\n\\nChina has put at least 12 cities under lockdown, attempting to restrict the movements of around 35 million people. Hoffman said a quarantine on that scale is unprecedented and is unlikely to work, either in China or hypothetically in Canada.\\n\\nEven if we did try to stop travel, it still happens anyway. The good news about travel that's done through official channels like flights is that you can track it and if someone does get a case, you can use some contact tracing knowing who that person traveled with and who they were around, he said. Generally travel bans don't work and people find ways around them.\\n\\nASSOCIATED PRESS A health official scans the body temperature of a passenger as she arrives at the Soekarno-Hatta International Airport in Tangerang, Indonesia, on Wednesday.\\n\\nMany international airports across the globe, including ones in Canada and the U.S., are screening passengers for symptoms, though this approach didn't work very well during the SARS outbreak.\\n\\nIn theory, it allows you to narrow in on who might have this, but in practice in the past, that approach was not shown to be helpful during SARS, for example, there were cases where people were in Canadian airports. We did screen millions of people for temperatures and didn't find a single case of SARS. That way so very expensive, disruptive and doesn't always work.\\n\\nSince the virus has already been genetically sequenced, diagnosing new cases is a fairly quick process. The World Health Organization is monitoring the situation but has not yet declared a global health emergency because the spread outside of China is still contained.\\n\\nWith files from The Canadian Press"}

He took an entourage to Doonbeg after a state visit with Queen Elizabeth II last year. Vice President Mike Pence went three hours out of his way to stay at Trump's resort in Doonbeg last year, even though he had traveled to Ireland to meet with the nation's prime minister in Dublin.

{"original": "Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) once told a fellow left-wing activist that the Democratic Party was too intellectually bankrupt to allow the progressive movement to flourish within it.\\n\\nIn a 1985 letter newly obtained by HuffPost in which Sanders debated running for governor, he wrote: Whether I run for governor or not is really not important. What would be a tragedy, however, is for people with a radical vision to fall into the pathetic camp of the intellectually bankrupt Democratic Party.\\n\\nTimes have changed.\\n\\nSanders, who has served as an independent in Congress — first in the House and now in the Senate — since 1991, is now among the leading Democratic candidates for president, second behind former Vice President Joe Biden in national polls, and tied for first in Iowa. He's raised more money than any other candidate in the Democratic primary, with more individual contributions. His platform — which includes Medicare for All, tuition-free college, and wealth redistribution through aggressive taxes on the richest Americans — defines the party's progressive wing.\\n\\nHe has taken the Democratic Party's loyalty pledge and repeatedly promised to support whoever becomes the party nominee to defeat President Donald Trump. But that hasn't been enough for many of his critics in the party's establishment, who are likely to point to the letter as evidence he doesn't play nice with the party.\\n\\nAt the start of his career in politics, Sanders viewed the Democratic Party as hopeless. By 1985, he had already made several failed bids for elected office in Vermont as a member of the progressive Liberty Union party. He finally succeeded in 1981, becoming mayor of Burlington, the state's largest city, and toppling a five-term Democratic mayor.\\n\\nAt the beginning, the Democrats were very angry with him, Jane Sanders, Sanders' wife, said in an interview with HuffPost. Burlington's Board of Aldermen — a part-time, 13-seat city council — resisted Sanders' efforts. They wouldn't let him appoint any of the mayoral appointments. They stopped him from hiring the city attorney, city clerk, city treasure ... [The Democrats] were outright enemies in the beginning.\\n\\nSanders never won full control of city government, but he organized enough voters to elect some allies onto the board and win veto power. He soon became popular enough to win reelection by a 20-point margin.\\n\\nThe Sept. 5, 1985 letter ― which has not previously been reported on ― came as Sanders was considering a run for governor, and left-wing activists in the state and around the country were debating whether he should mount an independent bid or launch a primary challenge to the state's Democratic governor, Madeleine Kunin.\\n\\nObtained by HuffPost A Sept. 5, 1985, letter from then-Burlington, Vermont, Mayor Bernie Sanders to Marty Jezer, a progressive activist.\\n\\nSanders' three-paragraph missive was addressed to Marty Jezer, an author and progressive activist in the state. Then-Mayor Sanders was writing in response to an August letter from Jezer in which he apologized that a memo he wrote to Sanders had leaked to the press. While the exact contents of the memo are unclear, Jezer's letter indicates that it encouraged Sanders to run for Congress instead of challenging Kunin.\\n\\n1986 is the wrong time for such a race, Jezer, who died in 2005, wrote. I hope you will listen to the voices of the committed activists around the state. We sink or swim with this together.\\n\\nSanders ultimately reached a different conclusion: He ran against Kunin as an independent. But the decision was not without dissent. An editorial from the socialist magazine In These Times criticized Sanders for dividing the left.\\n\\nIn choosing to create a three-way race, Sanders is dividing the left and making more likely the defeat of an incumbent liberal woman governor by a more conservative Republican, In These Times wrote. (At the time, Kunin was one of only two female governors in the country.)\\n\\nThe editorial prompted Sanders to reply: I believe that the real changes that are needed in this country … are not going to be brought about by working within the Democratic Party or the Republican Party.\\n\\nKunin eventually won reelection with 47% of the vote. Republican Peter Smith finished second, earning 38% of the vote, while Sanders finished third with just 14%.\\n\\nThe Vermont senator's critiques of the Democratic Party are well documented, as CNN reported last July. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, he was adamant that a progressive movement could not be built within the party and was highly critical of the moderate New Democrats who argued that the party's progressivism in the 1960s, 1970s and early 1980s had alienated voters.\\n\\nI think that nationally, the party has on issue after issue sold out so many times that if you go before the people and say, 'Hey, I'm a Democrat,' you don't usually generate a lot of enthusiasm, Sanders said in 1991 about the idea of a progressive trying to work within the party.\\n\\nCommenting on civil rights activist Jesse Jackson's Democratic presidential runs in the 1980s, Sanders said he did not agree with Jackson's decision to work within the Democratic Party. (Sanders endorsed Jackson's candidacy.) His skepticism of the party continued in subsequent decades. In 2011, he said Democrats could be called Republican-lite for considering cuts to Social Security and Medicare in order to lessen the deficit. And his first presidential campaign in 2016 didn't shy away from blasting the party apparatus.\\n\\nSanders' willingness to criticize the Democratic Party speaks to the progressive bona fides highlighted by his supporters. His campaign often relies on decades-old videos of Sanders warning against the Iraq war, multinational trade deals and the climate crisis using the same rhetoric he still uses today.\\n\\nBut the senator's view of the party — and the role of progressive politics within it — has evolved. He's since refined his critiques to focus on the corporate wing of the Democratic Party, which is composed of the same centrists, including organizations like Third Way, that pushed the party to the right during the 1980s and '90s.\\n\\nJane Sanders, who did not recall the exact circumstances of her husband's letter to Jezer, said this shift came about when he was elected to the House as an independent. He knew that if Democrats didn't let him into their caucus, he wouldn't be assigned to any committees and would be left out of the process altogether.\\n\\nHe believed that the two-party system was bankrupt, but as he was put in a position by the people of Vermont to effect real change, he had to consider, how do you effect real change? Jane Sanders said. His concern isn't party politics.\\n\\nBy 2015, when he launched his bid for the Democratic presidential nomination, Sanders had fully changed his mind about the ability for progressive politics to flourish within the party.\\n\\nThe decision that I made, as the longest-serving independent in the history of the United States Congress, I said, 'If we are going to win this race, we have to do it within the Democratic primary process,' Sanders said in a 2016 interview with NBC's Chuck Todd. He decided to not run as an independent because he didn't want to be a spoiler in the presidential race.\\n\\nBernie fights when he has to fight, Jane Sanders said. Bernie's interest is getting things he wants done, done. He found that he had to fight effectively against the Democratic Party at the beginning as mayor. But over time, by organizing, he learned he can change the Democratic Party.\\n\\nSanders' relationship with the party has notably softened since that first presidential run. He served on the Senate Democrats' leadership team and his 2016 campaign managed to push the Democratic National Committee to change rules around superdelegates, lessening the power of party insiders in the nominating process.\\n\\nThat hasn't been enough for many of his critics, who accuse him of only half-heartedly campaigning for former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in 2016 after dragging out the primary, and question whether he would be willing to support down-ballot Democratic candidates who don't share his progressive ideology.\\n\\nJane Sanders said she hadn't spoken with her husband about how he would engage in party politics should he be elected president. But she was explicit about how he approaches it currently.\\n\\nIf you organize, the people will elect new people, Jane Sanders said, citing those like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), who famously ousted a top-ranking House Democrat in the 2018 midterm elections. You will see Bernie supporting and raising money for the best of the Democrats. You will not see him doing that for others.\\n\\nBut former Vermont Gov. Peter Shumlin, a Democrat who has endorsed former Vice President Joe Biden in the 2020 nominating contest, said he was skeptical that Sanders could keep the party together during an election against Trump.\\n\\nThe notion that [Sanders] would lead the national Democratic Party would be repugnant to both Democrats and to Bernie Sanders, because he's not a Democrat, Shumlin told HuffPost in a phone interview. He'd be the first one to tell you that.\\n\\nThat the party's policy debates have only now caught up to him was Sanders' opening pitch to voters when he announced in early 2019 that he would run for president again.\\n\\nOver the last two years — and before — you and I and millions of Americans have stood up and fought for justice in every part of our society, and we've had some successes, Sanders said when launching his 2020 bid.\\n\\nAs one of the top contenders going into the Iowa caucuses in early February, Sanders now clearly believes that he can bring about a progressive revolution within the Democratic Party — one that he's worked to change."}
{"original": "Video credit: Skye Fitzgerald, director, Spin Film\\n\\nAhmed Elhubbish, a middle-aged Yemeni living in Yemen's capital city of Sanaa, wants to know what his children — Abdul Rahman, Khalid, Wasim and Siham — did wrong.\\n\\nLast year, they were killed in an airstrike launched from thousands of miles above them by sophisticated machinery from continents away. What could make them targets for the coalition led by Saudi Arabia and supported by the U.S. that has been bombing Yemen since 2015?\\n\\nThere's not a single reason for persistent attacks on Yemenis such as the May 2019 strike that hit his children, Elhubbish said through a translator in an outtake from Hunger Ward, a new documentary on the war and mass starvation in Yemen, which was directed by Oscar and Emmy nominee Skye Fitzgerald. (Watch above. Note: The video contains graphic images.)\\n\\nThe footage, which was shot for the documentary and shared exclusively with HuffPost, showed the immediate aftermath of an airstrike and included reflections by Elhubbish and others that highlight the toll of the bombing campaign.\\n\\nLawmakers, U.S. officials, humanitarian groups, anti-war activists, arms dealers, foreign representatives and others have debated the American role in Yemen for years in Washington ― though rarely with such vivid evidence of the policy's consequences as is documented in Fitzgerald's film.\\n\\nIt's vital now to have a clear picture of what President-elect Joe Biden's choices could mean for Yemen as he assumes the presidency later this month and will have the power to change U.S. policy.\\n\\nThe country's current crisis began in the fall of 2014, when Iran-backed rebels known as Houthis ejected Yemen's internationally recognized government from Sanaa. Six months later, Saudi Arabia and its allies, notably the United Arab Emirates, launched a military intervention against the Houthis ― with crucial backing from the U.S. and other Western nations that continues despite persistent reports that the coalition is violating human rights standards and international law.\\n\\nMost national security experts believe that without American support for the bombing, the Saudi-led coalition would need to seriously curtail its operations. That move would also make the kingdom more keen to cut a peace deal with the Houthis and address deadly tussles for influence among its own Yemeni partners.\\n\\nThe war has now killed nearly a quarter of a million people, the United Nations reported in December. Airstrikes by the Saudi-led coalition have killed at least 18,000 civilians, according to the Yemen Data Project, an independent monitoring group. The strikes have hit hospitals, markets, schools and other nonmilitary targets, prompting State Department lawyers to worry that American involvement could implicate U.S. officials in war crimes.\\n\\nAfter nearly five years of fighting, the Houthis continue to control the most populated parts of Yemen ― and the Saudis continue to bomb those regions with U.S. support, most recently on New Year's Eve.\\n\\nUnder President Barack Obama, Washington provided the Saudi-led coalition with aerial refueling that enabled it to run longer bombing campaigns, as well as intelligence and regular supplies of fresh bombs, while defending the campaign from international criticism and supporting a Saudi blockade of Yemeni ports that drove up food prices and pushed millions of Yemenis into famine-like conditions.\\n\\nPresident Donald Trump continued that policy and took further steps against the Houthis that had devastating consequences for Yemenis, such as slashing U.S. aid for Houthi-controlled regions amid the coronavirus pandemic. When lawmakers and rights groups called for a tougher U.S. approach to the Saudis over their role in the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, Trump cut off the aerial refueling assistance but left in place other forms of American aid to the Saudi-led coalition.\\n\\nTrump also vetoed bipartisan legislation to cut off that support and to stop sending more bombs to the countries involved in the war.\\n\\nBiden has promised he will end the Obama-era policy and treat Saudi Arabia as a pariah. But he will face a test of how seriously he takes that promise early in his presidency: Biden will have to decide whether to block a giant arms package that Trump crafted for the U.A.E. last fall, which the vast majority of congressional Democrats opposes.\\n\\nThe humanitarian situation in Yemen is predicted to deteriorate even further in the coming months with hunger on the rise, Scott Paul of Oxfam America told HuffPost in December after a slim Senate majority approved the U.A.E. weapons package, which includes munitions that could be used in Yemen. Congress and the Biden administration should do all they can to halt these arms sales and be a force for peace to save lives in Yemen."}
{"original": "By Erin El Issa\\n\\nThere are many personal finance tenets to follow when you decide to take control of your finances. Perhaps one of the most important is this: Don't pay fees unless absolutely necessary.\\n\\nThe average cost of checking account fees over a decade totals almost $1,000, according to a recent study. But many of these fees -- including common ones such as maintenance, ATM and overdraft fees -- can be avoided by choosing the right bank and cultivating good banking habits.\\n\\nHere's what you should know about common bank fees and tips for avoiding them, including options for low-fee checking accounts that also earn interest.\\n\\n1. Maintenance fees\\n\\nMany traditional banks charge a maintenance, or service, fee on checking accounts -- about $10 to $12 per month.\\n\\nSome banks will waive the charge if you keep a daily minimum balance or have a certain amount of money deposited directly into your account each month. Others require a certain number of debit card transactions each month for the waiver.\\n\\nCheck your bank's policy for exact terms so that you can set up direct deposit and keep the minimum required balance to avoid maintenance fees. If you can't meet the requirements, look for a bank without these fees.\\n\\n2. ATM fees\\n\\nYou've probably had the experience of needing cash and looking unsuccessfully for an ATM affiliated with your bank. You ended up with no choice but to go, cringing, to another ATM, resigned to paying a fee to your bank and possibly another to the ATM's operator. Such fees average $2.01 and $2.75, respectively, according to the study.\\n\\nATM fees can be avoided by using your own bank ATM. That may require choosing a bank whose ATMs are easily accessible from your home or workplace, or looking for local bank branches and ATMs when you are out and about. You could also get cash back when making debit card purchases at many retail locations, eliminating the need for a trip to the ATM.\\n\\n3. Overdraft fees\\n\\nYour bank may charge you an overdraft fee if your withdrawals and transactions total more than the balance in your checking account. Most large U.S. banks charge at least $35 per overdraft, according to a recent Pew study. if you don't correct the negative balance in a certain amount of time, you could get hit with an extended overdraft fee -- that median is $20, the study said.\\n\\nConsumers average about two overdrafts per year. But these fees are avoidable. The obvious solution is to avoid spending more money than you have in your account. You can also choose to have your transactions declined by the bank if your funds are insufficient.\\n\\nIf you opted into your bank's overdraft program, which will carry a fee when you exceed your account balance, talk to customer service about opting out. Then keep a close eye on your bank balance, and use a credit card or cash to avoid overdraft fees.\\n\\nUse an online-only bank or credit union\\n\\nYou can optimize your finances more by using an online-only bank or credit union. Online financial institutions have fewer overhead costs than traditional banks, so they are typically able to offer free checking accounts with higher interest rates and no maintenance fees. They typically don't have their own ATMs but tend to be part of a network of fee-free ATMs that are widely accessible, especially in larger cities.\\n\\nIf you regularly have to deposit cash or like to visit a branch, try brick-and-mortar credit unions, which usually have lower fees and higher interest rates than big banks. Credit union membership may be restricted to residents of certain geographical areas or workers at qualified employers, but you may be able to join by making a donation of $5 to $10. That's generally less than one month's service fee at a big bank, so it's worth the investment.\\n\\nThis article was written by NerdWallet and was originally published by U.S. News & World Report."}

{"original": "OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) — A U.S. judge in California on Sunday blocked Trump administration rules, which would allow more employers to opt out of providing women with no-cost birth control, from taking effect in 13 states and Washington, D.C.\\n\\nJudge Haywood Gilliam granted a request for a preliminary injunction by California, 12 other states and Washington, D.C. The plaintiffs sought to prevent the rules from taking effect as scheduled on Monday while a lawsuit against them moved forward.\\n\\nBut Gilliam limited the scope of the ruling to the plaintiffs, rejecting their request that he block the rules nationwide.\\n\\nThe changes would allow more employers, including publicly traded companies, to opt out of providing no-cost contraceptive coverage to women by claiming religious objections. Some private employers could also object on moral grounds.\\n\\nCalifornia and the other states argue that women would be forced to turn to state-funded programs for birth control and experience unintended pregnancies.\\n\\nThe law couldn't be more clear — employers have no business interfering in women's healthcare decisions, California Attorney General Xavier Becerra said in a statement Sunday. Today's court ruling stops another attempt by the Trump Administration to trample on women's access to basic reproductive care. It's 2019, yet the Trump Administration is still trying to roll back women's rights. Our coalition will continue to fight to ensure women have access to the reproductive healthcare they are guaranteed under the law.\\n\\nThe U.S. Department of Justice said in court documents the rules protect a narrow class of sincere religious and moral objectors from being forced to facilitate practices that conflict with their beliefs.\\n\\nAt issue is a requirement under President Barack Obama's health care law that birth control services be covered at no additional cost. Obama officials included exemptions for religious organizations. The Trump administration expanded those exemptions and added moral convictions as a basis to opt out of providing birth control services.\\n\\nAt a hearing on Friday, Gilliam said the changes would result in a substantial number of women losing birth control coverage, which would be a massive policy shift.\\n\\nThe judge previously blocked an interim version of the rules — a decision that was upheld in December by an appeals court.\\n\\nThe ruling affects California, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Minnesota, New York, North Carolina, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, and the District of Columbia."}

{"original": "The Green New Dealers are taking their movement on the road.\\n\\nIt's been a whirlwind two months since the youth activists of the Sunrise Movement staged protests in Democratic leaders' offices, bringing into the mainstream calls for a Green New Deal ― a sweeping federal policy that would mandate 100 percent renewable energy and provide good-paying sustainable jobs to millions of Americans.\\n\\nNow the Sunrise Movement, likely the nation's fastest-growing climate advocacy group, is planning a 14-stop tour meant to drum up grassroots support for a Green New Deal across multiple states, HuffPost has learned. It's the first leg of the group's effort to make the policy the defining issue of the 2020 election.\\n\\nWe're launching the Road to a Green New Deal Tour to activate the millions of Americans who are ready to fight for a Green New Deal but haven't heard of it yet, Varshini Prakash, co-founder of Sunrise Movement, said by email. When you come out to a tour stop, we'll give you all the tools you need to spread the word within your own community, build support, and pressure your elected officials to take a stand.\\n\\nIn March and April, the Sunrise Movement will host events in Florida, California, Pennsylvania, New York, Kentucky, Michigan and elsewhere. The tour builds off an intensive new online training program, where volunteers are coached via webinars on how to confront politicians and frame an issue as overwhelming as global warming in terms of clear, effective action. Each event will include in-person training sessions, and conclude with organizing meetings for new converts.\\n\\nThe goal of the tour is to invite tens of thousands of young people into the movement, Stephen O'Hanlon, a spokesman for Sunrise Movement, said by phone. We want to go where they are, and one thing we've learned … is young people across the country, in red states, blue states and purple states, are excited about what a Green New Deal could mean for their communities.\\n\\nReuters In a photo from three years ago, Varshini Prakash, then with the Divestment Student Network leads chants of I believe that we will win during a student climate protest in Washington.\\n\\nThe Sunrise Movement has added more than 100 new local chapters since November. That includes one in Wyoming, the nation's top coal-producing state, two in Nebraska, a hotbed of pipeline battles, and another two in deep-red Utah. The group has raised more than $500,000 in just two months, with 650 new recurring monthly donors.\\n\\nFounded officially in April 2017, the Sunrise Movement traces its roots back to the start of the decade, when the Occupy Wall Street protests put a national spotlight on the widening income gap. By the mid-2010s, the student activists who would go on to found the Sunrise Movement were leading efforts to pressure their universities to divest from fossil fuels. Drawing on lessons from the 2016 presidential bid of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), the group finally took form a few months after President Donald Trump began a full-on assault on environmental regulations in a push to bolster the oil and gas industry.\\n\\nBy the time the midterm elections began, the Sunrise Movement had started carving out a place for itself, helping to elevate candidates who took climate change more seriously than just declaring a belief in the basic science. The group helped run a ground campaign for left-wing candidates like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) and Michigan gubernatorial hopeful Abdul El-Sayed. The Sunrise Movement also bird-dogged powerful incumbents like New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who was forced to make an embarrassing public reversal after a teenage activist got him to promise to stop taking fossil fuel money on camera.\\n\\nBut the breakthrough came in November, days after the election.\\n\\nHistoric wildfires in California, buttressed by back-to-back United Nations and federal reports on the extent of human-caused global warming, generated an unusual amount of attention on the climate crisis. Then Democratic leaders made clear that climate change would be, at best, a midlevel priority after retaking the House of Representatives, with Nancy Pelosi, not yet the next House speaker, making the restoration of a decade-old select committee on global warming the cornerstone of the party's strategy. In response, the Sunrise Movement staged sit-in protests in Pelosi's office demanding Democrats instead champion a Green New Deal.\\n\\nOcasio-Cortez joined the protests, adding the political star power needed to grab headlines in a competitive, fast-moving news cycle. The 29-year-old socialist darling from New York also proposed a resolution to establish a select committee on a Green New Deal in the House, providing a counteroffer to Pelosi's panel.\\n\\nYoung people across the country, in red states, blue states and purple states, are excited about what a Green New Deal could mean for their communities. Stephen O'Hanlon , Sunrise Movement\\n\\nNearly 40 House Democrats and a handful of senators backed the resolution. More than half the Democrats expected to run for president in 2020 slowly endorsed a Green New Deal in some form or another. One poll pegged the number of registered voters who support a Green New Deal at 81 percent, including 57 percent of conservative Republicans.\\n\\nPelosi and her allies kiboshed the effort last month, announcing plans to move ahead with the original select committee. But the push succeeded in making a Green New Deal a rallying cry.\\n\\nTouring the country could build a grassroots base for eventual Green New Deal legislation that the last major federal climate bill ― the 2009 cap-and-trade proposal known as the Waxman-Markey bill ― never received.\\n\\nThe politics have drastically changed since then, R.L. Miller, the president of the political action committee Climate Hawks Vote, said by email. Sunrise is a grassroots-driven group, unlike some of the top-down green groups pushing Waxman-Markey, and they have both energy and moral clarity on their side.\\n\\nBut passion and urgent messaging only go so far, and the Sunrise Movement faces considerable challenges. Labor unions, a necessary constituency for a policy that essentially amounts to an industrial plan, are skeptical of proposals to end fossil fuel use, a source of lucrative contract jobs. The Sunrise Movement's meteoric ascent was fueled by aggressive protests against potential Green New Deal champions, which risked burning allies, according to E&E News. In a competition with immigration, health care and taxes, climate change remains an underdog issue with relatively few vocal champions on the national level despite its ubiquitous threat.\\n\\nPlus, the Trump administration is stacked at every level with officials who reject the very reality that burning fossil fuels is the primary cause of global warming, making it hard to envision Green New Deal legislation passing until 2021 at the earliest.\\n\\nOther climate groups have taken different approaches.\\n\\nThe Citizens' Climate Lobby built a network of roughly 400 local groups in part by pushing an avowedly bipartisan message on climate change and appealing to a small cadre of Republicans who back a moderate carbon fee-and-dividend policy. Despite its ideological malleability, many say such a policy amounts to a half-measure in dealing with greenhouse gases.\\n\\nThe Sierra Club's Beyond Coal campaign empowered local communities across the country to organize around shutting down coal-fired power plants, but it's limited in scope. The organization's broader 100 percent renewable energy effort struggled until the emergence of the Green New Deal rhetoric to address concerns over the impact on jobs.\\n\\nThe Environmental Voter Project went the wonk's route, using data to target specific voters it deemed likely to support green causes with aggressive get-out-the-vote materials. But it has a narrow focus, both in geography and mission.\\n\\nSunrise Movement Then-Rep.-elect Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) speaking at the Sunrise Movement protest in then-Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi's office in November.\\n\\nThe challenge is how to scale it and make it sustainable, Anthony Leiserowitz, the director of the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication, said of the upcoming Sunrise Movement tour. One-off rallies in a few cities, for example, might generate a little press and get some temporary action, but the effects are unlikely to last or build sustained support for the policy or, I would argue, build the deeper political power of the climate movement.\\n\\nA series of local events might make for a flashy start to the year, but the Sunrise Movement's 2020 election push won't end with the monthlong roadshow. The group plans to confront presidential candidates directly, forcing each of the Democratic hopefuls to take a position on the Green New Deal and on whether to accept donations from the fossil fuel industry. It's also preparing to stage protests at as many Democratic debates as possible ahead of the Democratic National Convention in July 2020.\\n\\nThe Sunrise Movement is working with electoral groups such as Justice Democrats and Climate Hawks Vote to identify progressive primary challengers to moderate incumbents who oppose a Green New Deal. Early polling already shows the group could make a difference. Democratic voters in New York's 4th Congressional District, a densely populated swath of suburban Long Island, said they would support a primary challenger to popular Rep. Kathleen Rice (D-N.Y.) if she voted against a Green New Deal, according to survey data released last week.\\n\\nI feel the Sunrise Movement and their proposed Green New Deal is a genuinely exciting new development, Ed Maibach, a climate communications researcher at George Mason University, said by email. If the folks in the Sunrise Movement get out there and sell their idea to Americans before their opponents attempt to shoot it down, 2019 may prove to be an unexpectedly auspicious moment for climate solutions in America."}

He has maintained he did nothing wrong and blamed his departure on vicious and politically motivated attacks.\\n\\nBy midday Wednesday, his Twitter profile read former secretary. In a farewell message posted to the social media site, he said it was a high honor to serve @POTUS & the American People.\\n\\nWe've restored public lands 'for the benefit & enjoyment of the people,' improved public access & shall never be held hostage again for our energy needs, Zinke wrote.\\n\\nIt's been a high honor to serve @POTUS & the American People as @Interior Secretary.

But several names have surfaced as contenders for the role, including Rep. Rob Bishop (R-Utah) and outgoing Sen. Dean Heller (R-Nev.). Whoever Trump taps must be confirmed by the Senate.\\n\\nBefore being sworn in at the Interior Department on Aug. 1, 2017, Bernhardt, a Colorado native, worked for eight years at the law firm Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck, where he lobbied on behalf of oil, gas, mining and agricultural interests. He also previously served as a top Interior official under former President George W. Bush, leading an attempt to open Alaska's pristine Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil and gas development. (Last month the Trump administration took a significant step toward its goal of allowing drilling in the refuge, which Zinke said stands out among the most impactful Interior accomplishments in terms of bolstering America's economic strength and security.)\\n\\nThe Senate confirmed Bernhardt as Interior's deputy secretary in July 2017. Before his confirmation hearing, 150 conservation groups signed a letter opposing his nomination, citing his ties to the industries he is now charged with regulating and labeling him a walking conflict of interest.\\n\\nHe has so many potential conflicts that he carries around a list of former clients and is barred from participating in decisions affecting them, The Washington Post reported in November.\\n\\nBloomberg via Getty Images President Donald Trump and acting Interior Secretary David Bernhardt (left) at a meeting in the Cabinet Room of the White House on Jan. 2, the first day Bernhardt was in charge of the department.\\n\\nAs Interior's deputy secretary, Bernhardt met on several occasions with lobbyists for MGM Resorts International, the casino-resort giant that his longtime former employer represents, as HuffPost previously reported. The ethics agreement he signed last year bars him from participating in matters involving Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck.\\n\\nLast year the Interior Department blocked a proposed casino partnership between two Connecticut tribes. The project would have been competition for an MGM casino in nearby Springfield, Massachusetts, and the company lobbied against federal approval. Interior's decision is under investigation by the agency's inspector general.\\n\\nBernhardt played a key behind-the-scenes role in many regulatory rollbacks during Zinke's tenure, as Mother Jones highlighted in an October profile. Those efforts include a plan to dismantle Obama-era protections for the greater sage grouse, a move that would open up millions of acres of the declining game bird's habitat to energy and mineral development. Bernhardt is also leading a charge to revise the Endangered Species Act, one of America's bedrock conservation laws. The proposed changes would make it easier to remove recovered species from the protected list and would change how federal agencies go about designating habitat as critical to the long-term survival of species.\\n\\nAfter news of Zinke's resignation, the liberal environmental group Western Values Project launched a website detailing Bernhardt's work with special interests. In an accompanying statement, the nonprofit's executive director, Chris Saeger, called Bernhardt the ultimate DC swamp creature.\\n\\nThe bottom line is that Bernhardt is too conflicted to even be Acting Secretary, Saeger said.\\n\\nBernhardt represented Interior at Wednesday's Cabinet meeting at the White House, sitting directly next to Trump."}

{"original": "Hey! It's Bushroot! In the flesh!\\n\\nThese six words shattered the little world that I created for myself during my freshman year at Syracuse University. Up until that point, I had considered myself to be pretty much nailing the whole college thing as I adjusted to life eight hours away from my Maryland childhood home. I was getting good grades, keeping my homesickness mostly in check, convincing myself that I enjoyed cheap beer and making new friends. Cool new friends. Cool new bro friends, to be exact.\\n\\nI was on cloud nine about being accepted into the Brewster Hall dorm crew, which was led by a group of guys who lived on the floor below me and who loved to do the ultimate college bro stuff, such as smoke weed and watch sports. One of them even initiated a hookup with me on the very first night of college. He was drunk ― and he never looked me in the eye after that ― but still.\\n\\nGrowing up, I was a bit of a late bloomer both physically and socially. I could hardly believe that these guys saw me for who I really was: a cute, fun, friendly girl who was cool enough to be privy to their inside jokes ― including and especially the one about Bushroot.\\n\\nBushroot was a squat, gnome-like creature that one of the bros had sketched out at the beginning of the semester to be our dorm mascot. It had bulging eyes and a dark shaded face ringed by short spiky hair. The guys proudly hung photocopies of the Bushroot sketch up on all their walls. They would approach the sketch and ask, Bushroot, should I take another hit from this bong? Or someone in the room would suddenly whisper 'Shroot and then they'd all repeat the name in turn, escalating the volume until they were shouting. They would invite the girls, myself included, to chant Bushroot along with them and then they would hoot and holler when we did.\\n\\nThen, one night, I found out that this mascot — and therefore the whole Bushroot joke — was supposed to be a caricature of me. A guy from a different dorm was hanging out in Brewster Hall. When he saw me face to face, he blurted out those six fateful words: Hey! It's Bushroot! In the flesh!\\n\\nI retreated to the privacy of my dorm room and tried to deny that I had heard him correctly. I'm Bushroot? I thought. The stupid-looking mascot thing that everyone thinks is so hilarious? How?!\\n\\nBut Bushroot had enough similarities to my appearance that I had to believe it. The shaded skin, for one. And the spiky hair. I understood that my Afro-style cropped cut was an unconventional look for our white, affluent, sorority-laden upstate New York campus. It was for me, too. I had never done anything so bold when it came to my appearance. I had gotten a burst of confidence after high school, though, and wanted to make a start strong in this new chapter in my life. I wanted to show up to college and really be someone.\\n\\nI just didn't want to be the dorm mascot.\\n\\nCourtesy of Leah Olson The author sporting her newly cropped cut during her freshman year at Syracuse University in 2003.\\n\\nConsidering that this incident occurred at roughly the halfway point of my life to date, it could have made for a very nice turning point if we were following a typical Hollywood narrative.\\n\\nLeading up to Bushroot, I had spent nearly two decades as a girl who was half-Black but hellbent on being seen as fully white. From as early as I can remember, I harbored the belief that in white America, there was a minimum threshold that a human had to meet before the rest of society even considered whether that person could be cute, beautiful, sexy, professional and successful. And that threshold was ... whiteness. The way I saw it (and the way the world had made me see it), if you didn't look white, well then you better hope to be super talented at something that white America valued.\\n\\nParadoxically, I developed this hurtful white favoritism mindset while growing up in a multiracial family of transracial adoptees. I was adopted at birth by my white parents, who went on to adopt my white sister and four Black brothers. My parents espoused diversity, African American heritage, anti-racism and tolerance. We had open conversations about race and prejudice. I grew up surrounded by family friends and family members of all races, ethnicities and backgrounds.\\n\\nBut the messages I was receiving from the broader society around me were powerful and persistent. As I got old enough to make my own decisions, I chose to attend mostly white academic magnet programs in middle and high school. I made no efforts to diversify my social circle. Ditto with my extracurricular activities: violin, cross country, competitive swimming and ― the kicker ― field hockey.\\n\\nThrough it all, I felt like I was doing a pretty convincing job of passing as white, so long as I hid my hair. I saw my hair as the big giveaway. White people's hair hung down. My coarse, kinky curly hair expanded out.\\n\\nCourtesy of Lean Olson The author at age 4, when her hair finally grew long enough to assemble into some sort of bun (which she viewed as a thrilling milestone in my young eyes!).\\n\\nWhen my hair finally grew long enough, I always shoved it back into a thick braid or a tight bun to try and pull off a sporty look. But right before I left for Syracuse, I went out on a limb and got that short, cropped, natural curly cut.\\n\\nIf my life were following the kind of story arc you might see on TV, here's where I ― the Black girl who wanted to be white ― would have finally been forced to admit that racism exists. I would have known it all along, of course, in part because of the very fact that I wanted so badly to be white in the first place. Post-Bushroot, I would have taken a hard look at all the other times I had experienced both covert and overt racism. I would have spoken out against the hurtful mascot joke of which I was the butt at Syracuse. I would have sought solace from other people of color ― maybe even my own family members ― who might have understood and helped me deal with my pain.\\n\\nBut I can't write that story.\\n\\nForget an arc ― my story became more linear than ever as I jacked up my quest to get white people to see and accept me as white.\\n\\nI first addressed my hair, which seemed like an obvious place to start at the time. I felt grateful that at this point in my life, I was no longer beholden to my parents' no chemicals in your body policy. I began to pay increasingly large percentages of my income to hair stylists to burn the crap out of my hair with sketchy chemicals ― relaxers, texturizers, keratins, thermal reconditioners, smoothers, serums, rinses ― that made my eyes water, my nose run and my scalp scream. I figured it was the price I had to pay to scorch out any traces of Bushroot.\\n\\nCourtesy of Leah Olson The author giving a toast while rocking her elusive straight hair at her sister's wedding in 2016. (Needless to say, chemicals were involved, she said.)\\n\\nI also went hardcore on tailoring my résumé, my friendships and my lifestyle in hopes of fitting in with white, privileged, affluent, well-respected America after I graduated from college. In 2007, I joined the education reform organization Teach For America for a two-year teaching commitment. Afterward, I attended Harvard Law School, graduated in 2012, and then worked for four years at top-tier corporate law firms in New York City and San Francisco.\\n\\nThe whole time, I was surrounded by a lot of white people. A lot. However, I take far less issue with that ― I made wonderful friends and had incredible, life-changing experiences ― than I do with my attitude along the way. I was in full-on racial denial. I didn't even join any affinity groups for Black, Indigenous and other people of color or try to make any friends who looked like me.\\n\\nAt first, while I was still hurting inside, I felt motivated to keep climbing the white privilege ladder to get as far away as I could from the position of being a victim of racism. I would collect my latest (white) gold star and think, Suck it, Syracuse! As I became more enmeshed in my 20-something rat race life, however, it became more subconscious. I am naturally hardworking and competitive (aka Type A), so I began enjoying my aggressive life pursuits more simply for what they were. I began to go long stretches of time without thinking about Syracuse or Bushroot or any of that pain. In fact, I never told a soul about Bushroot until this year.\\n\\nNow, I am finally finding an arc, thanks to the boys ― not the Syracuse ones, but my own.\\n\\nIn a plot twist that I find a little bit hilarious and a little bit fated, my white husband and I are the biological parents to two sons who are as different in appearance as day and night ― pun intended.\\n\\nCourtesy of Leah Olson The author with her sons, ages 2 and 4 months, respectively, in the spring of 2020.\\n\\nI'll pause here to acknowledge that, yes, I married a white guy. My husband loves me for all of who I am, inside and out. He has been a strong supporter of my identity journey. He is an incredible father to our kids. But he is indeed a white guy. Like, Scandinavian ancestors on both sides white. And our first son looks like a carbon copy of those ancestors. Fair skin, blue eyes, stick-straight towhead blond hair.\\n\\nConsider this child next to me. We turn heads when we're out in public. Strangers cannot get enough of our brown-blond combo. Sometimes even I catch myself doing a double take at us and thinking about how not even my AP Biology teacher back in high school could have predicted this outcome.\\n\\nSo maybe it was the universe at work in some way, right? My first son came to me with the message: Stop hiding! You're not white! And now everyone's going to be calling you out on it!\\n\\nAnd then came his brother.\\n\\nAlmost exactly two years later, my husband and I were blessed with our second son, who looks like a carbon copy of me. Brown eyes (no real hair yet) and brown skin that is somehow even a little darker than mine.\\n\\nThis son brought his own message: Stop hiding! We're not white! But we are both beautiful just the way we are!\\n\\nCourtesy of Leah Olson The author's younger son at 9 months old.\\n\\nIt took welcoming these two beautiful boys into the world for me to realize the journey I had been on was not the journey I wanted to stay on. I do not know what would've happened if I had not become a mother to them ― if the realization that I was hiding from who I really am had not accompanied them when they appeared in my world. But it did. And it made me rethink ― and re-feel ― everything.\\n\\nSo here I am, in all of my vulnerable glory. I am sharing the Bushroot story to belatedly call out racism and cruelty but also to illustrate just how powerful white favoritism and, let's be honest, white supremacy can be in this society. By hiding the pain that I felt at Syracuse and, more generally, by focusing so much time and energy throughout my life into trying to convince others and myself that I am just as white as they are, I have undoubtedly caused pain to myself and to those who look like me. I don't want to do that anymore. Especially not to my son.\\n\\nMy identity journey is not over. On the contrary, it's just beginning. There's a lot that I still don't know, but here is what I do know: Being honest is important. It doesn't mean you have to have all of the answers or have to be ready to take some dramatic action to prove a point. It just means that you have to be ready to be raw.\\n\\nBeing raw is OK. Admitting pain is OK. Apologizing is OK. And it's never too late to come home to yourself.\\n\\nI want to be honest about my racial identity for me, for my kids and for my country. I want us to make some profound progress in making America a more accepting place where people can feel more and, ultimately, hurt less. I want to be exactly who I am, and I want my sons — and, really, everyone — to feel confident to do the same.\\n\\nLeah Olson is working on a memoir about growing up biracial in white America.

{"original": "This article is the first in a seven-part series, One Year Later: Larry Nassar And The Women Who Made Us Listen, that commemorates the seven days women stood in a Lansing, Michigan, courtroom last year and read powerful impact statements to former USA Gymnastics and Michigan State trainer Larry Nassar. One Year Later was produced by reporter Alanna Vagianos. Read more installments: One | Two | Three | Four | Five | Six | Seven\\n\\nOne year ago, almost to the day, Morgan McCaul stood in a tiny courtroom in Lansing, Michigan, ready to face down her abuser, former USA Gymnastics and Michigan State University trainer Larry Nassar. With her pixie-cut hair and tortoiseshell glasses, the diminutive 18-year-old University of Michigan student didn't look especially formidable.\\n\\nThen she started speaking.\\n\\nEvery shred of admiration I had for you is gone, McCaul told Nassar, the doctor she said she'd once respected and called a friend. The man I thought I knew did not exist, only a selfish predator whose atrocities know no bounds.\\n\\nThe beige courtroom, ordinarily unremarkable, hummed with energy that day as dozens of women waited their turn to read victim impact statements to the man who'd turned their lives upside down at some point in the past two decades. An army of more than 150 survivors had arrived for battle.\\n\\nSince reports of Larry Nassar's misconduct to Michigan State faculty began in 1997, two years before I was even born, I can't help but wonder, McCaul continued. How many little girls could have been spared from this lifelong battle if someone at the university had just done the bare minimum and listened?\\n\\nWhen McCaul finished, she stepped back from the podium, emotional but resolute, and stared down Nassar.\\n\\nNearly 365 days later, McCaul says it was this moment and that historic sentence hearing that changed her life forever.\\n\\nAli Lapetina for HuffPost Morgan McCaul, age 19, holds her original impact statement about Larry Nassar that she read in court last year.\\n\\nDays before McCaul and her legion of self-proclaimed sister survivors confronted Nassar in court, I published a piece about the 140 women who had publicly accused Nassar of sexual abuse at the time. While their stories had commanded attention in the Lansing area (thanks to first-rate reporting from local media), they hadn't yet garnered the international attention they would ultimately receive. It was frustrating, and disappointing, to see dozens of stories of serial abuse brushed aside by mainstream media.\\n\\nHalf a dozen survivors described a feeling of hopelessness before the sentencing, telling HuffPost last year that it seemed as if the country simply did not care about the abuse they experienced. Some attributed it to sexism. Others believed the lack of public attention was because most of Nassar's victims were not Olympic gymnasts.\\n\\nWe couldn't get anybody to pay attention to this. We tried so hard and we couldn't get people to care, Sarah Klein, an attorney and one of the first known victims of Nassar, told HuffPost this year. We knew that what Michigan State had done was wrong. We knew that what USAG had done was wrong, and we wanted so badly to tell our story, but we couldn't get any traction.\\n\\nIt was a sentence hearing, of all things, that finally made the country take notice. On Jan. 16, 2018, in a tiny Michigan courtroom, 169 women and family members began reading gut-wrenching victim impact statements to the once-famed sports medicine doctor.\\n\\nI could just feel it in that room. Finally, we were taking our power back and the world was listening. Amanda Thomashow, MSU graduate and Nassar survivor\\n\\nI could just feel it in that room, Nassar survivor and MSU graduate Amanda Thomashow told HuffPost. Finally, we were taking our power back and the world was listening.\\n\\nIt's common for victims of a crime to be given the opportunity to read a statement. But this was different. Ingham County Circuit Court Judge Rosemarie Aquilina took a unique and at times controversial approach, allowing every single person to speak ― which meant that instead of lasting a day or two, the hearing ran an entire week.\\n\\nI got to bring that little girl that I once was with me into court and up to that podium, Klein told HuffPost. And I got to speak for her.\\n\\nThat week, and those women, forced the country to finally confront Nassar's heinous abuse and the institutional complicity that enabled him for so long.\\n\\nBy the end of the seven days, prosecutors had identified more than 265 accusers. And that was before more survivors faced down Nassar during an additional sentencing in Charlotte, Michigan.\\n\\nJEFF KOWALSKY via Getty Images People in the courtroom react as former Michigan State University and USA Gymnastics doctor Larry Nassar listens during impact statements during the sentencing phase in Ingham County Circuit Court on January 24, 2018 in Lansing, Michigan.

A year later, now that the public is finally listening, I wanted to know ― have MSU and USAG righted their wrongs?\\n\\nI find it really interesting how many people are still willing to put money and medals and institutional reputation ahead of survivors ― even under intense public scrutiny, McCaul said.\\n\\nAll the women agreed: The country may finally be paying attention, but USA Gymnastics and Michigan State are not.\\n\\nI still fear that the institutions are not listening, Harrison, an MSU graduate and former gymnast and soccer player, said. Sexual assault survivors should never have to beg to be listened to or believed, and unfortunately I feel like that's what we've had to do this past year.\\n\\nTime and again, MSU, USA Gymnastics and the U.S. Olympic Committee have neglected to remedy decades of institutional failures, despite embarrassing resignations, criminal charges and even bankruptcy.\\n\\nAt MSU, former President Lou Anna K. Simon, former gymnastics coach Kathie Klages and former MSU dean of osteopathic medicine and Nassar's former boss William Strampel have been charged with lying to the police, willful neglect of duty and, in the case of Strampel, sexual misconduct.\\n\\nEven more distressing to many survivors, MSU interim President John Engler closed a $10 million healing fund in December originally set aside for counseling and other services for Nassar victims. The school redirected that money into an existing $500 million settlement divided between the 332 women who'd sued the school. This move left dozens of other accusers, who were not part of the lawsuit, unable to collect support funding for necessary counseling and other mental health services. (Last week, MSU's board of trustees voted to establish a new fund, although board Chair Dianne Byrum said the details are still to be worked out.)\\n\\nSmith, a dance teacher, scoffed at MSU's incompetence in its attempts to course-correct after the Nassar scandal.\\n\\nAli Lapetina for HuffPost jess a c\\n\\nI teach students as young as 2, and in my experience, 2-year-olds are better at taking responsibility than Michigan State University, she said. Children don't necessarily understand what they're doing, but they understand when their friend says 'That hurts me.'\\n\\nThomashow said that for MSU to improve, the school needs to listen to the team of experts and advocates it has on hand as part of the recently created Relationship Violence and Sexual Misconduct Expert Advisory Workgroup. The group consists of rock star advocates, Thomashow said, including Andrea Munford, the lead MSU Special Victims Unit detective who broke open the Nassar case in 2016.\\n\\nI know that they have it in them at MSU, Thomashow said. It's just listening to the experts and actually having a trauma-informed, evidence-based approach to sexual assault prevention and response.\\n\\nSuch a response would typically entail training officials on the importance of believing survivors and combating victim blaming. It would also include law enforcement training about how trauma works, and its effects on delayed reporting and memory loss. The university has not yet rolled out programs specifically addressing these issues.\\n\\nMeanwhile, at USA Gymnastics, former president Steve Penny and former trainer Debbie Van Horn face criminal charges as well. Van Horn was indicted in June on allegations that she sexually assaulted a child while working at the infamous USAG training facility, the Karolyi Ranch in Walker County, Texas.\\n\\nAli Lapetina for HuffPost Amanda Thomashow, age 29, poses for a portrait on the bed where she originally wrote her impact statement about Larry Nassar a year ago.\\n\\nIn one of the most glaring missteps, USAG appointed Mary Lee Tracy to the prestigious role of elite development coordinator, only to learn that she'd defended Nassar in December 2016, when more than 50 women had already accused him of serial sexual abuse. Days later, she resigned.\\n\\nFor its part, the U.S. Olympic Committee, the very organization tasked with righting the ship post-Nassar, has not been able to land on its feet. The organization announced in November that it planned to decertify USA Gymnastics, but USAG filed for bankruptcy ― a last-ditch effort to stabilize the flailing organization ― before the decertification could take place. As of this writing, USA Gymnastics is still up and running.\\n\\nLast month, it was revealed that two USOC top officials deleted emails containing disturbing accusations against Nassar in 2015, and failed to report it. One of the officials was fired over the revelation; the other had stepped down some months before.\\n\\nMcCaul toggled between anger, frustration and flat-out exhaustion as she discussed the various institutional errors.\\n\\nIf international attention is not enough to force institutional leaders to change their behavior, what is? she said, adding that money repeatedly took precedence over girls' lives.\\n\\nIf international attention is not enough to force institutional leaders to change their behavior, what is? Morgan McCaul, University of Michigan student and Nassar survivor\\n\\nReached for comment, representatives for USAG and Michigan State each expressed remorse for the survivors' trauma while pointing to changes their respective institutions have made post-Nassar.\\n\\nOne year ago, more than 150 courageous women made gymnastics, and all sports, safer by sharing their stories and the personal impact of Larry Nassar's despicable crimes, Kathryn Carson, chair of USA Gymnastics' board of directors, told HuffPost. We deeply regret the horrific acts that hurt so many of our athletes. We will never forget and are forever grateful for their bravery in coming forward.\\n\\nCarson said a lot has changed in the past year, citing turnover in USAG's leadership and noting that the group has implemented safe sport policies and worked to create a culture of greater accountability.\\n\\nWe know we have more work to do, she said. We are committed to taking the needed steps toward fostering a positive, encouraging and safe environment where all of our members are comfortable in speaking up and have the opportunity to thrive and follow their gymnastics dreams.\\n\\nEmily Guerrant, a spokeswoman for MSU, told HuffPost the university is extraordinarily sorry for all the harm Nassar's crimes and the school's own failures have caused.\\n\\nAs we learn and move forward, the university continues to engage and invest in an intense reform and cultural change effort to ensure Michigan State University is a safe campus for students, faculty, staff and our community, she said. MSU has made many strides in addressing sexual misconduct situations, including implementing a new chaperone policy and strengthening mandatory reporting policies for all staff.\\n\\nAli Lapetina for HuffPost Morgan McCaul, age 19, inside her apartment in Ann Arbor Michigan. Morgan is studying Political Science Student at the University of Michigan.\\n\\nLooking ahead, there's no one-size-fits-all solution for three different institutions that failed women equally. The cleanup promises to be complicated, as the organizations attempt to unlearn decades of bad behavior.\\n\\nMcCaul, like Thomashow, stressed the importance of prioritizing and centering survivors in Nassar's wake.\\n\\nIf the health and the well-being of the people that you hurt is at the forefront of your mind, I think that that will create an environment and create a mindset for actual progress, she said.\\n\\nAnd if the past year has proven anything, it's that the sister survivors will stop at nothing to hold these organizations accountable. All of the women agreed that their fight isn't over.\\n\\nIt's clear that fame, money and attention is what's motivating them, Smith said of USA Gymnastics and MSU. Let's be clear, though, you can't buy us off. There's no amount of money, there's no amount of fame or attention that can get us to stop.\\n\\nOne Year Later: Larry Nassar And The Women Who Made Us Listen is a seven-part series that commemorates the seven days women stood in Judge Rosemarie Aquilina's Lansing, Michigan, courtroom last January and read powerful victim impact statements to former USA Gymnastics and Michigan State trainer Larry Nassar.

{"original": "By Hong Soon-do, Beijing correspondent, AsiaToday - China's political world had been dominated by various factions before Xi Jinping took power at the 18th Chinese Communist Party (CCP) National Congress in 2012. But now there are signs of unification of political factions within the party. While China's socialist system and the regime remain unchanged, we could even say that no other faction than the Xi Jinping faction is left in China.\\n\\nAccording to Beijing sources familiar with the Chinese government information on Wednesday, there used to be two main political factions within the CCP leadership competing for power, influence and control over policy initiatives. They are the Communist Youth League faction and the Shanghai faction. They deserved to be the main powers since the Youth League faction produced former President Hu Jintao and Premier Li Keqiang, and the Shanghai faction produced former President Jiang Zemin. Their close allies monopolized key positions of the ruling party. But now it is not easy to find high ranking officials of these factions in the office of the ruling party. It's because most of them have been relegated to less important posts as a result of a recent reshuffle. Chinese vice chair Li Yuanchao, who is widely considered to be a protégé of Hu Jintao, is even embroiled in rumors of losing his post.\\n\\n[Chinese President Xi Jinping and his allies. The picture is taken during their Europe visit in 2014./ Source: Xinhua News Agency]\\n\\nOn the other hand, Xi Jinping's close allies are being promoted to key positions. It can be clearly seen from the recent reshuffle. What's most eye-catching is the position of mayor Shanghai. Ying Yong, a former close subordinate of Xi Jinping, is expected to step up from deputy role to replace Yang Xiong, who is considered a member of the Shanghai faction.\\n\\n[Ying Yong, a former close subordinate of President Xi Jinping, is expected to be appointed mayor of Shanghai./ Source: Xinhua News Agency]\\n\\nWe should also take note of the appointment of the deputy secretary of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, which is considered ministerial rank. Xi's long-time speechwriter Li Shulei was promoted to deputy chief of the discipline commission during the commission's recent plenary session. The appointment shows that the Chinese president is seeking to train Li to be secretary Wang Qishan's successor.\\n\\nIn addition, we should not ignore the appointment of Zhang Guoqing and Chen Yixin as mayors of Chongqing and Hubei provinces, respectively. Zhang and Chen's appointments show Xi Jinping's intentions to train young bloods in order to increase his control in the future.\\n\\nSuch trend is expected to continue for a while. In short, the signs of the unification of political factions may have already become reality."}
{"original": "Employees of the music equipment retailer Guitar Center have been told they must sign mandatory arbitration agreements or they will lose their jobs.\\n\\nThe agreement, a copy of which was obtained by The Huffington Post, forces employees to relinquish their rights to sue the company in class action lawsuits over wage violations, workplace discrimination and unjust firings, among other disputes.\\n\\nSean Lynch, a sales employee at the company's Las Vegas store, said he and his colleagues were told they must sign the agreement by end of day Friday or they forfeit their jobs.\\n\\nIt was imposed on us and we have absolutely no choice, Lynch told HuffPost.\\n\\nArbitration agreements have become highly controversial for the way they hamstring employees and weaken their legal power. By sending disputes to an arbitrator, they force workers to pursue their claims individually and outside of court, preempting any collective action. And even though they're supposed to be neutral third parties, arbitrators are often cozy with the companies that workers are squaring off with, as The New York Times detailed in a recent series.\\n\\nA Guitar Center spokeswoman said the company declined to comment.\\n\\nCorporations are increasingly demanding that employees and consumers agree to mandatory arbitration, whether signatories realize it or not. Nowadays, the clauses are often tucked into welcome packets as boilerplate for new hires to sign. But in the case of Guitar Center, it appears the new policy is being imposed suddenly on longtime employees like Lynch, who says he's worked for the company for seven years.\\n\\nThe Las Vegas resident said he and his co-workers learned about the agreements in December when they signed in to do routine computer training. The PowerPoint-style sessions are usually devoted to matters like music equipment or workplace safety, he said. But in this case, the session was all about arbitration, and why it was good for the company and the worker.\\n\\nIn a question-and-answer sheet on the new policy, Guitar Center says that going to an arbitrator is less costly, less formal, friendlier and faster than going through the courts. The document assures a fair and impartial process, and notes that Guitar Center will pick up the tab for the arbitration (though not for the employee's lawyer, if he or she chooses one). The company is clear that the agreement is mandatory:\\n\\nAs a condition of new or continued employment, all new and current associates are required to electronically acknowledge and agree to be bound by the Arbitration Program and related agreement.\\n\\nLynch said he has been circulating a petition in his store that he intends to submit to management on Friday. He plans to sign the arbitration agreement, but not without protest. He said he can't afford to lose his job.\\n\\nMy main concern with it is that it's 'do it or else,' Lynch said.\\n\\nGuitar Center has been wrapped up in a nasty labor dispute with the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union, which provided the arbitration documents to HuffPost. In 2013, RWDSU won elections at three Guitar Center stores, including Las Vegas, but the union is still without a contract at any of them. The general counsel of the National Labor Relations Board accused the company of refusing to bargain in good faith, leading to a recent two-week trial. A decision hasn't yet been issued.\\n\\nLiz Vladeck, a lawyer with Cary Kane LLP who represents the union, said she questions the legality of Guitar Center requiring its employees to sign such a document. Although federal courts have ruled different ways on the issue, the NLRB has declared that such mandatory agreements illegally infringe on a worker's right to protected concerted activity with colleagues.\\n\\nWhile Guitar Center's agreement says workers can still pursue certain claims, such as unemployment insurance or workers' compensation, the language rules out a strikingly broad array of situations -- including any other violation of federal, state or local law.\\n\\nWe're analyzing the agreement in light of the labor board's recent cases. We're considering filing a new charge and pursuing a new round of action, Vladeck said. What's great is a lot of workers have been individually protesting. They're organizing themselves."}
{"original": "Jonathan Ernst/Reuters With the elections of Jon Ossoff, Raphael Warnock and Joe Biden, progressives are thinking they might actually be able to pass some real reform.\\n\\nWhen the 2020 election finally ended 64 days after Election Day, Democrats pulled out two additional victories, setting up a 50-50 balance in the Senate where Vice President-elect Kamala Harris will cast tie-breaking votes.\\n\\nThe wins for Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff unlock much more hope that the Biden administration might not just undo some of the worst actions taken in the Trump era, but actually push progressive reforms over the finish line.\\n\\nDemocrats in the Senate and the House, where their majority is also razor-thin, will still have to contend with more conservative members of their party who are resistant to progressive reforms.\\n\\nAnd Democrats will have to deal with the filibuster, which allows a minority of senators to block legislation by stalling unless and until 60 members vote to end debate. That would mean getting 10 Republicans to join them, something hard to imagine in most circumstances these days.\\n\\nThere are a few exceptions to the filibuster, including bills that go through the budget reconciliation process ― a special procedure that makes it possible to pass bills with a simple majority. But there are rules about what can and can't be in a reconciliation bill and Democrats over the next two years will be limited to three such bills, at most.\\n\\nThe only other way forward would be to end the filibuster, which is a parliamentary rule that the Senate adopted and can easily end. Reforming the filibuster is something Biden signaled last year he could be open to, after historically defending the procedure, but several Democratic senators have said they would oppose that.\\n\\nStill, progressive reforms in these areas now look a whole lot more possible than they did last week:\\n\\nMinimum Wage And Labor\\n\\nA Democratic majority in the Senate could put in play the first minimum wage hike in more than a decade. The federal wage floor of $7.25 per hour has not budged since 2009. With Democrats holding the House, the Senate and the White House, they would have a much stronger hand to pursue an increase as high as $15, though only if they prove willing to nuke the filibuster.\\n\\nDemocratic control of the Senate also makes sweeping labor reform possible through the Protecting the Right to Organize Act (PRO Act). The legislation, which the Democratic-controlled House had passed last year, would ramp up penalties for employers who try to break unions, ban anti-union right to work laws, and expand workers' rights to strike and boycott. The measure would be a huge prize for organized labor, but it has drawn fierce opposition from business groups and could struggle to draw the necessary votes from moderate Senate Democrats.\\n\\nAt the very least, a Democratic Senate should allow Biden to more easily reverse many of the labor policies of the Trump era ― not just legislatively through the Congressional Review Act, but by reshaping the National Labor Relations Board, which referees disputes between employers and unions. The Trump picks for that board have made it more difficult for many workers to bargain collectively. If Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) is deposed as the Senate's leader, Biden would have a much easier time installing union-friendly nominees who could undo the previous board's decisions.\\n\\nVoting Rights And Campaign Finance\\n\\nReauthorization of the Voting Rights Act and a suite of voting rights and campaign finance and ethics reforms were already at the top of congressional Democrats' priority list before they won control of the Senate on Tuesday.\\n\\nParamount among these is the John Lewis Voting Rights Act, which would reform and reauthorize the 1965 voting rights law. The proposed legislation, named after the civil rights hero and former Democratic congressman who died in 2019, would update the VRA in compliance with the Supreme Court's 2014 decision in Shelby County v. Holder, which gutted key parts of the historic law. That decision freed state-level Republicans to enact a raft of voter suppression measures aimed at lowering minority voter turnout. Former President Barack Obama called on the Senate to waive the filibuster in order to pass the revised law in his eulogy for Lewis.\\n\\nHouse Democrats also plan to pass the For The People Act, a collection of voting rights, campaign finance and ethics reforms, as they did in 2019. The bill would create a system of publicly financed congressional elections, expand campaign finance disclosure provisions, enhance executive branch ethics laws, end partisan gerrymandering, and require states to implement a host of election reforms to make it easier to vote. Other bills like the Protect Our Democracy Act, which aims to prevent future presidents from abusing their power as Donald Trump did, will also get a Senate hearing now.\\n\\nThe Judiciary\\n\\nBiden will have a much, much easier time getting his judicial nominees confirmed with Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) leading the Senate Judiciary Committee than he would have with Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) at the helm. Since Trump and McConnell filled almost every open judicial seat that Republicans had prevented Obama from filling, Biden will have to rely on older judges to retire quickly if he is to put his stamp on the federal judiciary.\\n\\nTrump transformed the Supreme Court with three new justices, the most named by any president since Ronald Reagan. Progressive judicial activist groups wasted no time in calling for liberal Stephen Breyer, the oldest Supreme Court justice at 82, to retire as soon as Biden is inaugurated and make way for a younger progressive justice. Democrats do not want another elderly justice dying at an inopportune time, as happened with the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. If Breyer does step down, Biden is expected to nominate the first Black female justice, as he promised to do during his presidential campaign.\\n\\nThe Social Safety Net\\n\\nOutside of their demands for bigger unemployment benefits in coronavirus relief legislation, Democrats have not said much lately about expanding or improving programs for poor people. They've mostly played defense against Trump and congressional Republicans' attempts to cut food and disability benefits, policies that will be relatively easy for them to reverse.\\n\\nBut there have been some big proposals in recent years, like making the child tax credit fully refundable and paid in advance, so low-income parents receive monthly checks instead of having to wait for a refund. Democratic leaders included this proposal in their COVID-19 relief demands late last year.\\n\\nAs for expanding Social Security retirement benefits, party leaders previously declined to give a hearing to such a proposal, though they said nice things about it.\\n\\nTaxes, Maybe\\n\\nBiden has said he supports a higher corporate tax rate and higher income and payroll taxes on people earning more than $400,000 ― proposals that would partially reverse the tax cuts that Republicans enacted at the end of 2017.\\n\\nCongressional Democrats also want to reverse some of Trump's tax cuts, but they've muddied the message by mainly insisting they would undo the only major tax hike that Republicans included in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Among its various changes, that law capped the federal deductions people can take for what they pay in state and local taxes, which Democrats decried as a tax hike on the middle class even though it mostly affected high-income households.\\n\\nClimate And A Green New Deal\\n\\nZeroing out planet-heating pollution from the world's second-largest emitter by the middle of the century will require unprecedented changes to the U.S. economy, and Biden will need new legislation to do that.\\n\\nDuring their campaigns, neither Warnock nor Ossoff endorsed the Green New Deal slogan that progressives use to frame calls for a World War II-style industrial strategy to rapidly decarbonize. But both Georgia Democrats vowed to make climate legislation a top priority, and Warnock, a Baptist reverend, draws on a long history of Black clergy fighting racist policies on pollution.\\n\\nThere will still be pushback from conservative Democrats like Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), a staunch fossil fuel ally who in 2010 ran an ad in which he fired bullets into a copy of the last major climate bill that Congress considered. Manchin, Sen. Krysten Sinema (D-Ariz.) and Sen. Angus King (I-Maine) voted against a resolution in March 2019 outlining the core tenets of a Green New Deal. Newly elected Sen. John Hickenlooper (D-Colo.), a longtime oil and gas booster, could also be a hurdle.\\n\\nBut lawmakers can also embed climate provisions in broader spending packages. Last month, Congress passed a stimulus bill that included billions for clean energy research, extended tax credits for solar and wind power, and ratified a global deal to phase out hydrofluorocarbons, a superheating refrigerant gas. The federal government's annual budget offers a similar opportunity, as the budget reconciliation process allows lawmakers pushing polarizing provisions to circumvent the filibuster.\\n\\nHealth Care\\n\\nThe Affordable Care Act ― Biden's famous B.F.D. ― is 11 years old and, for all its success making health care coverage available and more affordable to millions of Americans, it needs work. Biden campaigned on beefing up the law rather than replacing it wholesale with a single-payer Medicare for All system. A fully Democratic Congress would provide the new president with an opportunity to fulfill some of his promises.\\n\\nEven with Republicans out of legislative power, Biden faces a potential crisis in the Supreme Court, which is due to rule later this year on a lawsuit challenging the ACA's constitutionality. The Republican officials who brought the suit base their argument on the fact that Congress repealed the fines associated with the law's individual mandate in 2017 without repealing the mandate itself. Biden and a Democratic Congress could fix that problem in multiple, simple ways by amending the ACA and rendering the lawsuit moot.\\n\\nProtecting the ACA is but a preliminary step. Biden's health care plan would direct additional financial assistance to those who purchase private health insurance on exchanges like HealthCare.gov, and make that coverage and that assistance available to more people. Biden has also proposed establishing a government-run public option insurance program that would be available to everyone as an alternative to private coverage, including to low-income adults who live in 12 states that haven't expanded their Medicaid programs under the ACA. And he has called for lowering the Medicare eligibility age from 65 to 60 and allowing the federal government to negotiate prescription drug prices with manufacturers, among other policies a Democratic majority makes possible.\\n\\nImmigration\\n\\nBiden has promised to take a number of executive actions to reverse Trump's immigration policies, but Democratic control of Congress could allow him to resurrect broader immigration reform.\\n\\nThe incoming president supports a pathway to citizenship for many undocumented immigrants ― including Dreamers, the young undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as kids. He's also pledged to increase the refugee cap and ease restrictions on asylum-seekers.\\n\\nA number of measures now have a chance of passing the Senate, including the National Origin-Based Antidiscrimination for Nonimmigrants Act (or NO BAN Act), which passed the House last July. It would immediately terminate Trump's travel ban on several Muslim-majority countries and prohibit future presidents from implementing a similar ban.\\n\\nBiden promised to renew temporary protected status for people from Venezuela, Guatemala and Hong Kong, among others. The House passed a bill to do that last month, but Republicans in the Senate blocked it. The president-elect has also pledged to work with Congress on other reforms including amending visa programs for permanent workers and expanding protections for domestic violence survivors and undocumented immigrants who report labor violations.\\n\\nPaid Leave And Childcare\\n\\nIt's hard to imagine a better moment for Democrats to pass paid family and sick leave, and to do something to improve the state of childcare. The coronavirus pandemic has added a level of urgency to these issues, as paid sick leave would help reduce the spread of COVID-19 and a lack of paid family leave has pushed hundreds of thousands of parents, mainly women, out of the workforce.\\n\\nLawmakers like Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) and Rep. Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn.) have raised the issue's profile in the last few years, and polling shows actual bipartisan support. Biden's campaign agenda favors 12 weeks of paid family leave and seven days of paid sick leave.\\n\\nThe quickest path forward would be to extend and expand the emergency sick leave and childcare leave provisions passed last year to deal with the pandemic. Republican senators blocked extension of those provisions in December, and they expired on Jan. 1.\\n\\nMeanwhile, the long-suffering childcare industry has taken a massive hit. But it's now possible for Congress to pass something visionary like increased childcare funding to ensure, as Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) proposed, that families don't have to spend more than 7% of their income on that necessary expense. Biden's robust caregiving proposals also raise the prospect of higher pay and benefits for childcare workers.\\n\\nEducation\\n\\nOn the higher education front, Biden's agenda focuses on hiking funding for historically Black colleges and universities, and doubling the value of Pell grants, which help low-income students attend college. Both goals are possible with a simple Senate majority.\\n\\nAnother goal, to expand opportunities for free college, would involve more complex legislation and votes from Republicans, making it less likely. How much action Biden can take on student loan forgiveness is also up for debate, including whether he could do so through executive action. Expanding access to preschool is another area where advocates are hopeful for new, ambitious legislation resembling what Biden proposed as a candidate.\\n\\nThere's new hope of passing COVID-19 relief measures to send much-needed injections of dollars to state and local governments, K-12 schools and universities. Biden has promised to reopen most schools within his first 100 days in office, an undertaking that would require massive funding. There's also hope that any stimulus package could include resources to help alleviate students' learning loss over the last year."}
{"original": "Four years ago, on Jan. 21, 2017, nearly half a million people showed up for the Women's March in Washington, D.C., and millions more joined around the world to protest the kinds of unjust and racist policies expected from the newly inaugurated President Donald Trump.\\n\\nIt was a day of anger, but also unity and joy. Parents brought their kids, women sported pink pussy hats, and people carried homemade signs with statements like A woman's place is in the revolution! and Make America gay again.\\n\\nIt was also a day of dire warnings. Women warned that Trump's racist, misogynistic and violent rhetoric would have real consequences. In the years after, those fears were borne out in his policies and practices.\\n\\nNearly four years later, on Jan. 6 of this year, a mob of Trump's most fervent supporters ― incited by the then-president himself ― violently stormed the U.S. Capitol to try to stop Congress from certifying President-elect Joe Biden's victory.\\n\\nTrump's presidency was thus bookended by two very different groups registering their reactions to losing an election. To Women's March organizers, the end came as no surprise.\\n\\nWomen said this would happen, noted Rachel O'Leary Carmona, the executive director of the Women's March. This is exactly who we knew Trump to be. This is exactly who we said he was. And this is exactly why we got him out of office. Because this attempted coup is just the beginning of what he could have done if he got another four years.\\n\\nOn the four-year anniversary of that first protest, HuffPost spoke to Linda Sarsour, an original organizer and co-chair of the Women's March. (She is no longer affiliated with the group. Sarsour and two other original co-chairs stepped down from their positions at the organization in 2019 after reported in-fighting and accusations of anti-Semitism.)\\n\\nIllustration: Damon Dahlen/HuffPost; Photos: Getty Linda Sarsour speaks during a National Day of Action for a Dream Act Now protest on Feb. 7, 2018, in Washington, D.C.\\n\\nLooking back at that day four years ago and the organizing that happened around that first historic Women's March, how do you feel now?\\n\\nI feel proud. The Women's March was a warning to the country that we were going to mobilize in large numbers to hold this administration accountable. We reached women across the country, including a majority of women who never ever marched or organized a day in their lives, and we were able to articulate a message that our liberation is bound up with one another. A white woman won't be free if Black women and Muslim women and refugee women are not free. It was a very powerful message.\\n\\nIt was fascinating to see the comparison of the beginning of Trump's presidency to the end, the crazy contrast of people registering their reactions to losing an election. One, the Women's March, was peaceful and joyous, while the other was a violent insurrection.\\n\\nThe difference between us and insurrectionists is that our march stood for something. It wasn't just a march against Donald Trump. It was a march for racial justice and gender justice and climate justice. We gave people something to aspire for.\\n\\nHow do you reflect on that contrast?\\n\\nOutside of the Women's Marches, I reflect on the direct action that was led by women over the last four years. I remember in 2018, during the zero-tolerance policy of separating children from their mothers and fathers, we organized the largest women-led civil disobedience in history. And the Capitol Police figured out how to arrest over 640 women that day who were engaged in non-violent direct action inside of the Senate Hart building in the atrium.\\n\\nAs a Women's March leader, I remember during the [Brett] Kavanaugh hearing I was the first protester in that Senate chamber, and all I did was get up and say, This is a travesty of justice. This is a mockery of justice. That's all I did. And I was dragged over chairs and arrested brutally by the Capitol Police for doing nothing more than standing up and using my voice. I did not engage in violence. I did not have any weapons. I was an unarmed woman just saying that I was outraged at what was happening before my eyes, and I was brutalized by the Capitol Police.\\n\\nWe were able to articulate a message that our liberation is bound up with one another. A white woman won't be free if Black women and Muslim women and refugee women are not free. Linda Sarsour\\n\\nSo, for me, when I watched insurrectionists and white supremacists storm the Capitol ― people who had announced days in advance that they were coming to the Capitol ― and to see that they were treated with kid gloves really shows you everything we were trying to expose in the last four years under this administration. Law enforcement is not here to protect everyone the same and not everyone will be held accountable the same. And I've experienced that. I've been arrested over 20 times on Capitol Hill grounds, inside the Capitol and outside the Capitol. So to watch people just walk right in, break windows, steal mail from federal government officials ― it was a very triggering but eye-opening experience for the rest of the country.\\n\\nHow do you think the women who marched in 2017 can channel that energy into four years of a Biden presidency? A president they likely see far more common ground with, but still need to demand big change from.\\n\\nWhat is powerful now, four years later and in my experience organizing for the last 20 years, is that now we see intersectionality in a way that we have never seen before. We've seen racial justice movements working with climate justice movements working with gender justice movements in ways that are really unprecedented. I believe that the Women's March ― and our contribution as women-of-color leaders in the Women's March ― forced our movement to understand that we cannot win this in silos. We cannot defeat Donald Trump or his policies in silos. Once Donald Trump goes after one of us, he's gonna go after all of us ― and that's, in fact, exactly what he did. So I think in the next four years, under the Biden administration, you will see a lot more intersectional power building across movements and across communities.\\n\\nI just came from Georgia. I lived there for a month during the Senate runoff and I saw some of the most remarkable organizing. That, for me, is a reflection of what is possible over the next four years ― to push this administration to do the right thing. If you see even some of the policies that Biden has already proposed and some of the first-day executive orders, one of them is repealing the Muslim ban. That was a big campaign that came out of our movement.\\n\\nSo I feel proud. I hope that women, particularly those who were never really organizers and started becoming active in the last four years, I hope that they see the fruits of their labor. I hope that Black and brown organizers who have been organizing for decades see the fruits of their labor. That's what I'm excited about.\\n\\nThis interview has been edited for length and clarity."}
{"original": "After the end of the Cold War some 30 years ago, public debate and understanding of the enormous scale of impact of nuclear war fell to very low levels. This has changed with recent nuclear weapons tests and missile firings by North Korea. In this article I explain why the threat of nuclear war may now be higher than it has ever been and why we should all be aware of the latest scientific studies of the impacts of nuclear weapons.\\n\\nTwo nuclear war scenarios\\n\\nThere are approximately 14,900 nuclear weapons ready to fire or in stockpiles. 13,800 are deployed by the USA and Russia, while the remaining 1,100 are deployed by China, the UK, France, India, Pakistan and Israel. North Korea may have a handful of weapons. Based a range of published or leaked nuclear war plans and statements by political leaders, there are two key types of nuclear war to consider.\\n\\nThe first is a global nuclear war involving the US and Russia. In this scenario at least 1800 large warheads, or more likely over 3000, would be fired at nuclear weapon launch sites, command centres, ports, major industry, power stations and major centres of population. This is a large number of warheads and most cities, particularly state or regional capitals, would be struck by several nuclear weapons.\\n\\nThe other main scenario is a 'regional conflict', for example between India and Pakistan. In this case at least 100 smaller nuclear weapons would be used out of stockpiles of around 200 weapons striking mainly large densely populated super cities such as Delhi and Karachi. A North Korea – US scenario could be similar but with fewer but larger warheads being used.\\n\\nEveryone understands that any such conflict would cause unprecedented levels of deaths and suffering, but what is not well understood is just how vulnerable modern society is. On top of this, the most up to date scientific studies predict serious and long lasting global climate impacts leading to widespread crop failure and famine.\\n\\nThe increased risk of nuclear war\\n\\nSince the Cold War, both the US and Russia have kept 1800 warheads ready to launch within minutes as soon as a potential nuclear attack is detected. This nuclear hair trigger is intended to prevent a nuclear first strike by ensuring that weapons will be launched before they are themselves destroyed. But this policy has brought the world very close to a nuclear war several times in past years when equipment faults and innocent signals were thought to be nuclear attacks in progress and launches were only countermanded at the last minute. Now, nuclear commanders warn this risk is even higher due to continued cyber-attacks. Many argue that weapons should not be kept ready to fire at short notice as a nuclear response would always be possible.\\n\\nThe vulnerability of society to nuclear attack\\n\\nThe use of a nuclear warhead causes a series of severe impacts: Intense nuclear radiation and a blinding flash of light much brighter than the sun; a fierce fireball lasting several seconds; an intense blast wave; minutes or hours later, large-scale deposition of radioactive particles as fallout.\\n\\nSurvivors of the bombs dropped over Japan at the end of World War 2 speak of a bright sunlit day plunged into darkness as black oily rain fell. Dead figures, charred black still standing. Burned and terminally injured survivors, their skin hanging off; eyes and other internal organs hanging out of their bodies. Cars and vehicles tossed like toys, strong structures reduced to piles of rubble. Huge fires.\\n\\nUse of a nuclear weapon today would be much worse for two reasons: a typical modern nuclear weapon is now 8 to 80 times larger; modern society is much more reliant on vulnerable information technology and long distance supply routes for food and fuel.\\n\\nModern society is heavily reliant on electricity to power central heating pumps, to provide water, information via TV, the internet and mobile phones. Nuclear strike will mean no water supply, no heating or lighting, no information, no mobile phone signal.\\n\\nOnly a few days' food supply exists in regional distribution depots. The supply network would fail for multiple reasons: road blockages, communications breakdown, collapse of the banking system, destruction of ports.\\n\\nInternational aid organisations and health bodies all agree that the tens of thousands of casualties from just one nuclear bomb would overwhelm all attempts to help the injured. As a result, there would be no hope of treatment for severe injuries including burns, broken bones, deep cuts from flying debris.\\n\\nTo add to the multiple impacts, most locations in Western Europe are ringed by nuclear targets such as power stations or cities, so whatever the weather or wind condition, radioactive fallout is likely. You may receive a lethal dose inside a few hours but may not experience any symptoms until days possibly up to a week later. Radiation sickness causes vomiting, diarrhoea and internal bleeding. Children and the elderly are more vulnerable and more likely to suffer or die.\\n\\nWith the intense levels of damage, huge fires would spread across all major towns and other targets, burning them out in huge fires lasting days to weeks. We now understand that these huge fires would cause long lasting climatic impacts at a global level.\\n\\nA nuclear winter\\n\\nIntense city-wide fires loft extensive high-altitude smoke clouds similar to a large volcanic eruption. These clouds block sunlight causing cooling. The latest climate models predict that the use of a few tens to a hundred of the smaller nuclear weapons in the regional India-Pakistan scenario would cause severe frosts, reduced growing seasons, drought and famine lasting up to ten years across the entire northern hemisphere. A 1,800 US - Russian warhead scenario would cause a long-lasting cold period with a peak average global cooling of 4°C, whilst a larger scale nuclear war with over 3000 warheads would cause average cooling of 8°C. This is greater than the average cooling of 5°C experienced during the last ice age, so this would be a severe nuclear winter lasting a decade.\\n\\nWhilst an average cooling of only a few degrees may not sound very serious, the crucial impact is much longer periods of frost in winter and severe drought. There would be dramatically reduced growing seasons or even the impossibility of growing any crop as planned. Farming also relies upon supplies of fuel for mechanised planting and harvesting.\\n\\nRealistically, after a large scale nuclear war, one must picture small groups of brutalised, traumatised people, violently thrown back into a pre-industrial age. Assuming that some people somewhere furthest from the bombs could initially survive this global catastrophe, any 'recovery' would surely be measured in hundreds of years. It has to be regarded a shocking indictment of our modern civilisation that current stockpiles of nuclear weapons are sufficient to cause such a global catastrophe.\\n\\nThe only conclusion that can be drawn from these findings is that any use of nuclear weapons would be a global disaster and cause unacceptable suffering. Nuclear weapons do not keep us safe but under a constant threat of disaster. We now know we have avoided this only by sheer luck in several nuclear close-calls. In 2017, this understanding led 122 countries at the United Nations, to support a treaty to ban nuclear weapons in the same fashion as chemical and biological weapons and to press the nuclear-armed states to negotiate major reductions in weapons. We need to get rid of nuclear weapons before they get rid of us.\\n\\nYou can find out more about Scientists for Global Responsibility here.\\n\\nHuffPost UK Tech has launched HuffPost-Apocalypse, a project that aims to investigate what an apocalypse would mean for humanity, how we can best delay the end of the world, what the world will look like after we're gone and what the best viable options for survival will be for anyone left.

{"original": "President Joe Biden has revoked a key permit for the Keystone XL pipeline, effectively killing the controversial project and jump-starting what he's promised will be a seismic shift in U.S. climate policy after four years of inaction under Donald Trump.\\n\\nThe executive order on the oil pipeline, which Biden signed just hours after his inauguration, is part of an anticipated blitz of early executive actions to reverse Trump-era policies. Several are expected to target the previous administration's industry-friendly rollbacks of environmental regulations.\\n\\nBiden and Vice President Kamala Harris have pledged aggressive government action to combat the global climate crisis, and in recent weeks they've assembled what environmentalists have hailed as an all-star team to lead that effort. As promised, Biden signed a second executive order Wednesday to rejoin the Paris climate accord.\\n\\nA cry for survival comes from the planet itself, Biden said during his inauguration speech. A cry that can't be any more desperate or any more clear now.\\n\\nRevoking the permit for Keystone XL is part of a broader day-one executive order to address the climate crisis, create good union jobs, and advance environmental justice, according to the administration. Those efforts include potentially strengthening fuel economy and emissions standards; directing the Interior Department to protect our nation's treasures by reviewing and possibly reversing Trump's rollbacks of protected national monuments, including Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante; and temporarily banning all oil and gas leasing activities in Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.\\n\\nIt comes as a major blow for a fossil fuel infrastructure project that has been plagued by setbacks and litigation over the last decade.\\n\\nIn 2015, President Barack Obama rejected Keystone XL, saying that U.S. leadership to combat climate change would be undercut if he allowed the pipeline to be built. Trump, in turn, revived both Keystone XL and the Dakota Access pipeline, signing a pair of executive orders in his first few days to move the pipelines forward. Legal challenges followed and in November 2018 a federal judge halted construction on Keystone XL and ordered the Trump administration to conduct a thorough environmental review. Trump subsequently sidestepped that court order, issuing a presidential permit in 2019 authorizing energy company TransCanada to again proceed with construction.\\n\\nIf built, the planned 1,179-mile, $8.5 billion Keystone XL pipeline would transport some 830,000 barrels of crude oil per day from Alberta, Canada, to Nebraska, where it would link up with the existing Keystone pipeline that connects to refineries in Texas.\\n\\nPipeline owner TC Energy Corp said in a statement Wednesday that it would suspend construction ahead of Biden's order, which it called very disappointing.\\n\\nWhile the Trump administration, industry groups and other project supporters touted the pipeline's potential to create thousands of new jobs, environmentalists and Native American groups have long warned about its potential climate and other environmental impacts. The pipeline has already suffered a number of failures, including a nearly 400,000-gallon spill in North Dakota in October 2019.\\n\\nCanadian officials were among those who expressed concern this week after several media outlets reported on Biden's looming action. Jason Kenney, the premier of the province of Alberta, said in a statement that repealing the project permit would kill jobs on both sides of the border, weaken the critically important Canada-US relationship, and undermine US national security by making the United States more dependent on OPEC oil imports in the future.\\n\\nMeanwhile, environmental groups hope the president's executive order is just the start of aggressive government action to curb planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions.\\n\\nThese huge first steps show Biden is serious about climate action, but re-entering the Paris Agreement and canceling Keystone must be the start of a furious race to avert catastrophe, Kierán Suckling, executive director of the Center for Biological Diversity, said in a statement. Much more is needed, and we're increasingly hopeful the administration will stop approving new fossil fuel projects and speed the transition to clean, distributed energy that climate science and justice demand."}

Now a 23-year-old masters student at the University of Toronto, Ye was only around eight years old when the SARS outbreak happened but he already began to encounter racism at his school.\\n\\nI remember when the other kid on the playground would tell me to go away because 'all Chinese people had SARS,' Ye posted on Twitter.\\n\\nI remember when the other kids on the playground would tell me to go away because all Chinese people had SARS, the spread of the virus is a concern, but let's not let paranoia translate to racism.

But thinking back to it, when kids told me to get away from them because I was Chinese, that was racism.\\n\\nAt the time it made me feel excluded and made me feel invalid in who I was.\\n\\nWhen news of the novel coronavirus first started spreading, Asian-Canadians like Ye felt they were grappling not just with the outbreak of a new mysterious virus, but also the onslaught of racism they've come to expect.\\n\\nIn 2003, Toronto was hit especially hard by SARS. There were a total of 44 deaths, all in or around the city. As the toll rose, people started staying away from Chinese restaurants and grocery stores, CBC News reported in 2003. Businesses in Toronto's Chinatown reported their customers dropping by 70 to 90 per cent.\\n\\nCarlos Osorio / Reuters Pedestrians walk in the Chinatown district of downtown Toronto on Jan. 28, 2020.\\n\\nBesides the economic hit, Asian communities in Canada faced racism at personal levels. The Ontario government's post-SARS commission found cases of Chinese workers getting terminated from their jobs and Chinese tenants unlawfully kicked out by landlords. Funeral homes cancelled victims' funerals if they heard the body came from a hospital dealing with SARS.\\n\\nYe is worried that as the new virus makes its way through the information cycle, young kids will have to go through the same discrimination he went through.\\n\\nIt doesn't help that Ye has already seen an instance of blatant racism among people his own age. On a university Facebook group he's a part of, someone posted a fake graphic insinuating that people in Wuhan, China — where the outbreak reportedly started — are trying to rip masks off medical staff.\\n\\nI think this time around it's made so much worse by social media, where anyone can say anything they want, whether it's trying to take advantage of it for views and making these fake claims, or it's people like this who are spreading a racist message.\\n\\nCourtesy of Frank Ye Frank Ye is a graduate student at Munk School of Global Affairs in Toronto studying public policy. He endured SARS-fuelled racism as a child.\\n\\nHarris Ali, a professor of sociology at York University who has written extensively about the social impact of the SARS outbreak in Toronto, said that social media is the factor that didn't exist then the same way it does now.\\n\\nAt the time of the SARS outbreak, cellphones and texting were still at a rudimentary phase. But now, social media has given people the ability to gather virtually — and it's helping to amplify existing prejudice.\\n\\nIn Ontario, thousands of parents in the York Region signed a petition asking the school board to keep students whose family had visited China away from schools. The school's chair wrote back to parents, letting them know the request ran the risk of demonstrating bias and racism.\\n\\nThat sort of response, you didn't get it in the 2003 outbreak, said Ali. The racism responses were more interpersonal and individualized — shunning on the street, hate messages on telephone answering machines, Canadian-Chinese community centres facing verbal abuse.\\n\\nWatch: Coronavirus: the myths you shouldn't believe. Story continues below.\\n\\nWhile those responses were unwarranted and irresponsible, Ali says that the anonymity of the web means those responses can happen faster than ever.\\n\\nIt has an enduring psychological impact, he said.\\n\\nAli said that the obvious difference with the novel coronavirus outbreak is that things have improved technically — Canada was prepared to handle the virus before it even came here, the technology is more advanced, and health officials were able to mobilize quicker.\\n\\nWhere the improvement has not occured is with the social impact of the disease — racism, stigmatization — those have kind of been left unaddressed, he said.\\n\\nIn 2003, paranoia surrounding SARS reached such heights that Jean Chrétien, prime minister at the time, went to a restaurant in Chinatown and publicly ate soup, in an effort to ease fears.\\n\\nFred Lum/ Globe and Mail/ The Canadian Press Jean Chrétien has tea with members of Toronto's Chinese community in response to SARS fears which hurt Chinese businesses, on Apr. 10, 2003.\\n\\nIt's a good gesture of solidarity, it's a good gesture against the racist presumption, said Justin Kong, executive director of the Chinese Canadian National Council.\\n\\nRegardless, people should not assume that just because you're going to a Chinese restaurant or Chinese mall, that means that somehow you're going to get infected.\\n\\nKong said when news of the novel virus hit Canada, there was already an impending sense of fear in the Chinese-Canadian community that they'd experience what they went through with SARS.\\n\\nIt didn't take long before his fears were validated. For example, Kong came across a tweet by CTV reporter Peter Akman that showed him posing beside his barber who was wearing a face mask.\\n\\nHopefully ALL I got today was a haircut, Akman captioned the photo. He since apologized for the tweet.\\n\\nBut Kong said the damage was already done.\\n\\nThat was just a regular person who was working, small-business owner, probably just gave this guy a haircut, he said. The only basis of that was because this person was Chinese and that they were wearing a mask.\\n\\nAs part of the national council, Kong is working to help monitor misinformation about the disease and help keep the media on track. Seeing a journalist from an established outlet engage in racism was not a good start.\\n\\nI think it's important that we don't racialize the issue, because while the virus did originate in China, anyone is susceptible to the virus.\\n\\nKong described the community paranoia among Asian-Canadians ⁠— the fear that racist attitudes toward them will come to the forefront ⁠— as a hallmark of every time a disease breaks out.\\n\\nI think it's important that we don't racialize the issue, because while the virus did originate in China, anyone is susceptible to the virus. - Justin Kong, executive director of the Chinese Canadian National Council\\n\\nBut it's not unwarranted. Ye is feeling the impact of it on his day-to-day life.\\n\\nIt's just the worry that someone says something or looks at you some way and you feel it's because of this virus, or people are avoiding you because of who you are.\\n\\nAfter bearing the brunt of the social and economic impact of SARS in 2003, Chinese-Canadians were left to rebuild their lives by themselves. The Asian Canadian Labour Alliance noted in their post-SARS report that though the government had put aside $150 million to help Ontario recover from SARS, not a single cent went to Chinatown businesses or workers.\\n\\nKong thinks that, going forward, it's all about balancing a needed policy-based response and not producing unjustified hyper-fear. Even within the community, he said, fears are fluctuating between Oh, I'm so scared to this is no big deal.\\n\\nYou carry this burden where you worry about yourself, but you also worry about the well-being of your relatives who are in a worse situation than you are right now in Canada, said Ye.\\n\\nCole Burston via Getty Images Health officials during a press briefing on the coronavirus at Queen's Park on Jan. 27, 2020, in Toronto.\\n\\nCanada should start considering how to properly deal with the social impacts of outbreaks, Ali said, especially given that with globalization, they're more likely.\\n\\nWhen I interviewed the guy who discovered SARS, he said, 'You know what's different today? In the past you would have a disease outbreak in a village, and it was very limited because it used to burn itself out.'\\n\\nAmongst the vitriol against Chinese communities in North America, some people like to point to SARS and other diseases as proof that China is a hotbed of diseases.\\n\\nThat's nonsense, said Ali. If you study infectious disease and their origins, they all have their origins in an animal reservoir. He said given the increasing rate of globalization, disease can come from livestock here as well.\\n\\nAli says outbreaks are going to keep on happening, just because of the way we live.\\n\\nI'm not passing judgment on that at all, it's just sort of a natural thing.\\n\\nWith the likelihood that this will happen again, social and psychological factors of outbreaks should be considered as important as the technical issues — but they're not, Ali said."}

The proceedings will set out to answer two fundamental questions: Should McDonald's be considered an employer alongside the franchisees who run its stores, and if so, did the company violate its employees' rights amid the mass protests?\\n\\nThe hearings are about much more than a few one-day strikes. In a sense, the very franchise model that McDonald's and most other fast-food companies operate on will be on trial.\\n\\nMcDonald's sets the terms and conditions for its employees -- in this case we'll make that clear, Gwynne Wilcox, an attorney for the fast-food workers, said on a call with reporters Thursday. The company dictates policy and practice. Workers have been intimidated and threatened and even fired.\\n\\nWhile McDonald's did not immediately comment on Thursday, the company has told The Huffington Post in the past that it views the NLRB case as an overreach that strike[s] at the heart of the franchise system. McDonald's denies that it broke the law.\\n\\nThe case is being brought by the NLRB's general counsel, on behalf of McDonald's workers who are part of the union-backed Fight for $15 movement. The workers claim they were retaliated against for their activism, which embarrassed the company and helped draw national attention to the plight of low-wage workers. The trial involves so-called unfair labor practice charges involving McDonald's locations scattered around the country.\\n\\nIt isn't often that a franchisor like McDonald's is held accountable for labor law violations at its stores. Roughly 90 percent of McDonald's locations are technically run by franchisees -- the much smaller companies or individuals who tend to the day-to-day operations and ultimately sign workers' paychecks. According to McDonald's, it's the franchisee who's responsible for the working conditions inside a McDonald's store.\\n\\nThe Fight for $15, which is funded by the Service Employees International Union, has challenged that entire premise. It argues that McDonald's really is the boss inside stores, exerting control over workers through the menu, the supplies and uniforms, the training materials, and even computer programs that determine labor costs. The franchise model, it says, merely helps the company shirk its duties to workers, by shifting legal liabilities onto franchisees when workers get shorted on pay or fired for union activism.\\n\\nIf they succeed at trial and prove that McDonald's has a significant hand in setting the working conditions, then McDonald's could be punished for violating the workers' rights. The fast-food company would find itself answering to workers at franchised stores in a way it never had to before.\\n\\nThe general counsel's case has put the entire franchise industry on notice. The International Franchise Association, a trade lobby, has led a publicity blitz against the board, claiming it threatens businesses and entire industries if it deems companies like McDonald's joint employers. Republicans in Congress have publicized their cause, holding hearings and pushing legislation that would block the board from moving forward with such cases.\\n\\nFor its own part, McDonald's fought subpoenas from the board for records related to its business practices, forcing the NLRB to go to federal court. McDonald's and its franchisees were eventually compelled to fork over the documents.\\n\\nIn a call with reporters Thursday, David Dean, another lawyer for the fast-food workers, accused McDonald's of intentionally delaying the trial and doing everything they can to drag out the proceedings.\\n\\nMcDonald's seems resolved to try this case in the dark if it can, Dean said.\\n\\nAlso on HuffPost:\\n\\nPHOTO GALLERY McDonald's Secret Menu"}

Then, for about five months, Ontario had no price on pollution, until the federal government's carbon tax came into effect.\\n\\nThis whipsaw effect is confusing for voters and businesses and sabotages climate action in the long run, says Ontario Liberal leadership contender Steven Del Duca. That's why he says — if he wins the leadership convention and the next election — his government would collaborate on climate policy with opposition parties.\\n\\nThe Progressive Conservatives and NDP would have a hard time attacking and taking apart programs they helped develop, he said.\\n\\nWhen you're facing that kind of a threat, it shouldn't become a partisan political football. And that's what it's become, the former cabinet minister told HuffPost Canada.\\n\\nMark Blinch/Canadian Press Former Ontario minister Steven Del Duca stands with then-premier Kathleen Wynne at a climate announcement in Toronto on June 8, 2016.\\n\\nDespite the fact that Ontario's Liberal party has no permanent leader and only six elected members, it has more support than Ford's PCs, according to recent polls.\\n\\nThat means Del Duca, who's considered the front-runner to replace Kathleen Wynne, has a real shot at becoming premier in the 2022 election.\\n\\nHe gave HuffPost an exclusive preview of his Multi-Party Climate Change Plan.\\n\\nIt includes seven measures:\\n\\nCreate a committee with at least one MPP from every party in the legislature to work on climate policy,\\n\\nBring back reimbursements for electric vehicle purchases,\\n\\nMatch federal funding to build infrastructure for electric vehicles like charging stations,\\n\\nPlant 800 million trees in 10 years,\\n\\nGive a 50 per cent discount on fares to public transit riders on weekends, holidays and outside one-hour peaks on weekdays,\\n\\nGive $100 million a year to municipalities, businesses and farmers to build infrastructure that can stand up to extreme weather,\\n\\nDevelop a climate change curriculum for elementary and high school students.\\n\\nOntario needs a policy that is real, tangible and produces positive results, he said.\\n\\nRight now, all of those things are absent from the decisions that we see being made at Queen's Park by Doug Ford and his friends.\\n\\nIt's been particularly horrible to see Ford's government revoke Liberal environmental policies because they haven't replaced them with anything significant, Del Duca said.\\n\\nFord's government did introduce a climate plan in 2018, but Ontario's auditor general says it'll likely fail to meet its targets. Environment Minister Jeff Yurek has since called the plan a draft.\\n\\nEarlier: Premier Doug Ford defends climate plan. Story continues after video.\\n\\nOntario's emissions have been falling since the mid-2000s, largely because the Liberals phased out coal plants. Wynne, who still sits in the legislature as an MPP, sometimes shouts, You're welcome, when PCs say Ontario has cut its emissions.\\n\\nThe province needs to cut emissions from non-electricity sectors to meet future targets, according to a report by the Environmental Commissioner of Ontario, an independent office that was cut by Ford's government.\\n\\nMost of the measures in Del Duca's plan go after the largest source of Ontario's emissions: transportation.\\n\\nThe transit discount, which would apply in any jurisdiction that has public transit, would take cars off the road, he said.\\n\\nThere will be a whole bunch of new riders who come into the system if they leave their car at home, which is really good news for climate change.\\n\\nDel Duca says he would start implementing the plan within 100 days of winning office. Three of its measures — funding for electric vehicle infrastructure, rebates for electric vehicles and discounts for public transit — would be introduced no later than the government's spring budget in 2023.\\n\\nDel Duca couldn't project how many emissions his plan would cut, but said he'd align himself with the federal Liberals' goal to make the country carbon neutral by 2050. And he hasn't worked out how much the plan would cost.\\n\\nThe bigger question for us as a province is: What are we prepared to do? What are we prepared to invest in order to make sure that my daughters and the millions of others like them ... actually have a sustainable future? he said.\\n\\nFrom that perspective, I think it's more important for us … to make these kinds of investments and get the job done."}
{"original": "By Wayne Karl\\n\\nSpring has sprung, and while spring season is normally an occasion to celebrate, with days growing longer, weather getting warmer and real estate heading into busy season, everything feels a little different this year.\\n\\nCanada's real estate markets are dealing with myriad of issues. In the Toronto area, it's an acute supply shortage, skyrocketing prices and a resulting affordability crisis.\\n\\nIn B.C., a compositional shift towards softer sales and slowing price growth.\\n\\nIn Alberta, it's all about recovery, as the province and housing sectors claw their way out of two or three years of economic quagmire.\\n\\nOther provinces are dealing with their own economic- and market-specific challenges and opportunities.\\n\\nIn the resource-intensive provinces of Saskatchewan, and Newfoundland and Labrador, sales activity is still running at lower levels and supply is elevated. This has resulted in weakened price trends for these provinces, according to the Canadian Real Estate Association (CREA).\\n\\nIn Ontario's Greater Golden Horseshoe (the GTA, Hamilton-Burlington, Oakville-Milton, Guelph, Kitchener-Waterloo, Cambridge, Brantford, the Niagara Region, Barrie and nearby cottage country), the balance between supply and demand has become increasingly tight. This is expected to lead to continued double-digit price growth, resulting in further erosion in affordability and sales activity in the absence of a significant and sustained rise in new supply, CREA says.\\n\\nPRESSURE ON POLICY\\n\\nAgainst this backdrop, add the delicate and often confusing issue of policy. In Ontario, for example, the provincial government is facing hard lobbying from multiple sources -- chief among them the Ontario Home Builders' Association, Ontario Real Estate Association, and the Building Industry and Land Development Association -- to, in short, make more land available on which to build lowrise homes. And to speed up the approvals process.\\n\\nThe Canadian Home Builders' Association (CHBA) is also growing more vocal. In early March, it released an in-depth analysis of key factors underlying housing market conditions. The Housing Supply Deficit - Not Enough Homes for Families with Young Children, points to a significant and growing mismatch between housing demand and what the residential construction industry is able to supply, given planning and zoning patterns and lack of available serviced land. The report notes that if current trends continue, Canada will see a shortfall of 300,000 family-oriented homes over the next decade.\\n\\nThere has been a lot of commentary around what's driving house prices in markets like Vancouver and the GTA, says CHBA CEO Kevin Lee. Much of this overlooks the fundamental factors of supply and demand, and the increasing number of young families trying to achieve homeownership.\\n\\nFOREIGN BUYERS\\n\\nIn Toronto, having seen how effective a foreign buyers' tax in Vancouver has been to cooling a potentially overheating market there, the City is said to be considering taking similar action. Something... anything might be better than to let double-digit price growth continue unchecked, proponents say.\\n\\nBut, critics argue, slapping a tax on foreign purchases is short-sighted and will do nothing to facilitate a long-term solution to increase the supply of new homes.\\n\\nIf all of this wasn't complex enough, add the prospect of the National Housing Strategy. Due out at some point this year, this federal initiative will attempt to address the varied and challenging issues, involving differing provincial and regional economies, housing markets and conditions, from affordable housing to rental markets to homeownership.\\n\\nBUDGET 2017\\n\\nUntil then, we were looking to the 2017 federal budget, tabled on March 22 to see what, if anything, Ottawa would include to begin tackling some of these challenges. At the very least, it would have been reasonable to expect some modernization of the existing Home Buyers' Plan to allow Canadians impacted by sudden and significant life changes to buy a house without tax penalty. Many thought such changes would be included in Budget 2016, but none were forthcoming.\\n\\nBudget 2017, while making housing a priority by proposing to invest more than $11.2 billion over 11 years in a variety of initiatives, still comes up short on addressing affordability for first-time buyers.\\n\\nThe housing-related allocations in this budget are principally for affordable/social housing, so the key challenge of affordability for market-rate housing, and especially for first-time homebuyers, remains an issue, CHBA's Lee told YPNextHome.\\n\\nOriginally published on YPNextHome.ca\\n\\nFollow HuffPost Canada Blogs on Facebook"}
{"original": "Christian textbooks used in thousands of schools around the country teach that President Barack Obama helped spur destructive Black Lives Matter protests, that the Democrats' choice of 2016 nominee Hillary Clinton reflected their focus on identity politics, and that President Donald Trump is the fighter Republicans want, a HuffPost analysis has found.\\n\\nThe analysis, which focused on three popular textbooks from two major publishers of Christian educational materials ― Abeka and BJU Press ― looked at how the books teach the Trump era of politics. We found that all three are characterized by a skewed version of history and a sense that the country is experiencing an urgent moral decline that can only be fixed by conservative Christian policies. Language used in the books overlaps with the rhetoric of Christian nationalism, often with overtones of nativism, militarism and racism as well.\\n\\nScholars say textbooks like these, with their alternate versions of history and emphasis on Christian national identity, represent one small part of the conditions that lead to events like last week's riot at the U.S. Capitol, an episode that was permeated with the symbols of Christian nationalism. Before storming the Capitol, some groups prayed in the name of Jesus and asked for divine protection. They flew Christian and Jesus 2020 flags and pointed to Trump's presidency as the will of God. The linkage between Christian beliefs and the violent attack on Congress has since pushed evangelical leaders to confront their own relationship with Trump and their support for the rioters.\\n\\nThese textbooks made this brand of nationalism more mainstream, said Kathleen Wellman, a Southern Methodist University history professor who is working on a book about the two Christian publishers. I'm struck by how coherent of a worldview [the textbooks] promote and how thoroughly it resonates in current culture.\\n\\nRepresentatives from BJU Press and Abeka did not respond to inquiries about how many schools use their products. However, a 2017 HuffPost investigation found that about one-third of Christian schools participating in private school choice programs used a curriculum created by these two publishers or a similar company called Accelerated Christian Education, amounting to around 2,400 schools. The number of schools using these company's products that do not participate in a voucher program likely amounts to thousands more. (Voucher programs allow students to use taxpayer funds to attend private schools.)\\n\\nA passage in a history textbook published by Abeka.\\n\\nBoth Abeka and BJU Press have ties to Christian colleges. Abeka was launched in the 1970s by Arlin and Beka Horton, who also founded Pensacola Christian College, a Florida institution that outlaws dancing and other satanic practices, such as astrology. BJU Press is affiliated with the evangelical Bob Jones University in Greenville, South Carolina, which famously lost its tax-exempt status after banning interracial dating in the '80s, a policy it didn't reverse until 2000.\\n\\nWe unequivocally condemn any rhetoric that promotes illegal or violent behavior, Amy Yohe, managing editor of Abeka Publishing, told HuffPost. One of Abeka's core goals is to teach constructive citizenship through textbooks that accurately represent the facts of history, enabling students to learn from the life lessons it teaches, both positive and negative.\\n\\nBJU Press did not respond to requests for comment.\\n\\nHowever, scholars who study religion in America say that many of the ideas present in the publishers' textbooks overlap with rhetoric heard from the rioters last week. Christian nationalists argue that the United States was founded as a Christian nation and has a special covenant with God, meaning that its citizens must implement a particular vision for this country or they will fall out of favor with God. The textbooks parrot these ideas, said Andrew Whitehead, associate professor of sociology and director of the Association of Religion Data Archives at Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis.\\n\\nAs we see in these textbooks, they're afraid of outside forces or the U.S. won't be what it should be, said Whitehead. There's always a particular prescription ― they have to be on God's good side. I think that's a big part of it.\\n\\nPassages from the textbooks reflect an overarching worldview in which America is constantly moving away from a moral center, with Christians on the front lines beating back the forces of immorality.\\n\\nOne passage in an 11th-grade U.S. history textbook from Abeka states, Although many false philosophies were popular in America before 2000, the new millennium heralded a dramatic acceptance of immoral ideology on a national scale. … Three such philosophies are globalism, environmentalism, and postmodernism.\\n\\nBelieving religion — particularly Christianity — to be divisive, globalists discourage its influence on public life, it continues.\\n\\nBy parroting such conservative political views under the guise of Christianity, the textbooks give those views more legitimacy, making it difficult to distinguish between fact and opinion. While all textbooks, including the secular, cherry-pick narratives and have their biases, these ones fuse a religious worldview with Trumpian talking points using anti-media and anti-immigrant rhetoric.\\n\\nObviously it's too simplistic to say these textbooks are causing people to think something, but they play a unique role in giving visual credibility to these ideas by having them be in a very traditionally trustworthy artifact, said Adam Laats, professor of history and education at New York state's Binghamton University. There's a sense that they couldn't put it in a schoolbook if it wasn't true.\\n\\nHuffPost's previous investigation of these textbooks found that they also dismiss evolution as junk science, characterize Nelson Mandela as a marxist agitator who helped drive South Africa to radical affirmative action, and suggest that Satan hatched the idea of modern psychology. Many of the schools that use these books also ban LGBTQ students and families, and the books repeatedly condemn homosexuality. At one point in an Abeka textbook, slavery is described in purely economic terms, saying that slaves seemed to be better investments than indentured servants.\\n\\nI absolutely thought of these textbooks when watching what played out last week, Wellman said. It's the anti-science culture, anti-elite, the identification of Christianity with military culture.\\n\\nWin McNamee/Getty Images Trump supporters gather near the east front door of the U.S. Capitol after groups breached the building's security on Jan. 6, 2021.\\n\\nWhen discussing protests against the Iraq War and President George W. Bush's low approval rating at the time, the Abeka 11th-grade U.S. history book points the finger at the media in part, saying that much of the war opposition in America was the media, supported by a large number of Hollywood entertainers, and that spurred on by the media, many Americans wanted a change from the policies of the previous eight years.\\n\\nWhen discussing President Obama, the textbooks accuse him and his administration of stoking racial divisions. Below is a passage from that Abeka history book:\\n\\nMany Americans' views about race relations had improved at the time that Obama was inaugurated. Unfortunately, Americans' views of race relations declined after Obama came into office. Race riots in places such as Ferguson, Missouri, and Baltimore, Maryland, greatly escalated racial tensions and worsened strife between minorities and local police. President Obama's attempts to resolve these problems often seemed to make the situation worse.\\n\\nThe books do not mention that such protests came in response to the deaths of unarmed Black men, including Michael Brown and Freddie Gray Jr., at the hands of police.\\n\\nA high-school-level textbook from BJU Press also blames the Black Lives Matter movement for racial discord. It says:\\n\\nDespite President Obama's call for racial harmony, his eight-year term of office saw an intensification of racial discord. Several controversial shootings of black men led to protests, some of which were violent and destructive with black communities bearing the brunt of most of the destruction. Groups such as Black Lives Matter sharpened the divide between police and citizens, and black and white, with divisive rhetoric. Mixed messages from the Obama administration, the Department of Justice in particular, seemed to increase the racial discord.\\n\\nThe textbook does not mention that those controversial shootings were at the hands of police officers or explain the societal changes Black Lives Matter is trying to achieve with its supposedly divisive rhetoric. The book does not lay out for its teen readers what those mixed messages from the Obama administration were.\\n\\nOther targets of the textbooks include globalists, environmentalists and multiculturalists.\\n\\nAccording to multiculturalists, advancing the achievements of western civilization was an act of hatred toward other cultures. They encouraged people to define themselves by race, sex, or sexual orientation rather than by the pillars of western civilization, such as nation, family, and God, reads the Abeka American history textbook. However, many conservatives and Christians within America have attempted to quell these philosophies and once again turn America into a united, moral nation.\\n\\nThe textbooks don't give a full-throated endorsement of Trump, noting his crude remarks and previously liberal positions, but they ultimately represent him as someone on the side of Christians who is fighting for their values. One description from the Abeka textbook reads:\\n\\nContrary to the high hopes that Obama's presidency would bring the country together, Americans were bitterly divided leading up to the election in 2016. The Democratic Party had become increasingly concerned with identity politics, which is the idea that a person's race, sex, and sexual orientation form the most important parts of their humanity and that politics should reflect that belief. Republicans, meanwhile, believed that their politicians had been too compromising with the increasingly radical left and that they needed a political outsider who would not back down or compromise with the Democrats. ... The Republican Party nominated real estate mogul and reality television star Donald Trump from New York, whose determination and bombastic mannerisms gave Republicans the fighter they wanted. As a businessman, Trump stated that he would 'take the brand of the United States and make it great again.' However, many conservatives were wary of Trump because of his occasional vulgar speech, his past immoral behavior, and his public support of homosexual marriage; but some were persuaded by Trump's choice for his running mate — Indiana's conservative governor Mike Pence.\\n\\nEvangelical Christians were one of Trump's most important voting blocks. Though white evangelicals only represent about 15% of the electorate, they made up about 23% of the vote during the 2020 election, according to the Associated Press. About 8 in 10 white evangelical Christians voted for Trump last year.\\n\\nA passage from an Abeka high school history book.\\n\\nImages from the Capitol riot felt more familiar than shocking to 28-year-old Mel Garman, who grew up attending evangelical Christian schools.\\n\\nThere were the Christian flags, like the ones she used to pledge allegiance to in school, waving alongside American flags. The rioters' rhetoric, focused around saving the country, defeating enemies and promoting the will of God, could have come straight out of one of her childhood classrooms, where she said she was taught a distorted version of history with nods to white Christian supremacy. Last week's insurrectionists could have been her classmates, her teachers, her pastors. She felt a wave of recognition as she watched the pictures on social media.\\n\\nOver the course of my life I can see how what I was taught in Christian schooling has impacted me, and the riots on Jan. 6 played into it. That whole belief system revolves around the idea that you want the rest of the world to think like you, said Garman, who is now a social worker. It's a 'the ends justify the means' type of thing.\\n\\nSince Jan. 6, popular pro-Trump evangelical leaders have felt driven to judge the rioters' actions, with some offering full-throttle condemnations and others issuing more temperate responses.\\n\\nThe Secret Service had to escort the vice president of the United States to safety out of the Capitol building. Gunshots were fired. Tear gas was deployed in the Capitol Rotunda. People were killed. ... This was an assault on law. Attacking the Capitol was not patriotism; it was anarchy, said Rev. John Hagee of Cornerstone Church in San Antonio during his Sunday sermon, before going on to rally support for law enforcement, according to the Associated Press.\\n\\nMiles away in Kentucky, Brian Gibson, pastor and founder of His Church, blamed the riot on antifa agitators, a conspiracy theory for which there is no evidence.\\n\\nYou don't get 2 million people together without having some radicals in the crowd or some simple people in the crowd that you could lead anywhere, right? he said, also greatly exaggerating the size of the crowd that day.\\n\\nIn other places, teachers in public schools that don't rely on Christian textbooks are struggling to explain to their students the dynamics that allowed such violence to occur. In Chicago, high school teacher Raven Althimer discussed the harsh realities of the insurrection with her students, who are Black.\\n\\nThey think of when they had Black Lives Matter over the summer, peacefully protesting, and were tear-gassed. People are literally storming the Capitol and nothing is happening to them, Althimer told HuffPost. One of my students said, 'If 20 of us had done that, we all would have been dead.' I said, 'No, 20 of you wouldn't have even gotten that close.'"}

{"original": "Jake Paul/YouTube Jake Paul posted the Mystery Brand-sponsored video I Spent $5,000 ON MYSTERY BOXES & You WONT Believe WHAT I GOT... (insane) on his channel.\\n\\nYouTube's top influencers have cashed in on highly lucrative sponsorship deals to promote an online gambling company to their young fans, and YouTube doesn't have a problem with it.\\n\\nIn recent weeks, celebrity YouTubers Jake Paul, Bryan RiceGum Le and others have faced fierce backlash after uploading videos to their wildly popular channels featuring MysteryBrand.net, a website that lets users pay for a chance to win a variety of prizes.\\n\\nPeople who are 13 or older can sign up on MysteryBrand.net to buy virtual mystery boxes, which range in price from $1.99 to more than $1,299.99, and are marketed to contain an item from brands including Apple, Ralph Lauren, Xbox, Gucci, Supreme, Nike and Rolex. After paying for a box, users can open it on-screen to reveal their prize, then either order the item for delivery or sell it back (typically at a much lower price than the cost of the box) to receive online credit and try again. They can also select prizes to create their own box with customized odds, which tend to be far more expensive. Little information about Mystery Brand is publicly available, though the website states its terms and conditions are subject to Polish laws.\\n\\nYou could get a pile of shit or you could get a Rolls-Royce, 21-year-old Paul, YouTube's second-highest-paid star, told his 17.7 million subscribers in a recent video sponsored by Mystery Brand. I want you guys to go to MysteryBrand.net right now and play this game and tell me or tweet me or something if you guys win this, OK? urged Paul, who said in 2018 that his YouTube audience is primarily comprised of 8- to 16-year-old kids.\\n\\nMysteryBrand.net Top prizes listed on MysteryBrand.net include a $173,691.36 Louis Vuitton trunk.\\n\\n'It's Just A Scam'\\n\\nMysteryBrand.net, which is riddled with grammatical errors, quietly removed its top prizes ― including beach vacations, premium California real estate and luxury vehicles ― following a maelstrom of scam accusations on social media in the wake of Paul and Le's viral videos. Its now-deleted photo of a $250 million Most Expensive Los Angeles Realty mansion was actually an image of a $188 million Bel Air home, The Daily Beast and others reported. And until recently, Mystery Brand's prize list included a 2018 Lamborghini Centenarió ― only 40 of which have ever been produced (all prior to 2018). The same goes for its Real Car Rolls-Royce Phantom 2018 ― no such car was made last year.\\n\\nAfter people called the website out on Twitter, it took down a section of its terms and conditions that stipulated it could refuse to issue prizes to users who don't claim them within one hour. Angry reviews on Reddit and Mystery Brand's Facebook page claim some users received fake merchandise or never got their prize items at all. Critics, including controversial Swedish YouTube influencer PewDiePie, who has stoked outrage over his anti-Semitic videos in the past, have raised another issue: In their promotional posts, Paul and Le curiously won items of far higher value than unsponsored users did in their Mystery Brand videos. Le quickly won an $11,000 Chanel purse which, according to odds listed on MysteryBrand.net, he had a less than 0.17 percent chance of doing.\\n\\nMystery Brand is like gambling. It was very addictive. Ian Yael, 21, a YouTuber and former Mystery Brand user\\n\\nIan Yael, a 21-year-old university student from Mexico City, spent hundreds of dollars and opened nearly 20 boxes on MysteryBrand.net before winning a $1,100 Louis Vuitton pocket knife and ordering it for delivery in mid-October. But three months later, the item has not even been processed for shipping, his account shows.\\n\\nMystery Brand is like gambling. It was very addictive, Yael said. But it's just a scam. In messages viewed by HuffPost, he contacted the website several times to request an update or refund. A representative who goes by the name Tim Perk repeatedly assured Yael, month after month, Everything regarding your order is fine, and [it] should be coming soon!\\n\\nMysteryBrand.net courtesy of Ian Yael Ian Yael ordered his Mystery Brand prize for delivery on Oct. 14, as shown above. It still hasn't shipped.\\n\\nIn the U.S., gambling is generally defined as paying to place a bet or wager to win a lottery or other prize, and is restricted for minors. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit has ruled that internet gambling on a game of chance is not prohibited by law, however the Justice Department maintains that all internet gambling by parties in the U.S. is illegal. Within the European Union, there is no broad policy on gambling regulation, so each member state enforces its own laws.\\n\\nPerk claimed in an emailed statement to HuffPost that the site isn't a scam and its service is not equatable to gambling because other companies sell packages with unknown contents, too.\\n\\nMystery Brand is not much different from those projects, except for the fact that we make the whole process of buying and receiving items from a Mystery Box fast and transparent in real time, said Perk. He added: Sometimes, shipping may take up to a couple of weeks since we mostly use the [online marketplace] StockX platform for purchasing and delivering prizes.\\n\\nStockX was completely unaware of MysteryBrand.net, a representative told The Verge, adding that no formal partnership between the companies exists. Digital marketplace G2A cut ties with the website last week amid the scam and gambling allegations.\\n\\nMarco and Alvin/YouTube Mystery Brand videos have gone viral on YouTube.\\n\\nYouTube Unbothered\\n\\nYael, who spends several hours per day on YouTube, said he learned about MysteryBrand.net from trending videos on Marco and Alvin, a popular YouTube channel that has featured the website dozens of times since early October. The videos are supposedly unsponsored, but still profit from ad revenue through YouTube's general monetization program.\\n\\nYouTube's community guidelines claim the Google-owned company is constantly working to keep YouTube free of spam, scams, and other deceptive practices that attempt to take advantage of the YouTube community. But the video giant declined to answer why it allows monetized videos promoting a shady gambling website on channels geared to kids and teens.\\n\\nCreators should be transparent with their audiences if their content includes paid promotion of any kind, a Google spokesperson told HuffPost, without addressing specific questions about Mystery Brand videos.\\n\\nHuffPost confirmed that YouTube's algorithm has promoted Mystery Brand videos, giving them traction and potentially increasing ad revenue for both Google and the content creators. As the hosts of Marco and Alvin explained in a recent post, mystery box content helped them go viral and earn money: We were nothing before Mystery Brand. We were at 1,700 subscribers before we actually did our first Mystery Brand video, they said. Through Mystery Brand's name we have been able to grow ... and actually start doing YouTube for a living. They now have nearly 70,000 subscribers, and recently apologized for pushing a scam.\\n\\nPaul and Le respectively pulled in around 2 million and 2.6 million views on their promotional Mystery Brand YouTube videos in one week. Content creators can earn an estimated rate of up to $5 per 1,000 views on the platform from ads. After coming under fire, Paul addressed the controversy in a pair of snarky tweets last week before reminding children not to gamble. Le filmed a subsequent video acknowledging he was somewhat in the wrong for doing business with Mystery Brand, lamenting other YouTubers had done the same in the past without major scrutiny, and complaining the ordeal had been blown out of proportion. Neither Paul nor Le responded to HuffPost's requests for comment.\\n\\nRiceGum/YouTube Bryan RiceGum Le posted the Mystery Brand-sponsored video How I Got AirPods For $4 on his channel.\\n\\n'Imagine How Much They Offered Me'\\n\\nYouTube stars have made big money directly through Mystery Brand sponsorship deals. Daniel Keemstar Keem, a YouTuber with 4.7 million subscribers, claimed he declined a $100,000 offer from a similar company to promote its service on his channel. Le, who has 10.8 million subscribers, suggested Mystery Brand paid him well above that amount for his sponsored video.\\n\\nApparently they only offered Keemstar $100K. My [subscriber] numbers are higher, so imagine how much they offered me, Le said in his apparent apology post, attempting to explain why he had agreed to do the promotion. The money was on the table and if I wanted the money I just had to open up a few Supreme boxes and shoe boxes and boom, I get the money. So I'm like, 'Yo, that sounds easy enough.'\\n\\nYeezy Busta, a YouTube influencer with 448,000 subscribers who asked not to use his real name for privacy reasons, confirmed to HuffPost that Perk from Mystery Brand offered him a sponsorship deal for tens of thousands of dollars in July. After doing some research into the website and deciding it was a scam, he turned it down.\\n\\nIt was hard to say no to the money, but I felt like in my position it was better for me to save hundreds if not thousands of people from losing hundreds if not thousands of dollars, he said. It really hurts me to see so many kids losing their money. A hundred dollars to me or to other creators isn't a whole lot, but to these kids it might be their savings or their holiday money.\\n\\nContent creators should do their due diligence and take responsibility for what they promote, he added. Every YouTube creator wants to influence their fans in a positive way, but sometimes a check can change people's minds."}
{"original": "Hoptocopter via Getty Images Even if oil demand and prices increase post-pandemic, many of the industry's lost jobs are unlikely to come back.\\n\\nEvery time a politician talks about climate policy or a newspaper runs a big story on the transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy, the question of jobs comes up. For those who are opposed to the transition, the common criticism is that moving away from coal, oil and gas would leave hundreds of thousands of Americans out of work. For those in favor, the question is how to train hundreds of thousands of oil and gas workers for different sorts of jobs.\\n\\nRarely do the talking points — or the debates that follow — get into the details of what's actually happening in the oil and gas labor market: that it's an industry already grappling with a dwindling talent pipeline and that a push toward automation was making tens of thousands of oil workers redundant even before the coronavirus pandemic wiped out more jobs.\\n\\nThe industry lost more than 100,000 jobs between March and August 2020, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics and consulting firm Deloitte (so certainly not the worst-hit sector, but hard-hit nonetheless). Even if oil demand and prices increase, not all of those jobs are likely to come back, said Ken Medlock, senior director of the Center for Energy Studies at Rice University's Baker Institute for Public Policy.\\n\\nThat's because it's not just the pandemic that's hurting the industry. Other factors are cutting down the oil and gas workforce as well.\\n\\nFirst, as with most industries, there's automation, which has reduced the number of jobs available in the energy sector over the last several years. When oil prices crashed in 2014, the Houston area shed some 86,000 oil and gas jobs and by 2019 had regained only 24,400 of those jobs. Why? In large part because in the wake of the crash, oil companies became more efficient and began to embrace automation in a big way.\\n\\nThe automation trend has continued, Medlock said. So when production grew again from 2017 to 2019, that growth didn't require a lot of additional labor input.\\n\\nThrow global trends toward electrification and clean energy into the mix and the job market wasn't looking that rosy for oil and gas even before the pandemic.\\n\\nIf you're a 30-year-old graduating with an MBA and you want to stay in Houston and you want to be in energy, you're taking a very different look than you would have 10 years ago. Jeff Bishop, CEO of Key Capture Energy\\n\\nAnd even if the job demand does rebound to any extent, between policy and economic shifts and dwindling social approval of the industry, oil companies may find themselves struggling to hire.\\n\\nAs fossil fuels flag, all signs point to a strong future for renewable energy.\\n\\nLooking at global investments in the energy space, it's all going to wind, solar, batteries, EVs [electrical vehicles]. It's not going into fossil fuels, said Jeff Bishop, CEO of the large-scale battery company Key Capture Energy. Fossil fuels aren't going away, don't get me wrong, especially not in Texas. But if you're a 30-year-old graduating with an MBA and you want to stay in Houston and you want to be in energy, you're taking a very different look than you would have 10 years ago.\\n\\nLast week — a century ago by 2021 standards — social media lit up with various opinions about a New York Times story that highlighted the waning fortunes of new college graduates looking to work in the oil and gas industry. Some sympathized with young people graduating into a pandemic, but most wondered why they had chosen to work in the industry in the first place, given what we know about both its impact on climate change and its financial prospects in years to come.\\n\\nBut actually, Bishop and Medlock believe the changing energy landscape is not such a big problem for the sorts of white-collar workers profiled by the Times, whose skills are largely transferable to any segment of the energy sector. In fact, according to Bishop, it's a boon to clean energy startups like his to be able to hire oil and gas workers.\\n\\nI can teach people power, but I can't teach people the process, procedures and mindset for these big energy projects, he said. Just in Texas alone, we're putting over $100 million of capital to work and we need a level of rigor around project management, safety and process that oil and gas companies are really good at.\\n\\nHis company specifically recruits current and former gas employees and recent grads who studied for oil and gas jobs.\\n\\nPeople call Houston the energy capital of the world, but Houston is really an engineering and logistics capital, Medlock said. Those skillsets — managing a supply chain, handling materials, chemical engineering — that's all transferable.\\n\\nThis is not to say that there's a simple one-to-one transition from oil and gas jobs to clean energy jobs. The Bureau of Labor Statistics still doesn't collect data on solar and wind jobs, so the stats that exist are cobbled together, but there are indisputably fewer jobs in clean energy than currently exist in the fossil fuel industry. And while white-collar workers can hop around the energy sector, it's not as straightforward for the various blue-collar workers in oil and gas. Welders can work just as easily on a wind farm as an oil rig, but the skills of other oil rig workers are pretty specific to drilling.\\n\\nPaul Darrow/Reuters Some job skills transfer easily between the fossil fuel and renewable energy sectors.\\n\\nThe idea of employing out-of-work oil hands to plug and remediate abandoned oil wells has been floated a few times in recent years as a transitional job for these blue-collar workers while the economy shifts away from fossil fuels. Although oil companies are legally required to decommission out-of-use wells and drill sites, and return the land or sea to its pre-drilling condition, it's fairly common for companies to declare bankruptcy before these asset retirement obligations (AROs) are fulfilled. Consequently, there are now an estimated 1 to 3 million abandoned wells in the U.S. in need of remediation.\\n\\nSome pro-transition activists ― like Theron Horton, a strategist with the ARO Working Group ― have suggested that oil workers could be hired by the federal or state governments to perform this work as they train for new jobs.\\n\\nThere's 10 years of steady jobs for these people, not boom and bust the way it has been in the oil fields, Horton said. And it's work that their skillset and identity is aligned with. Plus, it leaves them in situ — they don't have to move, their kids stay in the same schools. Ten years is a long time to transition, so it's really common sense convergence here. It's also worker solidarity, for these people in the fields not to feel like they're abandoned by society.\\n\\nBut despite the number of such wells, others, like Medlock, are not convinced that such an approach would put a large enough number of people back to work.\\n\\nMeanwhile, in the white-collar world, if oil prices do rebound, it's more likely that oil companies will be chasing graduates than the other way around. The fossil fuel industry has been worried for years about the lack of interest shown by younger generations in working for oil and gas companies. Even a few years ago, young people saw careers in the industry as difficult, dangerous and harmful to society. Between the 2014 crash and the pandemic, now it also seems financially unstable. So even as they lay off workers in the field, oil companies continue to recruit at universities to avoid creating a generation gap in their workforce, a problem the industry grappled with in the 1980s.\\n\\nUnlike the '80s, oil companies these days are competing for workers with more stable and more popular industries, including clean energy.\\n\\nBishop said he's not worried that the people he's hired away from oil and gas will defect back to fossil fuels if prices hit $100 a barrel again.\\n\\nPeople want stable, well-paying jobs that have purpose, he said, adding that he's regularly contacted by individuals who have an oil and gas education but are interested in his firm, especially folks coming out of business school. They know they're gonna be in energy, and they see the writing on the wall: You need to be in the energy transition now.\\n\\nHuffPost's Work In Progress series focuses on the impact of business on society and the environment and is funded by Porticus.

{"original": "Ready your tractors and plows—the farm bill is upon us. This omnibus package of legislation, reauthorized every 5 to 7 years, shapes virtually every aspect of our food and agricultural system. Yet this wide-ranging, $500 billion piece of legislation, which aims to ensure a safe and sufficient food supply for our nation, fails to take steps to guarantee that the food we produce actually makes it to our plates. Congressional agriculture committees recently commenced hearings to begin preparation for the 2018 Farm Bill, which makes this the perfect time to discuss how the next farm bill can invest in solutions to reduce the nearly 40% of food that goes to waste in the U.S.\\n\\nReducing food waste offers a significant opportunity to impact the economy and environment. We spend $218 billion to produce, process, transport, and then dispose of 62.5 million tons of food each year. Wasted food eats up 20% of our nation's freshwater, cropland, and fertilizer before ending up in the landfill, where it adds 113 million tons of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere annually. At the same time, one in seven Americans are food insecure. Much of the food we currently waste is still safe, edible, and nutritious, and redistributing just 30% of this food could feed every food insecure American.\\n\\nWith preparations for the 2018 farm bill already under way, now is the time to rethink the role the federal government can play in reducing food waste to protect people, preserve our planet, and provide economic benefits, while helping us value food as a resource. This week, the Food Law and Policy Clinic of Harvard Law School, in partnership with Food Policy Action and ReFED, released Opportunities to Reduce Food Waste in the 2018 Farm Bill, which recommends policies Congress can implement to tackle food waste in the next farm bill.\\n\\nThere are myriad opportunities to incorporate food waste into the farm bill, including many simple, easily implemented changes, like tweaks to statutory language, eligibility requirements, or grant selection processes that can allow many farm bill programs to address food waste. For example, the farm bill includes several grant programs to support distribution, processing, and marketing of food for sale. Broadening eligibility language to include food recovery organizations and allow grant funding to support distribution of food that is donated but not sold can ensure less is wasted. For other programs, directing USDA to preference applicants with a plan to donate surplus food, or who pledge to create such a plan, would provide a strong incentive for producers to take steps to donate more and reduce their waste.\\n\\nCongress can also enact new policies in the farm bill to address key drivers of food waste, such as clarifying and standardizing confusing best by and sell by date labels. Currently, manufacturers have broad discretion over date labels and use a wide array of mystifying phrases that generally indicate a product's quality, not safety. Misinterpretation of these labels by consumers, businesses, and even regulators (who in some states restrict the sale or donation of such safe, wholesome food) puts more food in landfills. The upcoming farm bill is the perfect opportunity to establish a system that limits date labeling language to two standard options, a quality date and a safety date, cutting down both consumer confusion and wasted food. Industry groups are already on board—the Food Marketing Institute and Grocery Manufacturers Association recently announced a voluntary initiative to just use two standardized date labels: a standard best if used by for quality and use by for safety—and federal legislation can ensure this standard takes root nationally.\\n\\nThe 2018 Farm Bill can also build on state-level pilot programs. Many states and localities have implemented policies limiting the amount of organic waste that businesses can send to landfills. In Massachusetts, implementation of an organic waste ban achieved a five-fold increase in waste diversion, and created more than $175 million in economic activity and 500 jobs in just two years. Measures like these have tremendous potential, but also require significant up-front investments to build waste diversion infrastructure. The farm bill could provide dedicated planning and implementation funding to support state governments that implement similar bans, making the wins seen in Massachusetts replicable across the nation.\\n\\nIn 2015, USDA and EPA announced the first-ever U.S. food waste reduction goal—a bold and aggressive goal of halving our food waste by 2030. If the federal government doesn't invest in food waste reduction, then we will fail to hit the mark. It is time for Congress to tackle the issue of food waste in the U.S.; a farm bill that remains silent on the topic is a missed opportunity to break our food waste habit and achieve significant social, environmental, and economic benefits in return."}
{"original": "A Cincinnati elementary school is under fire for reportedly limiting students' trips to the water fountain.\\n\\nA sign, photographed hanging on the wall of Carson Elementary School, reads Getting a drink by permission only. That means you must ask the teacher before going out into the hall for a drink. You will get one pass per week to get a drink of water; after that points will be deducted from your grade.\\n\\nThe school immediately drew criticism for the harsh policy — not only does it have the potential to leave students dehydrated, but it also punishes them for needing a drink. Parents raised the alarm about the sign and made it clear that the policy was unreasonable. You're not going to fail my kid because he's thirsty and he wants a drink, one concerned parent said to a local news channel. If my kid's playing in the gym room and he's hot and sweaty and he asks for a drink and he goes to get a drink, are they going to deduct a point from him? asked another. A mother put it simply, I thought it was not right that they were depriving the children of having water.\\n\\nThe sign went public on Tuesday, and as of Wednesday, Carson Elementary has already removed it. The school district is calling the policy a misunderstanding. It released a statement apologizing and clarifying the issue: There was a sign posted at Carson Elementary intended to remind students when it is appropriate to ask to leave class for a water fountain break. The sign's directive was outside school policy, a result of a misunderstanding about the school's procedures. When school officials learned about this, the sign was removed. Students are permitted to ask for permission to leave class for needed restroom or water breaks at no risk to their grades. The school district has since confirmed that students' grades will not be affected.\\n\\nConventional wisdom tells us to drink eight eight-ounce of water per day. According to the Mayo Clinic, the directive is easy to remember, and it's a reasonable goal. Some people may need less than eight glasses per day. As they say, Most healthy people can stay hydrated by drinking water and other fluids whenever they feel thirsty. That extends to students — and means way more than one trip a week to the water fountain.\\n\\nRead more from Yahoo Lifestyle:"}
{"original": "While politicians and policy-makers have made mouth noises about the amount of time spent on the Big Standardized Test and the prep therefor, those elements only scratch the surface of how test-and-punish policy has messed with American schools.\\n\\nAt various times in ed history we have talked about teacher-centered schools, community-centered schools and student-centered schools. What we have seen over the past decade is the rise of the test-centered school.\\n\\nIn the test-centered school, regardless of what its mission or vision statement may say, test results are the guiding force.\\n\\nIn the test-centered school, there are remediation courses, but these are not remedial courses in the classic sense of trying to help students who are behind in their comprehension of content. These are test prep courses, in which students' time and attention is devoted to practicing the skills of test-taking. Perhaps the school uses a program package so that students can work independently on computers, drilling multiple choice responses to test-style questions, over and over and over and over and over, day after day after day after day after mind-numbing day, until the students have been taught that English and/or Math (because these remedial courses are never required in non-tested departments) are miserable disciplines filled with nothing but drudgery and boredom.\\n\\nThese remediation courses will have two other side effects. First, they will fill up the student's schedule, so that students who have not Done Well Enough on the test must take Remediation 101 instead of shop or art or band or accounting. These will be the students whose strengths are NOT English and Math, but they will not be able to fully pursue their strengths, but must instead spend their school day focusing on their weakness, their area of failure. If you have never spent your days being bad at something, you may not understand just how corrosive to the spirit it is.\\n\\nIf you want to get a sense of how this is, just imagine switching the classes involved. Sorry, pat, but no Junior Honors English class for you until you can finally play a decent B-flat scale on trumpet, said no school ever. Sorry, Mrs. Bagswatter, but Chris can't sign up for AP Calculus until that physical fitness test is passed in PE.\\n\\nThe other side effect will be on what the school can offer. Your English and Math teachers will have to make room in their schedule for Test Prep 101, which means that they don't have time to teach any elective courses.\\n\\nIn fact, running a test-centered school system doesn't just affect how time in school is used, but how the school is actually structured. Middle schools in particular may feel the push in test-centered districts (though I had a hard time finding current research about middle school structure trends, and I've folded in anecdotal through-the-grapevine stuff here). One tradition of middle schools is for 7th and 8th grade, but that leaves the whole school ranking based on the results of eighth grade testing. So districts may feel test-based pressure to move sixth and even fifth graders under the middle school roof to help with school ratings, or shift to old school K-8 schools, sidestepping the middle school rating issue entirely.\\n\\nBottom line -- we have districts that are looking at structural changes based not on what's best for the students or even what works best with the available physical plants. They are looking at structural changes primarily based on what will have the best effect on their test-based accountability measures.\\n\\nIn a test-based school, it comes down to the test scores and accountability measures. In Pennsylvania, AP test results can count toward a school's ranking. Many states are now moving toward using SAT's as the BS Test for high school ranking. Consequently, where decisions about students taking college entrance exams might have been based on what the student needs (Will the AP credit be any use to her at her chosen school? Does he even intend to go to college?), they are now based on how the student's choice affects the school. This spring, somewhere in America, a high school principal is going to say, I don't care if the credit isn't going to be any use at Pat's school in Pat's program -- that kid's the strongest student we have in that department. You get Pat in there to take that damn AP test, whether Pat wants to or not.\\n\\nAnd that ultimately is the problem with test-centered schools; the relationship between the school and the student is turned upside down. Instead of asking, How does this help us meet the educational needs of our students, the school asks, How will this affect our test scores? In a test-centered school, the school is not there to serve the students -- the students are there to meet the needs of the school. And no -- there isn't a scintilla of evidence that test prep serves student needs, nor that test results are an important indicator of their education.\\n\\nMaybe we offer bribes. Maybe we restructure school. Maybe we drill forever. Maybe we make it clear that we will accept no excuses. It doesn't matter. The students are there to crank out the scores the school wants, and policies are measured by that metric -- will this get students to give us the scores we need from them? That's separated from the question of Does this meet the students' educational needs by a chasm so large that you could lose the entire US education system in it.\\n\\nSure, much is riding on test-driven policies these days. But at some point administrators and leaders and parents and classroom teachers have to step up and stand for the needs of the students before all else. Because if we aren't going to stand up for our students, what are we going to stand up for?\\n\\nOriginally posted at Curmudgucation"}
{"original": "President-elect Joe Biden has unveiled an economic relief plan that would deliver $1,400 to most Americans and invest in a national vaccination program — and also endorses a whole host of Democratic policy priorities from increasing the minimum wage and expanding paid leave to extending unemployment benefits.\\n\\nBiden addressed the nation on the details of the plan, called the American Rescue Plan, on Thursday night as he prepares to assume control of the federal government next week amid a still-raging pandemic throttling the country's health care system and economy. On average, the coronavirus has killed more than 3,000 Americans a day over the past week, and unemployment claims nationwide are on the rise. Nearly 1.2 million Americans applied for unemployment benefits last week, according to the latest report from the Department of Labor.\\n\\nThe $1.9 trillion plan is designed to both immediately address those crises, while also delivering on longer-term Democratic priorities.\\n\\nThere is real pain overwhelming the real economy, Biden said. It's not hard to see that we are in the middle of a once-in-several-generations economic crisis within a once-in-several-generations public health crisis.\\n\\nThe 19-page outline sprawls from taxes to health care to workplace safety, and it's not clear which of its policies will remain top priorities when negotiations begin in earnest. Some items, such as unemployment benefits, are already on the coming Capitol Hill agenda this year.\\n\\nThe plan, as currently designed, would likely need bipartisan support to pass Congress. But Democrats, who will soon have control of the Senate majority, also have a legislative maneuver called budget reconciliation available to them, which will allow them to pass certain proposals with only a simple majority.\\n\\nJIM WATSON via Getty Images We are in the middle of a once-in-several-generations economic crisis within a once-in-several-generations public health crisis, President-elect Joe Biden said.\\n\\nBiden includes $1,400 direct payments in his proposal, which added to the $600 checks sent out with the last relief package would amount to the $2,000 he vowed to get out to Americans.\\n\\nIn its last COVID-19 relief bill, Congress extended federal unemployment benefits for gig workers and the long-term jobless only until April. Biden's plan would extend benefits through September, and also boost the $300 per week federal supplement to $400.\\n\\nThat's a more modest increase than top congressional Democrats are currently demanding. Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), who will be the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee once Democrats take control of the Senate, and was instrumental in writing the original $600 unemployment insurance program in March, said he intends on pushing a return to that original benefit.\\n\\nThe new jobless claims are going to be especially important to Senate Democrats and it will really strengthen our case, Wyden said Thursday morning, citing new numbers released Thursday showing 18 million Americans claiming unemployment aid. The original four-month law actually reduced the poverty rate.\\n\\nTom Williams via Getty Images Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), right, and Sen. Ron Wyden, (D-Ore.), will be instrumental to negotiations on this COVID-19 relief and economic recovery package.\\n\\nThe unemployment provisions, along with the direct payments, have gotten some pushback from left-leaning lawmakers, who had understood Biden's promise of $2,000 to be on top of the existing $600 Congress approved last month, not including them.\\n\\n″$2,000 means $2,000. $2,000 does not mean $1,400, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) told The Washington Post, additionally tweeting that she hoped the unemployment benefit would be retroactive to when the original program lapsed over the summer.\\n\\nSen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who will soon be the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee and was among the most vocal champions of the $2,000 checks, was more direct in his praise.\\n\\nPresident-elect Biden has put forth a very strong first installment of an emergency relief plan that will begin to provide desperately needed assistance to tens of millions of working families facing economic hardship during the pandemic, Sanders said in the statement.\\n\\nThe plan also appears to omit a proposal favored by Wyden and many Democrats to tie benefits to the unemployment rate instead of setting an arbitrary cut-off deadline. Biden supports the idea and it's mentioned as a possibility after the September cut-off, but a senior official said he is not prioritizing economic triggers for jobless benefits in the administration's first proposal.\\n\\nIn a statement after the proposal's release, Wyden said he looked forward to taking the lead on the proposal while reiterating his support for increasing the jobless benefit and making the program more responsive to the economy.\\n\\nA core pillar of Biden's proposal is boosting vaccination, through what he's calling a national vaccination program that will provide states and local governments with extra funding, above and beyond what last year's COVID-19 relief bill offered. Biden has said his goal is to administer 100 million doses in the first 100 days of his administration ― a pace that is higher than current levels, but still a lot lower than what is likely necessary to achieve herd immunity by summer.\\n\\nThe Biden plan also calls for the federal government to launch community vaccination centers around the country and deploy mobile vaccination clinics to hard-to-reach areas, although the transition team has not specified whether the federal government will be creating and running those centers directly or whether it will simply be providing support to state and local governments, many of which have already launched some efforts along those lines.\\n\\nAlso in the rescue proposal: A call to hire 100,000 public health workers, both to combat the pandemic and create jobs, as well as funding for schools to test and prepare classrooms for a return to in-person learning.\\n\\nBiden plans to deliver remarks on Friday outlining his plan to speed up the vaccine rollout in more detail.\\n\\nThe vaccine rollout in the United States has been a dismal failure thus far, he said.\\n\\nMuch of Biden's opening bid is an expansion of assistance already on the books and some new revenue streams for struggling public works. It includes an additional $30 billion in rental and utilities assistance, $5 billion for housing those at risk of homelessness, extensions of the eviction moratorium and the increased nutrition benefit, more than $150 billion in funding for schools and funding for struggling public transit systems, among other programs.\\n\\nThe incoming administration also wants to pass a slew of changes to low-income tax credits that Democrats have sought in recent years, including an increase in refunds for parents from the child tax credit and a boost to the earned income tax credit for childless adults. But Biden has apparently not embraced proposals to make the credits payable in advance, meaning the changes wouldn't benefit anyone until 2022, and would only boost refunds for one tax year.\\n\\nIf parents received tax credits in advance ― as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Ways and Means Chair Richard Neal (D-Mass.) proposed last year ― the policy would resemble the kind of child benefit that is standard in other advanced countries, and it would probably put a huge dent in child poverty.\\n\\nThe proposal's $1.9 trillion price is significantly higher than anything Republicans have been comfortable with in recent months, but Biden has repeatedly argued deficit spending is necessary to combat the pandemic's damage. The proposal does not include any tax increases or revenue raisers to offset the cost of the aid.\\n\\nThe consensus from economists from everywhere from the Fed to the IMF to other top institutions is that at this very precarious moment in the crisis, the senior Biden official said. The risk of doing too little at this moment is far greater than the risk of doing too much and therefore. The investments in this package will actually deliver real relief, prevent scarring, prevent human suffering and actually put us on a path to a stronger recovery, and a stronger and more stable fiscal position.\\n\\nThat said, Democrats do have a lot of political considerations to take into account. Many Biden officials remember the political failures of the 2009 economic relief package, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, a policy that economists maintain was economically sound, but Republicans made so politically toxic that Democrats lost control of the House just a year later.\\n\\nThat's a history that will likely define the initial negotiations as Biden comes into office with slim majorities in both chambers of Congress.\\n\\nUnity is not a pie-in-the-sky dream, it is a practical step to getting things done, said Biden, who has often insisted he will find common ground with Republicans despite skepticism from other Democrats.\\n\\nGOP lawmakers were largely silent on the plan on Thursday night — neither Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell nor House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy released a statement — but the proposal drew praise from the traditionally Republican-leaning U.S. Chamber of Commerce.\\n\\nWe applaud the President-elect's focus on vaccinations and on economic sectors and families that continue to suffer as the pandemic rages on, the group said."}
{"original": "During the partial government shutdown that started in December 2018 and became the longest in U.S. history, the fossil fuel-friendly Trump administration plowed ahead with its energy dominance agenda. As about 800,000 federal workers went without paychecks, the Interior Department worked to boost oil and gas development in the Alaskan Arctic, processed fossil fuel drilling applications and permits, and even brought back dozens of furloughed employees to ensure offshore drilling activities continued.\\n\\nNow, amid a global coronavirus pandemic that has upended daily life and slashed oil prices, Trump and his team have once again prioritized fossil fuel production.\\n\\nThe administration is considering bailing out the oil and gas industry, which has been hit hard by an overseas price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia and a drop in global demand due to the coronavirus. That relief is expected to include the Department of Energy purchasing 77 million barrels of crude oil from U.S. producers, enough to fill the nation's emergency reserve to capacity, at a cost of $2.5 billion.\\n\\nPresident Trump says he has instructed the secretary of energy to buy large quantities of crude oil for strategic reserve during the coronavirus response https://t.co/FIAmzRAAku pic.twitter.com/fopP207MiW — CBS News (@CBSNews) March 13, 2020\\n\\nThe Interior Department is also moving forward with fossil fuel lease sales, as the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management offered up a sweeping 78 million acres in the Gulf of Mexico for bidders on Wednesday despite environmental groups' calls to halt the sales during the pandemic. John Filostrat, a spokesman for the bureau, said the event was live-streamed with only a handful of BOEM workers, with bids submitted either by mail or in person at the bureau's New Orleans office.\\n\\nWednesday's auction yielded about $93 million for just shy of 400,000 acres ― the lowest total for any U.S. offshore auction since 2016, according to Reuters. Twenty-two companies participated in the sale.\\n\\nThat amounts to roughly half the previous lease sale, which took place last August, and marked the first time since region-wide sales began in 2017 that total bidding failed to surpass $100 million. It's a sign that oil prices are too low for anyone but industry behemoths to make offers, said an analyst for energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie.\\n\\nWith the recent drop in oil price, it came as no surprise that the bidding dollar amount was significantly lower, said Mfon Usoro, a senior research analyst covering the Gulf of Mexico for Wood Mackenzie. We think more lease sales are still in the cards, but higher oil prices will be required for bid amounts to climb back to historical norms.\\n\\nIndeed, the sale came the same day the price of oil plummeted to its lowest level in 18 years, with West Texas Intermediate, the primary U.S. benchmark for crude, falling to $22.90 per barrel on Wednesday, a 15% plunge and the cheapest price since 2002. Brent crude, the global gauge for oil prices, dropped 9% to $26.16 per barrel. At those prices, it's nearly impossible for many U.S. fracking companies, responsible for the majority of the country's oil production, according to the Energy Information Administration, to pay back steep debts, prompting the Trump administration to consider measures to bail out drillers.\\n\\nBut analysts told HuffPost last week to expect a wave of bankruptcies of smaller producers that could lead to consolidation within the industry as oil majors, the companies that almost exclusively had the capital to bid in Wednesday's auction, buy up troubled rivals.\\n\\nDAVID MCNEW via Getty Images Pump jacks draw crude oil from the Long Beach Oil Field near Signal Hill, California.\\n\\nPlunging prices and mergers aren't the only things that could cost big oil companies in the near term. Almost immediately after Wednesday's auction took place, the legal challenges began. Earthjustice filed a lawsuit Wednesday on behalf of several environmental groups asking a federal judge to block the Gulf of Mexico lease sale on the grounds that it violated the law by failing to fully analyze the risks new drilling posed to the public. Brettny Hardy, an attorney for Earthjustice, called it the latest example of the administration putting profits before the health and safety of people and the planet.\\n\\nOnshore, the Bureau of Land Management is scheduled to hold oil and gas auctions this month in Montana, Colorado, Wyoming and Nevada.\\n\\nMost of BLM's oil and gas lease sales are run entirely via an online platform (only Alaska does in-person sales, and those are not scheduled until November), so no postponement is planned at this time, BLM spokesman Greg Fuhs told E&E News on Tuesday.\\n\\nKate Kelly, public lands director at the left-leaning Center for American Progress, was among those who expressed outrage over the administration's actions. It's both tone-deaf and fleecing taxpayers to be holding lease sales during a public health crisis, she told HuffPost.\\n\\nThe Coalition to Protect America's National Parks, an organization representing current and former parks employees, also called on the Department of the Interior to halt oil and gas auctions, as well as public comment periods and major policy proposals.\\n\\nThere are huge implications and consequences surrounding proposed policy changes and lease sales, Phil Francis, the coalition's chair, said in a statement. These actions should be given full and deliberate consideration, not rushed through at a time when we should be focused on the health and safety of the American people.\\n\\nThe Interior Department did not immediately respond to HuffPost's question about whether oil and gas operations have been identified as mission critical services. But in an email statement, an agency spokesperson said that the health and safety of the public and our employees is our highest priority.\\n\\nAll DOI actions, including lease sales, are being evaluated on a case-by-case basis and adjustments are being made to ensure we are allowing for proper public input, while protecting the health and safety of the public and our employees, the statement said."}

The day of the October attack, Paddock had a room service delivery and a housekeeping call, the hotel said.\\n\\nIt wasn't clear, however, if anyone entered Paddock's room that day, or, if they did, what they saw.\\n\\nThe revelation was made by a hotel representative responding to questions from the Las Vegas Review-Journal concerning reports that Paddock had hung a do not disturb sign on his door for three days as he prepared for his massacre. The hotel has come under fire for apparently failing to check on a guest who turned out to be a mass killer.\\n\\nPaddock, 64, fired more than 1,100 rounds of ammunition on concertgoers at the Route 91 Harvest Festival from the broken window of his 32nd-floor corner suite at Mandalay Bay on Oct. 1. He then killed himself. He had an additional 4,000 rounds in his room along with an arsenal of weapons.

The spokesperson said the do-not-disturb policy had not changed.\\n\\nAll MGM Resorts properties follow a health and welfare check operating procedure that stipulates a welfare check be performed after two consecutive days where a do not disturb sign has been displayed on the door and the guest has not interacted in person or by phone with housekeeping or other hotel staff over the same period, the representative said in a statement, Fox TV reported. Our staff reserves the right to enter the room if it is deemed appropriate to conduct a welfare check.\\n\\nAfter criticism that Mandalay Bay apparently did not check on Paddock's room for a period of time, Disney World resorts changed its do not disturb sign to a room occupied sign and said rooms would be checked by staff at least once a day.

{"original": "The 116th Congress is the most diverse in history, with incoming members expanding political representation on a number of fronts. For the first time, Congress now includes Muslim women, Native American women, an openly bisexual senator and the youngest woman ever elected to serve in either chamber.\\n\\nYet despite that progress, Congress is once again beginning a new session without a single member who openly identifies as atheist, according to a Pew Research Center analysis of the latest CQ Roll Call Faith on the Hill survey.\\n\\nThe questionnaire identified only one representative ― Sen. Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.) ― who says she is religiously unaffiliated. Sinema, who has taken issue with the atheist label in the past, has been the only openly unaffiliated member of Congress since she was elected to the U.S. House in 2012. (She's also the first openly bisexual member of the U.S. Senate).\\n\\nAn additional 18 members of the 116th Congress responded don't know or didn't list a religious faith on the latest questionnaire.\\n\\nThe survey underscores a longstanding lack of political representation among the growing ranks of Americans who say they don't believe in God, are questioning the existence of a higher power, or simply don't subscribe to traditional organized religion.\\n\\nNearly one-quarter of U.S. adults now consider themselves to be religiously unaffiliated, compared to just 0.2 percent of Congress, or 1 in 535 members, according to Pew. Meanwhile, more than 88 percent of Congress identifies as Christian ― including all but two Republicans, both of whom are Jewish ― compared to just 71 percent of the U.S. public. Overall, the 116th Congress is slightly more religiously diverse than the prior Congress, according to Pew.\\n\\nThis gap in representation has persisted as atheists, nontheists, agnostics and other so-called religious nones continue to battle for public acceptance following decades of social and political prejudice toward their views.\\n\\nALEX EDELMAN via Getty Images Sen. Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.) participates in a ceremonial swearing-in on January 3, 2019. Rather than use a traditional Bible, she placed her hand on a book from the Library of Congress that contains the texts of the Arizona and U.S. constitutions, a spokesperson said.\\n\\nThe simplest definition of an atheist is a person who doesn't believe in the existence of gods. Ten percent of Americans say they fit that description, according to a 2018 Pew survey. In the current political climate, however, the word atheist can be more controversial, often used to hint that someone lacks a moral center or is openly hostile to organized religion.\\n\\nAmid that cultural backdrop, there have been no open atheists in Congress since 2012, when then-Rep. Pete Stark (D-Calif.) lost his seat to a challenger. Stark had already been in Congress for over three decades when he publicly acknowledged his nonbeliever status in 2007. Former Rep. Barney Frank (D-Mass.) also waited until after he'd retired to announce that he doesn't believe in God. No candidate has ever entered Congress as an avowed atheist.\\n\\nThe absence of openly atheist representation in the highest ranks of government presents a problem for the religiously unaffiliated, said Roy Speckhardt, executive director of the American Humanist Association (AHA), a nonprofit that promotes the philosophy that people can be good without a god.\\n\\nIt's critically important to see ourselves reflected in those who represent us, said Speckhardt. When that isn't the case, it's very much like a billboard for minorities who are underrepresented, whoever they are.\\n\\nBut Speckhardt also called into question the accuracy of the latest Faith on the Hill survey. He noted that Rep. Jared Huffman (D-Calif.) has publicly questioned the existence of God and said he embraces the humanist label, which holds that one can lead meaningful, ethical lives capable of adding to the greater good of humanity without theism or other supernatural beliefs, according to the AHA. Rep.

Jared Huffman (D-Calif.) has publicly questioned the existence of God and said he embraces the humanist label, but in a recent survey, he responded don't know or otherwise refused to list a religious faith.\\n\\nWhatever terms congressional representatives choose to identify their religious beliefs, it's clear that the stigma against atheism and lack of religious affiliation in politics is beginning to erode, said Speckhardt.\\n\\nIn 2018, Huffman and Raskin were among the founding members of the Congressional Freethought Caucus. The group's mission, the founders wrote, is to promote sound public policy based on reason, science, and moral values, protect the secular character of our government, and champion the value of freedom of thought worldwide.\\n\\nIn the years ahead, Speckhardt said he hopes Congress will make progress on initiatives of particular importance to nonbelievers, including measures to preserve the separation of church and state and protect the rights of nontheists abroad.\\n\\nThere will be no openly atheist torchbearer helping to lead that charge, at least for now. But it's only a matter of time before that changes, said Speckhardt.\\n\\nA recent poll commissioned by the AHA suggested that in safely blue districts, a candidate's atheism is a nonissue, or even a plus, for a large portion of the electorate.\\n\\nWith some members of Congress likely identifying as religious only to avoid the potential negative repercussions of saying they don't believe in God, the nonbeliever community must show that it will have the back of any politician who publicly embraces the atheist mantle, said Speckhardt.\\n\\n[We have] to point out to them that we would much more appreciate their openness about their deeply held convictions, versus hiding them or lying about them, he said.

{"original": "Sean Kilpatrick/THE CANADIAN PRESS Conservative MP Michelle Rempel Garner speaks in Ottawa on May 7, 2019.\\n\\nCanada is in crisis.\\n\\nSo begins the Buffalo Declaration, a document released by Conservative Calgary Nose Hill MP Michelle Rempel Garner Thursday. The declaration is co-signed by three other Alberta Tories, and demands equality for the province under the constitution.\\n\\nBesides now getting to use the excellent pun of referring to these MPs as the Buffalo wing of the Conservative Party — and developing a hankering for blue cheese dressing along the way — this document reignited debate about Western alienation, conversations that followed last fall's election after the ruling Liberals didn't win a single seat in Alberta or Saskatchewan.\\n\\nIt's also sparked a wave of critiques from Albertans and other people across Canada, arguing that the alienated Westerners don't represent their views and legitimize dangerous separatist sentiments.\\n\\nWATCH: Alberta premier reacts to letter calling for Ottawa to deny Teck project. Story continues below.\\n\\nBut what is this document and how seriously should you take it?\\n\\nHere are some answers to your Buffalo Declaration questions.\\n\\nWhat is the Buffalo Declaration?\\n\\nThe Buffalo Declaration is a 13-page document and accompanying webpage released on Feb. 20 signed by four Conservative members of Parliament. It outlines concerns about Alberta's role in the federal government and what the signees call a push for equality for the province. The authors definition of equality has a number of different pillars, from repealing carbon taxes to changing the size of Parliament.\\n\\nThe declaration outlines the challenges faced by Alberta and possible solutions. It contends that Alberta is physically and economically isolated from Canada's power structures.\\n\\nIt's structurally quite similar to the 2001 Firewall Letter, written by future-prime minister Stephen Harper and other prominent Albertans to then-premier Ralph Klein urging him to to fully exercise Alberta's constitutional powers by creating a provincial police force and withdrawing from the Canada Pension Plan.\\n\\nThe Buffalo Declaration, however, is targeted at Justin Trudeau's federal government rather than the provincial one. In fact, it is quite sympathetic to Jason Kenney's UCP government in Alberta and how it's handled separatist sentiment.\\n\\nWe support Premier Jason Kenney's initial efforts in this regard, as his government's Fair Deal panel explores the creation of a provincial revenue agency, withdrawing from the Canada Pension Plan, establishing a provincial police force, and other measures, the report reads. But we must go further. Much further.\\n\\nWe must go further. Much further - The Buffalo Declaration\\n\\nThe much further in question seems to be demanding things that would require a rewriting of the constitution, such as shifting resource projects to be under the control of the provinces and rewriting equalization payments. As well, the document calls for repealing policies such as the carbon tax and enforcing rule of law on energy project protests.\\n\\nIt even asks for Trudeau to recognize Alberta as culturally distinct from the rest of Canada.\\n\\nThere's a lot going on there.\\n\\nThe document's proposing over a dozen structural and policy changes to how Canada works. Many would require referenda, and most would require the support of the federal Conservative party before pushing Trudeau on them.\\n\\nAnd that brings up that this document, notably, is targeted at the upcoming Conservative leadership race.\\n\\nStory continues after video.\\n\\nAny leadership contestant for the Conservative Party of Canada who seeks the support of Albertans should be prepared to address this declaration, the document reads.\\n\\nNotably, Rempel Garner — who's leading the charge on the declaration — has expressed interest in a run for federal party leadership in the past, but has not formally declared anything for the current race.\\n\\nWho is behind it?\\n\\nAlberta currently has 33 Conservative MPs in the House of Commons, but only four have signed this document.\\n\\nRempel Garner is leading the charge on the declaration, but it is also co-signed by Banff-Airdrie MP Blake Richards, Medicine Hat-Cardston-Warner MP Glen Motz and Peace River-Westlock MP Arnold Viersen.\\n\\nAlbertans are questioning if confederation is broken. They feel disconnected from, and disrespected by, the rest of Canada, Richards wrote in a Facebook post.\\n\\nAlberta is not, and never has been, an equal partner in Confederation.

And yes, bison are different than buffalo. Scientifically speaking, buffalo actually refers to animals like water buffalo in Africa. Bison refers to the big brown woolly folks the Buffalo Declaration used as their logo.\\n\\nPlains bison were almost wiped out entirely in the late 1800s by over hunting, largely the result of colonial settlers on the prairies. Bison populations had remained steady for thousands of years previously and were incredibly important to Indigenous communities.\\n\\nThey have made a comeback in recent times. 2018 was the first time bison roamed freely in Alberta in 140 years.\\n\\nMany critics of the manifesto immediately pointed to the irony of using Buffalo in its name.\\n\\nIt takes one hell of a lot of nerve to name the #BuffaloDeclaration after an animal sacred to First Nations, when most of their complaints stem from how Canada keeps stopping them from rampantly screwing over Aboriginal populations, and destroying the land. #abpoli #cdnpoli — Jeff Rybak🍁 (@JeffRybak) February 21, 2020\\n\\nHow dare a bunch of white settlers invoke the buffalo that their ancestors deliberately genocided to deprive Indigenous ppls of self-sufficiency, as a declaration of a need to separate.

The issues and concerns outlined are very similar to those put forward by the folks behind Wexit, aka the separatist movement.\\n\\nThose folks want Alberta — and sometimes other Western provinces — to leave Canada to a certain degree. Some want to form a new country, others propose joining the United States while others just want Alberta to start governing more of itself a la Quebec.\\n\\nSeparatists have been specifically dismayed about equalization payments, where federal funds are transferred between wealthy and less wealthy provinces to help ensure reasonably comparable health care, education and welfare in all regions. Opponents of equalization say Alberta pays an unfairly large share, and argue that it should be allowed to keep all of its oil revenue.\\n\\nOn this, the Buffalo Declaration and Wexit agree.

{"original": "ILLUSTRATED BY LOUISA CANNELL.\\n\\nEngagement rings may no longer be required to cost three months' worth of income, but they are still pretty expensive. It might be the last thing on your mind when you got engaged, but just like any other forms of valuables, financial protection is called for in case something bad happens to it.\\n\\nPeople often make the mistake in thinking that an engagement ring is automatically insured under a homeowners policy, says Jerry Ehrenwald, president and CEO of the International Gemological Institute. However, many policies only provide limited coverage, which could leave you footing the bill — or a big chunk of it — if you need to replace an expensive item. Every couple should consider a insurance policy appropriate for their ring. Read on for all the essential tips you need to know to get started.\\n\\nPick A Provider\\n\\nDetermine the type of coverage you actually need: Most homeowners policy will only cover a maximum of $1,000 to $2,500 for personal jewelry, which might work if your ring cost was on the lower end of the spectrum. However, if your ring had a much higher value than that, the smart thing to do is to get an extension — also known as a rider — that specifically provides coverage for your ring. Give your home insurance provider a call to figure out the personal property limit, and the type of rider available to you.\\n\\nGet An Appraisal\\n\\nA receipt for your ring is required by the insurance provider, and you'll also need to get a jewelry appraisal to determine the real value of your ring. Check your insurance company's guidelines to make sure that the type of appraisal you're paying for fits the requirements. The American Gem Society has an online directory for the appraisers in your area. Expect to fork over $50 to $100 an hour for this service, based on an estimate listed on Jewelers Mutual.\\n\\nHow Much It Costs\\n\\nEngagement ring insurance plans work on an annual basis, and according to Investopedia, you'll be paying $1 to $2 for every $100 the ring is worth. The number fluctuates according to where you're based: You'll be expected to pay more for your coverage for places with higher theft rates.\\n\\nRead The Fine Print\\n\\nAs with all insurance policies, it's important to read the policies thoroughly and evaluate whether they fit your specific needs. Some riders will cover accidental loss, while others won't account for other damage beyond theft or loss. Another important answer to get on paper: What counts as sufficient proof that your ring is gone and will need to be replaced. If you want a more tailored plan for your piece of bling, consider going to a company that specialize in jewelry insurance, such as GemSafe."}
{"original": "Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii) told CNN on Friday that she definitely will seek the 2020 Democratic nomination for president, ending months of speculation.\\n\\nHer bid makes sense on its face: Democrats swept the 2018 midterm elections with a crop of young candidates like Gabbard, many of them with public service backgrounds and from historically underrepresented communities. (She is a military veteran and was the first Hindu member of Congress.) Much of the party also associates her with the ongoing revolt against its establishment. In 2016, she surrendered a plum Democratic National Committee post so she could endorse Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and argue top Democrats were unfairly helping former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton secure the party's presidential nomination.\\n\\nProgressives are already welcoming the news: Let them make their case and we'll find out who has the most compelling narrative, commentator Cenk Uygur said of Gabbard's taking on left favorites Sanders and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), whose 2020 plans are already in motion.\\n\\nBut the mythos linking the congresswoman to the party's rising left wing collapses over the critical question of how to handle the world beyond America's shores. Like Sanders and Warren, Gabbard is acutely attuned to the left's frustration with endless wars. What she's offering, however, is a fatalist view starkly different from the optimistic global vision of progress they've been pushing into the national conversation.\\n\\nOn domestic matters, Gabbard is in line with her counterparts: She supports a $15 minimum wage and single-payer health care, and she says Democrats need to do more to resist money from corporations and billionaires. Yet on foreign policy, she's gone rogue, tying the anti-intervention rhetoric adopted by nearly every Democrat (and Republicans like President Donald Trump) to embracing global leaders who flout international human rights standards and complain of persecution by American empire.\\n\\nGabbard's language is that of the old left, holding up the U.S. government as obsessed with unwisely projecting its influence, often for the sake of monied interests ― and, she asserts, in secretive risky ways ― while neglecting its own people at home. It's a mode that echoes the kind of anti-elite talk that Trump built his campaign around while he lied about his past position on the invasion of Iraq. (Why have politicians of both parties gotten Americans trapped in these far-away places?)\\n\\nAnd it connects seamlessly to another Trump-style view: a deep skepticism of foreigners, particularly Muslims. Gabbard has voted to make it harder for refugees from Iraq and Syria to enter the U.S., courted Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, despite his links to anti-Muslim violence that killed hundreds, and spent years as a Fox News darling for her willingness to claim President Barack Obama was making Americans less safe by supporting Arab rebels in Syria and not using the phrase radical Islam. (Obama aides and many experts warn that language risks implying a problem inherent in a religion followed by 1.6 billion people; Gabbard and Trump argue the language is essential to explain the rise of groups like the Islamic State.)\\n\\nWhat Sanders and Warren have tried to do, notably in a series of recent speeches, is offer a vision of a new left that addresses voters' deep skepticism of U.S. adventurism abroad without veering toward the idea that the world can't be fixed and that's just not Americans' problem. They're rejecting too the old-school internationalism associated with Clinton and many Republicans — the idea that U.S.-led diplomacy combined with smart limited use of force is the key to world order. They have challenged the notion that it's essential to appear tough in the face of traditional adversaries like Russia for the sake of American global standing. Instead, they're talking about multilateral efforts to improve the lives of U.S. citizens as well as people abroad.\\n\\nThe Sanders/Warren narrative seeks to unite a global left against a status quo in which oligarchs with disproportionate political power are tied to the national security state and brutal military missteps — both in the U.S. and in rivals like Russia and China. In that view, challenging the status quo of American foreign policy doesn't mean prioritizing dialogue with anyone no matter their track record, as Gabbard did with brutal Syrian dictator Bashar Assad ― it means reconsidering relationships with entire societies and trying to address their concerns in just ways, whether under anti-American regimes like Assad's or U.S. partners like Saudi Arabia.\\n\\nThe fight is going on on the left of the party, and you have the two better-established candidates from the left of the party trying to define a new kind of internationalism, said Heather Hurlburt of the New America think tank.\\n\\nGabbard's views are more a left hard-realist direction, she added, referring to a school of national security thought that suggests it's a waste of time for the U.S. and others to try to prioritize principles like inalienable human rights in global affairs.\\n\\nThe fight is going on on the left of the party, and you have the two better-established candidates from the left of the party trying to define a new kind of internationalism. Gabbard's views are more a left hard-realist direction. Heather Hurlburt of the New America think tank\\n\\nTo Hurlburt, a longtime follower of the debate over how Democrats should talk about foreign policy, it's difficult to see who Gabbard will appeal to.\\n\\nThere's a mass feeling across the public… that Trump has walked away from what are perceived as American values, and that's gotten a huge reception both from people who were organized and active in politics and people who weren't, Hurlburt said. She sees Sanders and Warren seeking to wed that concern to the issue they are best known for highlighting domestically, economic inequality.\\n\\nAs the race takes shape, Gabbard's rivals ― of whom there are likely to be many ― will know they can make political hay of her controversial views and over episodes like her visit to Assad amid his devastating campaign against his own people.\\n\\nWhat's unclear is how those politically close to her will handle what will be an internecine battle. Gabbard has developed deep roots in the party's left wing, working with the Sanders Institute, founded by the senator's wife, Jane Sanders, and frequently posturing as the Democrats' leading antiwar voice when more mainstream members of the party succumb to militarism the party's base dislikes, as when they endorsed Trump's strike against Assad in 2017.\\n\\nThe quiet hope among backers of Sanders and Warren so far is that her campaign will ultimately fizzle out before things have to get ugly.\\n\\nBut that's far from assured, given that many of Gabbard's supporters ― particularly in parts of the peace movement ― are fervent and have been hoping for this kind of announcement by her for years.\\n\\nThe left realists are present in a lot of places and are able to be spoilers quite effectively, Hurlburt said. Though their numbers are vanishingly small, they're loud and articulate, and they have a critique that can be very resonant when you look at some of the disasters going on around us.\\n\\nHow the contest evolves will determine how serious that fight gets ― and for now, it hasn't even officially begun.\\n\\nThere's no incentive for anyone to make any point out of attacking Gabbard loudly and publicly unless she starts to get some traction, Hurlburt said.\\n\\nCORRECTION: An earlier version of this story misidentified Gabbard's role at the Sanders Institute."}
{"original": "Stefani Reynolds via Getty Images David Frederick would run the office that represents the United States before the Supreme Court if he became Joe Biden's solicitor general.\\n\\nOn the campaign trail in 2019, Joe Biden said that fossil fuel executives should be held liable for climate change and those who refuse to take responsibility should be jailed. We should be able to sue oil and gas companies just like we did the drug companies, just like we did with the tobacco companies, he said in a February debate. And on his campaign website, Biden pledged to strategically support ongoing plaintiff-driven climate litigation against polluters.\\n\\nNow just weeks away from inauguration, the president-elect is considering a corporate lawyer who has defended Royal Dutch Shell against climate liability lawsuits to serve as solicitor general, the administration's top legal advocate who argues cases before the U.S. Supreme Court, according to two sources with knowledge of the process.\\n\\nDavid Frederick, a partner at the Washington, D.C.-based law firm Kellogg, Hansen, Todd, Figel & Frederick, is considered a serious enough candidate for solicitor general that the group Demand Justice singled him out as someone it would oppose in a public letter last month.\\n\\nFrederick served as a Clinton-era assistant to the solicitor general from 1996 to 2001 and appeared on the Obama administration's short list for the top job in 2008.\\n\\nThe Biden transition team, which is expected to announce its Justice Department picks sometime after Tuesday's closely watched Senate runoff elections in Georgia, did not respond to questions about Frederick's candidacy.\\n\\nThroughout his lengthy legal career, Frederick, 59, has notched notable progressive victories at the nation's highest court, winning decisions in favor of Tyson Foods workers whose wages the meatpacking giant stiffed, against tobacco companies advertising light cigarettes as safer, and against a gas facility that British oil giant BP tried to build in Delaware waters.\\n\\nBut some progressive advocates say Frederick's recent work defending Shell, in which he's argued that lawsuits trying to hold oil companies liable for climate change have no legal grounds, should be disqualifying.\\n\\nKellogg, Hansen, Todd, Figel & Frederick, PLLC Frederick, pictured here in his law firm website photo, is a widely known Democratic litigator who has already argued more than 50 cases before the Supreme Court.\\n\\nSurely they can find an accomplished lawyer in this country that hasn't made millions going to bat for the fossil fuel industry, said Jesse Bragg, the media director at the Boston-based anti-corruption group Corporate Accountability. Experience in the energy industry is not a prerequisite for solicitor general, and there are plenty of people who have extensive careers that don't include defending oil companies.\\n\\nReached by email, Frederick directed HuffPost to his law firm. The firm declined to comment.\\n\\nThe Equivalent Of Saying 'Oh, Murder Is Not Illegal'\\n\\nA flurry of litigation against oil giants began in 2015 after Inside Climate News and the Los Angeles Times revealed that Exxon Mobil Corp. had understood the science of global warming decades before the company started promoting misinformation denying that climate reality. Three years later, the Dutch publication De Correspondent unearthed documents showing that even after Shell's own scientists warned that emissions from burning oil were trapping heat in the atmosphere, the corporation's management team chose to emphasize the scientific uncertainties of global warming.\\n\\nFive states ― Connecticut, Delaware, Massachusetts, Minnesota and Rhode Island ― and a number of cities ― including New York, Baltimore and Oakland, California ― have filed lawsuits since then, making the case that some of the biggest oil companies operating in the U.S. broke the law by hiding the reality of climate change.\\n\\nThe industry had the science 30 years ago and knew what was going to happen but made no warning so that preemptive steps could have been taken, Harold Koh, a professor of international law at Yale Law School who served as legal adviser to then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, told Inside Climate News. The taxpayers have been bearing the cost for what they should have been warned of 30 years ago. The companies are now being called to account for their conduct and the damages from that conduct.\\n\\nIn court filings in California and Rhode Island last year, Frederick argued that federal law prevents states from suing Shell and other oil companies over climate change. He contended that federal law also provides no remedies for damage due to global warming and that Shell could only face climate litigation in the Netherlands, where it is headquartered.\\n\\nIt's a very different exercise than defending a criminal defendant where the lawyer might say, 'Sure, murder should be illegal, but my client didn't do it,' said Marco Simons, general counsel at the environmental legal nonprofit EarthRights International. This is the equivalent of the lawyer starting out the case by saying, 'Oh, murder is not illegal.'\\n\\nThe pushback highlights the legal challenges in prosecuting Shell, a globe-spanning corporate empire valued at nearly $140 billion, for planetary harm on a scale that few, if any, lawmakers could have imagined when writing the environmental statutes currently on the books. Two of the biggest cases against rival Exxon Mobil, for example, take a narrower approach, arguing that the company violated state laws in New York and Massachusetts by not disclosing relevant information to investors and making deceptive advertising claims about the safety of burning fossil fuels.\\n\\nAccused Of Selling 'His Progressive Bona Fides'\\n\\nLawyers who have argued cases alongside Frederick say his record shows that he's willing to take on the oil industry.\\n\\nWhile representing the state of Delaware in the mid-2000s, he persuaded the Supreme Court to block BP's bid to build a liquefied natural gas facility in Delaware waters on the grounds that it violated state laws protecting the coastline.\\n\\nHe worked tirelessly to protect the Coastal Zone Act in Delaware, which is one of our treasured environmental laws, said Max Walton, a partner at the Wilmington, Delaware-based law firm Connolly Gallagher who argued the case with Frederick. I can't think of a human being who works harder and smarter and more fair than David Frederick.\\n\\nThe Washington Post via Getty Images President-elect Joe Biden has vowed to make climate a top priority of his administration.\\n\\nIn 2016, the Supreme Court ruled against Exxon Mobil in a case that Frederick argued on behalf of the state of New Hampshire, forcing the oil giant to pay a $236 million fine for contaminating groundwater.\\n\\nDavid Frederick is the most capable, pro-consumer Supreme Court litigator in the country, and has demonstrated his ability over more than 50 Supreme Court arguments, Todd Webster, a former chief of staff to Sen. Chris Coons (D-Del.), told Politico last month. He is literally the guy progressives turn to when their cases reach the Supreme Court, so that we win at that level.\\n\\nBut progressive critics say it's that record of winning smaller-scale victories against oil companies that made him appealing to a company like Shell.\\n\\nWhat Shell is purchasing in getting his time is a lawyer who is known to be a Democrat who had some good clients, and that provides a positive sheen to their cause, said Jeff Hauser, director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research's Revolving Door Project. Frederick is selling to Shell the fact that he is a progressive, and there ought to be consequences for his progressive bona fides when he does that.\\n\\nShell did not return a call requesting comment.\\n\\nAt Odds With The Future Vice President\\n\\nFrederick's arguments put him at odds with some of the top officials in the incoming Biden administration. Among those who signed legal briefs in favor of allowing Oakland's case against five oil giants, including Shell, to move forward in the California courts were Vice President-elect Kamala Harris; Biden's secretary of state pick, Antony Blinken; his future climate diplomat, John Kerry; his choice for climate czar, Gina McCarthy; and Xavier Becerra, the likely next secretary of health and human services.\\n\\nOther potential names reportedly under consideration for solicitor general include Sherrilyn Ifill, director of the NAACP Legal and Educational Defense Fund; David Cole, national legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union; and Barbara Underwood, New York state's solicitor general.\\n\\nThere's no lack for public interest and public service-experienced litigators, Hauser said. We don't need to rotate between Republican Big Law and Democratic Big Law.\\n\\nKevin Robillard contributed reporting."}

And extra money in millions of hands boosts spending.\\n\\nA policy that makes the rich a bit poorer will affect only a handful of people, and will barely affect their life satisfaction, since they will still be able to buy whatever they want, Krugman wrote.\\n\\nNobel economics laureate Peter Diamond — arguably the world's leading expert in public finance, according to Krugman — has calculated the optimum top tax rate at 73 percent. Several other experts back that up.\\n\\nSo Ocasio-Cortez, far from showing her craziness, is fully in line with serious economic research, Krugman added. Republican policy to keep taxes on the wealthy low, on the other hand, rests on research by … well, nobody, he added.\\n\\nKrugman's conclusion: Ocasio-Cortez definitely knows more economics than almost everyone in the GOP caucus."}
