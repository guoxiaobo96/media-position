{"original": "(CNN) The Sunrise Movement, a youth-led climate activist group, has quickly announced itself as one of the most influential progressive forces in the formative days of President-elect Joe Biden's incoming administration.\\n\\nProtesters from the activist group Sunrise Movement march down H Street outside Lafayette Square in Washington, D.C. to express their objection to President Trump's response to the election results on November 5, 2020. (Photo by Matthew Rodier/Sipa USA)(Sipa via AP Images)\\n\\nAs Biden builds out his White House senior staff and Cabinet, the climate movement has notched a series of high-profile victories, one of the few divisions of the Democratic left to successfully embed a number of its top allies -- and ideas -- into the new government's upper echelons. But the promise of today, before Biden has even taken office, will soon be met by the grinding realities of governing in divided Washington.\\n\\nBut Sunrise's young leaders say that, after two years of pitched battles across the country, they are prepared for the fights to come.\\n\\nBiden has already nominated movement favorite Deb Haaland , a Democratic congresswoman from New Mexico, to lead the Interior Department and created a high-level White House climate shop, with former Environmental Protection Agency head Gina McCarthy and former Secretary of State John Kerry in top roles. Together, with willing partners in Biden's inner circle, Sunrise and allied organizations have helped craft the structures -- at least on paper -- that could position the administration to pursue audacious goals to meaningfully combat climate change in the coming years.\\n\\nFounded in 2017, the group first scored national attention when its members arrived as uninvited guests for a sit-in at House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's office on Capitol Hill, shortly before she formally reclaimed the speakership, after the 2018 midterm. Since then, it has emerged as an activist powerhouse with growing electoral might. While they are closely allied with groups like Justice Democrats in backing progressive primary challengers, the group's most significant campaign victory came months before Biden defeated Trump in November.\\n\\nEarlier this year, the organization launched an all-out defense of Massachusetts Sen. Ed Markey, a co-author with New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of the Green New Deal resolution, against a Democratic primary challenge from Rep. Joe Kennedy III this summer. Its successful marshalling of progressive energy behind Markey, in what most viewed as an uphill fight to win renomination, underscored the potency of the group's political operation -- and projected a sense among the Washington elite of the outsiders having a growing handle on the inside game.\\n\\nMost people just see us as the agitators who are never happy, who are never really going to back anyone, who are just constantly throwing stones but not willing to go to bat for any political leader, besides maybe AOC, executive director Varshini Prakash told CNN. The Markey campaign was an opportunity to show that we are willing to back you if you back us, and that we are willing to throw down if you are willing to take the risks to your friendships, your image or whatever it is that you're worried about.\\n\\nFrom Bernie to Biden\\n\\nGetting on board with Biden, though, was a more complicated proposition -- and sell to volunteers and supporters who overwhelmingly supported Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders during the primary. Sunrise political director Evan Weber said the Biden team made the first contact, a courtesy call in June 2019, after the campaign put out the first iteration of its climate plan. But the group was all-in for Sanders and there were no further conversations, he said, until after Super Tuesday in March.\\n\\nAt that point, the primary was effectively decided. Biden was on track to be the nominee and his team launched a more aggressive courtship. Biden aide Cristobal Alex, who had made the initial call last year, reached out again -- this time to schedule a conversation with Weber and Prakash. Symone Sanders, a senior campaign adviser, and Biden policy director Stef Feldman also wanted to chat.\\n\\nThey were being very intentional, seeing the writing on the wall -- one, that they were likely going to win the primary and, two, they had a big problem with young people, young progressives, and the Bernie wing of the party, Weber said.\\n\\nWhen Sanders dropped out in April, Sunrise and other allied groups addressed an open letter that began by congratulating Biden, but mostly outlined what they viewed as his shortcomings and where he should consider shifting his positions.\\n\\nI think they were probably a little bit upset about the public letter, Weber said, but they did reach out and listen to us and really engaged us.\\n\\nStill, the extent -- and limits -- of the moderate-progressive coalition that would eventually help elect Biden was not clear until after the unity task forces commissioned by Biden and Sanders wrapped up and published their reports and recommendations. Of the six working groups, none yielded as much movement from the Biden side as the group gathered to address climate policy.\\n\\nPrakash, a Sanders pick for the climate group, emerged from the weeks of virtual meetings with cautious optimism. That Biden chose heavy-hitters -- two of them, Kerry and McCarthy, are now headed to the White House -- to represent his side had been a good sign.\\n\\nBut as Prakash said then, what followed the general election was an open question -- one that the past few weeks have only begun to answer.\\n\\nI don't think that we have seen the dreaded 180 from the Biden team, where it's that they won and then they're immediately ghosting us and not talking to us and not involving us in this process, Prakash said. They have involved us in several of the processes, taken our recommendations really seriously.\\n\\nThe selection of Haaland, who endorsed Warren in the primary, to run the Interior Department was the culmination of a campaign led by an array of progressive, Indigenous and climate groups, who helped make her case not only with Biden officials but House Democratic leadership, which ultimately blessed a pick that will, for a time, further shrink their majority.\\n\\nThe decisions to tap former Michigan Gov. Jennifer Granholm to lead the Energy Department and Michael Regan , now the secretary of the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality, to head the Environmental Protection Agency have also been met with enthusiasm. But by installing Kerry, McCarthy and Ali Zaidi as his top domestic national climate advisers, Biden has assembled a team with institutional chops and movement trust to lead his climate efforts.\\n\\nIn a statement formally introducing Biden's Climate team, his transition described the group as bold thinkers (who) know how to pull every lever of government to take on the urgent, existential threat of climate change.\\n\\nSunrise and other groups welcomed the picks, who will arrive without the private sector baggage some of Biden's other selections are carrying.\\n\\nBiden has built his team by assembling trusted hands. On the climate-oriented positions is actually where we've seen the most divergence from that, I would argue -- it's the most progressive team overall in the administration, Weber said. You've got a really visionary, bold team, who's really serious and ambitious about the task at hand and are really all advocates and public servants.\\n\\nAn education\\n\\nPrakash and her team are new to the intricacies of government-building. It feels like a ton of hearsay, just a giant rumor mill, she said, describing the closely guarded nature of the deliberations. How decisions happen and what exactly is responsible for making them happen is more opaque than I even expected.\\n\\nBoth she and Weber are in consistent contact with Biden transition officials. They have met with the EPA agency review team, among others. That on its own speaks to the unique standing the climate movement -- apart from other interests of the progressive firmament -- has established with the Biden team, including members it has harshly criticized.\\n\\nIn November, Prakash responded to the appointment of Louisiana Rep. Cedric Richmond , who accepted fossil fuel donations as a candidate, as a senior adviser and director of the White House Office of Public Engagement by calling it a betrayal. But when Richmond convened a virtual meeting with progressive movement leaders and gun violence prevention advocates last week, Sunrise was invited and took part.\\n\\nThe headlines that sprung from the group's pushback to Richmond's selection took Prakash by surprise, she said. And looking back, the 27-year-old added, maybe I wouldn't have approved using exactly that word. But the message came across. And it penetrated. A few days later, Richmond as a guest on The Breakfast Club was asked by co-host Charlamagne tha God about his ties to the oil and gas industry. He answered in part by noting his role in drafting Virginia Rep. Donald McEachin, co-founder of the House United for Climate and Environmental Justice Task Force, into Biden-Sanders climate task force, then shrugged off the suggestion that his acceptance of fossil fuel industry money influenced his legislative work.\\n\\nThe Richmond dust-up wasn't the first time Sunrise and the Biden team were at loggerheads. During the first general election debate, Biden, under a barrage from Trump, repeatedly disavowed any suggestion that he supported the Green New Deal. In public, Weber and Prakash kept their focus on Trump.\\n\\nBut after the debate, Weber called a Biden campaign aide.\\n\\nWe said, 'Hey, we know you guys have your own plan, but it's really not helpful for you to be sh*tting on the Green New Deal, Weber recalled. He prodded the campaign to stick to the language it embraced in more comfortable settings and its own website, which described the project gauzily as a useful framework for boosting the economy, fighting for environmental justice and addressing the climate crisis -- all of it baked into Biden's own Build Back Better agenda.\\n\\nBut that crossroads moment was about more than climate policy. Young voters were the foundation of the Sunrise-Biden relationship during the campaign. Biden wanted their support. Sunrise understood what it took to unlock it. The desire of Democrats to keep them energized now is what could, potentially, sustain the coalition going forward.\\n\\nWhat we wanted to make clear to them, Weber said of the post-debate conversation, was our perspective that ... just as there's a fierce right wing constituency and it's animated against the Green New Deal, there's an even bigger constituency of young people for whom the Green New Deal is something that they are dedicating their lives to realizing and making possible.\\n\\nBy shoving it aside on such a big stage, Weber believed, Biden had, in effect, telegraphed to young voters that he did not take the issue -- one they prized above all others -- seriously.\\n\\nBiden's rhetoric mostly stayed the same. He spent parts of the final few weeks of the campaign insisting that he had never supported, or even hinted, that he wanted to ban fracking. But on the ground, the campaign targeted young voters with information about its climate plan.\\n\\nOne foot in, one foot out\\n\\nSunrise leaders, along with other progressives who have established relationships with Biden's inner circle, have praised his close aides for keeping a thick skin. The Richmond episode didn't shut the door on communications. Other criticism of his picks has been largely brushed off -- a departure from the Obama administration, which had the reputation of taking less kindly to sharp, public pushback.\\n\\nPrakash never lobbied the Obama team -- she was in her teens during the last Democratic transition -- but said she has heard from older allies that the attitude of (Biden chief of staff) Ron Klain vs. (Obama chief of staff) Rahm Emanuel is night and day.\\n\\nWhen Prakash praised Kerry's selection as international climate envoy in a tweet, but added that she was keeping her eyes peeled for a domestic equivalent, Klain responded, retweeting her and adding: Stay tuned!! A few weeks later, Biden rolled out McCarthy and Zaidi.\\n\\nStill, there are conflicts up ahead.\\n\\nSunrise is trying to pull off a balancing act, of keeping one foot inside the halls of power and another with its activist ranks on the streets, that grassroots organizations often tout but rarely accomplish.\\n\\nIt's an uncomfortable position. It's really weird and personally difficult, Prakash said. But it is absolutely possible and, I think, absolutely necessary to have both of them.\\n\\nThe first clash could come in the opening days and weeks of the Biden presidency, when the administration and Democrats in Congress craft and begin negotiations with Republicans on what he has promised will be a transformative stimulus bill. This summer, Prakash told CNN she believed that if the first leg of this is a massive infrastructure and jobs plan to reboot the economy and climate isn't a central pillar of that, we're totally screwed.\\n\\nAsked last week if she still believed this coming legislation could be the climate movement's first and last best shot to secure the level of green investment activists believe is necessary to alter the trajectory of the crisis.\\n\\nThe answer, Prakash said, was complicated.\\n\\nThe uncertainty surrounding control of the Senate, where Democrats need to sweep a pair of runoff elections next week to win a majority, had created additional murkiness around Sunrise's plan of action. The details of the stimulus bill will be important, she said, but we can't bank on Congress to legislate and have that be the be-all-end-all for climate policy in 2021 or in the Biden administration.\\n\\nBiden's willingness to exert his authority and the administration's commitment to pushing all the levers of power could end up being decisive.\\n\\nThere is a ton that Biden can do. And as we've seen, movements are behind him in utilizing the full power of the executive branch, Prakash said. It is a by any means necessary kind of approach."}

CNN.com and Facebook are partnering up, allowing you to participate in the conversation as you watch online at CNN.com/live. Prime-time coverage with the best political team on television continues.\\n\\n(CNN) -- President Obama delivered his State of the Union address to Congress on Wednesday night. Here is a transcript of the speech.\\n\\nObama: Madam Speaker, Vice President Biden, members of Congress, distinguished guests, and fellow Americans, our Constitution declares that from time to time the president shall give to Congress information about the state of our union. For 220 years, our leaders have fulfilled this duty. They've done so during periods of prosperity and tranquility, and they've done so in the midst of war and depression, at moments of great strife and great struggle.\\n\\nIt's tempting to look back on these moments and assume that our progress was inevitable, that America was always destined to succeed.\\n\\nBut when the Union was turned back at Bull Run and the Allies first landed at Omaha Beach, victory was very much in doubt. When the market crashed on Black Tuesday and civil rights marchers were beaten on Bloody Sunday, the future was anything but certain.\\n\\nThese were the times that tested the courage of our convictions and the strength of our union. And despite all our divisions and disagreements, our hesitations and our fears, America prevailed because we chose to move forward as one nation, as one people.\\n\\nAgain, we are tested. And again, we must answer history's call.\\n\\nOne year ago, I took office amid two wars, an economy rocked by a severe recession, a financial system on the verge of collapse, and a government deeply in debt. Experts from across the political spectrum warned that if we did not act, we might face a second depression.\\n\\nSo we acted, immediately and aggressively. And one year later, the worst of the storm has passed.\\n\\nBut the devastation remains: One in 10 Americans still can't find work. Many businesses have shuttered. Home values have declined. Small towns and rural communities have been hit especially hard. And for those who'd already known poverty, life has become that much harder.\\n\\nThis recession has also compounded the burdens that America's families have been dealing with for decades, the burden of working harder and longer for less, of being unable to save enough to retire or help kids with college.\\n\\nSo I know the anxieties that are out there right now. They're not new. These struggles are the reason I ran for president. These struggles are what I've witnessed for years in places like Elkhart, Indiana, Galesburg, Illinois.\\n\\nI hear about them in the letters that I read each night. The toughest to read are those written by children, asking why they have to move from their home, asking when their mom or dad will be able to go back to work.\\n\\nFor these Americans and so many others, change has not come fast enough. Some are frustrated; some are angry. They don't understand why it seems like bad behavior on Wall Street is rewarded, but hard work on Main Street isn't, or why Washington has been unable or unwilling to solve any of our problems.\\n\\nThey're tired of the partisanship and the shouting and the pettiness. They know we can't afford it, not now.\\n\\nSo we face big and difficult challenges. And what the American people hope -- what they deserve -- is for all of us, Democrats and Republicans, to work through our differences, to overcome the numbing weight of our politics, for while the people who sent us here have different backgrounds, different stories, different beliefs, the anxieties they face are the same, the aspirations they hold are shared: a job that pays the bills, a chance to get ahead, most of all, the ability to give their children a better life.\\n\\nYou know what else they share? They share a stubborn resilience in the face of adversity. After one of the most difficult years in our history, they remain busy building cars and teaching kids, starting businesses and going back to school. They're coaching Little League and helping their neighbors.\\n\\nOne woman wrote to me and said, We are strained but hopeful, struggling but encouraged.\\n\\nIt's because of this spirit -- this great decency and great strength -- that I have never been more hopeful about America's future than I am tonight.\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\nDespite -- despite our hardships, our union is strong. We do not give up. We do not quit. We do not allow fear or division to break our spirit. In this new decade, it's time the American people get a government that matches their decency, that embodies their strength.\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\nAnd tonight -- tonight, I'd like to talk about how together we can deliver on that promise.\\n\\nIt begins with our economy.\\n\\nOur most urgent -- our most urgent task upon taking office was to shore up the same banks that helped cause this crisis. It was not easy to do. And if there's one thing that has unified Democrats and Republicans -- and everybody in between -- it's that we all hated the bank bailout. I hated it.\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\nI hated it. I hated it. You hated it. It was about as popular as a root canal.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nBut when I ran for president, I promised I wouldn't just do what was popular, I would do what was necessary. And if we had allowed the meltdown of the financial system, unemployment might be double what it is today. More businesses would certainly have closed; more homes would have surely been lost.\\n\\nSo I supported the last administration's efforts to create the financial rescue program. And when we took that program over, we made it more transparent and more accountable. And as a result, the markets are now stabilized, and we've recovered most of the money we spent on the banks.\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\nMost, but not all. To recover the rest, I've proposed a fee on the biggest banks. Now...\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\nNow, I know Wall Street isn't keen on this idea, but if these firms can afford to hand out big bonuses again, they can afford a modest fee to pay back the taxpayers who rescued them in their time of need.\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\nNow, as we stabilized the financial system, we also took steps to get our economy growing again, save as many jobs as possible, and help Americans who'd become unemployed.\\n\\nThat's why we extended or increased unemployment benefits for more than 18 million Americans, made health insurance 65 percent cheaper for families who get their coverage through COBRA, and passed 25 different tax cuts.\\n\\nNow, let me repeat: We cut taxes. We cut taxes for 95 percent of working families. We cut taxes for small businesses.\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\nWe cut taxes for first-time homebuyers. We cut taxes for parents trying to care for their children. We cut taxes for 8 million Americans paying for college.\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\nI thought I'd get some applause on that one.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nAs a result...\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\nAs a result, millions of Americans had more to spend on gas and food and other necessities, all of which helped businesses keep more workers. And we haven't raised income taxes by a single dime on a single person, not a single dime.\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\nNow, because of the steps we took, there are about 2 million Americans working right now who would otherwise be unemployed.\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\nTwo-hundred-thousand work in construction and clean energy. Three-hundred-thousand are teachers and other education workers. Tens of thousands are cops, firefighters, correctional officers, first responders.\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\nAnd we're on track to add another 1.5 million jobs to this total by the end of the year.\\n\\nThe plan that has made all of this possible, from the tax cuts to the jobs, is the Recovery Act.\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\nThat's right, the Recovery Act, also known as the stimulus bill.\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\nEconomists on the left and the right say this bill has helped saved jobs and avert disaster, but you don't have to take their word for it.\\n\\nTalk to the small business in Phoenix that will triple its workforce because of the Recovery Act.\\n\\nTalk to the window manufacturer in Philadelphia who said he used to be skeptical about the Recovery Act, until he had to add two more work shifts just because of the business it created.\\n\\nTalk to the single teacher raising two kids who was told by her principal in the last week of school that, because of the Recovery Act, she wouldn't be laid off after all.\\n\\nThere are stories like this all across America. And after two years of recession, the economy is growing again. Retirement funds have started to gain back some of their value. Businesses are beginning to invest again, and slowly, some are starting to hire again.\\n\\nBut I realize that, for every success story, there are other stories, of men and women who wake up with the anguish of not knowing where their next paycheck will come from, who send out resumes week after week and hear nothing in response.\\n\\nThat is why jobs must be our No. 1 focus in 2010, and that's why I'm calling for a new jobs bill tonight.\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\nNow, the true engine of job creation in this country will always be America's businesses...\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\n... but government can create the conditions necessary for businesses to expand and hire more workers.\\n\\nWe should start where most new jobs do, in small businesses, companies that begin when...\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\n... companies that begin when an entrepreneur -- when an entrepreneur takes a chance on a dream or a worker decides it's time she became her own boss.\\n\\nThrough sheer grit and determination, these companies have weathered the recession and are ready to grow. But when you talk to small-business owners in places like Allentown, Pennsylvania, or Elyria, Ohio, you find out that even though banks on Wall Street are lending again, they're mostly lending to bigger companies. Financing remains difficult for small-business owners across the country, even though they're making a profit.\\n\\nSo tonight, I'm proposing that we take $30 billion of the money Wall Street banks have repaid and use it to help community banks give small businesses the credit they need to stay afloat.\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\nI'm also proposing a new small-business tax credit, one that will go to over 1 million small businesses who hire new workers or raise wages.\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\nWhile we're at it, let's also eliminate all capital gains taxes on small-business investment and provide a tax incentive for all large businesses and all small businesses to invest in new plants and equipment.\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\nNext, we can put Americans to work today building the infrastructure of tomorrow.\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\nFrom -- from the first railroads to the Interstate Highway System, our nation has always been built to compete. There's no reason Europe or China should have the fastest trains or the new factories that manufacture clean-energy products.\\n\\nTomorrow, I'll visit Tampa, Florida, where workers will soon break ground on a new high-speed railroad funded by the Recovery Act. There are projects like that all across this country that will create jobs and help move our nation's goods, services and information.\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\nWe should put more Americans to work building clean-energy facilities and give...\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\n... and give rebates to Americans who make their homes more energy efficient, which supports clean-energy jobs.\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\nAnd to encourage these and other businesses to stay within our borders, it is time to finally slash the tax breaks for companies that ship our jobs overseas and give those tax breaks to companies that create jobs right here in the United States of America.\\n\\nNow, the House has passed a jobs bill that includes some of these steps.\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\nAs the first order of business this year, I urge the Senate to do the same, and I know they will. They will.\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\nPeople are out of work. They're hurting. They need our help. And I want a jobs bill on my desk without delay.\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\nBut -- but the truth is, these steps won't make up for the 7 million jobs that we've lost over the last two years. The only way to move to full employment is to lay a new foundation for long- term economic growth and finally address the problems that America's families have confronted for years.\\n\\nWe can't afford another so-called economic expansion like the one from last decade, what some call the lost decade, where jobs grew more slowly than during any prior expansion, where the income of the average American household declined while the cost of health care and tuition reached record highs, where prosperity was built on a housing bubble and financial speculation.\\n\\nFrom the day I took office, I've been told that addressing our larger challenges is too ambitious, such effort would be too contentious. I've been told that our political system is too gridlocked and that we should just put things on hold for a while.\\n\\nFor those who make these claims, I have one simple question: How long should we wait? How long should America put its future on hold? You see...\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\nYou see, Washington has been telling us to wait for decades, even as the problems have grown worse. Meanwhile, China's not waiting to revamp its economy; Germany's not waiting; India's not waiting.\\n\\nThese nations, they're not standing still. These nations aren't playing for second place. They're putting more emphasis on math and science. They're rebuilding their infrastructure. They're making serious investments in clean energy because they want those jobs.\\n\\nWell, I do not accept second place for the United States of America.\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\nAs hard as it may be, as uncomfortable and contentious as the debates may become, it's time to get serious about fixing the problems that are hampering our growth.\\n\\nNow, one place to start is serious financial reform. Look, I'm not interested in punishing banks. I'm interested in protecting our economy. A strong, healthy financial market makes it possible for businesses to access credit and create new jobs. It channels the savings of families into investments that raise incomes. But that can only happen if we guard against the same recklessness that nearly brought down our entire economy.\\n\\nWe need to make sure consumers and middle-class families have the information they need to make financial decisions. We can't allow financial institutions, including those that take your deposits, to take risks that threaten the whole economy.\\n\\nNow, the House has already passed financial reform with many of these changes. And -- and the lobbyists are trying to kill it. Well, we cannot let them win this fight. And if the bill that ends up on my desk does not meet the test of real reform, I will send it back until we get it right. We've got to get it right.\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\nNext, we need to encourage American innovation. Last year, we made the largest investment in basic research funding in history, an investment -- an investment that could lead to the world's cheapest solar cells or treatment that kills cancer cells but leaves healthy ones untouched.\\n\\nAnd no area is more ripe for such innovation than energy. You can see the results of last year's investments in clean energy in the North Carolina company that will create 1,200 jobs nationwide, helping to make advanced batteries, or in the California business that will put 1,000 people to work making solar panels.\\n\\nBut to create more of these clean-energy jobs, we need more production, more efficiency, more incentives, and that means building a new generation of safe, clean nuclear power plants in this country.\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\nIt means making tough decisions about opening new offshore areas for oil and gas development.\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\nIt means continued investment in advanced biofuels and clean-coal technologies.\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\nAnd, yes, it means passing a comprehensive energy and climate bill with incentives that will finally make clean energy the profitable kind of energy in America.\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\nI'm grateful to the House for passing such a bill last year.\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\nAnd this year -- this year, I'm eager to help advance the bipartisan effort in the Senate.\\n\\nI know there have been questions about whether we can afford such changes in a tough economy. I know that there are those who disagree with the overwhelming scientific evidence on climate change.\\n\\nBut -- but here's the thing. Even if you doubt the evidence, providing incentives for energy efficiency and clean energy are the right thing to do for our future, because the nation that leads the clean-energy economy will be the nation that leads the global economy, and America must be that nation.\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\nThird, we need to export more of our goods.\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\nBecause the more products we make and sell to other countries, the more jobs we support right here in America. So...\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\nSo tonight, we set a new goal: We will double our exports over the next five years, an increase that will support 2 million jobs in America.\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\nTo help meet this goal, we're launching a National Export Initiative that will help farmers and small businesses increase their exports and reform export controls consistent with national security.\\n\\nWe have to seek new markets aggressively, just as our competitors are. If America sits on the sidelines while other nations sign trade deals, we will lose the chance to create jobs on our shores.\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\nBut realizing those benefits also means enforcing those agreements so our trading partners play by the rules.\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\nAnd that's why we'll continue to shape a Doha trade agreement that opens global markets and why we will strengthen our trade relations in Asia and with key partners like South Korea, and Panama, and Colombia.\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\nFourth, we need to invest in the skills and education of our people. Now, this year -- this year, we've broken through the stalemate between left and right by launching a national competition to improve our schools.\\n\\nAnd the idea here is simple: Instead of rewarding failure, we only reward success. Instead of funding the status quo, we only invest in reform, reform that raises student achievement, inspires students to excel in math and science, and turns around failing schools that steal the future of too many young Americans, from rural communities to the inner city.\\n\\nIn the 21st century, the best anti-poverty program around is a world-class education.\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\nAnd in this country, the success of our children cannot depend more on where they live than on their potential. When we renew the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, we will work with Congress to expand these reforms to all 50 states.\\n\\nStill, in this economy, a high school diploma no longer guarantees a good job. That's why I urge the Senate to follow the House and pass a bill that will revitalize our community colleges, which are a career pathway to the children of so many working families.\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\nTo make college more affordable, this bill will finally end the unwarranted taxpayer subsidies that go to banks for student loans. Instead, let's take that money and give families a $10,000 tax credit for four years of college and increase Pell Grants.\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\nAnd let's tell another 1 million students that, when they graduate, they will be required to pay only 10 percent of their income on student loans, and all of their debt will be forgiven after 20 years, and forgiven after 10 years if they choose a career in public service, because in the United States of America, no one should go broke because they chose to go to college.\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\nAnd, by the way, it's time for colleges and universities to get serious about cutting their own costs, because they, too, have a responsibility to help solve this problem.\\n\\nNow, the price of college tuition is just one of the burdens facing the middle class. That's why last year I asked Vice President Biden to chair a task force on middle-class families.\\n\\nThat's why we're nearly doubling the childcare tax credit and making it easier to save for retirement by giving access to every worker a retirement account and expanding the tax credit for those who start a nest egg. That's why we're working to lift the value of a family's single largest investment, their home.\\n\\nThe steps we took last year to shore up the housing market have allowed millions of Americans to take out new loans and save an average of $1,500 on mortgage payments. This year, we will step up refinancing so that homeowners can move into more affordable mortgages. And...\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\nAnd it is precisely to relieve the burden on middle-class families that we still need health insurance reform.\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\nWe do.\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\nNow, let's clear a few things up.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nI didn't choose to tackle this issue to get some legislative victory under my belt. And by now, it should be fairly obvious that I didn't take on health care because it was good politics.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nI took on health care because of the stories I've heard, from Americans with pre-existing conditions whose lives depend on getting coverage, patients who've been denied coverage, families, even those with insurance, who are just one illness away from financial ruin.\\n\\nAfter nearly a century of trying -- Democratic administrations, Republican administrations -- we are closer than ever to bringing more security to the lives of so many Americans.\\n\\nThe approach we've taken would protect every American from the worst practices of the insurance industry. It would give small businesses and uninsured Americans a chance to choose an affordable health care plan in a competitive market.\\n\\nIt would require every insurance plan to cover preventive care. And by the way, I want to acknowledge our first lady, Michelle Obama, who this year is creating a national movement to tackle the epidemic of childhood obesity and make kids healthier.\\n\\nThank you, honey.\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\nShe gets embarrassed.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nOur approach would preserve the right of Americans who have insurance to keep their doctor and their plan. It would reduce costs and premiums for millions of families and businesses.\\n\\nAnd according to the Congressional Budget Office, the independent organization that both parties have cited as the official scorekeeper for Congress, our approach would bring down the deficit by as much as $1 trillion over the next two decades.\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\nStill, this is a complex issue. And the longer it was debated, the more skeptical people became. I take my share of the blame for not explaining it more clearly to the American people. And I know that with all the lobbying and horse-trading, this process left most Americans wondering, What's in it for me?\\n\\nBut I also know this problem is not going away. By the time I'm finished speaking tonight, more Americans will have lost their health insurance. Millions will lose it this year. Our deficit will grow. Premiums will go up. Patients will be denied the care they need. Small-business owners will continue to drop coverage altogether.\\n\\nI will not walk away from these Americans, and neither should the people in this chamber.\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\nAs temperatures cool, I want everyone to take another look at the plan we've proposed. There's a reason why many doctors, nurses and health care experts who know our system best consider this approach a vast improvement over the status quo.\\n\\nBut if anyone from either party has a better approach that will bring down premiums, bring down the deficit, cover the uninsured, strengthen Medicare for seniors, and stop insurance company abuses, let me know.\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\nLet me know. Let me know.\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\nI'm eager to see it.\\n\\nHere's what I ask Congress, though: Don't walk away from reform, not now, not when we are so close. Let us find a way to come together and finish the job for the American people. Let's get it done.\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\nLet's get it done.\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\nNow, even as health care reform would reduce our deficit, it's not enough to dig us out of a massive fiscal hole in which we find ourselves. It's a challenge that makes all others that much harder to solve and one that's been subject to a lot of political posturing.\\n\\nSo let me start the discussion of government spending by setting the record straight. At the beginning of the last decade, the year 2000, America had a budget surplus of over $200 billion.\\n\\nBy -- by the time I took office, we had a one-year deficit of over $1 trillion and projected deficits of $8 trillion over the next decade. Most of this was the result of not paying for two wars, two tax cuts, and an expensive prescription drug program.\\n\\nOn top of that, the effects of the recession put a $3 trillion hole in our budget. All this was before I walked in the door.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nNow...\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\nNow -- just stating the facts. Now, if we had taken office in ordinary times, I would have liked nothing more than to start bringing down the deficit. But we took office amid a crisis, and our efforts to prevent a second depression have added another $1 trillion to our national debt. That, too, is a fact.\\n\\nI'm absolutely convinced that was the right thing to do, but families across the country are tightening their belts and making tough decisions. The federal government should do the same.\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\nSo tonight, I'm proposing specific steps to pay for the $1 trillion that it took to rescue the economy last year.\\n\\nStarting in 2011, we are prepared to freeze government spending for three years. Spending related to our national security, Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security will not be affected, but all other discretionary government programs will.\\n\\nLike any cash-strapped family, we will work within a budget to invest in what we need and sacrifice what we don't. And if I have to enforce this discipline by veto, I will.\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\nWe will continue to go through the budget line by line, page by page, to eliminate programs that we can't afford and don't work. We've already identified $20 billion in savings for next year.\\n\\nTo help working families, we'll extend our middle-class tax cuts. But at a time of record deficits, we will not continue tax cuts for oil companies, for investment fund managers, and for those making over $250,000 a year. We just can't afford it.\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\nNow, even after paying for what we spent on my watch, we'll still face the massive deficit we had when I took office. More importantly, the cost of Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security will continue to skyrocket.\\n\\nThat's why I've called for a bipartisan Fiscal Commission, modeled on a proposal by Republican Judd Gregg and Democrat Kent Conrad.\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\nThis can't be one of those Washington gimmicks that lets us pretend we solved a problem. The commission will have to provide a specific set of solutions by a certain deadline.\\n\\nNow, yesterday, the Senate blocked a bill that would have created this commission. So I'll issue an executive order that will allow us to go forward, because I refuse to pass this problem on to another generation of Americans.\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\nAnd when the vote comes tomorrow, the Senate should restore the pay-as-you-go law that was a big reason for why we had record surpluses in the 1990s.\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\nNow, I know that some in my own party will argue that we can't address the deficit or freeze government spending when so many are still hurting. And I agree, which is why this freeze won't take effect until next year, when the economy is stronger. That's how budgeting works.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nBut understand -- understand, if we don't take meaningful steps to rein in our debt, it could damage our markets, increase the cost of borrowing, and jeopardize our recovery, all of which would have an even worse effect on our job growth and family incomes.\\n\\nFrom some on the right, I expect we'll hear a different argument, that if we just make fewer investments in our people, extend tax cuts, including those for the wealthier Americans, eliminate more regulations, maintain the status quo on health care, our deficits will go away.\\n\\nThe problem is, that's what we did for eight years.\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\nThat's what helped us into this crisis. It's what helped lead to these deficits. We can't do it again.\\n\\nRather than fight the same tired battles that have dominated Washington for decades, it's time to try something new. Let's invest in our people without leaving them a mountain of debt. Let's meet our responsibility to the citizens who sent us here. Let's try common sense, a novel concept.\\n\\nNow, to do that, we have to recognize that we face more than a deficit of dollars right now. We face a deficit of trust, deep and corrosive doubts about how Washington works that have been growing for years.\\n\\nTo close that credibility gap, we have to take action on both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue, to end the outsized influence of lobbyists, to do our work openly, to give our people the government they deserve.\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\nThat's what I came to Washington to do. That's why, for the first time in history, my administration posts our White House visitors online. That's why we've excluded lobbyists from policy-making jobs or seats on federal boards and commissions.\\n\\nBut we can't stop there. It's time to require lobbyists to disclose each contact they make on behalf of a client with my administration or with Congress. It's time to put strict limits on the contributions that lobbyists give to candidates for federal office.\\n\\nWith all due deference to separation of powers, last week, the Supreme Court reversed a century of law that I believe will open the floodgates for special interests, including foreign corporations, to spend without limit in our elections.\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\nI don't think American elections should be bankrolled by America's most powerful interests or, worse, by foreign entities. They should be decided by the American people. And I urge Democrats and Republicans to pass a bill that helps correct some of these problems.\\n\\nI'm also calling on Congress to continue down the path of earmark reform, Democrats and Republicans.\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\nDemocrats and Republicans, you've trimmed some of this spending. You've embraced some meaningful change, but restoring the public trust demands more. For example, some members of Congress post some earmark requests online.\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\nTonight, I'm calling on Congress to publish all earmark requests on a single Web site before there's a vote so that the American people can see how their money is being spent.\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\nOf course, none of these reforms will even happen if we don't also reform how we work with one another. Now, I'm not naive. I never thought that the mere fact of my election would usher in peace and harmony and some post-partisan era.\\n\\nI knew that both parties have fed divisions that are deeply entrenched. And on some issues, there are simply philosophical differences that will always cause us to part ways. These disagreements, about the role of government in our lives, about our national priorities and our national security, they've been taking place for over 200 years. They're the very essence of our democracy.\\n\\nBut what frustrates the American people is a Washington where every day is Election Day. We can't wage a perpetual campaign where the only goal is to see who can get the most embarrassing headlines about the other side, a belief that if you lose, I win. Neither party should delay or obstruct every single bill just because they can.\\n\\nThe confirmation of...\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\nI'm speaking of both parties now. The confirmation of well-qualified public servants shouldn't be held hostage to the pet projects or grudges of a few individual senators.\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\nWashington may think that saying anything about the other side, no matter how false, no matter how malicious, is just part of the game. But it's precisely such politics that has stopped either party from helping the American people. Worse yet -- worse yet, it's sowing further division among our citizens, further distrust in our government.\\n\\nSo, no, I will not give up on trying to change the tone of our politics. I know it's an election year. And after last week, it's clear that campaign fever has come even earlier than usual. But we still need to govern.\\n\\nTo Democrats, I would remind you that we still have the largest majority in decades and the people expect us to solve problems, not run for the hills.\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\nAnd if the Republican leadership is going to insist that 60 votes in the Senate are required to do any business at all in this town, a supermajority, then the responsibility to govern is now yours, as well. Just saying no to everything may be good short-term politics, but it's not leadership. We were sent here to serve our citizens, not our ambitions.\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\nSo let's show the American people that we can do it together.\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\nThis week -- this week, I'll be addressing a meeting of the House Republicans. I'd like to begin monthly meetings with both Democratic and Republican leadership. I know you can't wait.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nNow, throughout our history, no issue has united this country more than our security. Sadly, some of the unity we felt after 9/11 has dissipated. And we can argue all we want about who's to blame for this, but I'm not interested in re-litigating the past.\\n\\nI know that all of us love this country. All of us are committed to its defense. So let's put aside the schoolyard taunts about who's tough. Let's reject the false choice between protecting our people and upholding our values. Let's leave behind the fear and division and do what it takes to defend our nation and forge a more hopeful future, for America and for the world.\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\nThat's the work we began last year. Since the day I took office, we renewed our focus on the terrorists who threaten our nation. We've made substantial investments in our homeland security and disrupted plots that threatened to take American lives.\\n\\nWe are filling unacceptable gaps revealed by the failed Christmas attack with better airline security and swifter action on our intelligence. We've prohibited torture and strengthened partnerships from the Pacific to South Asia to the Arabian Peninsula.\\n\\nAnd in the last year, hundreds of Al Qaeda's fighters and affiliates, including many senior leaders, have been captured or killed, far more than in 2008.\\n\\nAnd in Afghanistan, we're increasing our troops and training Afghan security forces so they can begin to take the lead in July of 2011 and our troops can begin to come home.\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\nWe will reward good governance, work to reduce corruption, and support the rights of all Afghans, men and women alike. We're joined by allies and partners who have increased their own commitment and who'll come together tomorrow in London to reaffirm our common purpose. There will be difficult days ahead, but I am absolutely confident we will succeed.\\n\\nAs we take the fight to Al Qaeda, we are responsibly leaving Iraq to its people. As a candidate, I promised that I would end this war, and that is what I am doing as president.\\n\\nWe will have all of our combat troops out of Iraq by the end of this August.\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\nWe will support -- we will support the Iraqi government -- we will support the Iraqi government as they hold elections, and we will continue to partner with the Iraqi people to promote regional peace and prosperity.\\n\\nBut make no mistake: This war is ending, and all of our troops are coming home.\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\nTonight, all of our men and women in uniform -- in Iraq, in Afghanistan, and around the world -- they have to know that we -- that they have our respect, our gratitude, our full support. And just as they must have the resources they need in war, we all have a responsibility to support them when they come home.\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\nThat's why we made the largest increase in investments for veterans in decades last year.\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\nThat's why we're building a 21st-century [Veterans Affairs]. And that's why Michelle has joined with Jill Biden to forge a national commitment to support military families.\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\nNow, even as we prosecute two wars, we're also confronting perhaps the greatest danger to the American people, the threat of nuclear weapons. I've embraced the vision of John F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan through a strategy that reverses the spread of these weapons and seeks a world without them.\\n\\nTo reduce our stockpiles and launchers, while ensuring our deterrent, the United States and Russia are completing negotiations on the farthest-reaching arms control treaty in nearly two decades.\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\nAnd at April's Nuclear Security Summit, we will bring 44 nations together here in Washington, D.C., behind a clear goal: securing all vulnerable nuclear materials around the world in four years so that they never fall into the hands of terrorists.\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\nNow, these diplomatic efforts have also strengthened our hand in dealing with those nations that insist on violating international agreements in pursuit of nuclear weapons. That's why North Korea now faces increased isolation and stronger sanctions, sanctions that are being vigorously enforced.\\n\\nThat's why the international community is more united and the Islamic Republic of Iran is more isolated. And as Iran's leaders continue to ignore their obligations, there should be no doubt: They, too, will face growing consequences. That is a promise.\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\nThat's the leadership we are providing: engagement that advances the common security and prosperity of all people. We're working through the G-20 to sustain a lasting global recovery. We're working with Muslim communities around the world to promote science and education and innovation.\\n\\nWe have gone from a bystander to a leader in the fight against climate change. We're helping developing countries to feed themselves and continuing the fight against HIV/AIDS.\\n\\nAnd we are launching a new initiative that will give us the capacity to respond faster and more effectively to bioterrorism or an infectious disease, a plan that will counter threats at home and strengthen public health abroad.\\n\\nAs we have for over 60 years, America takes these actions because our destiny is connected to those beyond our shores. But we also do it because it is right.\\n\\nThat's why, as we meet here tonight, over 10,000 Americans are working with many nations to help the people of Haiti recover and rebuild.\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\nThat's why we stand with the girl who yearns to go to school in Afghanistan, why we support the human rights of the women marching through the streets of Iran, why we advocate for the young man denied a job by corruption in Guinea, for America must always stand on the side of freedom and human dignity, always.\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\nAbroad, America's greatest source of strength has always been our ideals. The same is true at home. We find unity in our incredible diversity, drawing on the promise enshrined in our Constitution, the notion that we're all created equal, that no matter who you are or what you look like, if you abide by the law, you should be protected by it, if you adhere to our common values, you should be treated no different than anyone else.\\n\\nWe must continually renew this promise. My administration has a Civil Rights Division that is once again prosecuting civil rights violations and employment discrimination. We finally strengthened...\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\nWe finally strengthened our laws to protect against crimes driven by hate.\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\nThis year -- this year, I will work with Congress and our military to finally repeal the law that denies gay Americans the right to serve the country they love because of who they are. It's the right thing to do.\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\nWe're going to crack down on violations of equal pay laws, so that women get equal pay for an equal day's work.\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\nAnd we should continue the work of fixing our broken immigration system, to secure our borders, and enforce our laws, and ensure that everyone who plays by the rules can contribute to our economy and enrich our nations.\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\nIn the end, it's our ideals, our values that built America, values that allowed us to forge a nation made up of immigrants from every corner of the globe, values that drive our citizens still.\\n\\nEvery day, Americans meet their responsibilities to their families and their employers. Time and again, they lend a hand to their neighbors and give back to their country. They take pride in their labor and are generous in spirit.\\n\\nThese aren't Republican values or Democratic values that they're living by, business values or labor values. They're American values.\\n\\nUnfortunately, too many of our citizens have lost faith that our biggest institutions -- our corporations, our media, and, yes, our government -- still reflect these same values.\\n\\nEach of these institutions are full of honorable men and women doing important work that helps our country prosper. But each time a CEO rewards himself for failure or a banker puts the rest of us at risk for his own selfish gain, people's doubts grow. Each time lobbyists game the system or politicians tear each other down instead of lifting this country up, we lose faith.\\n\\nThe more that TV pundits reduce serious debates to silly arguments, big issues into sound bites, our citizens turn away.\\n\\nNo wonder there's so much cynicism out there. No wonder there's so much disappointment.\\n\\nI campaigned on the promise of change, change we can believe in, the slogan went. And right now, I know there are many Americans who aren't sure if they still believe we can change, or that I can deliver it.\\n\\nBut remember this: I never suggested that change would be easy or that I could do it alone. Democracy in a nation of 300 million people can be noisy and messy and complicated. And when you try to do big things and make big changes, it stirs passions and controversy. That's just how it is.\\n\\nThose of us in public office can respond to this reality by playing it safe and avoid telling hard truths and pointing fingers. We can do what's necessary to keep our poll numbers high and get through the next election instead of doing what's best for the next generation.\\n\\nBut I also know this: If people had made that decision 50 years ago or 100 years ago or 200 years ago, we wouldn't be here tonight. The only reason we are here is because generations of Americans were unafraid to do what was hard, to do what was needed even when success was uncertain, to do what it took to keep the dream of this nation alive for their children and their grandchildren.\\n\\nOur administration has had some political setbacks this year, and some of them were deserved. But I wake up every day knowing that they are nothing compared to the setbacks that families all across this country have faced this year.\\n\\nAnd what keeps me going, what keeps me fighting, is that despite all these setbacks, that spirit of determination and optimism, that fundamental decency that has always been at the core of the American people, that lives on.\\n\\nIt lives on in the struggling small-business owner who wrote to me of his company, None of us, he said, are willing to consider, even slightly, that we might fail.\\n\\nIt lives on in the woman who said that, even though she and her neighbors have felt the pain of recession, We are strong, we are resilient, we are American.\\n\\nIt lives on in the 8-year-old boy in Louisiana who just sent me his allowance and asked if I would give it to the people of Haiti.\\n\\nAnd it lives on in all the Americans who've dropped everything to go someplace they've never been and pull people they've never known from the rubble, prompting chants of USA! USA! USA! when another life was saved.\\n\\nThe spirit that has sustained this nation for more than two centuries lives on in you, its people.\\n\\nWe have finished a difficult year. We have come through a difficult decade. But a new year has come. A new decade stretches before us.\\n\\nWe don't quit. I don't quit. Let's seize this moment, to start anew, to carry the dream forward, and to strengthen our union once more.\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\nThank you. God bless you. And God bless the United States of America."}

We'll get you next time.\\n\\n\\n\\nTALEV: Next time.\\n\\n\\n\\nBASH: Thank you all. Have a great weekend.\\n\\n\\n\\nThank you for joining us on INSIDE POLITICS. Brianna Keilar starts RIGHT NOW.\\n\\n\\n\\nBRIANNA KEILAR, CNN ANCHOR: I'm Brianna Keilar, live from our Washington headquarters.\\n\\n\\n\\nWelcome to this special edition of CNN RIGHT NOW.\\n\\n\\n\\nUnderway, President Trump, in the 11th hour, making a last-ditch threat to get a citizenship question on the 2020 census less than an hour before a court deadline demanding to hear the administration's plan. Just a short time ago, the president said he's exploring all options, including issuing an executive order.\\n\\n\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\n\\n\\nDONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We have four or five ways we can do it. It's one of the ways that we're thinking about doing it very seriously. We're doing well on the census.\\n\\n\\n\\nWe could also add an addition on. So we can start the printing now and maybe do an addendum after we get a positive decision. So we're working on a lot of things, including an executive order.\\n\\n\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\n\\n\\nKEILAR: This is coming as a source tells CNN the president thinks the Justice Department threw in the towel too early after the Supreme Court ruled against including this question on the census last week. The source says the president has made it clear he wants to fight. And the clock is ticking as the DOJ faces a 2:00 p.m. Eastern deadline\\n\\n\\n\\nto tell a federal judge what it plans to do. But as for now, an official tells CNN, the census will continue to be printed without that citizenship question on it.\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd now CNN's exclusive interview with vice president -- former Vice President Joe Biden. The Democratic presidential frontrunner sat down with our own Chris Cuomo and he was pressed on a range of issues, including President Trump's friendship with North Korea, the ongoing trade war with China, whether he thinks he can actually take on President Trump and, of course, that debate moment with Senator Kamala Harris. The issue of busing is where we begin.\\n\\n\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\n\\n\\nCHRIS CUOMO, CNN ANCHOR: I was talking with you and Jill. You said you were expecting to have a target on your back. But the intensity of some of it. Did you see the questions about your past positions from the perspective of race being as relevant as they are?\\n\\n\\n\\nJOE BIDEN (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: No. And I don't think they're relevant because they're taken out of context.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat I didn't see is people who know me. I mean they know me well. It's not like it's somebody who just came out of the blue and didn't know anything. But it's so easy to go back and go back 30, 40, 50 years and take a context and take it completely out of context.\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd, I mean, you know, I -- I get all this information about other people's past and what they've done and not done. And, you know, I'm just not going to go there. If we keep doing that, that's -- I mean we should be debating what we do from here.\\n\\n\\n\\nFor example, this whole thing about race and busing. Well, you know, I think if you take a look, our positions aren't any different as we're finding out.\\n\\n\\n\\nCUOMO: With Senator Harris --\\n\\n\\n\\nBIDEN: Yes.\\n\\n\\n\\nCUOMO: Who said she sees it as a tool, not a must in all circumstances.\\n\\n\\n\\nBIDEN: Yes. Well, look at my record and --\\n\\n\\n\\nCUOMO: I don't think busing is about policy, Mr. Vice President.\\n\\n\\n\\nBIDEN: No, it's not.\\n\\n\\n\\nCUOMO: I think it was about principle. When you look back at your record on it, you were not in favor of busing. It was a different time. There were different applications. Why not just own it and say --\\n\\n\\n\\nBIDEN: Well, by the way, here's the thing, Chris, no -- CUOMO: I was against it but now I've changed.\\n\\n\\n\\nBIDEN: I was -- I was in favor of busing that was dejure busing. That is, if a court ruled that there was a law passed or circumstance that a county, a city, a state did that prevented black folks from being somewhere, then that's wrong, you should bus. I even went so far in the middle of that busing controversy with saying I'd use helicopters if that was necessary to make the point. And we really got, you know, town meeting that was -- got very hot. But what the issue is now is, for example, and it was then, voluntary busing. We supported it. We supported it then. And, by the way, Barack and I, as president and vice president, we provided money for voluntary busing if cities wanted to do it.\\n\\n\\n\\nCUOMO: I'm not questioning any of that.\\n\\n\\n\\nBIDEN: No, no --\\n\\n\\n\\nCUOMO: I'm saying that when you look back in the '70s, you said, I think busing doesn't work. It's an asinine concept.\\n\\n\\n\\nBIDEN: Well, by the way --\\n\\n\\n\\nCUOMO: You tried to pass bills that weren't for it.\\n\\n\\n\\nBIDEN: Busing did not work. You had overwhelming response from the African-American community in my state. My state is the eighth largest black population in the country as a percent of population. They weren't -- they did not support it. They did not support it.\\n\\n\\n\\nLook, the question is, how do you equalize education in every area? And I put forward the most -- the most aggressive plan to do that and I've been pushing it for a long time. For example, in, you know, Title I schools, schools that are disadvantaged, we should -- I proposed we go from $15 billion a year to $45 billion a year. We should bring people in and have preschool from three, four, five years old, before kindergarten. We should have -- look, every child out there, every child out there is capable, but they live in circumstances that make it difficult. From the time they get to school they've heard three, four million fewer words spoken. They're at a disadvantage.\\n\\n\\n\\n[13:05:04] CUOMO: I totally accept all of that.\\n\\n\\n\\nBIDEN: Well, I -- well, that's number one. But, number two, the idea right now, 65 out of 100 jobs in a study I did for the president point out you need something beyond a high school degree.\\n\\n\\n\\nCUOMO: That's true.\\n\\n\\n\\nBIDEN: So what are we doing? We're sitting around here as if it's an insoluble problem.\\n\\n\\n\\nCUOMO: I'm -- I get it on the policy. I never have viewed the busing back and forth in that debate as about policy or application of how to affect civil rights. It's about consistency and proving if you'll be better than what we're dealing with now in the White House, which is people won't tell the truth about things. If busing didn't work, then it made sense that you weren't for it back then.\\n\\n\\n\\nBIDEN: But I --\\n\\n\\n\\nCUOMO: But why say you were for it?\\n\\n\\n\\nBIDEN: Well, no --\\n\\n\\n\\nCUOMO: Why not just be straight about it and move on?\\n\\n\\n\\nBIDEN: OK, because there's three different pieces. I was for voluntary busing. Number one. I was for busing where the courts showed that, in fact, a legislative body took an action preventing black folks from going to a school. That is dejure -- I know you know, dejure segregation. The difficult piece is, this is 50 years ago, people don't understand the context.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe third one is, do you have an administration, through their non- elected officials, the Department of Housing, decide every school should be equally balanced across the board? That's a different issue. And the way to deal with that problem is what I did from the time I was a kid. I got out of -- I got out of law school, came back, had a great job, became a public defender. I fought for putting housing and -- low-income housing in suburbia. I talked about eliminating red line and I talked about school districts should be consolidated in ways that made sense so, in fact --\\n\\n\\n\\nCUOMO: Why didn't you fight it like this in the debate?\\n\\n\\n\\nBIDEN: Be -- in 30 seconds?\\n\\n\\n\\nCUOMO: Hey --\\n\\n\\n\\nBIDEN: Come on, man.\\n\\n\\n\\nCUOMO: What happens most in a debate, Mr. Vice President? People blow their time cue.\\n\\n\\n\\nBIDEN: Well --\\n\\n\\n\\nCUOMO: You're the only person I've ever seen on a debate stage say I'm out of time.\\n\\n\\n\\nBIDEN: Well, we've never had a place where you have 30 seconds, man. What I didn't want to do is get in that scrum. Do you think the American public looked at that debate, take me out of it, and thought, boy, I really -- I really like the way that's being conducted. They're really showing themselves to do really well. Come on, man.\\n\\n\\n\\nCUOMO: But they -- they're going come after you.\\n\\n\\n\\nBIDEN: Sure they're going come after me.\\n\\n\\n\\nCUOMO: Were you prepared for them to come after you?\\n\\n\\n\\nBIDEN: I was prepared for them to come after me, but I wasn't prepared for the person coming at me the way she came at -- she knew Beau. She knows me. I don't -- well, anyway, I -- but here's the deal, what I do know, and this is the good and the bad news. The American people think they know me and they know me. Since that occurred, I had the most sought after endorsement for the mayor of Atlanta, a black woman, who's a great leader, Mayor Bottoms, endorse me. I've had numerous members of the Black Caucus endorse me. I've --\\n\\n\\n\\nCUOMO: Are you worried about the poll slippage with African-Americans after the debate?\\n\\n\\n\\nBIDEN: No, no, these -- these folks just came. I'm making the point to you, I don't see it. People know who I am. I don't believe there's anybody out there that believes that I have anything other than a keen and consistent interest in making sure every child has -- these are all our children.\\n\\n\\n\\nCUOMO: Here's the tough -- here's the question, did you re-watch the debate?\\n\\n\\n\\nBIDEN: No, I didn't.\\n\\n\\n\\nCUOMO: Why not?\\n\\n\\n\\nBIDEN: Well, I didn't have an opportunity to re-watch it. And, besides, you know, my measure is how people react outside, getting on a train, getting on a plane, walking through an airport, walking in a parade, just going to the grocery store. I got no sense, I really mean it, no sense.\\n\\n\\n\\nCUOMO: Here's the tough question for Democrats. They need a warrior, OK, because not too aggrandize, not to lionize, but this president knows how to fight in the ring one on one. Kamala Harris is friendly fire. Cory Booker is friendly fire. How can Democrats have confidence that you can take on the biggest and the baddest when you're having trouble sparring in party?\\n\\n\\n\\nBIDEN: I don't think I'm having trouble sparring. It's how you want to spar. Look, I'm the guy at the time everybody talks about things that are changed. I took on same-sex marriage. I took on a whole range of issues. I took on arms control. I took on dealing with Russia with the -- with the arms control agreement. I took on Putin in terms of Iraq -- I mean, excuse me, in terms of what was going on in Ukraine. I've taken on these leaders around the world. I'm the guy that's gone in and met -- I've taken on all these leaders. I -- I mean I -- this is ironic. I've never been accused of being -- not being able to spar. I've been accused of being too aggressive.\\n\\n\\n\\nCUOMO: But the game has changed.\\n\\n\\n\\nBIDEN: Well --\\n\\n\\n\\nCUOMO: And you think that what's happening with Harris is anything compared to what would happened with you and this president?\\n\\n\\n\\nBIDEN: No, but everybody knows who this guy is. Come on, man. Come on.\\n\\n\\n\\nCUOMO: How do you beat him? BIDEN: I beat him by just pointing out who I am and who he is and what\\n\\n\\n\\nwe're for and what he's against. This guy is a divider in chief. This guy is acting with racist policies. This guy is moving to foment hate, to split. That's the only way he can sustain himself.\\n\\n\\n\\nCUOMO: Nothing about him worries you?\\n\\n\\n\\nBIDEN: Oh, yes, well, sure, it worries me in the sense that I'm looking forward to this, man. You walk behind me in a debate, come here, man. Don't you think I -- you know me too well. I mean I -- the idea that I'd be intimidated by Donald Trump? He's the bully that I knew my whole life. He's the bully that I've always stood up to. He's the bully that used to make fun when I was a kid and stutter and I'd smacked him in the mouth.\\n\\n\\n\\n[13:10:19] Look, this is not -- but that -- they -- I think the American people want a president who has some dignity, who has a value set, who is actually trying to restore the soul of this country so when they turn on the television they look up and their kids say, I want to be like that guy or that woman.\\n\\n\\n\\nCUOMO: There are domestic agenda items I want to tick through.\\n\\n\\n\\nBIDEN: (INAUDIBLE).\\n\\n\\n\\nCUOMO: But you have made a big point of saying the threat here with the current administration is abroad.\\n\\n\\n\\nBIDEN: (INAUDIBLE).\\n\\n\\n\\nCUOMO: What exactly bothers you abroad?\\n\\n\\n\\nBIDEN: What bothers me abroad is, look, the idea that we can go it alone with no alliances for the next 20 or 30 years is a disaster. How are we going to deal with stateless terrorism without doing what I've been able to do with the president, put together coalitions of 50, 60 nations to take it on? I come out of a generation where we were trying to be the policemen of the world. We can't go in every place. We need allies. He is absolutely dissing them. He's embracing thugs. He's embracing Kim Jong-un, who is a thug. He's embracing Putin, who is a -- who is a flat dictator. He's embracing people who, in fact -- and he's stiff-arming our friends. He's threatening NATO, to pull out of NATO. I mean, come on.\\n\\n\\n\\nCUOMO: He says he's gotten NATO to give in more money for their defense because of his tactics.\\n\\n\\n\\nBIDEN: Oh, give me a break. Oh, come on, man. And, by the way, the idea that NATO think -- let me put it this way. If he wins re- election, I promise you, there will be no NATO in four years or five years.\\n\\n\\n\\nCUOMO: You think there will be no more NATO if he's re-elected.\\n\\n\\n\\nBIDEN: No more NATO. Look, I went to the -- the conference in -- that we have. It's called the Vercunda Conference (ph). It used to be. The first speech stood up, the chancellor, the former chancellor of Germany stands up. She says, we have to go it alone. We can't count on the United States.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhy did we set up NATO, Chris? So no one nation could abuse the power in the region in Europe that would suck us in, in the way they did in World War I and World War II. It's being crushed.\\n\\n\\n\\nLook at what's happening with Putin. While he -- while Putin is trying to undo our elections, he is undoing elections in -- in Europe. Look what's happened in Hungary. Look what's happened in Poland. Look what's happened in (INAUDIBLE). Look what's happening. You think that would happen on my watch or Barack's watch? You can't answer that, but I promise you it wouldn't have. And it didn't.\\n\\n\\n\\nCUOMO: So with North Korea, the idea of reaching out, President Obama, Vice President Biden wanted to do more than that. The Republicans used to whack you on the head. You can't be nice to people who are our enemies. Hadn't this president done what you wanted to do by reaching out to Kim?\\n\\n\\n\\nBIDEN: He did the exact opposite. He gave Kim everything that he wanted, legitimacy. He gave Kim -- he ended our relationship, as a practical matter with South Korea and Japan as a united front and let China off the hook. He put us in a position where we say, by the way, I love the man. I know what he's doing. He hasn't done a thing. He hasn't done a thing, Kim Jong-un. And what have we done? We've suspended exercises.\\n\\n\\n\\nLook, I come out of the arms control era. Guess what, there's two ways you do this, you work or you defend and you say, hey, man, don't screw with us. You move, this is what's going to happen. This is going to happen.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut, in the meantime, what you do is you deal with your allies and also those who don't -- aren't with you. Do you think China wants any part of North Korea becoming a nuclear power?\\n\\n\\n\\nCUOMO: So what do you do differently with North Korea and China?\\n\\n\\n\\nBIDEN: With regard to North Korea -- with China, I make it clear that we're going to move our defenses up, as we did before, and we're going to make sure we have the capacity to deal with it near term. I'm going to let South Korea and Japan know we're there for them. We are their nuclear umbrella. We're there for them. And China, understand, if you don't want us in your throat here, if you don't want us in your face, do something.\\n\\n\\n\\nCUOMO: Do you stop the trade battle with China? Do you go back to TPP?\\n\\n\\n\\nBIDEN: By the way, the idea that this trade battle makes any sense, is benefitting anybody, is absolutely ludicrous. And just ask the farmers here or around the world. Their -- I mean around the United States and the manufacturers. It's killing us.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat we should do is we deal with China -- I had a conversation with Xi before I -- Xi Jinping before I left. And he said, well, you know, remember they set up their no-fly zone and -- I said, we're not going to pay attention to it. He said, what do you want me to do, just withdraw it? And I said, no, but just understand, we're just going to fly through. We flew a B-52 through it. We are a Pacific power. We're not going anywhere, understand. And that's the reason why you have security is because we've allowed stability in the region. They get it. But what they're doing now is we're not dealing with China's problem for (ph) us. China's problem is they're stealing intellectual secrets.\\n\\n\\n\\nCUOMO: Yes.\\n\\n\\n\\n[13:15:01] BIDEN: Their cyber security. Deal the same way. You say you've got to invest here in the United States and you want to be able to invest here, and we're -- and you say we want to invest in China but you've got to have a 51 percent owner? No deal, man. Deal for a deal. (INAUDIBLE).\\n\\n\\n\\nCUOMO: This administration is fighting that same fight, isn't it?\\n\\n\\n\\nBIDEN: But they're not. No. They're fighting in trade. Trump thinks it's about trade deficits and trade surpluses. It's not about that.\\n\\n\\n\\nLook, while he's like tweeting, China is going to own the 5G market. While in fact he -- they're spending billions on artificial intelligence. What are we doing? They're doing a whole lot of things that make no sense for us to stand still.\\n\\n\\n\\nCUOMO: What would you do differently with North Korea? Would you slam the door on them again?\\n\\n\\n\\nBIDEN: With North -- yes, I'd make it real clear. Look, you want to talk, you want to deal with us, you want sanctions lifted, show me something ahead of time. Show me.\\n\\n\\n\\nCUOMO: They haven't tested a bad missile.\\n\\n\\n\\nBIDEN: They haven't tested -- and the reason why they haven't tested is they have it all done. They're sitting there with missiles that are -- have capacity and nuclear capacity right now. So they're not giving up anything.\\n\\n\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\n\\n\\nKEILAR: President Trump responding to that, responding to Chris' interview with former Vice President Joe Biden, calling him a bully. Hear what the president has to say, next.\\n\\n\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\n\\n\\n[13:21:03] KEILAR: Well, you just watched part one of our exclusive interview with Vice President Joe Biden.\\n\\n\\n\\nWith us now, CNN's senior political analyst Ryan Lizza and New York Times reporter Astead Herndon, who is with us.\\n\\n\\n\\nSo he was defending himself on race. He was trying certainly to repair some of the damage that Kamala Harris inflicted during the debate.\\n\\n\\n\\nRYAN LIZZA, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST: Yes, I found one of the most interesting moments when he was almost personally offended that Harris brought this up by mentioning her long friendship with Beau Biden. And I know -- I think Kamala Harris has actually talked about that relationship. And he didn't dwell on that for a long time, but he sort of threw it out there. You know, he didn't think she would go there, I'm paraphrasing him, because -- one reason was because she had a relationship with his deceased son, Beau.\\n\\n\\n\\nKEILAR: Is it like a -- is it a --\\n\\n\\n\\nLIZZA: And that makes this much more personal than I can remember any primary fight. I mean he's in a huge field of candidates. He's been in politics a long time. He has to know that everything he's ever said or done or voted on is fair game. And so I don't know if this is just political or if he's genuinely offended by this friendship that she and Beau had, and that's why he's surprised.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut, boy, this makes this a much more personal fight than a political fight at this point -- than a policy fight at this point.\\n\\n\\n\\nKEILAR: He seemed genuinely offended --\\n\\n\\n\\nLIZZA: He did.\\n\\n\\n\\nKEILAR: Because he cut himself off.\\n\\n\\n\\nLIZZA: He did.\\n\\n\\n\\nKEILAR: I think he realized he was actually saying very much what he felt.\\n\\n\\n\\nLIZZA: Yes.\\n\\n\\n\\nKEILAR: And then he said his -- anyway, right? That's what he --\\n\\n\\n\\nLIZZA: And I think it's --\\n\\n\\n\\nKEILAR: Anyway is sort of what he says when he's editing himself.\\n\\n\\n\\nLIZZA: And I'd be very curious to see what the Harris campaign says about that because Biden essentially is hinting here, and I'm curious to see what Astead thinks of this, is hinting here at, you know, because of that friendship, maybe this issue is off limits.\\n\\n\\n\\nKEILAR: Well, Astead, let's listen to that moment. We'll play again what Biden said about being confronted by Kamala Harris.\\n\\n\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\n\\n\\nCHRIS CUOMO, CNN ANCHOR: They're going come after you.\\n\\n\\n\\nJOE BIDEN (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Sure they're going come after me.\\n\\n\\n\\nCUOMO: Were you prepared for them to come after you?\\n\\n\\n\\nBIDEN: I was prepared for them to come after me, but I wasn't prepared for the person coming at me the way she came at -- she knew Beau. She knows me.\\n\\n\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\n\\n\\nKEILAR: It's -- it's -- what did you think? I mean it seems to me that he felt attacked by his son's good friend.\\n\\n\\n\\nASTEAD HERNDON, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST: Yes, I think that that was a really interesting kind of offhand comment that clearly when you say something like that, that's going to get folks' attention. That, you know, Joe Biden is someone who prizes those personal relationships and we know that Senator Harris has talked about how she respected his son.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut it should not be a surprise that people are coming after his record. I mean Senator Harris was someone who kind of prizes that legion of older black voters that Joe Biden currently has a stranglehold on and so she was using that debate moment to try to go at him directly.\\n\\n\\n\\nNow, was he surprised at the kind of personal way she did it, invoking her own story, the way the campaign came with t-shirts with her childhood photo on after, maybe that took the campaign by surprise. But certainly the issue should not be a surprise for Biden. He knew that he was going to be the target on that stage.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut I, you know, I think it's important to remember here that Senator Harris has -- has praised the vice president. She started the kind of speech on the debate by saying I respect you, but then she took it to a place that really has Joe Biden on the back foot as someone who thinks of himself as a civil rights advocate, who has been a real aid and public servant to African-American communities. So this strikes at his whole identity and the way he views his political brand.\\n\\n\\n\\nKEILAR: All right, real quickly, Ryan, did you think this interview -- a one-on-one interview is a better venue for Biden than the debate stage?\\n\\n\\n\\nLIZZA: I think clearly. Yes. Yes.\\n\\n\\n\\nKEILAR: Clearly.\\n\\n\\n\\nLIZZA: Yes. Yes.\\n\\n\\n\\nKEILAR: And, Astead, what do you think?\\n\\n\\n\\nHERNDON: One hundred percent.\\n\\n\\n\\nKEILAR: A hundred percent.\\n\\n\\n\\nOK. So, and why -- why is that? Is that just that sort of -- his ability to sort of have a one-on-one relation -- he wanted to stay above the fray it seemed like. No one likes what Kamala Harris called a food fight is what he seemed to be saying.\\n\\n\\n\\n[13:25:04] LIZZA: Well, first, he's got a good rapport with Chris that, you know, they know each other. And he's able -- look, he doesn't have nine other people sniping at him. He has a chance to answer with longer statements.\\n\\n\\n\\nI thought it was a little strange that he said, you know, he -- oh, you only get 30 seconds to respond. But, I mean, that's the nature of a debate. Everyone knows that. It's not going to be much different when he takes on Trump because, look, there's so many levels of what Harris did here. There's just the pure policy level, was he wrong to oppose federally mandated desegregation via busing back in the '70s? That's one thing. But the other thing, I think maybe even the broader issue is, is he made Biden -- she -- excuse me, she made Biden look unprepared, right? You know --\\n\\n\\n\\nKEILAR: That's right. And he said -- he even said I wasn't prepared for that, right? I think he was expecting a different kind of attack.\\n\\n\\n\\nLIZZA: Right.\\n\\n\\n\\nKEILAR: Now, taking on President Trump, to that point, Ryan, one of the things that stood out to me in this was that he raised the specter of physically taking on President Trump. So you'll recall, in that 2016 town hall debate that Donald Trump had with Hillary Clinton, and I think we actually may have a picture of this, that he was standing kind of menacingly behind Hillary Clinton. It became a meme, right? And he actually said here, you know, if Trump were to walk behind me, and the head -- there's the head-on shot, right? He basically said, you know, if Trump were to walk behind me, hinting at that, what did you think, Astead?\\n\\n\\n\\nHERNDON: Yes, we've seen Vice President Biden do this before, kind of hint at the fact, you know, his brand is kind of a tougher guy and he said, he said I think last year they had a back-and-forth about the kind of physical confrontation again.\\n\\n\\n\\nI think to the broader point, this is him again trying to play to that electability kind of figurative that he wants to present himself as, as the person who can match Trump on his own turf and best him at that.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat I think, though, is the risk here is that this is a Democratic electorate that while Vice President Biden may have enjoyed that reputation months ago as kind of the only person who can deal with Trump on that plane, I think that is what the debate has changed. To Ryan's point, Senator Harris was able to kind of bring him down to earth and look just like those other candidates. And so I think we see in polling now the kind of -- the question of who can best take on Trump, Senator Warren, Senator Harris are seeing bumps in that -- in that question, and that strikes at the real heart of Vice President Biden's campaign and even in statements like that.\\n\\n\\n\\nKEILAR: All right, Astead Herndon, thank you so much.\\n\\n\\n\\nRyan Lizza, thank you for your analysis. Time is running out and the president is growing frustrated, now threatening an executive order to keep the citizenship question on the census with a court deadline to explain the administration's plans for the census just minutes away now.\\n\\n\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)"}
{"original": "This is the transcript of the debate between Democratic presidential candidates Sens. Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama on February 21, 2008 at the University of Texas in Austin.\\n\\nSens. Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton face off in a high-stakes debate, Thursday night. more photos »\\n\\nCNN's CAMPBELL BROWN: And the candidates have taken their seats. We are ready to get started. On behalf of CNN, Univision and the candidates, we want to thank our hosts, the University of Texas and the LBJ School and Library.\\n\\nAnd now I want to give you an idea of what to expect over the next 90 minutes or so. We want to have a real conversation between these two candidates on the issues important to Texas and the entire nation, so we won't have any hard and fast rules for them to follow. We simply ask the candidates to keep their answers to a reasonable length and to stay on point.\\n\\nAnd we have given the candidates the opportunity to make opening statements. The order was determined by a draw. Senator Obama won the draw and elected to go second.\\n\\nSo please go ahead, Senator Clinton.\\n\\nSEN. HILLARY CLINTON: Well, thank you.\\n\\nAnd I am just delighted to be back here in Austin. You know, nearly 36 years ago I came to Austin for my very first political job, and that was registering voters in south Texas. And I had the great privilege of living for a while in Austin and in San Antonio, and meeting people and making friends that have stayed with me for a lifetime.\\n\\nAnd I found that we had a lot in common, a lot of shared values, a belief that hard work is important, that self-reliance and individual responsibility count for a lot.\\n\\nCLINTON: And among the people whom I got to know, who became not only friends, but heroes, were Barbara Jordan, who taught me a lot about courage, and today...\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\n...would actually be her birthday. I remember all the time about how she got up every single morning, facing almost insurmountable odds, to do what she did.\\n\\nAnd another was my great friend Ann Richards, who taught me so much...\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\n... about determination. Ann was a great champion for the people of Texas. She also reminded us that every so often it is good to have a laugh about what it is we're engaged in.\\n\\nAnd as I think back on those years and the work that I've done ever since, you know, for me politics is about making real differences in people's lives. I am very, very proud that over these years I have been able to make a difference in the lives of people in Texas, Ohio and elsewhere.\\n\\nCLINTON: You know, 350,000 children in Texas get health care every month because I helped to start the Children's Health Insurance Program.\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\nAnd 21,000 National Guard and Reserve members get access to health care because I went across the party line and joined up with a Republican senator to make that happen.\\n\\nSo there's a lot that we've already done. But there's so much more to do.\\n\\nI want to take on the tough issues that face us now. I want to stop the health insurance companies from discriminating against people because they're sick. You know, it's unconstitutional to discriminate on the basis of race or gender or ethnic origin or religion, but it's OK to discriminate against sick people.\\n\\nAnd we're going to end that, because it's time we said no more.\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\nAnd I want to continue the work that I've done in the Senate to take care of our veterans.\\n\\nCLINTON: It was shocking and shameful, what happened, that we discovered about a year ago at Walter Reed. We can do so much better, to take care of the people who've taken care of us.\\n\\nAnd there is a lot of work ahead. I offer a lifetime of experience and proven results. And I know that, if we work together, we can take on the special interests, transfer $55 billion of all those giveaways and subsidies that President Bush has given them, back to the middle class, to create jobs and provide health care and make college affordable.\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\nAnd I ask you -- I ask you to join in my campaign. It's now up to the people of Texas, Ohio, and the other states ahead.\\n\\nSo, if you'll be part of this campaign, which is your really your campaign, about your futures, your families, your jobs and your health care, we'll continue to make a difference for America.\\n\\nThank you all very much.\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\nBROWN: Senator Clinton, thank you.\\n\\nBROWN: Senator Obama?\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\nSEN. BARACK OBAMA: First of all, thank you so much to the University of Texas for hosting us, and it's a great honor to share the stage once again with Senator Clinton. I've said before that we've been friends before this campaign started; we'll be friends afterwards, unified to bring about changes in this country.\\n\\nYou know, we are at a defining moment in our history. Our nation is at war, and our economy is increasingly in shambles. And the families of Texas and all across America are feeling the brunt of that failing economy.\\n\\nThis week, I met a couple in San Antonio, who -- as a consequence of entering into a predatory loan -- are on the brink of foreclosure and are actually seeing them having to cut back on their medical expenses, because their mortgage doubled in two weeks.\\n\\nOBAMA: I've met a young woman who gets three hours of sleep a night because she has to work the night shift even as she's going to school full time, and still can't afford to provide the health care for her sister who's ill.\\n\\nIn Youngstown, Ohio, talked to workers who have seen their plants shipped overseas as a consequence of bad trade deals like NAFTA, literally seeing equipment unbolted from the floors of factories and shipped to China, resulting in devastating job losses and communities completely falling apart.\\n\\nAnd all across America I'm meeting not just veterans, but also the parents of those who have fallen.\\n\\nOne mother in Green Bay gave me this bracelet in memory of a 20- year-old son who had been killed in a roadside bomb, as a consequence of a war that I believe should have never been authorized and should have never been waged and has cost us billions of dollars that could have been invested here in the United States in roads and bridges and infrastructure and making sure that young people can go to college and that those who need health care actually get it.\\n\\nOBAMA: Now, Senator Clinton...\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\n... Senator Clinton and I have been talking about these issues for the last 13 months. We both offer detailed proposals to try to deal with them. Some of them are the same. Some we have differences of opinion.\\n\\nBut I think we both recognize that these problems have to be dealt with and that we have seen an administration over the last seven years that has failed to address them and -- in many ways -- has made them worse.\\n\\nBut understand that what is lacking right now is not good ideas.\\n\\nOBAMA: The problem we have is that Washington has become a place where good ideas go to die. They go to die because the lobbyists...\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\nThey go to die because lobbyists and special interests have a strangle-hold on the agenda in Washington. They go to die in Washington because too many politicians are interested in scoring political points rather than bridging differences in order to get things done.\\n\\nAnd so the central premise of this campaign is that we can bring this country together, that we can push against the special interests that have come to dominate the agenda in Washington, that we can be straight with the American people about how we're going to solve these problems and enlist them in taking back their government.\\n\\nYou know, Senator Clinton mentioned Barbara Jordan, somebody who was an inspiration to me and so many people throughout the country. And she said that what the American people want is very simple: They want an America that is as good as its promise.\\n\\nOBAMA: I'm running for president because I want to help America be as good as its promise.\\n\\nThank you very much.\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\nBROWN: All right, Senator Obama, thank you, and let's begin with questions.\\n\\nJorge Ramos?\\n\\nUNIVISION's JORGE RAMOS: Thank you very much (SPEAKING IN SPANISH).\\n\\nThank you so much for being with us, and let me start with a little news. After nearly half a century in office, Fidel Castro resigned as the head of the Cuban government. Ninety miles off the coast of the United States, we might have a new opportunity.\\n\\nThe question for you, Senator Clinton: Would you be willing to sit down with Raul Castro, or whoever leads the Cuban dictatorship when you take office at least just once, to get a measure of the man?\\n\\nCLINTON: Well, Jorge, I hope we have an opportunity. The people of Cuba deserve to have a democracy. And this gives the Cuban government, under Raul Castro, a chance to change direction from the one that was set for 50 years by his brother.\\n\\nI'm going to be looking for some of those changes: releasing political prisoner, ending some of the oppressive practices on the press, opening up the economy.\\n\\nOf course the United States stands ready. And, as president, I would be ready to reach out and work with a new Cuban government, once it demonstrated that it truly was going to change that direction.\\n\\nI want to bring the region together, our European allies who have influence with Cuba, to try to push for some of those changes, and to make it very clear that, if Cuba moves toward democracy and freedom for its people, the United States will welcome that.\\n\\nCLINTON: And as president, I would look for opportunities to try to make that happen and to create the momentum that might eventually lead to a presidential visit.\\n\\nBut there has to be evidence that indeed the changes are real; that they are taking place; and that the Cuban people will finally be given an opportunity to have their future determined by themselves.\\n\\nRAMOS: Very simply, would you meet with him or not, with Raul Castro?\\n\\nCLINTON: I would not meet with him until there was evidence that change was happening, because I think it's important that they demonstrate clearly that they are committed to change the direction. Then I think, you know, something like diplomatic encounters and negotiations over specifics could take place.\\n\\nBut we've had this conversation before, Senator Obama and myself, and I believe that we should have full diplomatic engagement where appropriate. But a presidential visit should not be offered and given without some evidence that it will demonstrate the kind of progress that is in our interest, and in this case, in the interests of the Cuban people.\\n\\nBROWN: Senator Obama, just to follow up, you had said in a previous CNN debate that you would meet with the leaders of Cuban, Iran, North Korea, among others, so presumably you would be willing to meet with the new leader of Cuba.\\n\\nOBAMA: That's correct. Now, keep in mind that the starting point for our policy in Cuba should be the liberty of the Cuban people. And I think we recognize that that liberty has not existed throughout the Castro regime. And we now have an opportunity to potentially change the relationship between the United States and Cuba after over half a century.\\n\\nI would meet without preconditions, although Senator Clinton is right that there has to be preparation. It is very important for us to make sure that there was an agenda, and on that agenda was human rights, releasing of political prisoners, opening up the press. And that preparation might take some time.\\n\\nBut I do think that it's important for the United States not just to talk to its friends, but also to talk to its enemies. In fact, that's where diplomacy makes the biggest difference.\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\nOBAMA: One other thing that I've said, as a show of good faith that we're interested in pursuing potentially a new relationship, what I've called for is a loosening of the restrictions on remittances from family members to the people of Cuba, as well as travel restrictions for family members who want to visit their family members in Cuba.\\n\\nAnd I think that initiating that change in policy as a start and then suggesting that an agenda get set up is something that could be useful, but I would not normalize relations until we started seeing some of the progress that Senator Clinton was talking about.\\n\\nBROWN: But that's different from your position back in 2003. You called U.S. policy toward Cuba a miserable failure, and you supported normalizing relations.\\n\\nBROWN: So you've backtracked now...\\n\\nOBAMA: I support the eventual normalization. And it's absolutely true that I think our policy has been a failure. I mean, the fact is, is that during my entire lifetime, and Senator Clinton's entire lifetime, you essentially have seen a Cuba that has been isolated, but has not made progress when it comes to the issues of political rights and personal freedoms that are so important to the people of Cuba.\\n\\nSo I think that we have to shift policy. I think our goal has to be ultimately normalization. But that's going to happen in steps. And the first step, as I said, is changing our rules with respect to remittances and with respect to travel.\\n\\nAnd then I think it is important for us to have the direct contact, not just in Cuba, but I think this principle applies generally. I recall what John F. Kennedy once said, that we should never negotiate out of fear, but we should never fear to negotiate. And this moment, this opportunity when Fidel Castro has finally stepped down, I think, is one that we should try to take advantage of.\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\nBROWN: Senator Clinton, do you want a quick response?\\n\\nCLINTON: Well, I agree, absolutely, that we should be willing to have diplomatic negotiations and processes with anyone. I've been a strong advocate of opening up such a diplomatic process with Iran, for a number of years.\\n\\nBecause I think we should look for ways that we can possibly move countries that are adversarial to us, you know, toward the world community. It's in our interests. It's in the interests of the people in countries that, frankly, are oppressed, like Cuba, like Iran.\\n\\nBut there has been this difference between us over when and whether the president should offer a meeting, without preconditions, with those with whom we do not have diplomatic relations. And it should be part of a process, but I don't think it should be offered in the beginning. Because I think that undermines the capacity for us to actually take the measure of somebody like Raul Castro or Ahmadinejad and others.\\n\\nCLINTON: And, as President Kennedy said, he wouldn't be afraid to negotiate, but he would expect there to be a lot of preparatory work done, to find out exactly what we would get out of it.\\n\\nAnd therefore, I do think we should be eliminating the policy of the Bush administration, which has been very narrowly defined, and frankly against our interests, because we have failed to reach out to countries, we have alienated our friends, and we have emboldened our enemies.\\n\\nSo I would get back to very vigorous diplomacy, and I would use bipartisan diplomacy. I would ask emissaries from both political parties to represent me and our country, because I want to send a very clear message to the rest of the world that the era of unilateralism, preemption and arrogance of the Bush administration is over and we're going to...\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\nBROWN: Very briefly and then we're going to move on.\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\nOBAMA: I think, as I said before, preparation is actually absolutely critical in any meeting. And I think it is absolutely true that either of us would step back from some of the Bush unilateralism that's caused so much damage.\\n\\nBut I do think it is important precisely because the Bush administration has done so much damage to American foreign relations that the president take a more active role in diplomacy than might have been true 20 or 30 years ago.\\n\\nBecause the problem is, if we think that meeting with the president is a privilege that has to be earned, I think that reinforces the sense that we stand above the rest of the world at this point in time. And I think that it's important for us in undoing the damage that has been done over the last seven years, for the president to be willing to take that extra step.\\n\\nOBAMA: That is the kind of step that I would like to take as president of the United States.\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\nBROWN: A question now on the economy.\\n\\nJohn King?\\n\\nCNN's JOHN KING: Campbell, Senators, good evening, first.\\n\\nI want to bring the conversation back home. You know from your travels -- you don't need to look at the polls or anything else -- that the economy is by far now the dominant issue that voters want to hear about from the candidates.\\n\\nFor some, that is a question about: What should we do about an economy that is at the edge or perhaps in the early stages of a recession? For some, it is more focused. Maybe it is: Will you raise the minimum wage? Maybe it's about trade deals that they think leave them on the raw end, as you mentioned in your opening statement, Senator Obama.\\n\\nBut when we ask Democrats, How are these two candidates different?, they even think they don't know.\\n\\nSenator Obama, beginning with you, tell us as specifically as you can, how would a President Obama be different than a President Clinton in managing the nation's economy?\\n\\nOBAMA: Well, first of all, let me emphasize the point that you just made, which is: You don't need an economist or the Federal Reserve to tell the American people that the economy's in trouble, because they've been experiencing it for years now.\\n\\nEverywhere you go, you meet people who are working harder for less, wages and incomes have flatlined, people are seeing escalating costs of everything from health care to gas at the pump.\\n\\nAnd so people have been struggling for a long time. In some communities, they have been struggling for decades now. So this has to be a priority of the next president.\\n\\nNow, what I've said is that we have to restore a sense of fairness and balance to our economy, and that means a couple of things.\\n\\nNumber one, with our tax code: We've got to stop giving tax breaks to companies that are shipping jobs overseas and invest those tax breaks in companies that are investing here in the United States of America.\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\nWe have to end the Bush tax cuts to the wealthy...\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\n... and to provide tax breaks to middle-class Americans and working Americans who need them.\\n\\nOBAMA: So I've said that if you are making $75,000 a year or less, I want to give an offset to your payroll tax that will mean $1,000 extra in the pockets of ordinary Americans. Senior citizens making less than $50,000, you shouldn't have to pay income tax on your Social Security.\\n\\nWe pay for these by closing tax loopholes and tax havens that are being manipulated.\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\nOn our trade deals, I think it is absolutely critical that we engaged in trade, but it has to be viewed not just through the lens of Wall Street, but also Main Street, which means we've got strong labor standards and strong environmental standards and safety standards, so we don't have toys being shipped in the United States with lead paint on them.\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\nSo these are all issues that I've talked about repeatedly, and I think there are also opportunities in our economy around creating a green economy. We send $1 billion to foreign countries every day because of our addiction to foreign oil.\\n\\nOBAMA: And for us to move rapidly to cap greenhouse gases, generate billions of dollars that we can reinvest in solar and wind and biodiesel -- that can put people back to work. So...\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\nNow, I don't want to take too much time. And I'm sure we'll be spend more time discussing this.\\n\\nSenator Clinton and I, I think, both agree on many of these issues. And I think it's a credit to the Democratic Party as a whole that the other candidates who were involved earlier on agreed with us on many of these issues.\\n\\nI think that there is a real, solid agenda for moving change forward in the next presidency.\\n\\nThe question people are going to have to ask is: How do we get it done?\\n\\nAnd it is my strong belief that the changes are only going to come about if we're able to form a working coalition for change. Because people who were benefiting from the current tax code are going to resist. The special interests and lobbyists are going to resist.\\n\\nAnd I think it has to be a priority for whoever the next president is to be able to overcome the dominance of the special interests in Washington, to bring about the kinds of economic changes that I'm talking about.\\n\\nOBAMA: And that's an area where Senator Clinton and I may have a slight difference. But I'm happy to let her speak first and then can pick up on anything that's been left out.\\n\\nKING: Let's give Senator Clinton that opportunity then.\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\nAs you have campaigned, Senator, on this issue and others, but specifically on this issue, you have said, I am ready on day one to take charge of the economy.\\n\\nThe clear implication, since you have one opponent at the moment, is that you're ready; he's not.\\n\\nWhat would you do differently on day one than a President Obama would when it comes to managing the nation's economy?\\n\\nCLINTON: Well, I would agree with a lot that Senator Obama just said, because it is the Democratic agenda.\\n\\nCLINTON: We are going to rid the tax code of these loopholes and giveaways.\\n\\nWe're going to stop giving a penny of your money to anybody who ships a job out of Texas, Ohio or anywhere else to another country.\\n\\nWe're certainly going to begin to get the tax code to reflect what the needs of middle class families are so we can rebuild a strong and prosperous middle class.\\n\\nYou know, the wealthy and the well-connected have had a president the last seven years, and I think it's time that the rest of America had a president to work for you every single day.\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\nWe will also have a different approach toward trade.\\n\\nWe're going to start having trade agreements that not only have strong environmental and labor standards, but I want to have a trade time-out. We're going to look and see what's working and what's not working, and I'd like to have a trade prosecutor to actually enforce the trade agreements that we have before we enter into any others.\\n\\nWe're also going to put much tougher standards in place so that people cannot import toys with lead paint, contaminated pet food, contaminated drugs into our market. We're going to have much more vigorous enforcement of safety standards.\\n\\nCLINTON: Now, in addition, there are steps I would take immediately. One is on this foreclosure crisis. I have been saying for nearly a year we had to crack down on the abusive practices of the lenders. But we also need a moratorium on home foreclosures.\\n\\nEverywhere I go, I meet people who either have been or about to lose their home. 85,000 homes in foreclosure in Texas; 90,000 in Ohio. I've met the families: the hairdresser, the single mom who's going to lose her home, the postal worker who got really hoodwinked into an agreement that wasn't fair to him.\\n\\nSo I would put a moratorium for 90 days, to give us time to work out a way for people to stay in their homes, and I would freeze interest rates for five years. Because these adjustable-rate mortgages, if they keep going up, millions of Americans are going to be homeless. And vacant homes will be across the neighborhoods of Texas and America.\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\nCLINTON: Now, in addition, there are three ways we need to jump start the economy.\\n\\nClean green jobs; I've been promoting this. I wanted it to be part of the stimulus package. I thought a $5 billion investment in clean green jobs would put hundreds of thousands of Americans to work helping to create our future.\\n\\nWe also need to invest in our infrastructure. We don't have enough roads to take care of the congestion, we have crumbling bridges and tunnels. We need to rebuild America, and that will also put people to work.\\n\\nAnd, finally, we need to end George Bush's war on science, which has been waged against scientists and researchers...\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\nBROWN: Thank you, Senator. And we've got a lot of ground to cover...\\n\\nCLINTON: This is about how we fund the future. We've got to get back to being the innovation nation. Think of everything that goes on at this great university to create the new economy...\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\nBROWN: All right. Senator Clinton, thank you very much.\\n\\nBROWN: And, as I was saying, we've got a lot to get through. So I do want to shift gears and go on to another topic especially important here in Texas, which is immigration.\\n\\nAnd, Jorge, you have a question.\\n\\nRAMOS: (SPEAKING IN SPANISH) Federal raids by immigration enforcement officials on homes and businesses have generated a great deal of fear and anxiety in the Hispanic community and have divided the family of some of the 3 million U.S.-born children who have at least one undocumented parent.\\n\\nWould you consider stopping these raids once you take office until comprehensive immigration reform can be passed?\\n\\nCLINTON: I would consider that, except in egregious situations where it would be appropriate to take the actions you're referring to.\\n\\nBut when we see what's been happening, with literally babies being left with no one to take care of them, children coming home from school, no responsible adult left, that is not the America that I know.\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\nCLINTON: That is against American values. And it is...\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\nAnd it is a stark admission of failure by the federal government. We need comprehensive immigration reform. I have been for this. I signed onto the first comprehensive bill back in 2004. I've been advocating for it: tougher, more secure borders, of course, but let's do it the right way, cracking down on employers, especially once we get to comprehensive immigration reform, who exploit undocumented workers and drive down wages for everyone else.\\n\\nI'd like to see more federal help for communities like Austin and others like Laredo, where I was this morning, that absorb the health care, education, and law enforcement costs.\\n\\nAnd I personally, as president, would work with our neighbors to the south, to help them create more jobs for their own people.\\n\\nFinally, we need a path to legalization, to bring the immigrants out of the shadows, give them the conditions that we expect them to meet, paying a fine for coming here illegally, trying to pay back taxes, over time, and learning English.\\n\\nIf they had a committed a crime in our country or the country they came from, then they should be deported. But for everyone else, there must be a path to legalization. I would introduce that in the first 100 days of my presidency.\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\nBROWN: Senator Obama, is your position the same as Hillary Clinton's?\\n\\nOBAMA: There are a couple of things I would add. Comprehensive immigration reform is something that I have worked on extensively.\\n\\nTwo years ago, we were able to get a bill out of the Senate. I was one of the group of senators that helped to move it through, but it died in the House this year. Because it was used as a political football instead of a way of solving a problem, nothing happened.\\n\\nAnd so there are a couple of things that I would just add to what Senator Clinton said.\\n\\nNumber one, it is absolutely critical that we tone down the rhetoric when it comes to the immigration debate, because there has been an undertone that has been ugly.\\n\\nOftentimes, it has been directed at the Hispanic community. We have seen hate crimes skyrocket in the wake of the immigration debate as it has been conducted in Washington, and that is unacceptable.\\n\\nWe are a nation of laws and we are a nation of immigrants, and we can reconcile those two things. So we need comprehensive reform...\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\n... we need comprehensive reform, and that means stronger border security. It means that we are cracking down on employers that are taking advantage of undocumented workers because they can't complain if they're not paid a minimum wage.\\n\\nOBAMA: They can't complain if they're not getting overtime. Worker safety laws are not being observed.\\n\\nWe have to crack down on those employers, although we also have to make sure that we do it in a way that doesn't lead to people with Spanish surnames being discriminated against, so there's got to be a safeguard there.\\n\\nWe have to require that undocumented workers, who are provided a pathway to citizenship, not only learn English, pay back taxes and pay a significant fine, but also that they're going to the back of the line, so that they are not getting citizenship before those who have applied legally, which raises two last points.\\n\\nNumber one, it is important that we fix the legal immigration system, because right now we've got a backlog that means years for people to apply legally.\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\nAnd what's worse is, we keep on increasing the fees, so that if you've got a hard working immigrant family, they've got to hire a lawyer; they've got to pay thousands of dollars in fees. They just can't afford it. And it's discriminatory against people who have good character, we should want in this country, but don't have the money. So we've got to fix that.\\n\\nOBAMA: So we've got to fix that.\\n\\nThe second thing is, we have to improve our relationship with Mexico and work with the Mexican government so that their economy is producing jobs on that side of the border.\\n\\nAnd the problem that we have...\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\nThe problem that we have is that we have had an administration that came in promising all sorts of leadership on creating a U.S.- Mexican relationship. And, frankly, President Bush dropped the ball. He has been so obsessed with Iraq that we have not seen the kinds of outreach and cooperative work that would ensure that the Mexican economy is working not just for the very wealthy in Mexico, but for all people. And that's as policy that I'm going to change when I'm president of the United States.\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\nBROWN: All right, Senator Obama.\\n\\nWe're going to stay with this topic. I want to have John King ask another question.\\n\\nGo ahead, John.\\n\\nKING: I want to stay on the issue, but move to a controversial item that was not held up when the immigration debate collapsed in Washington, and that is the border fence.\\n\\nKING: To many Americans, it is a simple question of sovereignty and security. America should be able to keep people out that it doesn't want in.\\n\\nBut, as you know in this state, especially if you go to the south of here, along the border, and in other border states, to many people it's a much more personal question. It could be a question of their livelihood. It could be a question of cross-border trade. It might be an issue to a rancher of property rights. It might be a simple question of whether someone can take a walk or a short drive to see their family members.\\n\\nSenator, back in 2006, you voted for the construction of that fence. As you know, progress has been slow.\\n\\nAs president of the United States, would you commit tonight that you would finish the fence and speed up the construction, or do you think it's time for a president of the United States to raise his or her hand and say, You know what? Wait a minute. Let's think about this again. Do we really want to do this?\\n\\nCLINTON: Well, I think both Senator Obama and I voted for that as part of the immigration debate.\\n\\nCLINTON: And having been along the border for the last week or so -- in fact, last night I was at the University of Texas at Brownsville -- and this is how absurd this has become under the Bush administration. Because, you know, there is a smart way to protect our borders, and there is a dumb way to protect our borders.\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\nAnd what I learned last night when I was there with Congressman Ortiz is that the University of Texas at Brownsville would have part of its campus cut off.\\n\\nThis is the kind of absurdity that we're getting from this administration. I know it because I've been fighting with them about the northern border. Their imposition of passports and other kinds of burdens are separating people from families, interfering with business and commerce, the movement of goods and people.\\n\\nSo what I've said is that I would say, wait a minute, we need to review this. There may be places where a physical barrier is appropriate.\\n\\nI think when both of us voted for this, we were voting for the possibility that where it was appropriate and made sense, it would be considered. But as with so much, the Bush administration has gone off the deep end, and they are unfortunately coming up with a plan that I think is counterproductive.\\n\\nCLINTON: So I would have a review. I would listen to the people who live along the border, who understand...\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\n... what it is we need to be doing to protect our country.\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\nBROWN: Let me go on, again -- John?\\n\\nKING: Does that mean that you think your vote was wrong, or the implementation of it was wrong?\\n\\nBecause, as you know, when they first built the fence in the San Diego area, it only went so far. And what it did was it sopped the people coming straight up the path of where that was built, and they simply moved. And California's problem became Arizona's problem.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nCLINTON: But, you know, John, there is -- there's a lot we've learned about technology and smart fencing. You know, there is technology that can be used instead of a physical barrier.\\n\\nCLINTON: It requires us having enough personnel along the border so that people can be supervising a certain limited amount of space and will be able to be responsive in the event of people attempting to cross illegally.\\n\\nI think that the way that the Bush administration is going about this, filing eminent domain actions against landowners and municipalities, makes no sense.\\n\\nSo what I have said is, yes, there are places when after a careful review, again listening to the people who live along the border, there may be limited places where it would work. But let's deploy more technology and personnel, instead of the physical barrier.\\n\\nI frankly think that will work better and it will give us an opportunity to secure our borders without interfering with family relations, business relations, recreation and so much else that makes living along the border, you know, wonderful.\\n\\nBROWN: All right.\\n\\nCLINTON: And the people who live there need to have a president who understands it, will listen to them and be responsive.\\n\\nBROWN: All right, Senator Clinton.\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\nSenator Obama, go ahead please.\\n\\nOBAMA: Well, this is an area where Senator Clinton and I almost entirely agree. I think that the key is to consult with local communities, whether it's on the commercial interests or the environmental stakes of creating any kind of barrier.\\n\\nAnd the Bush administration is not real good at listening. That's not what they do well.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nAnd so I will reverse that policy. As Senator Clinton indicated, there may be areas where it makes sense to have some fencing. But for the most part, having border patrolled, surveillance, deploying effective technology, that's going to be the better approach.\\n\\nThe one thing I do have to say, though, about this issue is, it is very important for us, I think, to deal with this problem in terms of thousands of -- hundreds of thousands of people coming over the borders on a regular basis if we want to also provide opportunity for the 12 million undocumented workers who are here.\\n\\nOBAMA: Senator Clinton and I have both campaigned in places like Iowa and Ohio and my home state of Illinois, and I think that the American people want fairness, want justice. I think they recognize that the idea that you're going to deport 12 million people is ridiculous, that we're not going to be devoting all our law enforcement resources...\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\n... to sending people back.\\n\\nBut what they do also want is some order to the process. And so, we're not going to be able to do these things in isolation. We're not going to be able to deal with the 12 million people who are living in the shadows and give them a way of getting out of the shadows if we don't also deal with the problem of this constant influx of undocumented workers.\\n\\nAnd that's why I think comprehensive reform is so important. That's the kind of leadership that I've shown in the past; that's the kind of leadership that I'll show in the future.\\n\\nOne last point I want to make on the immigration issue because we may be moving to different topics: Something that we can do immediately that I think is very important is to pass the Dream Act, which allows children who through no fault of their own are here but have essentially grown up as Americans, allow them the opportunity for higher education.\\n\\nOBAMA: I do not want two classes of citizens in this country.\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\nI want everybody to prosper. That's going to be a top priority.\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\nBROWN: OK, we've got one last question on immigration.\\n\\nJorge, go ahead.\\n\\nRAMOS: (SPEAKING SPANISH) Right now, there are more than 30 million people in this country who speak Spanish.\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\nMany of them are right here. By the year 2050, there will be 120 million Hispanics in the United States. Now, is there any downside, Senator Clinton, to the United States becoming (SPEAKING SPANISH) becoming a bilingual nation? Is there a limit?\\n\\nCLINTON: Well, I think it's important for as many Americans as possible to do what I have never been able to do, and that is learn another language and try to be bilingual because that connects us to the rest of the world.\\n\\nI think it is important, though, that English remain our common unifying language because that brings our country together in a way that we have seen generations of immigrants coming to our shores be able to be part of the American experience and pursue the American dream.\\n\\nYou know, I have been adamantly against the efforts by some to make English the official language. That I do not believe is appropriate, and I have voted against it and spoken against it.\\n\\nCLINTON: I represent New York. We have 170 languages in New York City alone. And I do not think that we should be, in any way, discriminating against people who do not speak English, who use facilities like hospitals or have to go to court to enforce their rights.\\n\\nBut I do think that English does remain an important part of the American experience. So I encourage people to become bilingual. But I also want to see English remain the common, unifying language of our country.\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\nRAMOS: Senator Obama, is there any down side to the United States becoming a bilingual nation?\\n\\nOBAMA: Well, I think it is important that everyone learns English and that we have that process of binding ourselves together as a country. I think that's very important.\\n\\nI also think that every student should be learning a second language, because...\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\n... you know, so, when you start getting into a debate about bilingual education, for example, now, I want to make sure that children who are coming out of Spanish-speaking households had the opportunity to learn and are not falling behind.\\n\\nOBAMA: If bilingual education helps them do that, I want to give them the opportunity.\\n\\nBut I also want to make sure that English-speaking children are getting foreign languages because this world is becoming more interdependent and part of the process of America's continued leadership in the world is going to be our capacity to communicate across boundaries, across borders, and that's something frankly where we've fallen behind.\\n\\nOne of the failures of No Child Left Behind, a law that I think a lot of local and state officials have been troubled by, is that it is so narrowly focused on standardized tests that it has pushed out a lot of important learning that needs to take place.\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\nAnd foreign languages is one of those areas that I think has been neglected. I want to put more resources into it.\\n\\nBROWN: All right.\\n\\nWe're going to take a quick break. We've got to go to a commercial. We'll be back with a lot more. There is also a debate we should mention raging online right now. Go to our Web site, CNNpolitics.com, and join in. The debate here at the University of Texas in Austin continues right after this.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\nBROWN: And we are back. We're here in Austin, Texas, the capital city. Welcome back to the Texas Democratic debate at the University of Texas, Austin.\\n\\nThe first question now goes to John King.\\n\\nKING: Senator, as I'm sitting here, we're about 45 minutes into the discussion tonight, and I'm having what I like to call one of those parallel universe moments.\\n\\nI've been watching each of you give speeches in arenas not unlike this one individually. And the tone is often quite different than the very polite, substantive discourse we've had tonight.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\nAnd so, I want to ask you about that. There are times when each of you seems to call into question the other one's credibility or truthfulness.\\n\\nAnd, Senator Clinton, I want to talk specifically about some words you've spoken here in the state of Texas over the past couple of days.\\n\\nYou've said, quote, My opponent gives speeches; I offer solutions.\\n\\nYou said the choice for Democrats in this campaign is, quote, talk versus action.\\n\\nNow, in a campaign that some of us are old enough to remember, maybe not many of the students here, this would be called the Where's the beef? question.\\n\\nBut, since we're in Texas, I'd like to borrow a phrase that they often use here and you've used yourself in the context of President Bush. Are you saying that your opponent is all hat and no cattle, and can you say that after the last 45 minutes?\\n\\nCLINTON: Well, I have said that about President Bush, and I think our next president needs to be a lot less hat and a lot more cattle.\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\nYou know, I think you can tell from the first 45 minutes, you know, Senator Obama and I have a lot in common. We both care passionately about our country. We are devoted to public service. We care deeply about the future, and we have run a very vigorous and contested primary campaign, which has been by most standards, I think, very positive and extremely civil.\\n\\nCLINTON: But there are differences between us. And I think, in our efforts to draw those contrasts and comparisons, we obviously try to let voters know how we see the world differently.\\n\\nAnd I do offer solutions. That's what I believe in and what I have done. And it's what I offer to voters because it's part of my life, over the last 35 years, working to get kids health care, working to expand legal services for the poor, working to register voters, working to make a difference. Because I think that this country has given me so much.\\n\\nAnd there are differences between our records and our accomplishments. I have to confess, I was somewhat amused, the other night, when, on one of the TV shows, one of Senator Obama's supporters couldn't.\\n\\nSo I know that there are comparisons and contrasts to be drawn between us. And it's important that voters get that information. So, yes, I do think that words are important and words matter, but actions speak louder than words. And I offer...\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\nBROWN: Senator Obama, go ahead.\\n\\nBROWN: Senator Obama, do you want to respond?\\n\\nOBAMA: Well, I think actions do speak louder than words, which is why over the 20 years of my public service I have acted a lot to provide health care to people who didn't have it, to provide tax breaks to families that needed it, to reform a criminal justice system that had resulted in wrongful convictions, to open up our government and to pass the toughest ethics reform legislation since Watergate, to make sure that we create transparency...\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\n... to make sure that we create transparency in our government so that we know where federal spending is going and it's not going to a bunch of boondoggles and earmarks that are wasting taxpayer money that could be spent on things like early childhood education.\\n\\nYou know, I think if you talk to those wounded warriors at Walter Reed who, prior to me getting to the Senate, were having to pay for their meals and have to pay for their phone calls to their family while they're recovering from amputations, I think they've said that I've engaged not just in talk, but in action.\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\nOBAMA: Now, I think that Senator Clinton has a fine record and I don't want to denigrate that record. I do think there is a fundamental difference between us in terms of how change comes about. Senator Clinton of late has said: Let's get real. The implication is that the people who've been voting for me or involved in my campaign are somehow delusional.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nAnd that, you know, the 20 million people who've been paying attention to 19 debates and the editorial boards all across the country at newspapers who have given me endorsements, including every major newspaper here in the state of Texas.\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\nOBAMA: You know, the thinking is that somehow, they're being duped, and eventually they're going to see the reality of things.\\n\\nWell, I think they perceive reality of what's going on in Washington very clearly. What they see is that if we don't bring the country together, stop the endless bickering, actually focus on solutions and reduce the special interests that have dominated Washington, then we will not get anything done. And the reason that this campaign has done so well...\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\nThe reason that this campaign has done so well is because people understand that it is not just a matter of putting forward policy positions.\\n\\nOBAMA: Senator Clinton and I share a lot of policy positions. But if we can't inspire the American people to get involved in their government and if we can't inspire them to go beyond the racial divisions and the religious divisions and the regional divisions that have plagued our politics for so long, then we will continue to see the kind of gridlock and nonperformance in Washington that is resulting in families suffering in very real ways.\\n\\nI'm running for president to start doing something about that suffering, and so are the people who are behind my campaign.\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\nBROWN: I think one of the points -- I think one of the points that John King was alluding to in talking about some of Senator Clinton's comments is there has been a lot of attention lately on some of your speeches, that they are very similar to some of the speeches by your friend and supporter Deval Patrick, the governor of Massachusetts, and Senator Clinton's campaign has made a big issue of this. To be blunt, they've accused you of plagiarism.\\n\\nOBAMA: Right.\\n\\nBROWN: How do you respond?\\n\\nOBAMA: Well, look, the -- first of all, it's not a lot of speeches. There are two lines in speeches that I've been giving over the last couple of weeks.\\n\\nI've been campaigning now for the last two years. Deval is a national co-chairman of my campaign, and suggested an argument that I share, that words are important. Words matter. And the implication that they don't I think diminishes how important it is to speak to the American people directly about making America as good as its promise. Barbara Jordan understood this as well as anybody.\\n\\nOBAMA: And the notion that I had plagiarized from somebody who was one of my national co-chairs...\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\n... who gave me the line and suggested that I use it, I think, is silly, and...\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\n... you know, this is where we start getting into silly season, in politics, and I think people start getting discouraged about it...\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\n... and they don't want...\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\nWhat they want is, how are we going to create good jobs and good wages?\\n\\nHow are we going to provide health care to the American people?\\n\\nHow are we going to make sure that college is affordable?\\n\\nSo what I've been talking about, in this speeches -- and I've got to admit, some of them are pretty good.\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\nWhat I've been talking about is not just hope and not just inspiration. It's a $4,000 tuition credit for every student, every year, in exchange for national service...\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\n... so that college becomes more affordable.\\n\\nOBAMA: I've been talking about making sure that we change our tax code so that working families actually get relief. I have been talking about making sure that we bring an end to this war in Iraq so that we can start bringing our troops home and invest money here in the United States.\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\nSo just to finish up, these are very specific, concrete, detailed proposals, many of them which I have been working on for years now. Senator Clinton has a fine record. So do I. I'm happy to have a debate on the issues, but what we shouldn't be spending time doing is tearing each other down. We should be spending time lifting the country up.\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\nBROWN: Senator Clinton, is it the silly season?\\n\\nCLINTON: Well, I think that if your candidacy is going to be about words, then they should be your own words. That's, I think, a very simple proposition.\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\nAnd, you know, lifting whole passages from someone else's speeches is not change you can believe in, it's change you can Xerox. And I just don't think...\\n\\nOBAMA: Come on.\\n\\n(CROSSTALK)\\n\\nCLINTON: No, but, you know, but, Barack, it is.\\n\\nBecause, you know, if you look -- if you look -- if you look at the YouTube of these videos, it does raise questions.\\n\\nNow, there is no doubt that you are a passionate, eloquent speaker, and I applaud you for that. But when you look at what we face in this country, we do need to unite the country, but we have to unite it for a purpose around very specific goals.\\n\\nCLINTON: It is not enough to say, Let's come together. We know we're going to have to work hard to overcome the opposition of those who do not want the changes to get to universal health care.\\n\\nYou know, when I proposed a universal health care plan, as did Senator Edwards, we took a big risk, because we know it's politically controversial to say we're going to cover everyone.\\n\\nAnd you chose not to do that. You chose to put forth a health care plan that will leave out at least 15 million people. That's a big difference.\\n\\nWhen I said we should put a moratorium on home foreclosures, basically your response was, well, that wouldn't work.\\n\\nAnd, you know, in the last week, even President Bush has said we have to do something like that.\\n\\nI just believe that we've got to look hard at the difficult challenges we face, especially after George Bush leaves the White House.\\n\\nCLINTON: The world will breathe a sigh of relief once he is gone. We all know that.\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\nBut then we've got to do the hard work of not just bringing the country together, but overcoming a lot of the entrenched opposition to the very ideas that both of us believe in, and for some of us have been fighting for, for a very long time. You know, when I took on...\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\nWhen I took on universal health care back in '93 and '94, it was against a firestorm of special interest opposition. I was more than happy to do that, because I believe passionately in getting quality affordable health care to every American.\\n\\nI don't want to leave anybody out. I see the results of leaving people out. I am tired of health insurance companies deciding who will live or die in America.\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\nBROWN: All right, Senator Clinton, thank you.\\n\\nSenator Obama, please respond.\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\nOBAMA: Well, I think that Senator Clinton mentioned two specific issue areas where we've got some differences. I'm happy to debate those, which is what I think should be the focus of this campaign. We both want universal health care.\\n\\nWhen I released my plan a few months later, we were in a debate and Senator Clinton said we all want universal health care. Of course, I was down 20 points in the polls at the time, and so my plan was pretty good. It's not as good now, but my plan hasn't changed. The politics have changed a little bit.\\n\\nWe both -- 95 percent of our plans are similar. We both want to set up a system in which any person is going to be able to get coverage that is as good as we have as members of Congress. And we are going to subsidize those who can't afford it.\\n\\nOBAMA: We're going to make sure that we reduce costs by emphasizing prevention. And I want to make sure that we're applying technology to improve quality, cut bureaucracy.\\n\\nNow, I also want to make sure that we're reducing costs for those who already have health insurance. So we put in place a catastrophic reinsurance plan that would reduce costs by $2,500 per family per year.\\n\\nSo we've got a lot of similarities in our plan. We've got a philosophical difference, which we've debated repeatedly, and that is that Senator Clinton believes the only way to achieve universal health care is to force everybody to purchase it.\\n\\nAnd my belief is, the reason that people don't have it is not because they don't want it but because they can't afford it.\\n\\nAnd so I emphasize reducing costs.\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\nAnd as has been noted by many observers, including Bill Clinton's former secretary of labor, my plan does more than anybody to reduce costs, and there is nobody out there who wants health insurance who can't have it.\\n\\nOBAMA: Now, there are legitimate arguments for why Senator Clinton and others have called for a mandate, and I'm happy to have that debate.\\n\\nBut the notion that I am leaving 15 million people out somehow implies that we are different in our goals of providing coverage to all Americans, and that is simply not true. We think that there's going to be a different way of getting there.\\n\\nOne last point I want to make on the health care front. I admire the fact that Senator Clinton tried to bring about health care reform back in 1993. She deserves credit for that.\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\nBut I said before, I think she did it in the wrong way, because it wasn't just the fact that the insurance companies, the drug companies were battling here, and no doubt they were. It was also that Senator Clinton and the administration went behind closed doors, excluded the participation even of Democratic members of Congress who had slightly different ideas than the ones that Senator Clinton had put forward.\\n\\nAnd, as a consequence, it was much more difficult to get Congress to cooperate.\\n\\nOBAMA: And I've said that I'm going to do things differently. I think we have to open up the process. Everybody has to have a seat at the table. And most importantly, the American people have to be involved and educated about how this change is going to be brought about.\\n\\nThe point is this, you know, we can have great plans, but if we don't change how the politics is working in Washington, then neither of our plans are going to happen, and we're going to be four years from now debating once again how we're going to bring universal health care to this country.\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\nBROWN: All right, we've got some time constraints here, so we've got to take another real quick break. Stay with us. We've got a lot more ahead.\\n\\nYou can compare the candidates on the issues any time; just go to our Web site, Cnnpolitics.com. A lot more ahead here at the University of Texas. We'll be right back.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\nBROWN: An enthusiastic crowd here at the University of Texas.\\n\\nWelcome back to the Texas Democratic debate. Let's get right to it. Jorge Ramos with the next question.\\n\\nRAMOS: Senator Clinton, yesterday you said, and I'm quoting, One of us is ready to be commander in chief.\\n\\nAre you saying that Senator Obama is not ready and not qualified to be commander in chief?\\n\\nCLINTON: Well, I believe that I am ready and I am prepared. And I will leave that to the voters to decide.\\n\\nBut I want to get back to health care, because I didn't get a chance to respond after Senator Obama finished. No, let me finish, Jorge...\\n\\nRAMOS: But I would like to come back...\\n\\nCLINTON: This is a significant difference. You know, Senator Obama has said it's a philosophical difference. I think it's a substantive difference.\\n\\nHe has a mandate for parents to be sure to ensure their children. I agree with that. I just know that if we don't go and require everyone to have health insurance, the health insurance industry will still game the system. Everyone of us with insurance will pay the hidden tax of approximately $900 a year to make up for the lack of insurance.\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\nAnd you know, in one of our earlier debates, John Edwards made a great point. It would be as though Social Security were voluntary. Medicare, one of the great accomplishments of President Johnson, was voluntary.\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\nI do not believe that is going to work. So it's not just a philosophical difference.\\n\\nCLINTON: You look at what will work and what will not work. If you do not have a plan that starts out attempting to achieve universal health care, you will be nibbled to death, and we will be back here with more and more people uninsured and rising costs.\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\nBROWN: All right. We appreciate that you want to make a point, Senator Obama. We have limited time, so I would like Jorge to move on to another subject or we're going to be out of time.\\n\\n(CROSSTALK)\\n\\nOBAMA: Well, I understand. But I think that Senator Clinton made a...\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nYou know, she's making a point, and I think I should have the opportunity to respond very briefly. And I'll try to make...\\n\\nBROWN: Very briefly, absolutely.\\n\\nOBAMA: Number one, understand that when Senator Clinton says a mandate, it's not a mandate on government to provide health insurance, it's a mandate on individuals to purchase it. And Senator Clinton is right; we have to find out what works.\\n\\nOBAMA: Now, Massachusetts has a mandate right now. They have exempted 20 percent of the uninsured because they have concluded that that 20 percent can't afford it.\\n\\nIn some cases, there are people who are paying fines and still can't afford it, so now they're worse off than they were. They don't have health insurance and they're paying a fine.\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\nIn order for you to force people to get health insurance, you've got to have a very harsh penalty, and Senator Clinton has said that we won't go after their wages. Now, this is a substantive difference. But understand that both of us seek to get universal health care. I have a substantive difference with Senator Clinton on how to get there.\\n\\nBROWN: All right, Senator Clinton?\\n\\nCLINTON: Wait a minute, no, this is too important. This is the number one issue that people talk to me about. You know, when a mother grabs my arm and says, I can't get the operation my son needs because I don't have health insurance, it is personal for me.\\n\\nCLINTON: And I just fundamentally disagree.\\n\\nYou know, Senator Obama's plan has a mandate on parents and a fine if parents do not...\\n\\nOBAMA: That's right.\\n\\nCLINTON: ... insure their children.\\n\\nOBAMA: That's right.\\n\\nCLINTON: Because he recognizes that unless we have some kind of restriction, we will not get there.\\n\\nOBAMA: There's a reason.\\n\\nCLINTON: He's also said that if people show up at a hospital sick, without health insurance, well, maybe at that point you can fine them.\\n\\nWe would not have a social compact with Social Security and Medicare if everyone did not have to participate. I want a universal health care plan.\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\nOBAMA: Now, that's -- that mother -- that mother who is desperate to get health care for her child, will be able to get that health care under my plan. Point number one.\\n\\nPoint number two, the reason a mandate for children can be effective is we've got an ability to make affordable health care available to that child, right now.\\n\\nOBAMA: There are no excuses. If a parent is not providing health care for that child, it's because the parent's not being responsible, under my plan. And those children don't have a choice. But I think that adults are going to be able to see that they can afford it, under my plan; they will get it, under my plan.\\n\\nAnd it is true that, if it turns out that some are gaming the system, then we can impose, potentially, some penalties on them for gaming the system.\\n\\nBut the notion that, somehow, I am interested in leaving out 15 million people, without health insurance, is simply not true.\\n\\nBROWN: All right. Jorge...\\n\\nCLINTON: We disagree on that.\\n\\nBROWN: OK. Jorge -- let's let Jorge re-ask his question, because I don't think anyone remembers that one.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nRAMOS: Let me try again, and not in Spanish, OK?\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nHere we go again. Because we also believe the war in Iraq is very important.\\n\\nAnd here's the question. Are you suggesting that Senator Obama is not ready; he doesn't have the experience to be commander in chief? That's a question of: What did you mean by that phrase?\\n\\nCLINTON: What I mean is that, you know, for more than 15 years, I've been honored to represent our country in more than 80 countries to negotiate on matters such as opening borders for refugees during the war in Kosovo, to stand up for women's rights as human rights around the world. I've served on the Senate...\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\nI've served on the Senate Armed Services Committee, and I have worked as one of the leaders in the Congress on behalf of Homeland Security in the very difficult challenges we face.\\n\\nYou know, just this week, it's a good example. We had elections in Pakistan, we had change in government in Cuba -- or at least the leadership. We've had the elections that, you know, should have happened that haven't happened and just changed the leader the way they do in Cuba. We've had Kosovo declaring independence, and we have had our embassy set on fire in Serbia.\\n\\nSo we have serious problems that pose a real question about presidential leadership, and also some great opportunities. You know, we now have opportunities perhaps with Cuba, I hope with President Musharraf, for him to do the right thing.\\n\\nCLINTON: I supported the independence of Kosovo because I think it is imperative that in the heart of Europe we continue to promote independence and democracy. And I would be moving very aggressively to hold the Serbian government responsible with their security forces to protect our embassy. Under international law, they should be doing that.\\n\\nSo when you think about everything that is going to happen, what we can predict and what we cannot predict, I believe that I am prepared and ready on day one to be commander in chief, to be the president, to turn our economy around, and to begin making a lot of these very difficult decisions that we will inherit from George Bush. And that is what I am putting forth to the voters.\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\nBROWN: Senator Obama?\\n\\nOBAMA: I wouldn't be running if I didn't think I was prepared to be commander-in-chief.\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\nMy number one job as president will be to keep the American people safe. I will do whatever is required to accomplish that. I will not hesitate to act against those that would do America harm.\\n\\nNow, that involves maintaining the strongest military on earth, which means that we are training our troops properly and equipping them properly, and putting them on proper rotations. And there are an awful lot of families here in Texas who have been burdened under two and three and four tours because of the poor planning of the current commander-in-chief, and that will end when I am president.\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\nOBAMA: But it also means using our military wisely. And on what I believe was the single most important foreign policy decision of this generation, whether or not to go to war in Iraq, I believe I showed the judgment of a commander in chief. And I think that Senator Clinton was wrong in her judgments on that.\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\nNow, that has consequences -- that has significant consequences, because it has diverted attention from Afghanistan where al Qaeda, that killed 3,000 Americans, are stronger now than at any time since 2001.\\n\\nYou know, I've heard from an Army captain who was the head of a rifle platoon -- supposed to have 39 men in a rifle platoon. Ended up being sent to Afghanistan with 24 because 15 of those soldiers had been sent to Iraq.\\n\\nOBAMA: And as a consequence, they didn't have enough ammunition, they didn't have enough humvees. They were actually capturing Taliban weapons, because it was easier to get Taliban weapons than it was for them to get properly equipped by our current commander in chief.\\n\\nNow, that's a consequence of bad judgment. And you know, the question is, on the critical issues that we face right now, who's going to show the judgment to lead? And I think that on every critical issue that we've seen in foreign policy over the last several years -- going into Iraq originally, I didn't just oppose it for the sake of opposing it.\\n\\nI said this is going to distract us from Afghanistan; this is going to fan the flames of anti-American sentiment; it's going to cost us billions of dollars and thousands of lives and overstretch our military. And I was right.\\n\\nOn the question of Pakistan, which Senator Clinton just raised -- we just had an election there. But I've said very clearly that we have put all our eggs in the Musharraf basket. That was a mistake. We should be going after al Qaeda and making sure that Pakistan is serious about hunting down terrorists, as well as expanding democracy. And I was right about that.\\n\\nOn the issues that have come up that a commander in chief is going to have to make decisions on, I have shown the judgment to lead. That is the leadership that I want to show when I'm president of the United States.\\n\\nOBAMA: On the issues that have come up, that a commander in chief is going to have to make decisions on, I have shown the judgment to lead. That is the leadership that I want to show when I'm president of the United States.\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\nBROWN: All right. We're going to stay with this and stay on Iraq.\\n\\nJohn King?\\n\\nKING: I want to continue in this vein, and hone in on the very point you just made. Because one of you, unless this remarkable campaign here takes another wacky, unpredictable turn, is going to be running against a decorated war hero, who is going to say that you don't have the experience to be commander in chief.\\n\\nAnd you have both said, it's not about that type of experience; it's about judgment.\\n\\nYou both had to make a judgment, a short time ago, in your job in the United States Senate, about whether to support the surge. And as that was going on, Senator Clinton, you had the commanding general in Iraq before you. And you said, I think that the reports provide to us really require the willing suspension of disbelief -- your words to General Petraeus.\\n\\nKING: I want you to look at Iraq now and listen to those who say the security situation is better. Ideal, no, but better -- some say significantly, in recent days, even some steps toward a political reconciliation.\\n\\nIs Iraq today better off than it was six months or a year ago because of the surge?\\n\\nCLINTON: Well, John, I think you forget a very important premise of the surge. The rationale of the surge was to create the space and time for the Iraqi government to make the decisions that only it can make.\\n\\nNow, there is no doubt, given the skill and the commitment of our young men and women in uniform that putting more of them in will give us a tactical advantage and will provide security in some places, and that has occurred.\\n\\nCLINTON: But the fact is that the purpose of it has not been fulfilled. The Iraqi government has slowly inched toward making a few of the decisions in a less than complete way, but it hasn't taken advantage of the sacrifice and the losses of life and billions of dollars that have occurred since the surge began.\\n\\nThat is why I have said, upon taking office I would ask the secretary of defense and the Joint Chiefs of Staff and my security advisers to give me a plan so that I could begin withdrawing our troops within 60 days.\\n\\nAnd I would begin that with...\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\n... with a very clear message to the Iraqis that they no longer had a blank check, as they had been given by President Bush, that as we withdraw our troops, probably one to two brigades a month, they would have to step up and make these decisions.\\n\\nCLINTON: I believe that is in the best interest of our military, which has been stretched thin.\\n\\nLast night in Brownsville, you know, a woman grabbed my hand and said, Please, my husband's there for the third time. Bring him home.\\n\\nAnd I told her privately what I have said publicly many times -- I will bring him home because I do not think it is in the interest of America or of the Iraqis that we continue to be there. It is up to the Iraqis to decide the kind of future they will have.\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\nBROWN: Senator Obama, in the same vein, you were also opposed to the surge from the beginning. Were you wrong?\\n\\nOBAMA: Well, I think it is indisputable that we've seen violence reduced in Iraq. And that's a credit to our brave men and women in uniform.\\n\\nIn fact, you know, the 1st Cavalry, out of Fort Hood, played an enormous role in pushing back al Qaeda out of Baghdad.\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\nOBAMA: And, you know, we honor their service.\\n\\nBut this is a tactical victory imposed upon a huge strategic blunder.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nAnd I think that, when we're having a debate with John McCain, it is going to be much easier for the candidate who was opposed to the concept of invading Iraq in the first place to have a debate about the wisdom of that decision...\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\n... than having to argue about the tactics subsequent to the decision.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nBecause, ultimately, that's what's at stake. Understand, not only have we been diverted from Afghanistan. We've been diverted from focusing on Latin America.\\n\\nWe contribute -- our entire foreign aid to Latin America is $2.7 billion, approximately what we spend in Iraq in a week.\\n\\nOBAMA: And it is any surprise, then, that you've seen people like Hugo Chavez and countries like China move into the void, because we've been neglectful of that.\\n\\nIran is the single biggest strategic beneficiary of us having invaded Iraq, and that is something that I think John McCain has to come to terms with.\\n\\nSo that is a debate that I'm happy to have.\\n\\nOne last point I want to make on this, and that is, the incredible burden that has been placed on the American people, starting with military families, and the fact that we still are not doing right by our veterans, that we still don't honor their service, that there are still homeless veterans, that we still don't screen properly for post-traumatic stress disorder and make sure that they're getting mental services that they need, that we are still...\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\n... having veterans in south Texas have to drive 250 miles to access a veterans hospital.\\n\\nOBAMA: That's unacceptable. But we talked about the economy earlier, the fact that we're spending $12 billion every month in Iraq means that we can't engage in the kind of infrastructure improvements that are going to make us more competitive. It means that we can't deliver on the kinds of health care reforms that both Senator Clinton and I are looking for.\\n\\nAnd that is also an argument that we have to have with John McCain because he has said that he is willing to have these troops over there for 100 years. The notion that we would sustain that kind of effort and neglect not only making us more secure here at home, more competitive here at home, allow our economy to sink. As John McCain says, he doesn't really understand the economy that well. It is clear from his embrace of George Bush's policies that he doesn't, and that's what I intend to change when I am president of the United States of America.\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\nBROWN: All right. We've got to take another quick break. We've got a lot more ahead. Stay with us. We'll be right back.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\nBROWN: Welcome back to the Texas Democratic debate.\\n\\nStay with us after the debate. Anderson Cooper and the best political team on television will have lots of analysis.\\n\\nBut back to the debate.\\n\\nJohn King?\\n\\nKING: Thank you.\\n\\nBoth of you have been harshly critical of the Bush administration for its secrecy, what you consider overuse of secrecy and executive power.\\n\\nTonight, Senator Obama, you've talked about more transparency. You also at one point criticized earmarks.\\n\\nAnd yet, a recent report came out that identified you -- lower on the list in terms how much money senators seek and sneak into the budget for these pork barrel spending projects, but it still said you were responsible for $91 million in earmarks.\\n\\nAnd you have refused to say where the money went, what it's for. Why?\\n\\nOBAMA: No, that's not true. We've actually disclosed, John, all our earmarks. And so, you know, we'll be happy to provide you with that information, because I believe very strongly in transparency.\\n\\nOBAMA: As I indicated earlier, one of the things that I did last year was to pass a bill with Tom Coburn, very conservative Republican but a sincere fiscal conservative. And we got together and created what we call Google for Government. It's a searchable database, where every single dollar of federal spending is posted on the Internet, so that ordinary voters can take a look. And if they see a bridge to nowhere being built, they know where it's going and who sponsored it. And if they see a no-bid contract going to Halliburton, they can check that out, too.\\n\\nAnd you know, the idea is that we open up the process so that the American people can make judgments about whether or not government is doing what it's supposed to be doing with its taxpayer money. And I've been consistently in favor of more disclosure around earmarks.\\n\\nOBAMA: Now, keep in mind, a lot of these are worthy projects in our states. I have actively pursued projects that I think are important. But I want to make sure that they're not done in the dark of night, that they're not done in committee, that everybody stands up and says, this is the kind of spending that I think is important.\\n\\nI have consistently supported those efforts. I will push for those as president of the United States of America.\\n\\nKING: Senator Clinton, as you know, I think your number was about $342 million. You say they're worthy projects, as Senator Obama did, for your state and that's part of your job, to get money for worthy projects back in your state.\\n\\nSenator McCain, as you know, is proud of going around the country earmark.\\n\\nOn the specific issue of pork barrel spending, fiscal accountability by the government at a time when many Americans frankly think, whether it is the House or the Senate, that you all waste money on things that aren't important to them, don't affect their daily lives, does he have a better case to make to the American people that, I have done this my entire career; I will do it as president, on the issue of on the issue of wasteful pork barrel spending?\\n\\nCLINTON: Well, no, not at all. Because he supported the wasteful tax cuts of the Bush administration and the Iraq war, with the billions of dollars...\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\n... that have been spent, and wants it to continue.\\n\\nYou know, when President Bush came into office, he inherited a balanced budget and a surplus. And it is gone. And we now are looking at a projected deficit of $400 billion, under the new Bush budget, and a $9 trillion debt.\\n\\nWe borrow money from the Chinese to buy oil from the Saudis. That is not a winning strategy for America.\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\nI will get us back to fiscal responsibility. And I will make it clear that the Bush tax cuts on the upper income, those making more than $250,000 a year, will be allowed to expire.\\n\\nCLINTON: Middle-class tax cuts and support for the middle class, to make college affordable, retirement security possible, health insurance affordable: Those will be my priorities.\\n\\nAnd I think it's important that we look at where the money has gone under President Bush -- no-bid contracts, cronyism, outsourcing the government in ways that haven't saved us money and have reduced accountability.\\n\\nSo the larger question is, who really is going to move us toward fiscal responsibility, and I believe that we can get back on the path we were on. It was working well. It was one of the reasons why the economy was booming.\\n\\nI've got that, you know, clearly in my economic blueprint, which is something that I've published the last few days, because it's part of what we have to do again. And I think that I will be very comfortable and effective in taking on Senator McCain over the fiscal irresponsibility of the Republican Party that he's been a part of.\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\nBROWN: All right.\\n\\nAn issue relating to the current election.\\n\\nJorge?\\n\\nRAMOS: As we can see, this has been an extremely close nomination battle that will come down to superdelegates. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, the highest ranking Democrat in government, said recently, and I'm quoting, It would be a problem -- and this is a question for you, Senator Clinton -- it would be a problem for the party if the verdict would be something different than the public has decided.\\n\\nDo you agree?\\n\\nCLINTON: Well, you know, these are the rules that are followed, and you know, I think that it will sort itself out. I'm not worried about that. We will have a nominee, and we will have a unified Democratic Party, and we will go on to victory in November.\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\nBROWN: Senator Obama, go ahead. Do you have a response to Senator Clinton?\\n\\nOBAMA: Well, I think it is important, given how hard Senator Clinton and I have been working, that these primaries and caucuses count for something. And so my belief is that...\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\n... the will of the voters, expressed in this long election process, is what ultimately will determine who our next nominee is going to be.\\n\\nOBAMA: But understand what I think is most important to the voters, and that is that we have a government that is listening to them again. They feel as if they've been shut out.\\n\\nYou know, when I meet mothers who are trying to figure out how to get health care for their kids, it's not just the desperation of that single mom. It's also that when they try to find some help, oftentimes they're hitting a brick wall.\\n\\nAnd they don't get a sense that the debates that are happening in Washington right now relate to them at all. And what they believe is that people are trying to get on TV and they're trying to score points and they're trying to win elections, and that they're not interested in knocking down the barriers that stand between the American people and their dreams.\\n\\nAnd I have no doubt that the Democratic Party at its best can summon a sense of common purpose again and higher purpose for the American people.\\n\\nOBAMA: And I think that the next nominee going into the November election is going to have a lot to talk about because the American people are tired of politics that is dominated by the powerful, by the connected. They want their government back, and that's what I intend to provide them when I'm nominated for president of the United States.\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\nBROWN: We have time for just one final question, and we thought we would sort of end on a more philosophical question. You've both spent a lot of time talking about leadership, about who's ready and who has the right judgment to lead if elected president.\\n\\nA leader's judgment is most tested at times of crisis. I'm wondering if both of you will describe what was the moment that tested you the most, that moment of crisis.\\n\\nBROWN: Senator Obama?\\n\\nOBAMA: Well, you know, I wouldn't point to a single moment. But what I look at is the trajectory of my life because, you know, I was raised by a single mom. My father left when I was two, and I was raised by my mother and my grandparents.\\n\\nAnd, you know, there were rocky periods during my youth, when I made mistakes and was off course. And what was most important, in my life, was learning to take responsibility for my own actions, learning to take responsibility for not only my own actions but how I can bring people together to actually have an impact on the world.\\n\\nAnd so, working as a community organizer on the streets of Chicago, with ordinary people, bringing them together and organizing them to provide jobs and health care, economic security to people who didn't have it, then working as a civil rights attorney and rejecting the jobs on Wall Street to fight for those who were being discriminated against on the job -- that cumulative experience, I think, is the judgment that I now bring.\\n\\nOBAMA: It's the reason that I have the capacity to bring people together, and it's the reason why I am determined to make sure that the American people get a government that is worthy of their decency and their generosity.\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\nBROWN: Senator Clinton?\\n\\nCLINTON: Well, I think everybody here knows I've lived through some crises and some challenging moments in my life. And...\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\nAnd I am grateful for the support and the prayers of countless Americans.\\n\\nBut people often ask me, How do you do it? You know, How do you keep going? And I just have to shake my head in wonderment, because with all of the challenges that I've had, they are nothing compared to what I see happening in the lives of Americans every single day. along with Senator McCain, as the only two elected officials, to speak at the opening at the Intrepid Center at Brooke Medical Center in San Antonio, a center designed to take care of and provide rehabilitation for our brave young men and women who have been injured in war.\\n\\nAnd I remember sitting up there and watching them come in. Those who could walk were walking. Those who had lost limbs were trying with great courage to get themselves in without the help of others. Some were in wheelchairs and some were on gurneys. And the speaker representing these wounded warriors had had most of his face disfigured by the results of fire from a roadside bomb.\\n\\nCLINTON: You know, the hits I've taken in life are nothing compared to what goes on every single day in the lives of people across our country.\\n\\nAnd I resolved at a very young age that I'd been blessed and that I was called by my faith and by my upbringing to do what I could to give others the same opportunities and blessings that I took for granted.\\n\\nThat's what gets me up in the morning. That's what motivates me in this campaign.\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\nAnd, you know, no matter what happens in this contest -- and I am honored, I am honored to be here with Barack Obama. I am absolutely honored.\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\nCLINTON: Whatever happens, we're going to be fine. You know, we have strong support from our families and our friends. I just hope that we'll be able to say the same thing about the American people, and that's what this election should be about.\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\nBROWN: All right, a standing ovation here in Austin, Texas.

{"original": "(CNN) A pro-Israel Democratic super PAC is launching a new television ad on Wednesday in Iowa that questions Sen. Bernie Sanders' electability and raises the specter of his health following a heart attack last fall.\\n\\nThe 30-second spot, which will run throughout the week, comes in response to Sanders' rise in the polls and marks a late acknowledgement from some within the Democratic establishment that the Vermont senator is a legitimate contender for the party's nomination in 2020.\\n\\nThe Democratic Majority for Israel's political arm is spending $681,000 on the ad, which features a string of voters expressing concerns over Sanders' general election prospects and health. It does not address Israel or Sanders' foreign policy positions.\\n\\nI do have some concerns about Bernie Sanders' health considering the fact that he did have a heart attack, one of the Iowans featured in the ad says. Another suggests that, while he likes Sanders, voters in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Iowa are not going to vote for a socialist.\\n\\nSanders was hospitalized for more than two days after he suffered a heart attack in October while on the campaign trail. He had two stents inserted after doctors found an arterial blockage.\\n\\nSanders campaign co-chair Rep. Ro Khanna, a California Democrat, tweeted out a blistering response to the ad late Tuesday, saying the focus on Sanders' health crossed a line.\\n\\nFor a Democratic Super PAC to attack @BernieSanders health is beyond the pale of decency, Khanna said. Imagine the outrage if a Dem group had run attack ads about FDR's polio. Every Presidential candidate must denounce this & call for the ad to be taken down.\\n\\nIf elected, Sanders -- who in 2016 became the first Jewish candidate to win a major party primary contest when he won in New Hampshire -- would be the first Jewish president. He is to the left of the Democratic field on most key issues surrounding the relationship between US and Israel, but does not support the controversial Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions movement.\\n\\nIn an interview Tuesday night, DMFI president Mark Mellman said the group was moved to put hundreds of thousands of dollars behind the ad in an effort to blunt Sanders' momentum in Iowa and other early states.\\n\\nI think for many months now, the consensus has been that he really didn't have much of a chance at winning the nomination, Mellman said. We looked at the situation a couple of weeks ago and decided that assumption was no longer valid -- that he really does have a chance to win the nomination. And we thought that would be bad for Democrats, in terms of our ability to defeat Donald Trump, and bad for the issues that we care about.\\n\\nMellman also criticized Sanders for his past statements about Israel and on a number of policy positions, including the question of whether to maintain Obama-era levels of aid to Israel. DMFI, like Sanders, supports a two-state solution in the region.\\n\\nHe's voted right on a lot of legislation, but at the same time, he uses hyperbolic and vituperative language designed to stigmatize Israel, Mellman said of Sanders, who has been critical of the Israeli government led by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. In his role as a pollster, Mellman has worked on campaigns opposing Netanyahu, including on behalf of Israel's Blue and White party, in recent elections.\\n\\nOn Sunday, former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg jabbed Sanders, who spent time in Israel on a kibbutz, or communal farming settlement, during the 1960s.\\n\\nNow, I know I'm not the only Jewish candidate running for president. But I am the only one who doesn't want to turn America into a kibbutz, Bloomberg said, without naming Sanders, during a speech in Miami.\\n\\nAsked if DMFI would commit to backing Sanders if he won the nomination, the group's communications director, Rachel Rosen, did not offer a direct response.\\n\\nWe don't expect that to happen, Rosen said. But we are unalterably opposed to Donald Trump and his policies.\\n\\nMellman dismissed the progressive backlash to the ad and critics who have voiced concerns that it could hurt Sanders, if he wins the nomination, in a potential general election showdown with Trump.\\n\\nI honestly don't think Iowans saying -- in Iowa, in January -- that Sanders can't win is going to actually change people's minds about who to vote for in November, Mellman said. I just think that's a ludicrous proposition.\\n\\nThe group does not currently have plans in place for additional ad buys, Mellman told CNN, but didn't rule out the possibility.\\n\\nIn an email to supporters on Tuesday, Sanders campaign manager Faiz Shakir referenced the ad without discussing its content or naming the organization behind it.\\n\\nThis morning we learned that an outside spending group placed $700,000 worth of negative ads in Iowa attacking Bernie Sanders, Shakir wrote. After asking for donations, he added: We have a small lead in Iowa heading into Monday's caucus. But outside groups are on the attack and hoping to stop us. Bernie needs us all if we're going to fight back and win.\\n\\nSanders, in a video posted to Twitter later in the day, personally denounced the escalating efforts to oppose him in Iowa.\\n\\nThe big money interest can run all the negative ads they want, but it's not going to work, Sanders said. The people in Iowa, and across America are sick and tired of status quo politics, and they want a government that will work for all of us, not just wealthy campaign contributors.\\n\\nJ Street, the liberal pro-Israel, pro-peace group, did not comment on the ad itself, but argued that DMFI was not representative of most Democrats and American Jews.\\n\\nDMFI's right-leaning positions on Israel and US foreign policy are completely out of touch with the vast majority of Democrats and the vast majority of American Jews, who are both supportive of Israel and strongly critical of the far-right policies of the Netanyahu government, J Street spokesman Logan Bayroff said.\\n\\nBayroff also noted that the J Street had committed to endorse the Democratic nominee, no matter who voters choose, and pointed to the group's announcement this week that it planned to raise $1 million in a campaign fund for that candidate.\\n\\nThe Jewish progressive activist group IfNotNow, which has been mostly supportive of Sanders' policies but not endorsed him, slammed the ad and denounced DMFI.\\n\\nA majority of Americans and the vast majority of Democrats agree that our country should not give a blank check to Israel if the Israeli government continues with the violence of the occupation and denying the Palestinian people basic rights, co-founder Yonah Lieberman said. The ads don't focus on any of the AIPAC-front group's foreign policy goals because they are increasingly out of touch with the Democratic Party.\\n\\nThis story has been updated with additional context about the Democratic Majority for Israel and a statement from Sanders."}
{"original": "Washington (CNN) US diplomats are calling on Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to denounce President Donald Trump's role in the violent insurrection attempt on the US Capitol on Wednesday.\\n\\nPointing out that the US routinely denounces foreign leaders who use violence and intimidation to interfere in peaceful democratic processes and override the will of their voters, the State Department employees have drafted a memo that says, the Department of State should explicitly denounce President Trump's role in this violent attack on the US government and should also mention President Trump by name.\\n\\nIt is critical that we communicate to the world that in our system, no one -- not even the President -- is above the law or immune from public criticism, the memo states.\\n\\n'An integral role'\\n\\nThe document is an extraordinary rebuke of Trump from diplomats whose job is to serve as personal representatives of the President overseas. Pompeo, who has clear future political ambitions, has never publicly criticized the President and waited until Thursday to instruct diplomats to affirm President-elect Joe Biden's victory\\n\\nCNN obtained a copy of the dissent memo which was first reported by Foreign Policy. It began circulating within the foreign service after the violent assault on the Capitol that has left five dead and triggered a slew of resignations from Trump's Cabinet and within the White House.\\n\\nThe memo, which will soon be sent to Pompeo, was sent through the State Department's well-established dissent channel, a mechanism for State Department officials to offer alternative views on foreign policy without fear of retaliation. It was established in the 1960s during the Vietnam War to ensure that senior leadership in the department would have access to alternative policy views on the war.\\n\\nAbout 100 US diplomats have signed on to the document, which was spurred by frustration over the lack of a forceful response to the violence from the secretary and other State Department leaders. Earlier in the week the State Department provided guidance to embassies about how to discuss the violent mob attack on the capitol, but it did not mention Trump's role in triggering the events, which angered diplomats who saw the direct connection.\\n\\nAfter months of promoting baseless claims of voter fraud, which were rejected by the judiciary in dozens of cases, President Donald Trump encouraged supporters, some armed, to storm the US Capitol while Congress was certifying the results of a free and fair presidential election, the memo reads.\\n\\nHis incitement led to a violent riot in the US Capitol, five deaths, untold injuries, destruction and vandalism of government property, and incalculable damage to our democratic system and our image abroad, the memo continues. He played an integral role in breaking the 220-year streak of peaceful transfer of power between political parties during US elections.\\n\\nThe memo recommends language to describe the violent rioting, including the line that, President Donald Trump's incitement of violence against the certification of the United States' free and fair elections is unacceptable and incompatible with our laws, the democratic values and protected fundamental freedoms enshrined in our founding documents, and our long tradition of a peaceful and orderly transfer of power.\\n\\nIt goes on to say that guidance sent to press bureaus at the State Department and to US embassies and consulates worldwide, should not include any quotes from Trump about the episode, as he is not a credible voice on this matter.'\\n\\nThe memo implicitly criticizes Pompeo's approach to the chaos, saying that this change in our guidance would be a first step towards repairing the damage these events have inflicted on our international credibility.\\n\\nA political appointee to the department was fired by the White House Thursday after tweeting on Wednesday evening that Trump is unfit for office and is to blame for the mob attack on the US Capitol, according to two sources familiar with the firing.\\n\\nSome State Department officials -- both career officials and political officials -- do not agree with the dissent memo, or what they see as the intention behind it. One official called it political posturing before the Biden administration comes into office and argued that Pompeo and the department would never lay blame on the President publicly -- even if they feel that way privately -- because it would undermine the entire US government.\\n\\nYet other State Department officials felt that the memo is sending a clear message to Pompeo and was an action that the diplomats needed to take."}

Nicole Mason C. Nicole Mason\\n\\nGains in the stock market and the robust economy obscure the reality that many of the most marginalized workers, those with limited skills and education, are still struggling. Under Trump, the wealthy are doing extremely well, while the middle-class is hanging on.\\n\\nOn Friday, more than 800,000 federal workers across the country will go without a paycheck if the government fails to reopen. Trump says these workers will make adjustments as the shutdown could last months, even years. This, no doubt, will have a trickle-down effect on small businesses and others who rely on these workers to purchase goods and products.\\n\\nThe wall between Mexico and the United States, cheered by Trump's most ardent supporters as a metaphorical and political symbol of America First, has lost its appeal to some as the government shutdown has dragged on. Furloughed workers and those who sympathize with them have begun to realize the wall will not feed their families, keep their lights on or make sure their mortgage is paid.\\n\\nBut there are other reasons American workers may be disenchanted with the President. Trump campaigned on a promise to bring back coal mining jobs. Yet, as Bloomberg reported, analysts say that Trump's plan for the coal industry is not likely to have a large effect on its fortunes.\\n\\nAt campaign rallies and in interviews, Trump likes to say that he turned the West Virginia economy around by cutting energy regulations, but over the last decade, middle-class West Virginia households have seen no overall income gains from the state's modest economic growth, and there has been no sustained surge in the state's economy under Trump. These kinds of results will continue unless we are able to turn away from the divisive politics and rhetoric, and focus on building an economy that works for the majority of Americans – not just the few.\\n\\nWorking-class black and Latino Americans are also losing under Trump. In his address to the nation Tuesday night, President Trump asserted that illegal migration hurts all Americans by driving down jobs and wages, specifically impacting African-Americans and Hispanics. This is a bid to whip up support among both groups for the wall and his nativist immigration policies.\\n\\nWhile it is true that African-Americans and Hispanics tend to be employed in lower wage jobs than white and Asian workers, and compete in the labor market with undocumented immigrants for those jobs, it cannot be ignored that some US employers and corporations often exploit immigrant labor for their gain, by paying them less, forcing them to work in deplorable conditions, or threatening to deport them if they complain.\\n\\nThese habits not only harm undocumented immigrants, but American middle-class workers as well by suppressing wages and making it nearly impossible to demand safer working conditions or benefits without the fear of being fired. If Trump is concerned about the well-being of these black and Hispanic American workers, he should do more than suggest a wall to address the income disparity.\\n\\nCome March, if the government fails to reopen, tens of millions of Americans could lose their Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits, putting their families at risk of food insecurity. According to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, in 2017, 42 million Americans participated in the SNAP program – and more than 44% of them were in working families. It is hard to accept that this protracted and partisan skirmish over a wall could soon bring real hardship to the lives of the most vulnerable Americans.\\n\\nGet our free weekly newsletter Sign up for CNN Opinion's new newsletter.\\n\\nJoin us on Twitter and Facebook\\n\\nIn 2016, the white working class was cautiously optimistic, while others of us held our breath for the deal-maker and mega-businessman Donald Trump to work his magic to bring back jobs and revive struggling industries.

{"original": "Washington (CNN) The longer that President-elect Joe Biden takes to select his pick for US attorney general, the more pressure builds on him to staff his Justice Department with a diverse leadership team.\\n\\nWhat Biden had initially anticipated would be announced by Christmas Day, has stretched into the new year. That breaks with recent norms for an incoming president to make attorney general among his first Cabinet picks. It's also heightened the calls for Biden to address issues of diversity and racial injustice through his selection to lead the department.\\n\\nNot only is it the most prominent job left for Biden to fill, the attorney general also has purview over many of the issues feeding racial injustice.\\n\\nTensions are particularly high since, despite all the lobbying from outside groups, three of the top remaining frontrunners to lead the Justice Department are all White, and two of them are men.\\n\\nSources have told CNN the top candidates continue to be former Alabama Sen. Doug Jones, federal judge Merrick Garland and former acting Attorney General Sally Yates. As CNN has previously reported , former Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick, who is Black, remains in the mix. Picks for other top Justice Department jobs are expected to be more diverse, and there is a desire inside Biden's transition team to roll out those selections at the same time to showcase the new administration's commitment to diversity, sources say. That, too, could be adding to the long wait on the announcement for attorney general.\\n\\nTransition officials have told CNN they are in regular touch with civil rights groups about their attorney general selection and the Department of Justice more broadly, and that they value their perspectives and advice on both topics.\\n\\nThe diversity push is coming from a wide roster of civil rights activists from organizations like the League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC), the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials (NALEO), and the National Organization of Black Law Enforcement Executives (NOBLE). All told CNN they have been in constant contact with the Biden transition team to dole out hundreds of recommendations of people they've vetted for positions throughout the administration.\\n\\nWe are recommending over 80 people for various (leadership) positions at the Department of Justice and Secret Service among other law enforcement agencies, NOBLE President Lynda Williams told CNN.\\n\\nWilliams acknowledged that the next attorney general may not be and does not need to be a person of color, but if he or she is, then it will be a bonus.\\n\\nIn the end, Williams said the nominee must understand they represent something larger than themselves and that there are major issues regarding race in this country, even if it does not sit right at their feet.\\n\\nAmong the most prominent voices for a culture change at the DOJ has been Rev. Al Sharpton, founder of the National Action Network. In an early December meeting with Biden, Vice President-elect Kamala Harris and their team, Sharpton voiced his preference that the next attorney general be Black, and have experience within the federal government with a concentration on civil rights issues.\\n\\nSharpton however seemed to give an implicit nod to Jones recently when he followed up mid-December comments pushing for a Black attorney general by saying he could also accept a White candidate with a proven civil rights background that's going to handle this heightened racist bigoted atmosphere.\\n\\nJones was the US Attorney for the Northern District of Alabama under President Bill Clinton when he successfully prosecuted members of the Ku Klux Klan who were responsible for the 16th Street Baptist Church bombing in 1963.\\n\\nA year of strife\\n\\nA Police officer charges forward as people protest the death of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis Police in front of the White House in Washington, D.C. on May 31, 2020. - Thousands of National Guard troops patrolled major US cities after five consecutive nights of protests over racism and police brutality that boiled over into arson and looting, sending shock waves through the country. The death Monday of an unarmed black man, George Floyd, at the hands of police in Minneapolis ignited this latest wave of outrage in the US over law enforcement's repeated use of lethal force against African Americans -- this one like others before captured on cellphone video. (Photo by Samuel Corum / AFP) (Photo by SAMUEL CORUM/AFP via Getty Images)\\n\\nFollowing a year marked by racial protests and strife, calls for federal charges and investigations into the police shootings that sparked widespread protests this summer largely went unanswered. Just days after George Floyd's death, then-Attorney General William Barr said Floyd's death had driven home a longstanding breakdown in the criminal justice system, and Barr vowed to find constructive solutions in the weeks and months ahead so that Mr. Floyd's death will not be in vain.\\n\\nBut little reform has occurred.\\n\\nSenate Democrats blocked a Republican policing reform measure in late June because they said it fell short in addressing the very concerns expressed during the summer unrest.\\n\\nAmong other things, Democrats said the proposal did not include an outright ban on chokeholds and they could not decide whether to overhaul qualified immunity for cops so it's easier to sue them in civil court.\\n\\nA federal civil rights investigation was launched in Floyd's death and, at the time, FBI Director Christopher Wray said things would be moving quickly.\\n\\nThat investigation, along with several other probes launched this summer will likely be among the first issues many expect the next attorney general to confront immediately\\n\\nLongstanding issues\\n\\nLast week, the Justice Department drew renewed outcry when it announced there was insufficient evidence for federal charges surrounding the police shooting of 12-year-old Tamir Rice, a Black child in Cleveland who was holding a pellet gun in 2014 when he was shot by an officer who believed it was a real pistol.\\n\\ntamir rice\\n\\nThat case is a reminder that much of the strife over police brutality toward minorities predates the Trump administration, and that rank-and-file DOJ staffers have been pushing for internal changes for years.\\n\\nDarlene Brooks has worked at the Justice Department for 33 years, and she says it will take more than just a few diverse voices to change the White-centric culture that has been embedded over the course of many administrations.\\n\\nEven with Attorney General (Eric) Holder, I was excited for him, but it was like it stopped there, Brooks said. If the Department is riddled with career people who don't embrace diversity and only do a paper exercise, then it's futile and there's no change.\\n\\nBrooks serves as the President for the DOJ Chapter of the group Blacks in Government, where she leads a team that advocates for the equal opportunity and professional development of Black government employees. Brooks hopes new leadership at the Justice Department will usher in greater diversity in the workforce, will put a renewed focus on civil rights, and will place a priority on police reform.\\n\\nIt's not about defunding or taking money away from the police, which is how people keep misinterpreting it, Brooks explained. It's really about getting into these police departments and educating their practices.\\n\\nRestoring a commitment to equal justice\\n\\nTo do that, Sharpton said it is incumbent on the federal government to take the lead immediately.\\n\\nThe reason that we could not deal with local law enforcement and prosecutors is because of the intrinsic relationship between the local police who were involved in those situations and the prosecutors in those counties, Sharpton told CNN. Someone that is sensitive to that understands why the federal government and the Justice Department needs to intervene. ... So there's a sensitivity practice and an experienced practice that people of color could bring in that was totally absent in the last four years.\\n\\nKristen Clarke, the president of the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, said the Justice Department should prioritize reinvigorating federal civil rights enforcement, enforcing the Voting Rights Act, dealing with police brutality and cases in the education space that needs scrutiny.\\n\\nI think this is one of the most important decisions that President Elect Biden will have to make finding the right attorney general, who can restore a commitment to equal justice under law for all, who can make protection of racial justice and civil rights a top priority. These are incredibly important principles and values of the country needs right now in its next attorney general, so I'm glad that the next administration isn't racing to announce a decision and being really thoughtful and careful in deciding who they put forth for this important position, Clarke said.\\n\\nNational Urban League President Marc Morial was in the December 8 virtual meeting with Biden, Harris and six other civil rights groups. We generally spoke about the diversity of the Cabinet and the need for there to be a maximum number of African Americans serving in the Cabinet, so that the President can be successful with an emphasis on racial justice and addressing those issues, Morial said.\\n\\nThe most important thing is that the leadership team be diverse and have a strong commitment to civil rights and racial justice. In this environment that goes beyond simply the attorney general and it goes to the other keys position. President-elect Biden clearly said to us, and it goes without any reservation, that racial justice is going to be a part of everything he does. Racial justice is going to be a part of everything he does whether it's an agricultural or commerce, whether it's an economic policy, he continued.\\n\\nWe know that the tip of the spear is police community relations. This police issue will not quit. Police relationship systemically with black communities is broken and its costing people their lives."}
{"original": "WASHINGTON (CNN) -- House Speaker Nancy Pelosi Wednesday said it remains to be seen whether a House resolution labeling as genocide the mass killings of Armenians by what is now Turkey will get a vote on the House floor.\\n\\nThe issue has split Democrats.\\n\\nThere is reason to bring this to the floor, Pelosi, D-California, said. Whether those who have been advocating it want to go to that place remains to be seen.\\n\\nThe resolution is vehemently opposed by key U.S. military ally Turkey. The administration and critics of the resolution argue that any damage to U.S.-Turkish relations could endanger supply routes to U.S. forces deployed in Iraq.\\n\\nBy a 27-21 vote last week, the House Foreign Affairs Committee adopted the resolution, which formally identifies the killings as genocide. Turkish officials acknowledge the killings of Armenians during World War I but vehemently object to the designation genocide.\\n\\nOn Sunday, Pelosi told ABC's This Week that she intended to move ahead with a vote on the resolution, which she called one that is consistent with what our government has always said about ... what happened at that time.\\n\\nAsked about criticism that it could harm relations with Turkey -- a fellow member of NATO -- Pelosi said, There's never been a good time, adding that it is important to pass the resolution now because many of the survivors are very old.\\n\\nI have always supported it, [the resolution] as did the previous leader of the Democrats in the Congress, Congressman [Richard] Gephardt, Pelosi said. Almost everybody supports this, because they know it is right. Whether it will come up or not, or what the action will be, remains to be seen.\\n\\nPelosi said, however, other matters on the agenda that have to be dealt with first -- issues such as modifying the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act and overriding the president's veto of a bill expanding the State Children's Health Insurance Program.\\n\\nOn Tuesday, House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, the No. 2 House Democrat, also appeared to hedge his pledge to bring it to a full vote before November's holiday recess.\\n\\nI said I thought we would bring this up prior to us leaving here, said Hoyer. I have not changed on that, although I would be less than candid [not] to say that there are a number of people who are revisiting their own positions.\\n\\nPresident Bush also called on House leaders to abandon the measure.\\n\\nCongress has more important work to do than antagonizing a democratic ally in the Muslim world, especially one that's providing vital support for our military every day. Watch Bush condemn the resolution »\\n\\nBush also said at a Wednesday news conference that ... one thing Congress should not be doing is sorting out the historical record of the Ottoman Empire, the predecessor of modern Turkey.\\n\\nPelosi's comments come as five House Democrats on Wednesday underscored their strong opposition to the resolution, citing the militarily strategic importance of Turkey.\\n\\n\\n\\nReps. John Murtha of Pennsylvania, Alcee Hastings and Robert Wexler of Florida and John Tanner and Steve Cohen of Tennessee urged House Democratic leadership to stop the resolution, which passed the House Foreign Affairs Committee last week and is slated to go to the House floor for a vote.\\n\\nWe believe that this resolution at this time takes away or impedes our ability to bring the most swift rapid resolution of this situation in Iraq to a conclusion that is beneficial to our country, Tanner said.\\n\\nHastings and Tanner, both of whom serve on the House delegation to NATO, also expressed their opposition to the resolution in a letter from the delegation to Speaker Nancy Pelosi.\\n\\nThe measure would threaten our operations and our troops serving in Iraq and Afghanistan, the letter said.\\n\\nThe U.S. and Iraqi governments fear the proposed resolution could harm Washington's influence with Turkish officials who want to launch military raids against Kurdish rebels in northern Iraq. Washington officials are concerned the Turkish raids would further destabilize the region. Watch how U.S. is concerned about using Turkish airbase »\\n\\nSix former co-sponsors have abandoned the measure since last week, leaving it with 218 co-sponsors, said lead sponsor Rep. Adam Schiff, D-California.\\n\\nIf more members remove their names from the resolution, Hastings predicted that it will signal that it's not the right thing at this time.\\n\\nThe nation is critical to U.S. war supply routes, said U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates last week. About a third of American fuel supplies pass through Turkey, he said, as does about 70 percent of American air freight and 95 percent of mine-resistant armored military vehicles set for delivery to Iraq.\\n\\nEight former U.S. secretaries of state also oppose the resolution: Alexander M. Haig, Jr.; Henry A. Kissinger; George P. Shultz; James A. Baker III; Lawrence S. Eagleburger; Warren Christopher; Madeleine K. Albright; and Colin L. Powell. They sent a letter to Pelosi last month urging her not to let the resolution reach the House floor.\\n\\nPassage of the resolution would harm our foreign policy objectives to promote reconciliation between Turkey and Armenia, said the letter.\\n\\nIt would also strain our relations with Turkey, and would endanger our national security interests in the region, including the safety of our troops in Iraq and Afghanistan.\\n\\nAlthough the former secretaries of state emphasized they were not minimizing or denying the horrible tragedy faced by Armenians during the period, they also stressed Turkey's geo-political importance as an indispensable partner in the fight against terrorism.

In a roller-coaster ride not unusual for a Kvitova match, the twice Wimbledon champion fell 6-3 4-6 10-8 to Andrea Petkovic in nearly three hours.\\n\\nAfter Gael Monfils suspected he sustained a heat stroke in Thursday's blazing conditions, Alize Cornet crumpled to the court Friday as temperatures peaked at 40.2 degrees Celsius in Melbourne.\\n\\nA visibly distressed Cornet stayed down for a few moments in her third-round match against Elise Mertens on Hisense Arena before gingerly walking to her chair and receiving medical attention.\\n\\nThe world No. 42 – who famously upset Serena Williams at Wimbledon four years ago – was able to continue but lost to the Belgian 7-5 6-4.\\n\\nPHOTO: Michael Dodge/Getty Images AsiaPac/Getty Images Alize Cornet was in distress at the Australian Open Friday.\\n\\nAfterward Cornet said the players were being sent to the abattoir by being asked to play in such weather.

It's also challenging for our team, particularly those working out on court, including the ball kids and officials.\\n\\nWe do everything we can to help ease everyone's discomfort in these conditions.\\n\\nThe tournament appeared to have a backer in likely tennis' most popular player, Roger Federer, who largely stayed out of the heat by playing in Thursday's night session but has found himself in sweltering Melbourne conditions in the past.\\n\\nPHOTO: GREG WOOD/AFP/AFP/Getty Images Roger Federer played under the lights Thursday.\\n\\nWe know it can be very hot here in Australia, said the 19-time grand slam winner. I remember the days when we had four days of 40 degrees in a row a few years back. Now we got two. Most of the guys now have to play in 30-plus degrees conditions.\\n\\nIt's definitely a challenge. It's hard to prepare for that in some ways. But you know when you come down here that can happen.\\n\\nSure, I'm happy I played at nighttime. But … I would back myself playing during the daytime also. Used to go to Dubai when it was 45. Thirty eight seems almost okay.\\n\\nThe problem is at that temperature, sometimes your body just reacts funny just because it does. It is hard to get out of it, that feeling of not feeling well. Sure, I was watching the other players suffer. As long as nothing bad happens, it's all good.\\n\\nThankfully for players, fans and organizers, the temperature fell to 24 degrees at 8 p.m. local time Friday and the forecast the rest of the event looks manageable.\\n\\nHowever, a spike is expected next Friday, Saturday and Sunday but on those days only one singles match is scheduled and all are at night.\\n\\nKyrgios wins in front of Will Smith\\n\\nKyrgios moved ever closer to facing Nadal in the semifinals by downing 2008 finalist Jo-Wilfried Tsonga 7-6 (7-5) 4-6 7-6 (8-6) 7-6 (7-5) in front of actor Will Smith during the night session at Rod Laver Arena. Kyrgios usually prefers the smaller Hisense Arena, which can be more boisterous.\\n\\nThe hugely talented, controversial Aussie has been composed through three rounds, getting over temporary blips in his game and not letting distractions bother him.\\n\\nHe was clutch against one of his idols, Tsonga, saving a set point in the third-set tiebreak and coming back from 2-5 in the fourth-set tiebreak. Tsonga, not Kyrgios, became irate early in the fourth set after someone in the stands yelled at him in the previous tiebreak while he faced a set point. He duly earned a code violation.\\n\\nBetween the first serve and the second, the guy was talking to me and telling me, 'You are under pressure now, you are under pressure now,' when I was bouncing my balls, Tsonga told reporters. That's it. I lost it and I (went) a little bit crazy.\\n\\nThe guy was feeling safe because he was, you know, upstairs. I just told him, 'Come now to see if you feel the pressure or not.' That's it.\\n\\nAsked on court afterward who he'd like to play him in a movie, Kyrgios opted for, bang on cue, Smith.\\n\\nWhen I saw him out here I was so nervous...

Previously, he was a US Senate aide, television producer and a fellow at public policy think tanks. The views expressed in this commentary are his own.\\n\\n(CNN) —\\n\\nAfter months of media hype, a political neophyte with strong opinions, a brash style and extreme wealth gets into the race.\\n\\nAlmost immediately, the reality TV celebrity is propelled to the top of the pack – leading all contenders and in spitting distance of his political adversary across the aisle.\\n\\nNo, this is not the story of President Donald Trump's rise, but the story of technology entrepreneur and venture capitalist Kevin O'Leary of ABC's Shark Tank fame.\\n\\nO'Leary is running for the highest office in the land – in Canada.\\n\\nThe multimillionaire from Montreal's English-speaking minority grew up middle class, unlike the newly inaugurated US President, but embraces the path that brought the Queens-born real estate tycoon to 1600 Pennsylvania Ave.\\n\\nO'Leary's supporters are even selling Trump-like red hats with a slogan embroidered in white thread. Instead of Make America Great Again, O'Leary's caps encourage the voters to return Canada's Prime Minister to his previous occupation, saying: Make Trudeau a Drama Teacher Again.\\n\\nAnd Shark Tank's Mr. Wonderful is crushing his conservative Tory rivals out of the gate, too, with more than 50% of the party's voters in one poll backing him within days of his announced candidacy to become leader of the Conservative Party of Canada.\\n\\nO'Leary does distance himself from Trump, who is deeply unpopular north of the US border, on policy such as a border wall. O'Leary told the New York Post: We're both businessmen. That is the common thread. … But I am nowhere near the same (as) Donald Trump on policy. I am half Lebanese, half Irish – there's no walls. … If there was a wall around Canada, I wouldn't exist.\\n\\nO'Leary even apes the nationalist rhetoric Trump displays, tweeting: The Conservative Party of Canada needs a candidate who can beat Justin Trudeau and bring back jobs to this country!\\n\\nIt's official, I'm in. The Conservative Party of Canada needs a candidate who can beat Justin Trudeau and bring back jobs to this country! — Kevin O'Leary aka Mr. Wonderful (@kevinolearytv) January 18, 2017\\n\\nO'Leary, who is threading a needle playing the role of both Trump in Canada and his foil on issues where Canadian and US interests diverge, was bullish last year on Trump's effect on the stock market, too.\\n\\nO'Leary said that the markets would go straight up if Trump took the White House. On that count, O'Leary (if he put his money where his mouth was) made the right bet as stocks have soared since the election of the American tycoon.\\n\\nBut can O'Leary withstand the crowded field and slings and arrows like Trump did during the GOP primaries? Only time will tell.\\n\\nOne thing that is different that may affect Canada's choice is how the Conservative Party leader is selected – by members who have paid to join the party and who then have to show up to cast ballots and then wait hours for the final results\\n\\nA system similar to the Iowa and Nevada caucuses did not help Trump since only the most conservative, dedicated and organized candidates manage to make it past the caucusgoers. Trump lost most of the caucuses he competed in to other candidates despite his advantage in the polls.\\n\\nAnother thing that will weigh heavily against O'Leary is his opponent, the attractive and affable scion of the Trudeau dynasty.\\n\\nAdditionally, the Conservatives' last successful leader to assume the prime ministry was Stephen Harper, a traditional and reserved Canadian. He is a mild-mannered politician and man, a stereotype of Canadians.\\n\\nThen there's O'Leary's residency. In 2013, O'Leary called Boston home – and it just might be his political death knell.\\n\\nCanadians are sensitive, to say the least, about their southern neighbor and the brain drain of their successful brethren. Palm Springs and Florida are fine to visit, but going full American is a no-no.\\n\\nGet our free weekly newsletter Sign up for CNN Opinion's new newsletter.\\n\\nJoin us on Twitter and Facebook\\n\\nFormer Liberal Party leader Michael Ignatieff was raked over the coals by his political opponents for assuming academic posts in the United States and Britain, even bragging about voting in the latter.\\n\\nIt went down like a lead balloon in Canada, and Ignatieff skulked off into the Canadian political wilderness.\\n\\nThen again, Trump, who made Buy American, Hire American a rallying cry during his campaign, managed to get through – despite making his clothing lines in much-maligned China and hiring foreign workers at his projects and resorts.\\n\\nMaybe O'Leary's fame and wealth might make Mr. Wonderful, Mr. Prime Minister after all."}
{"original": "America is blundering into a new Russia election-meddling hall of mirrors that's already doing Moscow's work: tearing fresh political divides and threatening to again tarnish democracy's most sacred moment, a national election\\n\\nRevelations Thursday about intelligence assessments that Russia has launched a new interference effort to help reelect Donald Trump -- and the President's furious reaction -- mark the return of a recurring nightmare for the country just nine months before the presidential election.\\n\\nTrump was informed that the House Intelligence Committee was told of the Russian intelligence operation last week by Rep. Devin Nunes, his Republican ally from California and was frustrated that Democrats would be able to use the information against him, a source told CNN. A more conventional reaction by the commander-in-chief given his institutional responsibilities might be anger that again a foreign power was trying to manipulate US politics -- however it might affect his own fortunes.\\n\\nThe uproar over Russia's disinformation drive to hurt Hillary Clinton and help Trump four years ago cast a cloud that the current President has never been able to escape. The President's defensive response to a new Russia interference drama, colored by his belief that all such revelations as a Deep State assault on his own legitimacy, already appears to be exacerbating the damage caused by Moscow's meddling.\\n\\nIf his reelection bid is tainted in the same way, his conduct could become even more erratic at a time when he is already mounting an assault on US institutions like the Justice Department and acting with unbridled power following his acquittal in an impeachment trial.\\n\\nAnd the new revelations about Russia are certain to further damage the tenuous relationship between a President who denies election meddling ever happened, and an intelligence community that is charged with detecting such threats and countering them -- but is ultimately under Trump's control and susceptible to his political pressure.\\n\\nRussia fulfilling its goals once more\\n\\nPartisan uproar over the new claims, meanwhile, suggests that the alleged operation is again delivering for Russia on its intended goals: sowing distrust in the US system and turning Americans against themselves in a way that weakens national unity.\\n\\nSigns of Russian hacking, social media meddling and attacks on US infrastructure and the resulting confusion and controversy in Washington raise a sobering possibility: the second US election in a row risks being besmirched in the eyes of millions of voters at an already corrosive moment for US democracy.\\n\\nSources told CNN that the President was irate that intelligence community briefers told House lawmakers about Russia's new threat in a meeting last week. Trump was especially frustrated that House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff, who led impeachment hearings against him, was given the information.\\n\\nSchiff was quick to respond to the public reports, first published by The New York Times , about last week's classified briefing.\\n\\nWe count on the intelligence community to inform Congress of any threat of foreign interference in our elections, Schiff tweeted. If reports are true and the President is interfering with that, he is again jeopardizing our efforts to stop foreign meddling. Exactly as we warned he would do.\\n\\nThe President was frustrated that he had to learn about the briefing from a lawmaker and not from one of his officials, the person familiar with the situation told CNN.\\n\\nHe expressed frustration that it's happening again, the person said, referring to his perception that political rivals were able to weaponize intelligence related to Russia. The Washington Post first reported the involvement of Nunes.\\n\\nThe partisan divide that hampered efforts to respond to Russian election meddling in 2016 is already reemerging.\\n\\nRepublicans in the hearing reportedly pushed back against the revelations of new Russian election meddling, in a sign of how intelligence -- that can only be effective if its regarded as nonpartisan -- is being politically tainted.\\n\\nThe briefers were not ambiguous about the Kremlin having a preference for Trump, said a source familiar with the classified briefing.\\n\\nTexas Rep. Will Hurd, a former CIA officer, asked Nunes for some time for questioning and pressed the briefer about what led to the statements that Russia preferred Trump as President. The briefer responded that they did not have the underlying data, just the assessment.\\n\\nTrump's allies like Utah's Chris Stewart and Brad Wenstrup of Ohio started arguing that the assessment cannot be true because no President has been tougher on Moscow than Trump -- a highly subjective assessment, especially given the President's repeated and puzzling deference to Putin.\\n\\nThe accounts being described by sources suggest that Trump was more interested in suppressing the information for his own political gain than acting to protect the election. And the drama raises the question of whether his replacement of the acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire with a political acolyte, Richard Grenell, this week is an attempt to appoint an ally to ensure such politically damaging information doesn't get out.\\n\\nThere has been no public reaction so far from Trump to the latest Russia controversy.\\n\\nBut he's likely at some point to go on a prolonged tear over the new revelations since he's never really gotten over the 2016 election's Russia storm. He frequently blasts the idea that Russia interfered as a hoax made up by Democrats to discredit him.\\n\\nIn one stunning appearance with Vladimir Putin in Helsinki in 2018 , he publicly took the Russian President's word over that of his own intelligence agencies on the question of election meddling.\\n\\nThe political impact of the new Russia intrigue\\n\\nDescriptions of Trump's reactions to the new interference operation are likely to further embitter an already negative and nasty 2020 election campaign. Trump's opponents will be extremely skeptical about his motives and willingness to defend the US system -- and may fulfill his fears that they will use the information against him to present him again as Putin's patsy.\\n\\nThere is also precedent for the President being open to outside political influence.\\n\\nAfter all, the Ukraine saga that caused his impeachment showed a President keen to solicit foreign interference in the election.\\n\\nThe Mueller report showed how Trump's 2016 campaign expected to benefit from Russian election meddling even if it did not establish coordination between his team and Moscow.\\n\\nAnd the trial of Roger Stone -- who was sentenced to 40 months in jail on Thursday -- showed how the Trump campaign was eager to hear about how WikiLeaks would handle Democratic Party emails stolen by Russia in 2016 in a bid to damage Clinton.\\n\\nThe way that the news of the latest Russian meddling allegations emerged also raises new doubts about Trump's sincerity to defend the election or to put his own political interests to one side.\\n\\nThe really disturbing part of this is that it is so important for us as lawmakers who are privy to this information, this intelligence, to get it openly and honestly, then figure out what to do about it, Rep. Kathleen Rice, a Democrat of New York, told CNN's Wolf Blitzer.\\n\\nThe fact that this President, time and again puts his own personal and political future ahead of not just every other American but also our national security is just so outrageous. What is there to say? she asked.\\n\\nUS intelligence officials have repeatedly warned that Russia did not stop its efforts to interfere in US elections after 2016.\\n\\nFBI Director Christopher Wray told the Senate Judiciary Committee last month that Moscow was continuing to engage in malign foreign influence online with the goal of sowing division and discord, and to generate controversy, to generate distrust in our democratic institutions in our electoral process.\\n\\nA national security official in the Trump administration told CNN that election security official Shelby Pierson, who conducted last week's briefing, may have mischaracterized the intelligence that Russia has developed a preference for Trump.\\n\\nA more reasonable interpretation of the intelligence is not that they have a preference, it's a step short of that. It's more that they understand the President is someone they can work with, he's a dealmaker. But not that they prefer him over (Bernie) Sanders or (Pete) Buttigieg or anyone else, the official said.\\n\\nTrump supporters push back at claims he's been soft on Russia, noting that he sold lethal weapons to Ukraine -- a step the Obama administration refused to take -- and kicked out Russian diplomats after Moscow tried to assassinate a former intelligence defector on US soil.\\n\\nBut many of Trump's foreign policy moves have seemed to play into Russia's goals, including his withdrawal from Syria, his claim that Ukraine, not Moscow, interfered in the 2016 election and his frequent attacks on NATO and Western unity.\\n\\nSo it is not hard to see why Russia -- which pursues a foreign policy largely designed to splinter US influence and undermine the West -- might favor four more years of Trump if its goal is indeed to see him returned to the Oval Office.\\n\\nThis story has been updated with additional developments Friday."}

Elizabeth Warren arrived in Iowa on Friday evening and, through four events over a little more than 24 hours, quickly made clear that even as her presidential campaign evolves, she is poised to rise or fall with the same brand of wonky populism that took her from the classroom to Capitol Hill.\\n\\nIn speeches to packed rooms from the state's western border with Nebraska to its capital in Des Moines, Warren spent the weekend demanding structural change in Washington, where the partial government shutdown is entering its third week. She wants to strengthen our unions, our workers and our consumers while breaking the hold of an army of lobbyists occupying the capital, as she describes it, under the banners of big corporations.\\n\\nRELATED: Elizabeth Warren in Iowa: 'I am not a person of color'\\n\\nEven during her occasional strolls in the policy weeds, Warren, who has set the tone for her remarks so far by opening them with the story of her mother's struggle to find a minimum wage job to help save their house after Warren's father suffered a debilitating heart attack, keeps up a low fury. When her microphone cut out at the opening event in Council Bluffs, Warren didn't yell because, even in a room of 300 (with 200 more outside) she didn't have to.\\n\\nThere are too many people who get their power from turning working people against working people, the Massachusetts Democrat said a day later in Storm Lake during a riff on long-stalled talks over comprehensive immigration revisions. A few hours earlier, in Sioux City, she declared, Washington keeps working great for those with money, but not for anyone else. We need to call this out for what it is: It is corruption, pure and simple.\\n\\nIf Warren has strong feelings about ethanol, an important issue for Iowa voters and favorite means for out-of-state candidates to pander to them, she hasn't yet let on. Warren has also steered clear of some national progressive hits, like Medicare-for-all, which she hasn't mentioned through her first few stops.\\n\\nAsked on Saturday why the Democratic left's signature policy proposal had not gotten a mention through two events, Warren demurred.\\n\\nNo one's raised it, she said. But I have had a chance to talk about Medicaid, partly because I think we've had a national conversation about health care, and I think it's been enormously valuable.\\n\\nThe issue was indeed a winner for Democrats running during the 2018 midterm elections. In her opening foray, Warren has seemed content to continue on that path, advocating for Medicaid not just as a program for the poor but also as one that benefits seniors and Americans suffering from mental illness, while assailing the shameful behavior of insurance companies. On Saturday night, she won hearty applause when she called health care a basic human right.\\n\\nBut if Warren has appeared entirely self-assured in diving into the policy positions that she has been crusading for in Washington for years – All right! she cheered when an audience member in Sioux City began asking about internet regulations – her tone has changed when faced with questions about the 2016 election, a kind of riddle that she and so many other Democrats are still struggling to unwind.\\n\\nAsked how she planned to prevent a repeat of the undemocratic behavior between the DNC and Hillary's campaign in 2016 against Sen. Sanders, Warren told supporters in Des Moines, I'm not relitigating 2016, before pivoting to call all Democrats running for president to disavow super PACs, saying, I think that all of the Democratic candidates, whoever they turn out to be, should link arms and say our primary is not for sale to billionaires.\\n\\nIn a gaggle with reporters at her Council Bluffs rally on Friday, she bypassed a question about the comparisons being drawn between her campaign and Hillary Clinton's four years ago.\\n\\nYou know, look – I'd never run for public office before I got into the Senate race in Massachusetts, Warren responded. I was pulled into this because I have watched how America's middle class has been hollowed out. I am in this fight for working families. I'm going to stay focused on that all the way through.\\n\\nLike her colleague and ideological ally Sen. Bernie Sanders, the Vermont independent whose decision to enter the 2016 presidential campaign was partly a reaction to Warren's decision to sit it out, the Massachusetts senator seems least at ease when political conversation turns personal. But hers is a distinct challenge, and a lonely one during this period when Warren stands as the lone, high-profile female presidential candidate.\\n\\nShe has already been faced with a story focused on whether she risked being viewed as too unlikable, gamely parlaying it into a fundraising tool. Many Democrats seized on the same report, determined to lay down a marker to ensure that Warren and the other women likely to run – so many of them politically and personally distinct from Clinton in so many ways – be spared a very similar treatment.\\n\\nOutside Warren's debut event on Friday night, Natalie Wertz, 29, who was waiting for the candidate with a friend – both of them having purchased pink T-shirts emblazoned with Warren's de facto slogan, Nevertheless, she persisted – spoke confidently of Warren's potential as a candidate.\\n\\nNeither woman had heard about the likability flap, though Wertz smilingly proclaimed Warren a very likable person.\\n\\nBut her decision in 2020, Wertz said, would turn on more concrete questions.\\n\\nAs a lower middle class American, budget and finances sometimes – living paycheck to paycheck is very hard, she said. And it's a toxic world that has set us into this cycle of vicious debt. I think that Warren has great ideas about how to get us out of that.\\n\\nCNN's Carolyn Sung and DJ Judd contributed to this report."}

{"original": "(CNN) Facing the real possibility that Bernie Sanders' march to the nomination could reach a tipping point in next week's contests, the other six Democratic contenders launched a fusillade of attacks on the Vermont senator Tuesday night, aimed at painting him as a candidate who would lose to President Donald Trump in November.\\n\\nIn the opening moments of the debate, former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg mocked Sanders' embrace of socialism, claiming that Russian President Vladimir Putin was trying to get him nominated so he would lose to Trump. Former Vice President Joe Biden took on Sanders' record on guns and questioned whether he would be soft on authoritarian leaders. Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who has avoided attacking her close ally, claimed she would be more effectual in enacting a progressive agenda. Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar argued Sanders would alienate middle of the road voters with his expensive ideas.\\n\\nAnd former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg succinctly argued again and again that Sanders would sink the Democratic ticket in November, dragging House members and senators in swing states down with him.\\n\\nDuring the prior nine debates, Sanders' Democratic rivals had tried a lighter touch -- quibbling with the cost of his ideas or arguing that they couldn't possibly make it through Congress. But with the South Carolina and Super Tuesday contests just days away, they adopted a far sharper tone during the CBS debate in Charleston as they sought to knock Sanders from his front-runner perch.\\n\\nThe debate was heated and chaotic with multiple candidates often shouting over one another in what became an incomprehensible garble of words. But with Sanders rising, even in South Carolina -- which Biden once claimed was his firewall -- their imperative was clear.\\n\\nSanders managed a quick shot at Bloomberg, targeting his wealth, during the opening minutes of the debate when asked to explain how he would campaign against Trump when the economy is doing so well.\\n\\nYou're right the economy is doing really great for people like Mr. Bloomberg and other billionaires, Sanders said to laughter.\\n\\nBut after that moment, he was continually on defense.\\n\\nBloomberg immediately warned of Sanders' ideology as a democratic socialist, seeking to portray him as the weakest opponent against Trump.\\n\\nVladimir Putin thinks that Donald Trump should be president of the United States, Bloomberg said. And that's why Russia is helping you get elected, so you will lose to him.\\n\\nSanders shot back by speaking directly to Putin: Let me tell Mr. Putin, who interfered in the 2016 election -- try to bring Americans against Americans, the Vermont senator said. Hey, Mr. Putin, if I'm president of the United States, trust me, you're not going to interfere in any more American elections.\\n\\nButtigieg repeatedly turned the conversation to the effect that Sanders' liberal ideology could have on House members in once-red districts that were flipped to blue in 2018. He said that if Sanders becomes the Democratic nominee it would mean four more years of Donald Trump, Kevin McCarthy as speaker of the House and the inability to get the Senate in Democratic hands.\\n\\nThe time has come to stop acting like the presidency is the only office that matters, Buttigieg said. Not only is this a way to get Donald Trump reelected. We have a House to worry about. We have a Senate to worry about.\\n\\nKlobuchar pivoted to the cost of Sanders' proposals, arguing that they would alienate more moderate voters.\\n\\nWe have a huge choice, Klobuchar said. Do you want to have someone in charge of this ticket who wants to put $60 trillion in spending, three times the American economy? I don't think we do. I think we can get all the bold progressive things done without having someone so alienating that we're going to turn off the voters that we need to bring with us.\\n\\nSanders responded that his favorability ratings were among the highest up here onstage, and went on to defend his electability by arguing that he has built a campaign of energy and excitement.\\n\\nThough there is little evidence in exit polls to suggest that Sanders has broadened the Democratic coalition thus far, the Vermont senator promised to keep working toward the largest turnout in the history of the United States.\\n\\nJUST WATCHED Warren, Bloomberg tangle over sexist behavior and 'jokes' Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Warren, Bloomberg tangle over sexist behavior and 'jokes' 01:26\\n\\nWe need to bring working people back into the Democratic Party. We need to get young people voting in a way that they never have before. That is what our campaign is about.\\n\\nWarren's rare shot at Sanders was an attempt to position herself as being be more effective in getting their ideas through Congress.\\n\\nBernie and I agree on a lot of things, but I think I would make a better president than Bernie, she said. Getting a progressive agenda enacted is going to be really hard, and it's going to take someone who digs into the details to make it happen. Bernie and I both wanted to help rein in Wall Street. In 2008, we both got our chance. But I dug in. I fought the big banks. I built the coalitions, and I won.\\n\\nBernie and I both want to see universal health care, but Bernie's plan doesn't explain how to get there, doesn't show how we're going to get enough allies into it, and doesn't show enough about how we're going to pay for it, the Massachusetts senator continued. I dug in. I did the work. And then Bernie's team trashed me for it.\\n\\nSanders doubles down on Castro comments\\n\\nBut some of the sharpest exchanges were on foreign policy , which became a focal point over the past week after Sanders praised social programs implemented by Fidel Castro. During an interview with 60 Minutes, Sanders noted that Americans are very opposed to the authoritarian nature of Cuba but said it was unfair to simply say everything is bad.\\n\\nWhen Fidel Castro came into office, you know what he did? He had a massive literacy program. Is that a bad thing? Even though Fidel Castro did it? Sanders said in the recent 60 Minutes interview.\\n\\nOn Tuesday night, one of the debate moderators noted that Sanders, a self-described democratic socialist, has a track record of expressing sympathy for socialist governments in Cuba and Nicaragua . Can Americans trust that a democratic socialist president will not give authoritarians a free pass? she asked.\\n\\nI have opposed authoritarianism all over the world, Sanders replied. He insisted that his recent comments about Cuba were in line with those that former President Barack Obama has made, praising the country's progress on education.\\n\\nThe crowd booed. Really? Sanders said, looking taken aback. Really? Literacy programs are bad?\\n\\nIt might be a good idea to be honest about American foreign policy, and that includes the fact that America has overthrown governments all over the world in Chile, in Guatemala, in Iran, Sanders continued. And when dictatorships, whether it is the Chinese or the Cubans do something good, you acknowledge that. But you don't have to trade love letters with them.\\n\\nBiden jumped into the conversation, objecting to the characterization of the former President's remarks.\\n\\nHe did not in any way suggest that there was anything positive about the Cuban government, Biden said of Obama.\\n\\nHe, in fact, does not, did not, has never embraced an authoritarian regime and does not now, Biden added, going to argue that Sanders should have condemned authoritarian regimes, instead of calling out their accomplishments.\\n\\nJUST WATCHED Buttigieg says Sanders is too radical to beat Trump Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Buttigieg says Sanders is too radical to beat Trump 03:51\\n\\nButtigieg amplified that point moments later.\\n\\nI am not looking forward to a scenario where it comes down to Donald Trump, with his nostalgia for the social order of the 1950s and Bernie Sanders with a nostalgia for the revolutionary politics of the 1960s, he said.\\n\\nEarlier in the debate when asked why Russia would want to help Sanders' campaign, Buttigieg said Russian leaders want to sow chaos in the American election.\\n\\nThey want chaos and chaos is what's coming our way, Buttigieg said. He described the past three years under Trump as chaotic, divisive, toxic and exhausting.\\n\\nImagine spending the better part of 2020 with Bernie Sanders versus Donald Trump, Buttigieg said.\\n\\nBiden looks to go on offense before South Carolina\\n\\nAfter his first strong showing in Iowa and his wins in New Hampshire and Nevada, several polls have showed Sanders encroaching on Biden's once-dominant lead among black voters.\\n\\nIn an effort to halt Sanders' rise, the former vice president targeted Sanders' record on guns, faulting him for voting against the Brady Bill in 1993. He noted that he had advocated for a longer waiting period in the bill before a person could make a handgun purchase, and that Sanders had opposed that. Biden then invoked the 2015 massacre at Mother Emanuel AME Church in Charleston.\\n\\nI'm not saying he's responsible for the nine deaths, but that man would not have been able to get that weapon had the waiting period been what I suggested, he said.\\n\\nBernie in fact hasn't passed much of anything, Biden said at one point about Sanders' legislative record.\\n\\nHe also took Sanders to task for his past votes giving absolute immunity to gun manufacturers.\\n\\nImagine if I stood here and said we'd give immunity to drug companies. We would give immunity to tobacco companies, Biden said. That has caused carnage on our streets, 150 million people have been killed since 2007 when Bernie voted to exempt the gun manufacturers from liability. More than all the wars, including Vietnam, from that point on.\\n\\nI want to tell you, if I'm elected, NRA, I'm coming for you, Biden said, pointing his finger at the camera. Gun manufacturers, I'm going to take you on and I'm going to beat you. I'm the only one who has done it.\\n\\nIn the back-and forth-about deaths due to gun violence, Biden's use of the 150 million figure was inaccurate. When CNN asked about it, his campaign said he misspoke. About 413,000 people in the US have died from gun violence since 2007. Biden is correct that that figure is more than the number of military casualties since the Vietnam conflict.\\n\\nWhen Sanders was asked why he voted to give gun manufacturers a pass, he tried to turn the question on Biden -- to boos -- by noting that the former Delaware senator voted in support of the invasion of Iraq.\\n\\nMy point was ... I have cast thousands of votes, including bad votes, Sanders said. That was a bad vote.\\n\\nHe noted that he now has a D-minus rating from the National Rifle Association.\\n\\nBloomberg noted his work funding Moms Demand Action, the volunteer wing of Everytown for Gun Safety.\\n\\nI have a 6 million-person organization around this country: Moms Demand Action and Everytown, Bloomberg said. We have got background checks in 20 states. So you can do it. It's Congress that can't seem to do it. And I don't know why we think they're going to do it. The vice president voted for a death bill, and supported the NRA. And certainly Senator Sanders has supported the NRA.\\n\\nSanders repeatedly argued that his positions on guns decades ago were not as relevant as his position now.\\n\\nHere is the good news, because of all these disgusting mass shootings, the American people now understand that we must be aggressive on gun safety; (we will) not be dictated to by the NRA, and I am proud I have a 'D minus' record from the right. If elected president it will be worse than that, he said.\\n\\nBiden also defended his standing in the black community after the moderator noted that he has been losing ground among black voters in South Carolina.\\n\\nI've earned the vote, I've worked like the devil to earn the vote of the African American community, not just here but across the country, Biden said. I've been coming here for years and years, creating jobs here, making sure that the port, for example -- that employs one in 11 people -- we put $500 million in our administration just into this county. We've created jobs for people.\\n\\nWhen asked if he would drop out of the race if he does not win in South Carolina, Biden replied: I will win South Carolina.\\n\\nThis story has been updated with additional developments from Tuesday's debate."}

{"original": "The Mood of the Voter As the race begins in earnest, the public is wary, worried -- and waiting (TIME, September 15, 1980) -- Disenchanted, but not apathetic. Caring about issues, although much more concerned about character. Longing for a strong person to trust, but fearful of strength lacking sound judgment. Leery of weakness, but edgy about brashness. All too mindful of the disappointments of the past, but seeking hope in the future. Leaning toward one man, but often out of desperation and a sense of disdain for the others. Uncommitted. Unpredictable. As the 1980 presidential campaign swings into full stride, the American voter is displaying a show-me attitude as perhaps never before: wary, worried and waiting to see how the candidates perform. This unwontedly watchful and volatile electorate has already turned the race into a highly personal, potentially nasty, intensely competitive -- and, yes, exciting -- contest. The voters who could give Republican Challenger Ronald Reagan a lead as high as 28% over President Jimmy Carter in July and then snatch it all away in August can hardly be regarded as the rock- ribbed supporters of party and candidates that flourished in days of yore. And if the Reagan rise was giddy and the Carter comeback startling, the gadfly persistence of Independent John Anderson adds even more bite and confusion. He blithely dismisses Reagan as irrelevant -- a product of the '20s -- and accuses Carter of abandoning his autobiographical guery of Why Not the Best? for a current claim of I'm not the worst. With such a tight contest now taking shape, Anderson and his appeal to the disgruntled of both parties could prove to be the decisive difference in a few key states and swing the election, most likely to Reagan. The latest public opinion poll conducted for TIME by Yankelovich, Skelly and White discloses just how close the race is once again. Carter and Reagan are deadlocked at 39% each, while Anderson's support is 15% -- precisely the level set by the League of Women Voters for him to qualify as a viable candidate and therefore earn a third spot in its crucial opening debate, set tentatively for Sept. 21 in Baltimore. Carter, who insists on meeting Reagan first without Anderson, still threatened last week not to appear if the Congressman was included. The league's directs were to meet this week to examine the range of recent poll results and decide whether or not to invite Anderson. For so early in the campaign, a surprisingly low 7% of registered voters claim to be undecided about whom they now favor. (The study was based on a national sample of 1,644 registered voters interviewed between Aug. 26 and 28. The sampling error is thus plus or minus 3% and 4.5% when comparing present trend readings with previous TIME studies.) Still, the survey discloses just how shaky those current preferences are. Fully 55% say they are not personally interested or excited about any of the candidates. Only 11% report genuine enthusiasm for Reagan; a mere 9% feel that way about Carter and 6% about Anderson. In fact, much of the support given their preferred candidates is based on voters' opposition to the others, the choices are essentially anti votes. Thus 43% of the voters who prefer Reagan say they do so because they are really voting against Carter. Similarly, 34% of Carter's supporters say their choice is based on opposition to Reagan, while a hefty 61% of Anderson's followers admit that they are motivated by being against Carter and Reagan. Though Carter and Reagan are even up in the race, the poll discloses areas of serious slippage for Reagan in important areas. For one thing, 59% of those preferring Carter claim they do so out of a positive feeling for him: they like his experience, and consider him safer in foreign affairs. Only 48% of Reagan's followers feel a similar sense of confidence in their choice's ability to get things done and to answer the need for a change. At the same time, Reagan's rating on abilities regarded as important by voters has declined. In TIME's last survey in May, 49% of those sampled agreed that Reagan was a leader you can trust, while 42% believe that now. Reagan was then considered acceptable as a President by 64%; the current figure is 54%. Voter confidence in Reagan's ability to handle the economy has dropped from an impressive 75% to 66%, and his perceived competency in foreign affairs has slipped from 72% to 63%. The Californian still worries voters on a basic level: 54% of those surveyed feel that he often does not get his facts straight, and 48% fret that he may be trigger happy. Despite these declines, Reagan still scores higher than Carter in such voter-valued categories as standing up to the Soviets, keeping our defenses strong, getting the hostages out of Iran and making Americans feel good about themselves. On other matters, voters cannot see a major difference between Carter and Reagan on such matters as who could find more jobs for the unemployed, provided moral leadership, cut back U.S. dependence on foreign oil, or avoid making too many campaign promises. Geographically, there has been a significant shift in Carter's 1980 popularity in the South. Among white Southern Protestants, Reagan leads by 48% to 39%, indicating he has made inroads among the potentially influential evangelical and fundamentalist voters who supported Carter in 1976. THis leaves Carter with a statistically insignificant 1% lead in his home territory. Reagan commands a 10% margin in the West, while Carter barely stays ahead in the Northeast and Midwest. This time the survey was deepened to poll more thoroughly in the nation's key industrial states (Indiana, Michigan, Illinois, Ohio, Pennsylvania, New Jersey and New York). The aim was to detect any notable shifts in the blue-collar vote. Large-scale defections from the Democratic Party helped both Dwight Eisenhower and Richard Nixon win the presidency and today seem vital to Reagan's prospects. So far, no real switch has been found. Carter leads by 10 percentage points among blue-collar workers, setting these states up as some of the key battleground between now and November. The survey pinpoints one group of voters still posing a considerable problem for Carter: the former followers of Senator Edward Kennedy. Despite the efforts at the Democratic national Convention to patch up the party's deep rift and Kennedy's later pledges of support for Carter, the Senator's followers now split three ways on what they intend to do: 39% say they will back Carter; 28% prefer Anderson; a surprising 22% are so disaffected that they say they will jump over the wall and vote for Reagan. That degree of party defection could cripple the Carter candidacy. The mood could well be, however, just a passing stage of postconvention blues. While the Kennedy problem lingers for Carter, the Anderson difference so confidently proclaimed by the earnest and stubborn Congressman from Illinois has not really faded either. If Anderson were to drop out, 37% of his present share of the voters say they would switch to Carter, 28% would go to Reagan and 26% claim they would not vote at all. With Anderson out, Carter narrowly leads Reagan in the nationwide popular vote, 44.5% to 43%. However, the sampling did not examine just how Anderson has scored 20% or higher in key states, such as New york, California and Massachusetts. One of the most dramatic findings of the survey came from a more indirect probing of voter sentiment -- and it looks potentially helpful to Carter. In the survey's state of the nation indicator, which measures how people feel about the way things are going in the country in general and how much confidence they have in the future, voters are becoming increasingly optimistic. While only 11% took a positive view of the nation's well-being in May, 21% are upbeat now. As the incumbent, Carter would presumably benefit from any continued upsurge in optimism, which seems centered on a belief that the economy may be revving up again. While nearly all the polls have found that the economy ranks first as an issue, well ahead of foreign affairs, the TIME study finds that, surprisingly, neither has much impact on voter preferences for the presidential candidates. Many polls reveal the voters are thoroughly confused when asked to make judgments about the candidates on most issues; the election seems much more likely to turn on personality than on policy, notes TIME National Political Correspondent John Stacks. One intriguing but as yet unexplained phenomenon that might be linked to issues is Yankelovich's discovery that 10% more women prefer Carter than Reagan. This is balanced, however, by Reagan's 10% edge among men. The vacillations in the polls make most opinion analysts and political scientists leery about how the current campaigns and their various pitches will affect the voters. Traditionally, of course, a majority of postwar voters have turned to the Democratic candidates during a time of economic recession or depression on the theory that the party of F.D.R. is more likely to use Government tools to check the decline. But now a Democratic President is presiding over high inflation and a recession. Simultaneously, Government intervention in the economy has become more suspect. Observes M.I.T. Political Scientist Thomas Ferguson: The signals coming down to the voters are incredibly mixed. There is an enormous amount of confusion even in the political parties. There is turmoil at all sectors of the electorate. Appearing on a panel of pollsters convened in Washington by the American Political Science Association, Warren Mitofsky of CBS News's election and survey unit contended that the issues carry little weight with voters intent on examining the character of the candidates. Said he: We are really seeing a loss of respect for our system of selecting our elective officials. This disenchantment with the candidates is causing voters to look at the personalities rather than the issues. In a moment of rare introspection for a presidential candidate, Anderson last week talked at length to TIME Correspondent Eileen Shields during a flight from Detroit to Washington about the dilemma posed by the nature of the politician process in 1980. I have a fundamental conflict in my thinking that troubles me deeply, he said. I know if I want to please a crowd I repeat, just as Reagan does, the tried-and-true crowd-pleasers over and over again. But I am really going to repeat in my prayers every night the hope that I can resist the temptation. You know, when Carter and Reagan are so vulnerable it is hard to resist the temptation. But I don't think that is what the campaign should be about -- or what the country wants. I can't in the end really sell myself to the country if I am just going around knocking those two. I've got to have something fresh, constructive and different to offer, and it is hard. It is so hard to stay off that other kick, particularly when Reagan shoots four out of five toes as he has done the last couple of weeks. I am not contemptuous of applause. I want people to listen. I want them to respond. I want to inspire them. But I would hope that I have a higher calling than to simply play to the lowest common denominator. Still, conceded Anderson, we are like performers. You're up and you're down. Sometimes you think of something and it inspires you and sometimes you look at your watch and you are not so inspired. More than the other candidates. Anderson can move an audience with his oratory one day, only to turn off his next crowd with a ponderous and even pontificating style of delivery. The President and the former Governor seem far less concerned about resisting the temptation that worries Anderson; they have been zapping each other with increasing zing almost daily. The attacks are deliberate. Reagan is the best standup performer in politics today says John Sears, the campaign manager whom Reagan fired last February. But the fact remains that Reagan's position in the polls is derived from what people think of Carter. Thus the central issue for Reagan's campaign will be to denigrate Carter's record. Despite his speaking skills, Reagan has of course, been too busy trying to explain away a series of bloopers either to maintain a consistent attack on Carter's performance or to attract attention to the Republican policies that he has proposed. Not only has Reagan fallen into uttering such needlessly provocative comments as advocating official governmental contacts with Taiwan, praising the Viet Nam War as a noble cause, suggesting that Darwinism be countered by teaching the biblical story of creation as well, and terming the current recession a severe depression, but his own advisers have jumped readily into the ensuing fray, like a Greek chorus of mourners, to concede in most cases that Reagan was wrong. Says Dean Burch, the senior adviser to Bush: There is a possibility that the caricature of Reagan will become a reality. We have to guard against it. While some of the impulsive Reaganisms may have pleased his more conservative supporters, they feed the doubts about his judgment that bother other voters. Thus the tense staff is trying to set up fail-safe systems to protect Reagan against Reagan. his aides are more carefully reviewing every speech text for pitfalls and insisting that the Governor just stick with the typed pages. In addition, an outside heavyweight adviser -- last week it was James Lynn, who headed Gerald Ford's Office of Management and Budget -- will ride shotgun on the campaign planes to help Reagan. The staff itself, however, remains a problem: it is still far too disorganized. Says an old Reagan friend: Ron doesn't know how to be tough with people. Sometimes he tolerates so-so performances. More emphasis and money will go into Reagan's paid TV commercials. The budget was pegged last week at about $15 million, up $1 million from original plans, and seven spots (three five-minute and four 30-second plugs) have begun to be aired. They are slotted within, before or after such well-watched family shows as The Waltons, Guiding Light, Angie and ABC Friday Night Movie. On TV, Reagan's delivery is warm, low key and artfully staged to project an air of sincerity. Contends Peter Dailey, Reagan's TV ad producer: The camera can look into the soul. In Reagan's case, that's a big asset. While he has talked repeatedly about the need for the U.S. to regain nuclear superiority over the Soviet Union, prompting Carter to accuse him of announcing that he would start an arms race, Reagan's TV pitch will be milder. Seated in an easy chair, he says disarmingly. To preserve our peace and freedom, we must maintain a margin of safety -- not numerical superiority . . . but a balance. The basic Reagan geographical strategy remains unchanged. His aides estimate his firm base in the West will produce about 150 electoral votes. East of the Mississippi, such states as Indiana, New Hampshire, Vermont and Virginia are seen as reasonably safe, giving him another 30 votes, just 90 short of election. Even if Carter should hold the Deep South, which is far from certain, Reagan will look for his victory margin in five targeted states: Ohio, Illinois, Pennsylvania, Texas and Florida. They have 121 electoral votes, and if Reagan can win just the largest three, he should wind up in the Oval Office. Thus nearly 40% of his currently scheduled campaign time (49 days of travel and 95 major appearances) will be devoted to these five states. At the moment, Reagan's aides consider his home state, California, safe enough to be downplayed a bit. New York looks fairly solid for Carter, but with the President being increasingly whittled away there by Anderson, the Californian may step up his efforts to win the state's 41 electoral votes. Anderson's prospects of taking more votes from Carter in New York will be strengthened if, as expected, he gets a place on the state's Liberal Party ballot. As for the Carter staff, it has been astonished by its candidate's catch-up last week: That Reagan is doing our work for us.' Other advisers are more cautious. Campaign Manager Robert Strauss professes to be worried that Carter's rally will generate overconfidence. Says he: I don't think Reagan necessarily is dumb. I don't think he is going to get us into atomic warfare. I don't think he is evil. He's a very likable, attractive man. But Strauss pinpoints Carter's re-election strategy: to portray Reagan as simplistic and not equipped to be President. Proud of his presidential performance, Carter intends to play up his record. Still, the President's main theme will be to attack Reagan. Sums up Hamilton Jordan, Carter's chief strategist: We can have a philosophical discussion about all the issues that face the American people, but the fact is the American people face a choice: Jimmy Carter or Ronald Reagan. Strauss long ago correctly guessed that Reagan's advisers would limit his public appearances. Says Strauss: They're going to try to show just a little bit of leg, but not enough to get him into trouble. By contrast, Carter will join the rough-and- tumble exchange of town meetings and press interviews, where he has invariably been at his best. Contends Strauss: The public likes very much to see the President in the flesh, nonstructured and nonpackaged. He likes it too. The Carter television campaign will stress his heavy responsibilities as President and portray him as being deeply concerned about the particular problems of unemployed blue-collar workers and older people. To tape his commercials, Carter has slipped quietly into a suburban Alexandria, Va., home to chat with eight housewives in a backyard. He has eluded the press to go to a construction site in Maryland to listen to workers, and he has visited a senior citizens' center in the District of Columbia. So far, the Carter travel schedule is much more flexible than Reagan's; stops are generally set for only a week or two in advance. He expects to travel just two or three days a week, holding just one major event a day -- appearances timed of maximum free TV news coverage. To cut costs, he intends to avoid overnight trips as much as possible and has asked campaign aides to double up in hotels or stay with friends while on trips. Geographically, the Carter advisers place great emphasis on the President's need to hold the South, where in 1976 he electoral votes. The Democrats know they must also win some states that Carter lost to Gerald Ford in 1976, including Michigan, Connecticut, Iowa and New Mexico. Differing with Reagan's assessment, they now see new hope of mounting a serious challenge in California, where Carter Pollster Pat Caddell has the President trailing by only eight points. Similarly, Carter will work hard in Texas, where he sees possibilities. The Carter advisers are counting on Vice President Walter Mondale to shepherd unhappy Kennedy supporters back into the Democratic fold. One recruit about to sign up: Robert Kennedy Jr., now a law student at the University of Virginia Law School. Mondale is also busily holding unity meetings to strengthen the old Democratic coalition that many experts feel will grudgingly regroup as Nov. 4 and the prospect of a Ronald Reagan presidency loom ever closer. As for John Anderson, the Carter tactic is to ignore him publicly and try to downgrade his importance. Privately, however, the White House is deeply worried about the Congressman's threat. In 1976 Eugene McCarthy, running independently, won just 1% of the vote, but the Carterites insist that was enough to tip Maine, Iowa, Oklahoma and Oregon into Ford's column. Carter desperately wants to keep Anderson out of the first debate because of the invaluable exposure it would give him. Indeed Carter's men have even suggested that the League of Women Voters hold a five-way first debate, including Libertarian Candidate Ed Clark and the Citizen's Party's Barry Commoner, to take some of the play away from Anderson. But the league turned down the proposal. The President's strategists concede that they have been boxed in by Reagan and Anderson on the debate issue; they fear public wrath if the President ducks a first debate with the other two. Anderson's chances of at least finishing the race brightened considerably last week. His cash-short campaign got relief when the Federal Election Commission ruled that he will be eligible for federal funds if he winds up with 5% or more of the votes. Although how much he could get will depend on how well he draws on Election Day, Anderson now plans to borrow $5 million, raising his anticipated war chest to $15 million. (Candidates who do not qualify for total federal funding are allowed to raise private funds to cover the difference between their eventual government grant and the full subsidy of $29.4 million.) For all the candidates, last week was a time to put the varied theories of their strategists to the test. Determined to nominate the Old Confederacy once again, Carter perspired in shirtsleeves amid some 25,000 Labor Day picnickers in a dusty, red-dirt park in Tuscumbia, Ala. He strummed all the Southern heart-strings he plays so lovingly. He enjoyed the music of Country Stars Charlie Daniels and Larry Gatlin, and shared the stage with former Alabama Governor George Wallace. He told how he had toured the Gettysburg battlefield with his friends Anwar Sadat and Menachem Begin, and how it reminded him that we Southerners believe in the nobility of courage on the battlefield, and because we understand the cost of war, we also believe in the nobility of peace. Carter's not so subtle point: he has worked for arms control, while Reagan encourages an arms race. Well aware that a dozen Ku Klux Klan members were watching in silent, white-sheeted protest some 20 yds. away, Carter drew rebel applause with a deft putdown. These people in white sheets do not understand our region and what it's been through, he said. They do not understand that the South and all of America must move forward. Noting that the Klan had burned a cross in the town the night before, Carter said softly: The One who was crucified taught us to have faith, to hope, not to hate, but to love one another. A few hours later, Carter was the genial host at a far different kind of picnic: a shindig on the South Lawn of the White house for some 800 labor leaders and their wives. Desperately in need of labor support, Carter last week was rewarded with the endorsement of the diminished but still influential AFL-CIO. Yet Carter's most symbolic act of the week was a visit to Independence, Mo., where he held a town meeting in Truman High School and smiled at signs that said: HARRY WOULD LOVE JIMMY and JIMMY CARTER, THE TRUMAN OF THE '80s. He visited the Truman Library, placed red roses on Truman's grave and paid an eight- minute call on ailing Bess Truman, the former President's 95- year-old widow. When I take a step that's not very popular, Carter said at the town meeting, I think of the unpopularity that Harry Truman had to suffer before he was finally vindicated. Reagan, meanwhile, was making a strong pitch for ethnic votes in a Labor Day setting redolent of America's heritage. In New Jersey's Liberty Park, he shed coat and tie to speak before a backdrop containing the Statue of Liberty, Ellis Island and the skyline of lower Manhattan. Scarlet-clad Korean girls sang God Bless America; an Irish war-pipe band in kilts played martial music from the homeland of Reagan's ancestors; and Polish dancers stepped out gracefully in their peasant regalia. Reagan's main coup was to present Stanislaw Walesa, 64, the father of the leader of the workers' protest in Poland, to the cheering crowd. Walesa, who lives in Jersey City, is not a U.S. citizen and has no political preferences. No matter. He helped Reagan by joining in a chorus of God Bless America. Reagan candidly proclaimed his reason for opeing this phase of his campaign in Hudson County, N.J. I'm here because it's the home of Democrats, he said. In this great country there are millions of Democrats as unhappy as we are with the way things are going. Honoring the generations of immigrants, Reagan, in top oratical form, once again evoked the words of a Democratic President by putting a twist on Jack Kennedy line: They didn't ask what this country could do for them, but what they could do for them, but what they could do to make this refuge the greatest home of freedom in history. But today a President of the U.S. would have us believe that dream is over, or at least in need of change. Reagan flew on to Detroit, traditional site of Labor day speeches by Democratic candidates, and visited nearby Allen Park to grill sausages in the backyard of Emil Petri, a steelworker (and a Republican) who had invited over 20 neighbors to meet the candidate. Many of the guests were laid-off autoworkers and steelworkers, the kind of blue-collar Democrats Reagan hopes to lure away from Carter. So far, so good, and then, once again, Reagan botched it. At the Michigan state Fair, he launched another attack on Carter and went too far. Now, I'm happy to be here, he said, while he (Carter) is opening his campaign down in the city that gave birth to and is the parent body of the Ku Klux Klan. Thud. By linking the President with the Klan, Reagan not only outraged Carter's supporters but offended no less than seven Souther Governors, who fired off wires protesting that Reagan had insulted the South. The President promptly jumped on the blunder: I resent very deeply what Ronald Reagan said about the South and about Alabama and about Tuscumbia. Anybody who resorts to slurs and to innuendo against a whole region based on a false statement and a false premise is not doing the South or our nation a good service. Indeed, Reagan had compounded his mistake by getting his facts wrong; Tuscumbia is merely the headquarters of a branch of the Klan. Reagan apologized by telephone to Alabama Governor Forrest (Fob) James, and once again his aides sheepishly tried to explain that their boss had not really meant what he said. All three candidates also paid homage last week to the Jewish vote that could prove critical in such states as New York, Florida and Illinois. The three pledged such rousing and unqualified devotion and support for Israel in speeches to B'nai B'rith in Washington that they all received standing ovations. Reagan's pitch was the most pointed. He assailed Carter for the failure of the U.S. to veto a U.N. resolution condemning Israeli expansionism, charged that the Carter-negotiated Camp David documents contained ambiguities that have now brought negotiations to a dangerous impasse and drew his most fervent applause by declaring that Jerusalem is now and will continue to be one city, undivided, with continuing free access for all. In turn, Carter stoutly defended his Middle East policy, noting last week's announcement that Sadat and Begin had agreed tko resume talks, and declared: There will not be one policy for an election year and another after the election. The same policy that led to Camp David and an uninterrupted supply of American economic and military aid to Israel will continue as long as I am President. But he admitted: I cannot assure you we will always agree with every position taken by the government of Israel. The tone of an increasingly acrimoniously campaign rose in pitch again as Reagan assailed Carter in the strongest terms so far. He cited recent news stories about a newly developed technique for shielding aircraft and other weapons against detection by enemy radar. Before a cheering audience of businessmen in Jacksonville, Reagan claimed this had been the most tightly classified, most highly secret weapons information since the Manhattan Project. Disclosure normally would be illegal, he said. But he charged that the breach of secrecy was blessed and sanctioned by the Carter Administration itself clearly for the sole political purpose of aiding Mr. Carter's troubled campaign. As a result, the Soviet Union has been handed a ten-year head start on developing ways to counter this type of ultrasophisticated weapons system. Defense Secretary Harold Brown angrily denied that the leaks about the defense technique were politically motivated. Responding to the Reagan blast, Press Secretary Jody Powell declared: Any implication that the President or Secretary of Defense acted in a manner which damaged the security of this country is wrong and not responsible and goes beyond the acceptable grounds of political partisanship. Governor Reagan doesn't know what he's talking about. With each candidate so eagerly on the attack so early, the 1980 presidential campaign could swing on a single event in such a volatile year. If held, the debates could turn the trick- perhaps even the very first one. But the candidates are all anxiously looking over their shoulders, wondering when lightning might strike. The Reaganites talk nervously, and sarcastically, of an October surprise, some international event that Carter will be able to exploit as the incumbent. As skirmishes ended and the battle was joined last week, Mondale summed up the long struggle to come succinctly, laconically and with a touch of world-weary realism. Six weeks and 200,000 miles to go, he said. And all of it uphill for every man in the race. By Ed Magnuson. Reported by Christopher Ogden/Washington and Laurence L. Barrett/Washington.

Prosecutors said at least 65 victims were to confront Nassar in court, in the last of three sentencing hearings for the disgraced doctor who molested young girls and women for two decades in the guise of medical treatment. / AFP PHOTO / JEFF KOWALSKY (Photo credit should read JEFF KOWALSKY/AFP/Getty Images)\\n\\nZURICH, SWITZERLAND - SEPTEMBER 22: Harvey Weinstein attends the 'Lion' premiere and opening ceremony of the 12th Zurich Film Festival at Kino Corso on September 22, 2016 in Zurich, Switzerland.

Niki Tsongas, a Democrat, represents the 3rd District of Massachusetts. The views expressed here are solely those of the authors.\\n\\n(CNN) —\\n\\nIn 2007, Lance Corporal Maria Lauterbach reported being raped by a fellow Marine. Several months later, he murdered her. During the eight months between Lauterbach's alleged assault and her murder, she was forced to show up to work every day and serve alongside Cesar Laurean, who was convicted of her first-degree murder. According to the Columbus Dispatch, she was denied a request for a base transfer, and according to NBC and others, endured retaliation from peers and superiors, and consistently struggled to find support from a chain of command and system that favored apathy over action.\\n\\nPHOTO: c/o House of Representatives Mike Turner\\n\\nPHOTO: c/o House of Representatives Niki Tsongas\\n\\nThis tragedy brought to light devastating flaws in the military hierarchy and its justice system; flaws that we discovered fueled a predatory culture. But Maria's story, and those of countless other alleged victims of military sexual assault, have also prompted historic changes to military policy (including new procedures for how the Pentagon investigates assault charges, new systems of reporting, and processes to shield victims from retaliation after reporting) and continue to influence the sustained push to change military culture for the better.\\n\\nFor the better part of a decade, we have worked with the military to identify root causes and institute safeguards that prevent sexual harassment and sexual assault and increase support for survivors.\\n\\nBut the organizational failures at the root of sexual harassment and assault are not unique to the military. Leaders abusing their authority; cultures that frequently close ranks to prevent negative attention; victims suffering retaliation; assailants protected by their colleagues; lack of institutional support; unclear or obstructed paths to justice – these are the same shortcomings now being revealed across industries, from entertainment to education; media to Congress. Sexual harassment and sexual assault in professional workplaces is widespread in America – but there are positive steps we can take.\\n\\nWhile not an apples-to-apples comparison, many of the systemic changes instituted over the past decade within the military can be translated to the civilian sector.\\n\\nThrough our bipartisan work, victims of military sexual crimes now have a right to legal assistance through the military's successful Special Victim's Counsel Program. Military personnel are required to complete anonymous climate surveys to better assess the prevalence of sexually-charged issues. Victims of sexual assault may also now request an expedited transfer to another workplace.\\n\\nConviction of sexual assault in the military now requires automatic processing for dishonorable discharge. These major changes have had positive results for survivors and the military climate as a whole.\\n\\nFor example, according to a military-wide survey conducted by the Defense Department's Office of People Analytics, 78% of victims who made reports were satisfied with their Special Victims' Counsel/Victims' Legal Counsel during the military justice process.\\n\\nSimilarly, private entities should, if victims request it, be encouraged to provide alternate places of work immediately to victims of sexual harassment or sexual assault. Responsible employers ought to provide victims no-cost legal support – you should not suffer financial hardship because you endured sexual harassment at work. Regular, anonymous climate surveys are useful tools every industry should adopt to determine the prevalence of harassment. And private institutions should clearly outline the professional consequences of sexually inappropriate or illegal behavior in the workplace.\\n\\nWhile every institution must wrestle with how best to change its culture and do right by victims, the fight against sexual assault in the military has imparted lessons and created tools that have broader applicability.\\n\\nA military unit succeeds or fails based on its members' ability to trust and cooperate with the women and men standing beside them. As we look around the halls of Capitol Hill, there are places where our culture trends toward insularity over transparency. But, like in the military, trust is essential between members, staff and all those involved in making our government run.\\n\\nWhich is why Congress, in particular, has an opportunity to set a powerful example by implementing quick and effective changes, and there are bipartisan efforts already underway to do so. We co-sponsored H.R. 4396, the ME TOO Congress Act, which incorporates many of the aforementioned military-specific recommendations, including victims' counsel, increased training, climate surveys, and enhanced responsibilities and authorities for the Congressional Office of Compliance to investigate sexual harassment and assault claims. This bill is an important next step now that Congress has mandated sexual harassment training for all members and staff.\\n\\nGet our free weekly newsletter Sign up for CNN Opinion's new newsletter.\\n\\nJoin us on Twitter and Facebook\\n\\nMilitary sexual assault is far from a solved crisis and we have much more work to do to change the military culture that has enabled these crimes for too long. But systemic changes in the military have had an impact and can also serve as a model for how broader society moves forward from this watershed moment."}
{"original": "The best home, rental and car insurance is not necessarily the least expensive, but the one that covers you when you need it.\\n\\nThat's according to policy-holders who reported their experiences to Clearsurance, an independent insurance information site, which produced a ranking of the best insurance companies of 2018.\\n\\nAnd the ranking shows that the best mix of affordability and service isn't always from the big players.\\n\\nThe companies in the top ten weren't so much the large national companies that we see advertised all the time, says Todd Kozikowski, co-founder and chief revenue officer of Clearsurance. But rather, it was regional carriers who offered good rates and great service, and even better service than some of the nationally known brands.\\n\\nRelated: 3 car buying tricks to ensure you get a good deal\\n\\nOnly two national companies make it on all three top 10 lists of best home, auto and renter's insurance: USAA and Geico.\\n\\nUSAA, a national company for military members and their families, had the best overall performance across all three lines of insurance. The Texas-based company ranked first for homeowners and renters insurance while finishing second for auto insurance. Geico was the only other company to land on all three lists.\\n\\nThe other top finishers? They are lesser known national carriers or mid-sized regional insurers.\\n\\nNew Jersey Manufacturers edged out USAA to be named the top-ranked car insurance company. And Erie Insurance Group ranked second for homeowners and fifth for car insurance.\\n\\nClearsurance's rankings came from looking at more than 50,000 customer reviews submitted by policyholders on its website in 2017. Each company's score came from factoring-in consumer ratings for the overall company, customer service and users' likelihood to recommend and to renew with the company. About half of the reviews were from policyholders who had experienced at least one claim with their company.\\n\\nCompanies had to meet a 100-review minimum to be included. For example, home and renters insurance company, Lemonade, was not included because the company didn't get 100 reviews, said Kozikowski.\\n\\nLooking for insurance can be overwhelming. Here are three trends to keep in mind when looking at the options.\\n\\nService or price?\\n\\nWe live in a five star world, says Kozikowski. We rate everything from cars to consumer products to banana slicers. But when it comes to insurance, consumers often think too simplistically. They are only thinking about price. We forget about service reputation and the ability of a company to honor your policy should something go wrong.\\n\\nThe policy-holders who weighed-in on their experiences in this ranking show that service is equally, if not more important, than price.\\n\\nAnd just because something is cheaper doesn't mean it is more or better coverage, says Kozikowski. You may save 50% off other policies, but it may only be a six month policy.\\n\\nBig or small insurer?\\n\\nPeople are reconsidering the big national carrier, says Kozikowski. The regional company, while it may not have the big cash reserves of a national, they may have the ability to be more nimble and within the claims department get to a decision faster and that leads to people being more satisfied with the service.\\n\\nWhile smaller carriers may not have the huge resources of national carriers, they can be more nimble and may more quickly address your claim.\\n\\nLook in your state in your region, says Kozikowski. There are great companies with tremendous service that you may not have heard of. They may be more empowered to help out, even if they don't have the marketing dollars.\\n\\nWhat are the insurer's incentives?\\n\\nBe wary of online quote generators or insurance comparison sites. Often these sites have a financial incentives that push you toward a certain company, or get paid when you select certain companies.\\n\\nOne sure way to find out what people think of their insurer, without incentives, is to ask your friends, co-workers and neighbors.\\n\\nPeople's experience with insurance companies is not something they'll often talk about, but if you ask whether they're happy with their insurer, they will likely have a pretty strong opinion.\\n\\nA crowdsourcing site like Clearsurance or other independent sources of information like Consumer Reports can also help you learn about the actual experiences of policyholders to find out if a company is a good blend of price and service and right for you."}

{"original": "(CNN) —\\n\\nIt's been almost 10 months since the coronavirus pandemic landed on US shores, and in that time, the travel industry has become a shadow of its former self. With international borders mostly closed, people hunkered down in their homes and business travel reduced to a fraction of its former self, airlines and hotels are seeing only a sliver of the travelers they had just a year ago.\\n\\nBut with vaccines now ramping up production, it's likely that travel begins its comeback in 2021. And if you've been eager to book a trip for later this year, you may want to start looking at your options now instead of waiting to see how things unfold. That's because there are a number of reasons that booking today could be a better choice than holding off until we're already deep into 2021.\\n\\n1. Most flights can now be changed for free\\n\\nThere aren't many silver linings to the pandemic cloud we've been living under for nearly a year now, but one of the few bits of good news is that the major US airlines — American, Delta and United — have dropped their change fees on all domestic tickets and most international itineraries departing from North America. The one exception is basic economy tickets, and even some of those can still be changed without a fee depending on how and when they're booked.\\n\\n(Also, let's give credit here to Southwest, which has never had basic economy or change fees in the first place. If you're looking for a passenger-friendly airline, Southwest continues to have some of the best policies of all the US carriers, including easy-to-change tickets and free checked bags.)\\n\\nNow, that doesn't mean all airline tickets are refundable. There's a big difference between changeable and refundable. Basically, the new policies mean you can change your ticket before departure and not have to pay an extra fee. But unless you specifically pay more for a refundable flight, you still can't get your money back on most tickets unless there's a cancellation by the airline itself.\\n\\nAnd while there are no longer fees for changing your flight, you'll still have to pay any difference between the original fare you bought and the price of the new ticket if it's more. Conversely, if the price of your new flight is lower, both American and Delta will give you a credit for the difference. (United just pockets it, so keep that policy in mind when you're choosing an airline.)\\n\\nStill, the new rules offer a lot more flexibility and make it more attractive to go ahead and book since there's no risk of losing your money if a vaccine doesn't make it to you before your trip. It also means it's worth locking down a great deal for the future if you find one now. Speaking of which…\\n\\n2. Great deals are everywhere\\n\\nUnsurprisingly, struggling airlines and hotels are doing everything they can to get people to book. And while now isn't a good time to partake in unnecessary travel, you can take advantage of deals now for trips in the future.\\n\\nWhat kinds of deals can you get? Just as an example, JetBlue is currently running a flash sale with flights between January and June starting at $59 one way. Even June may still be too soon for a leisure trip, but you can get from San Francisco to Honolulu for Thanksgiving at a round-trip price of $326 as of this writing.\\n\\nIf you're interested in an international getaway, there are also deals to be had. Right now, you can book from New York to London in November for $357 round trip, or score a round-trip itinerary between Chicago and Amsterdam for around $492.\\n\\nTo find cheap airfares, either use Google Flights or an online travel agency to search for trips, or sign up for notifications from a deal site, such as The Flight Deal or Scott's Cheap Flights. Or try a data-driven app like Hopper to find the ideal time to book.\\n\\nAnd if you've been sitting on a stack of frequent flyer miles, now's the time to use them. Award availability is more open than it has been in years as airlines try to fill seats, and most US airlines no longer charge a fee to cancel an award ticket and get your miles back (again, United is the exception if you cancel less than 30 days from departure). So put aside some time to search the airline's website and see what sorts of miles deals appear.\\n\\n3. Travel credit cards can protect you if you get sick\\n\\nPHOTO: iStock You may already be eligible for various forms of travel insurance by using the credit cards in your purse or wallet.\\n\\nEven with changeable flights, there may still be some aspects of a booked trip that are difficult or impossible to change, and you don't want to lose money if you get sick and can't travel.\\n\\nYou could buy a travel insurance policy to cover you in case the worst happens, but they can be expensive, and not all of them will cover claims related to the coronavirus pandemic. Fortunately, a cheaper and better way to protect yourself might already be in your purse or wallet: your credit card.\\n\\nMany travel credit cards include various forms of travel protection, such as trip cancellation and interruption coverage, travel accident insurance, emergency evacuation coverage and more. While these protections generally don't cover you if you voluntarily cancel your trip due to the pandemic, they often do cover you if you personally get sick from the coronavirus.\\n\\nEvery credit card offers different levels of coverage, and some don't have any travel protections at all, so it's important to check the fine print before you book your trip with a specific credit card to know exactly what you're being protected against. But if you want to be sure that your travel investment is safe, choose the right credit card to book your post-pandemic vacation.\\n\\nRelated: Read CNN Underscored's guide to the best credit cards with travel insurance protections.\\n\\n4. Demand is likely to pick up later in the year\\n\\nWhile it's impossible to predict how long a full vaccine rollout will take and when international destinations will start to lift travel restrictions, it seems likely that travel will begin to ramp up by the second half of 2021.\\n\\nOn the other hand, it's easy to predict that demand for travel is going to explode as soon as planes are fully back in the skies. With so many people cooped up in their homes for so long, many have a palpable desire to get to an exotic destination as soon as possible.\\n\\nOnce demand takes off, great airfares and award availability are likely to taper off. That doesn't mean deals will completely disappear — industry leaders are projecting that business travel, which is the most lucrative part of the market for airlines, won't fully return for several years. But if you want to lock in a great deal, it's better to do it now while demand is still depressed.\\n\\n5. Give yourself something to look forward to\\n\\nPHOTO: iStock After the last year, everyone could use a vacation.\\n\\nIt's been a tough year, and even though we may be starting to see the light at the end of the tunnel, there are still a number of tough months ahead. By booking yourself a trip now, you'll have something to look forward to at the end of it. Taking care of your mental health is just as important as taking care of your physical health, and the idea of an upcoming trip may help get you through the slog.\\n\\nAnd even with all of the above in mind, if you just don't feel comfortable booking future travel at the moment, don't feel bad about that either. Many people don't have a flexible enough family or work schedule to allow themselves to book speculative travel with so many unknowns still out there.\\n\\nIf that's you, there's one other thing you can do while waiting for travel to resume: earn extra travel rewards on your credit card. Many cards offer big sign-up bonuses to new card holders, and those bonuses alone can be enough to book a trip when the world is finally more stable. Plus, you can use a credit card to earn rewards on the everyday things you buy while you're stuck at home.\\n\\nSo, if you aren't ready to book travel yet but want to make sure you have enough frequent flyer points or miles to go somewhere great when you finally can, check out our list of the best travel credit cards and see if one of them might be a good fit for you."}

Authorities said Tuesday, Oct. 31, 2017, that three Dartmouth psychology professors are under criminal investigation for allegations of sexual misconduct. The previous week the college said the professors were put on paid leave and had their access to campus restricted due to allegations of serious misconduct. The college later told authorities it had received allegations of sexual misconduct. (AP Photo/Jim Cole, File)\\n\\n(CNN) —\\n\\nDartmouth College says it is launching a new initiative to combat sexual harassment and abuses of power on campus. But a lawyer for seven women who are suing the university over its handling of sexual harassment allegations say the efforts miss the mark.\\n\\nThe announcement comes nearly two months after a federal complaint was filed against the Ivy League school by seven current and former graduate students who allege three professors created a toxic environment where female subjects were routinely subjected to sexual harassment and even rape.\\n\\nA school inquiry led to the resignations of the three professors in 2018 and the school pledged to take steps to improve the campus culture. The new Campus Climate and Culture Initiative is the latest step in that direction, school officials said in a press release.\\n\\nThe new program will include the following components:\\n\\n- A single policy to address sexual misconduct for faculty, staff, and students, with appropriate processes for adjudicating potential violations;\\n\\n- A mandatory online sexual violence prevention training program for all faculty, staff, professional and graduate students, and postdoctoral scholars;\\n\\n- Research advisory committees for all graduate programs to ensure that all graduate students have access to multiple advisors.\\n\\nThe announcement comes as American universities grapple with how to handle allegations of campus sexual misconduct and their obligations under Title IX, the federal law that bars discrimination based on sex, including harassment, in federally funded education programs and activities.\\n\\nThe Department of Education in November proposed new rules for dealing with sexual harassment and assault on college campuses that would bolster the rights of those accused of wrongdoing.\\n\\nThe lawsuit accuses the New Hampshire school of failing to create an environment free from gender-based discrimination, in violation of Title IX.\\n\\nDartmouth says the new program will expand the school's Title IX office, which is responsible for reviewing reports of sexual misconduct and conducting investigations. The school also pledged to increase mental health resources at Dartmouth and said that an outside expert who specializes in creating inclusive communities will review academic departments.\\n\\nThe lawsuit claims that the prominent researchers, who no longer are allowed on campus, coerced female students into drinking and made the women feel as if their success depended on their willingness to participate in their alcohol-saturated culture the men created.\\n\\nThe complaint claims that Dartmouth knew about the professors' behavior for more than 16 years and did nothing until 2017, when several female graduate students reported the allegations to the college's Title IX office. During the Title IX investigation, the lawsuit claims that Dartmouth failed to provide the plaintiffs with support, accommodations or guidance, then unilaterally terminated the disciplinary process without seeking their input.\\n\\nPreviously, school officials said they applauded the courage of the women who came forward. However, we respectfully, but strongly, disagree with the characterizations of Dartmouth's actions in the complaint and will respond through our own court filings, they said.\\n\\nDeborah Marcuse, an attorney representing seven women plaintiffs in the sexual harassment lawsuit, said the initiatives miss the mark and simply bring the school into compliance with federal law.\\n\\nTo the extent that Dartmouth is now seeking to conform its policies to what federal law requires, we certainly support that though we think it's long overdue, Marcuse said. What's striking about this is that Dartmouth continues to fail to acknowledge or accept responsibility for the damage that its long history of inaction has caused.\\n\\nMarcuse faulted the school for not reaching out to her clients for their input. Dartmouth's formal response to their complaint is due in a little over a week on January 15.\\n\\nIt appears to us that for all of the lip service to their courage, there has been no interest from Dartmouth in materially responding to or really listening to these women despite a lot of vague call outs to 'we want to include everyone and everything', she said.\\n\\nIf you just look at the nature of the various responses there really just isn't any acknowledgment that what these women experienced is something that has had any impact on Dartmouth at all."}

Euro area financial stability must be safeguarded.\\n\\nSo what is behind the current crisis around the euro zone's third-largest economy? And what could it mean for Europe and the world if it escalates?\\n\\nDomenico Lombardi, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and former International Monetary Fund executive board member, says the roots of Italy's troubles lie in its huge public debt and low growth rate.\\n\\nItaly's economy has been growing at only 0.3%, he said, and most importantly is projected to grow at a similarly feeble rate for the next few years.\\n\\nThis very low rate of growth really is one of the lowest in the world, he said, and on top of that Italy has a very high public debt.\\n\\nThat debt stands at about 120% of gross domestic product (GDP) -- or in other words, a fifth more than the country's annual economic output -- and is one of the highest in the world, bar that of Greece, which has had to be bailed out by Europe.\\n\\nPut these two factors together in Italy and it becomes clear that the economy is not going to be able to generate enough resources to pay for its debt, Lombardi says.\\n\\nDouglas McWilliams, chief executive of the London-based Centre for Economics and Business Research, also believes that Italy is not growing strongly enough to prevent its GDP ratio rising to unsustainable levels.\\n\\nHe warned in a report Thursday that Italy was bound to default on its debt -- although Spain, also facing rising borrowing costs, might not -- saying: Greece cannot sort out its debt problem and realistically the same is the case for Italy.\\n\\nBarroso's statement later Thursday said the rising cost of borrowing for Italy and Spain was a cause of deep concern. But, he insisted, the bond markets' reaction was clearly unwarranted on the basis of economic and budgetary fundamentals in those two countries.\\n\\nIn fact, the tensions in bond markets reflect a growing concern among investors about the systemic capacity of the euro area to respond to the evolving crisis, he said, in a statement that fueled anxiety about broader European stability.\\n\\nBerlusconi also sought to push back against the idea Italy was in particular danger, with an address to Parliament a day earlier in which he said the economic challenges it faces need to be tackled with determination and without panic.\\n\\nWe do not deny we are facing a crisis, he said, but stressed Italy's banks, institutions and political system were strong enough to cope.\\n\\nOur economy is solid, he said. Our banks are solid. They are well capitalized. They have liquidity. They have overcome the stress tests.\\n\\nBut the speech was light on concrete policy measures, analysts say, and may not have been enough to deter market speculators who now have Italy in their sights.\\n\\nProfessor Iain Begg of the London School of Economics told CNN that while Berlusconi's public return to the helm on the economy was welcome after a conspicuous absence, Italy's mercurial prime minister is also a part of the problem.\\n\\nItaly under Berlusconi has failed to grasp the nettle of economic reform to tackle low growth over a sustained period, Begg said. In addition, he said, Berlusconi erred last month by publicly criticizing Finance Minister Giulio Tremonti (who is himself troubled by corruption allegations) over recently announced austerity measures.\\n\\nAs soon as you start playing these kind of games politically, the markets smell blood and as soon as they scent it, they start tearing flesh, Begg said.\\n\\nHe argues that Italy should not be in trouble in the first place because although its debt is high, it is not rising.\\n\\nAlso, the public-sector deficit -- the gap between taxation and expenditure -- is very low at 4% compared with other countries, such as 10% in the UK and 11% in the United States. Italy isn't exposed to the same kind of property bubble as Spain and its banking system is strong, Begg said.\\n\\nBut other elements, like the new debt deals agreed for Greece, Ireland and Portugal, have paradoxically pushed up borrowing costs for Italy to record levels -- with bond yields, or interest rates on government debt, reaching 6% -- and put it under greater pressure, he said.\\n\\nUnlike McWilliams, Begg believes Italy is highly unlikely to default on its huge debt -- but its situation is nonetheless precarious if it wants to avoid years of low growth.\\n\\nHowever, anxieties over Italy's economic future have led many to wonder what its default might mean for Europe and beyond, with the dreaded word contagion on many lips.\\n\\nLombardi believes the current situation is serious. If you affect Italy, you can really weaken the euro significantly, he says, describing it as the weakest link among Europe's big economies.\\n\\nWorse, he says, the European Union, the IMF and the European rescue fund do not have enough money to bail it out as they did smaller European economies -- sparking a potential domino effect.\\n\\nSo far the crisis has been limited to Greece, Ireland and Portugal, he said.\\n\\nBut of course if the crisis was to hit Italy, it would spread also to France, to the rest of the euro area, and of course you would have contagion to the U.S. through the banking system.\\n\\nThe huge public debt held by the United States also would make it more vulnerable to speculators, he added.\\n\\nAndrea Rebusco, head of trading services Italy for IG Markets, told CNN the mood in Italy was grim although he does not believe his country's situation is drastic.\\n\\nWhile the government had done the right thing in passing the austerity measures, he said, it came too late. People don't see enough effort from the politicians to stimulate the economy and carry out structural reforms, he said.\\n\\nHis message is echoed on the streets of Rome.\\n\\nMaria Leone has run a small but popular beauty center in the heart of the city for decades but is pessimistic about the current situation. It's a disaster, a very difficult moment, she told CNN. Everyone asks for discounts. None of Berlusconi's laws have helped small businesses like mine.\\n\\nCompared to the past we need to be more competitive, but it's an unfair competition, against immigrants that run their businesses out of any control, and against big globalized companies.\\n\\nMauro Servini, a 34-year-old barman in Rome, is single and doesn't think he'll ever have a family because he earns too little.\\n\\nI hate Berlusconi and all the politicians. They should first think about cutting their salaries and being a good example for the nation, he said. My future...? Better not to think about it.\\n\\nSo what does Italy need to do next?\\n\\nExperts seem to agree that economic reforms are needed in order to stimulate growth and that Italy should stick to the terms of its new austerity package, with cuts to public services and the social welfare system over the next decade.\\n\\nThe country must also invest in research and development and reform its labor markets to make its companies competitive against those of emerging economies, they say.\\n\\nItaly also needs the support of its partners in Europe, including the other big economies such as Germany and France, and institutions like the European Central Bank. Italy's politicians must also present a completely united front to ward off increased speculation, Begg said.\\n\\nAnd the picture is not altogether bleak. Unemployment in Italy, at just over 8%, is not as high as in Spain or Greece, Begg said, giving more leeway for the government to carry out tough reforms and the economy to be turned round.\\n\\nOrsola Longhini, a 24-year-old student in Rome who completed a degree in art and has just started a second one in psychology, told CNN she could see a brighter future ahead.\\n\\nI don't pretend to have the standard of life that my parents gave me, but I'll make it and, one day, I'll have a job as art therapist and a family as well. I'm investing in a serious education, hoping that one day I will be able to do what I really want.\\n\\nCNN's Jim Boulden, Livia Borghese and Kendra Petersen contributed to this report."}

The plants grow from cuttings for approximately two months and then blossom before being harvested, dried, stored in jars for a month and later processed to be consumed on site. Spanish law prohibits the possession of soft drugs like cannabis in public and its growth to be sold for profit is illegal. But the law does tolerate growing cannabis for personal use and its consumption in private. Dozens of private marijuana smoking clubs operate across Spain that take advantage of this legal loophole that serve cannabis users who do not want to get their drugs from the streets.

Last year, doctors prescribed the herb to about 25,000 patients suffering from cancer, epilepsy, post-traumatic stress and degenerative diseases. The purpose is not to cure them but to alleviate their symptoms.

Starting New Year's Day, recreational marijuana can be sold legally in California. (AP Photo/Mathew Sumner)\\n\\nStory highlights Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced Thursday he was rewriting the federal government's stance on marijuana prosecution How that plays out on the ground is a question that has kept the phones of marijuana attorneys busy\\n\\n(CNN) —\\n\\nIt was a week of highs and lows for marijuana enthusiasts. Only three days after California opened its first legal weed dispensary, becoming the latest US state to trade in kosher cannabis, a massive reversal from the Justice Department has left the burgeoning industry in doubt.\\n\\nAttorney General Jeff Sessions announced Thursday he was rewriting the federal government's stance on marijuana prosecution, shifting policy away from the last administration's hands-off approach to one that brings more risk to the players in states where the drug is decriminalized.\\n\\nThe 2013 Cole memo that recognized that marijuana was still illegal under federal law but gave prosecutors permission to direct resources away from enforcement in states with decriminalization laws is no more. Now, per the DOJ, federal prosecutors are to enforce the laws enacted by Congress and to follow well-established principles when pursuing prosecutions related to marijuana activities.\\n\\nHow that plays out on the ground, from sunny California to snowed-in Massachusetts, is a question that has kept the phones of marijuana attorneys busy.\\n\\nYou may have some questions too.\\n\\nCan I still buy legal weed?\\n\\nYes you can, said Brian Vicente, a marijuana attorney based in Denver. In the six states where recreational marijuana is legalized and its sale is allowed, if you meet the requirements, there's nothing to stop you from going to a dispensary and making a purchase.\\n\\nBut is it risky?\\n\\nWe have never historically seen the federal government prosecute people for small possession of marijuana. I think it's highly unlikely the federal government will be using their scarce federal resources to hone in on marijuana users, Vicente said.\\n\\nWhile marijuana possession remains illegal under federal law, small-time consumers are not in the crosshairs of Thursday's announcement. Sessions, in his memo, instructs prosecutors to weigh relevant considerations like the seriousness of the crime, the deterrent effect of criminal prosecution, and the cumulative impact of particular crimes on the community. He also mentions the DOJ's finite resources.\\n\\nVicente, though, stresses that consumers need to know their states' marijuana laws inside and out – legal purchase limits, driving under the influence and across state lines restrictions – and warns that it's possible federal officials could prosecute violations of those.\\n\\nWhat about business owners?\\n\\nHere's where the DOJ decision could really bare its teeth. By empowering US attorneys to decide on their own whether or not to prosecute the sale of marijuana in states that have decriminalized it, risk for industry movers is greater.\\n\\nThe reaction from the top prosecutors in districts with legalized recreational marijuana has been mostly mild. In Colorado, the US attorney said in a statement that his office would not change its approach, which has already been guided by the principles outlined in Sessions' memo. Other prosecutors, from Alaska and Maine, and districts based in Seattle and Portland, said they too would continue their practices, focusing resources on combating violent crime and large-scale drug trafficking.\\n\\nBut still, US attorneys for the Southern District of California, encompassing San Diego, and for the District of Massachusetts, signaled a potentially stricter tact. In San Diego, US Attorney Adam Braverman said his prosecutors will evaluate violations of (federal drug laws) in accordance with our district's federal law enforcement priorities. In Massachusetts, US Attorney Andrew Lelling said he intends to meet with our federal partners to discuss enforcement efforts and priorities.\\n\\nIf these US attorneys say they want to toe the party line and attack these marijuana companies they've got all the power of the federal government behind them, so the risk has increased, said Derek Connor, a Las Vegas-based marijuana attorney.\\n\\nFor many stakeholders in the marijuana industry, Thursday was a difficult day.\\n\\nI've talked to 15 clients today ranging from folks in Ohio to Florida to Denver, Vicente said. They're pretty concerned. They're trying to peel this back and figure out what layer of risk they have. It's a bit of a scary day for those folks.\\n\\nWhat could the prosecutors do?\\n\\nWhether they'll do it or not – with considerations of tight budgets and competing priorities – US attorneys' offices can now begin crackdowns at various points in the billion dollar industry.\\n\\nLegal authorities described potential scenarios.\\n\\nThe US attorney for Boston would direct the (Drug Enforcement Administration) and say, 'listen, it is now a priority for us to go after marijuana businesses,' and they would engage in investigations or maybe even kick in the door of a marijuana dispensary clearly violating federal law and arrest them, Vicente said.\\n\\nAdded Connor: It would be started like any other federal criminal investigation. I would imagine there would be some cease-and-desist letters. 'You've got a certain number of days to shut down and cease operations.'\\n\\nConfidential informants could be used to play purchasers before search warrants could be executed, Connor continued.\\n\\nIn any situation, the case against a legitimate distributor would be exceedingly easy, Connor said.\\n\\nIn these states where everything's regulated so tightly from seed to stem, essentially you've built the feds a case for them by virtue of these federal regulations, Connor said. You've basically handed them on evidence on a silver platter."}

Despite the doctor's warning, the crew stayed the course while the doctor and flight attendants tried to treat Brittany, who was 25 years old at the time. She was taken to a hospital immediately upon landing, but died three days later.\\n\\nNow her family is suing the airline for wrongful death.\\n\\nBrad Cranshaw, the attorney for Brittany's husband and her parents, told CNN Friday the family's main objective isn't winning a financial settlement.\\n\\nThey want the airline to re-examine its policy and procedures so this won't happen to anyone else, he said.\\n\\nThe family wants something (they) can't have, and that's Brittany back, Cranshaw said. But we are interested in how American intends to speak to the issues that lead to the circumstance that took Brittany's life and the pilots' decision making.\\n\\nAn American Airlines representative said the company was deeply saddened by this event and our thoughts and prayers continue to go out to Mrs. Oswell's loved ones.\\n\\nWe take the safety of our passengers very seriously and we are looking into the details of the complaint, the airline said.\\n\\nWhat went wrong?\\n\\nAlmost everything, it seems.\\n\\nAfter Brittany became dizzy and passed out about three hours into the flight, the crew asked passengers if there was a doctor on board. A physician on the flight examined the young woman and determined she may have been suffering from a panic attack, the complaint for the lawsuit says. She regained consciousness and later talked to the crew, the complaint says.\\n\\nShortly after this episode, the suit says, she was found on the lavatory floor and had vomited and defecated all over herself and the lavatory. Once again, the flight attendants summoned the doctor for help while they grabbed on-board medical supplies\\n\\nAfter another examination, the doctor directed the flight attendants to inform the flight crew that it needed to divert the plane from its scheduled arrival at Dallas-Fort Worth to the nearest airport, so Brittany could receive proper medical care, according to the complaint.\\n\\nThe flight captain had the doctor come to the flight deck and relay information about the situation to American Airlines' on-call physician, the lawsuit says.\\n\\nHowever, despite the first-hand observations of the seriousness of Brittany's conditions by the medical doctor who treated her and who had requested the flight diversion, the Plaintiffs are informed and believe that the captain elected to continue the flight to Dallas-Fort Worth airport after conferring with the physician on call. Upon information and belief, the flight was approximately ninety (90) minutes from landing at that time, the complaint reads.\\n\\nCranshaw said the flight was near Albuquerque, New Mexico, when the doctor told the crew it was necessary to land quickly so Brittany could get to a hospital.\\n\\nThe question is, why was no landing attempted and why did American choose to continue going on? the attorney asked.\\n\\nSoon after the doctor left the cockpit to return to Brittany's aid, the 25-year-old's pulse and breathing stopped.\\n\\nThe doctor and flight attendants tried to use an Automatic External Defibrillator (AED) on the young woman, but the machine indicated that no shock was administered, despite three attempts. She was given a dose of epinephrine from the plane's emergency medical kit and was also given cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) until the flight landed in Dallas, but she never regained consciousness, the lawsuit said.\\n\\nDoctors at Baylor Medical Center diagnosed her with anoxic brain damage and an acute embolism. She died a few days later.\\n\\nThe complaint alleges that the airline's failure to timely divert the flight and make an emergency landing denied Brittany the ability and opportunity to receive proper medical care in a timely manner, resulting in her death. It also says that American Airlines failed to provide working medical equipment and supplies to treat Brittany during the flight."}

Authorities said Tuesday, Oct. 31, 2017, that three Dartmouth psychology professors are under criminal investigation for allegations of sexual misconduct. The previous week the college said the professors were put on paid leave and had their access to campus restricted due to allegations of serious misconduct. The college later told authorities it had received allegations of sexual misconduct. (AP Photo/Jim Cole, File)\\n\\n(CNN) —\\n\\nDartmouth College says it is launching a new initiative to combat sexual harassment and abuses of power on campus. But a lawyer for seven women who are suing the university over its handling of sexual harassment allegations say the efforts miss the mark.\\n\\nThe announcement comes nearly two months after a federal complaint was filed against the Ivy League school by seven current and former graduate students who allege three professors created a toxic environment where female subjects were routinely subjected to sexual harassment and even rape.\\n\\nA school inquiry led to the resignations of the three professors in 2018 and the school pledged to take steps to improve the campus culture. The new Campus Climate and Culture Initiative is the latest step in that direction, school officials said in a press release.\\n\\nThe new program will include the following components:\\n\\n- A single policy to address sexual misconduct for faculty, staff, and students, with appropriate processes for adjudicating potential violations;\\n\\n- A mandatory online sexual violence prevention training program for all faculty, staff, professional and graduate students, and postdoctoral scholars;\\n\\n- Research advisory committees for all graduate programs to ensure that all graduate students have access to multiple advisors.\\n\\nThe announcement comes as American universities grapple with how to handle allegations of campus sexual misconduct and their obligations under Title IX, the federal law that bars discrimination based on sex, including harassment, in federally funded education programs and activities.\\n\\nThe Department of Education in November proposed new rules for dealing with sexual harassment and assault on college campuses that would bolster the rights of those accused of wrongdoing.\\n\\nThe lawsuit accuses the New Hampshire school of failing to create an environment free from gender-based discrimination, in violation of Title IX.\\n\\nDartmouth says the new program will expand the school's Title IX office, which is responsible for reviewing reports of sexual misconduct and conducting investigations. The school also pledged to increase mental health resources at Dartmouth and said that an outside expert who specializes in creating inclusive communities will review academic departments.\\n\\nThe lawsuit claims that the prominent researchers, who no longer are allowed on campus, coerced female students into drinking and made the women feel as if their success depended on their willingness to participate in their alcohol-saturated culture the men created.\\n\\nThe complaint claims that Dartmouth knew about the professors' behavior for more than 16 years and did nothing until 2017, when several female graduate students reported the allegations to the college's Title IX office. During the Title IX investigation, the lawsuit claims that Dartmouth failed to provide the plaintiffs with support, accommodations or guidance, then unilaterally terminated the disciplinary process without seeking their input.\\n\\nPreviously, school officials said they applauded the courage of the women who came forward. However, we respectfully, but strongly, disagree with the characterizations of Dartmouth's actions in the complaint and will respond through our own court filings, they said.\\n\\nDeborah Marcuse, an attorney representing seven women plaintiffs in the sexual harassment lawsuit, said the initiatives miss the mark and simply bring the school into compliance with federal law.\\n\\nTo the extent that Dartmouth is now seeking to conform its policies to what federal law requires, we certainly support that though we think it's long overdue, Marcuse said. What's striking about this is that Dartmouth continues to fail to acknowledge or accept responsibility for the damage that its long history of inaction has caused.\\n\\nMarcuse faulted the school for not reaching out to her clients for their input. Dartmouth's formal response to their complaint is due in a little over a week on January 15.\\n\\nIt appears to us that for all of the lip service to their courage, there has been no interest from Dartmouth in materially responding to or really listening to these women despite a lot of vague call outs to 'we want to include everyone and everything', she said.\\n\\nIf you just look at the nature of the various responses there really just isn't any acknowledgment that what these women experienced is something that has had any impact on Dartmouth at all."}
{"original": "Editor's Note: CNN political commentator Robby Mook ran the 2015-16 presidential campaign for Hillary Clinton and is now a senior fellow at Harvard University. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his.\\n\\n(CNN) —\\n\\nElection security has come under scrutiny over the last year – and deservedly so. The 2016 election opened our eyes to how new technologies we rushed to purchase after the butterfly ballots and hanging chads of the 2000 election created new vulnerabilities hard to imagine at the time.\\n\\nPHOTO: CNN Robby Mook\\n\\nWe have known how bad this problem is for over a year, so the logical question is: What have we done about it?\\n\\nSadly, not as much as we could have. But the reasons are more complicated than you might think.\\n\\nSecretaries of state and state and local election administrators have been scrutinized for hardware, software, and vendor choices. This scrutiny is healthy, but often fails to address the big picture: Yes, our election equipment and procedures are in need of an upgrade, but so are the policies that shape those choices in the first place.\\n\\nThe reality is that, even when officials want to do the right thing, red tape, contorted lines of authority and a lack of resources and inaction from Congress and state legislatures often hold them back. Our laws, procedures and financial commitment to elections need fixing – and that won't happen unless we pressure our lawmakers to do it.\\n\\nMany people don't realize that election system is not monolithic. It is not run like the Transportation Security Administration, a national bureaucracy with a unified leadership structure, budget and security protocols. Quite the opposite – there are around 7,000 election jurisdictions nationwide. Some states run their elections centrally, some delegate authority to counties or localities.\\n\\nEverything from budgets, equipment, human resources and policy are set differently and at different levels of government. Even the titular heads of elections vary by state, ranging from an elected secretary of state to administrators or commissions selected by governors or legislators. The system's diversity can make it more resistant to attack, but it also means one-size-fits-all solutions aren't workable.\\n\\nMoreover, election officials at every level are confined within the restraints of law, budget and bureaucratic architecture as much as any other part of government. Even if an election official decides her state needs new machines with a paper audit trail, she can't necessarily go out and buy them – she may need the legislature to appropriate millions of dollars and go through a procurement process.\\n\\nSimilarly, if she feels that her state needs new software, she may be locked into a contract her predecessor put in place years ago. The same applies to vendor security. Many contracts were put in place without strict provisions about reporting security incidents, or allowing third party audits. Cybersecurity simply wasn't top of mind even a few years ago.\\n\\nThen there's the question of who controls cybersecurity in the first place. Some election officials are able to hire their own cybersecurity staff, others have to work through a central cybersecurity office run by the governor. You get the idea; there are many hurdles that prevent quick fixes.\\n\\nThere are other complications. The integrity of our election system is ultimately a question of perception, not reality. The Russians don't actually need to manipulate vote tallies to achieve their desired outcome of distrust and chaos. They need only create the perception of interference. Even if we could completely guard against cyberintrusions – which is impossible – nation states could use social media to spread falsified documents and propaganda, or steal emails of election officials, to make people believe that an election was rigged.\\n\\nGiven this reality, we can't just secure databases and machines, we have to secure our civic ecosystem against the kind of foreign-born lies and distractions that we saw documented in Friday's indictment of Russians by special counsel Robert Mueller. This requires collaboration between our national security and intelligence services, law enforcement, social media platforms and our election officials.\\n\\nCongress must act to align our intelligence services so they will be best equipped to detect and prevent information operations. Social media platforms should not wait for rules or regulations to fully disclose the content that is spread on their platforms and force users to declare who they are. It would also be beneficial if they'd mandate that only humans can traffic information, not botnets.\\n\\nOur election system is deeply vulnerable and in dire need of an upgrade. We don't need more evidence of that.\\n\\nWe need to start posing the right questions to policymakers. Do election administrators have the funding they need to make necessary improvements to our election systems and the tools to hold vendors accountable for security? Do they have access to the intelligence they need to anticipate incoming threats? And are the state's IT and procurement systems sufficiently modern to account for a dynamic threat like cybersecurity?\\n\\nNone of these challenges should be excuses for negligence, but they explain why change has been painfully slow. We must focus our attention and advocacy on the people who can really change all of this: our legislators, especially our state legislators and governors, who have the power to remove financial, bureaucratic, and policy hurdles that slow reform. Congress has a unique ability to bring financial and intelligence resources to bear.\\n\\nThere is good legislation ready for a vote. At the federal level, a bipartisan group of senators have introduced a very sound bill that would provide states with an infusion of money, badly needed intelligence on cyberthreats, and federal support to get election technology up to date and keep it current. Yet another bipartisan bill has been introduced to better utilize national security tools to reduce foreign manipulation of elections.\\n\\nWe should all support these bills. They're not just common sense, they're solutions that have been staring us in the face for years. Members of the House and Senate should be pressured to bring them to a vote before the election recess.\\n\\nGet our free weekly newsletter Sign up for CNN Opinion's new newsletter.\\n\\nJoin us on Twitter and Facebook\\n\\nAlthough congressional action is critical, state legislatures are even more important. After all, they fundamentally write our election rules. They could appropriate funds and untangle bureaucracy, so election administrators could get to work immediately making needed changes. We must hold their feet to the fire, too.\\n\\nWe will never know exactly what effect foreign propaganda had on the 2016 election. As for hacking, it seems nation states were never able to manipulate vote totals or quite literally hack the election. But unless we act now, we may not be so sure next time."}

We invite you to join us.\\n\\nTo get there, we have to start by recognizing that factionalism has deep roots and is not restricted to the realm of politics. Sadly, it pervades the culture, seeping into and draining the joy from sport, and cluttering up civic life – our schools, our businesses and workplaces, even our sense of belonging in our communities.\\n\\nBut for all our apparent attachment to factionalism, this virulent form of partisanship is not solving problems. It's exacerbating them.\\n\\nTo take just one glaring example, let's look at education, where the debate has become so divisive that it's harming our children's futures.\\n\\nThe factions pick sides – public vs. private schools, traditional vs. charter, college vs. vocational training. Then they enter the ring and slug away.\\n\\nThe result is that both sides are smeared, their views distorted and demonized, and their supporters more entrenched and more adversarial. And our children are left with a failing status quo: low job satisfaction for teachers; declining engagement as students move through the grades and an increasing disconnect between what they learn and who they could be; and families who sometimes aren't sure which way to turn.\\n\\nThese kinds of debates sorely miss the larger point: We should not be fighting about where our kids go to school; we should be figuring out which type of education is best for each student and best fits their unique needs.\\n\\nIt's a model of problem-solution rather than problem-blame.\\n\\nThis is good policy and should be good politics. And it happens to be the way most Americans think about issues.\\n\\nWhen asked in a recent survey how lawmakers should meet the challenge of a politically divided Congress in 2019, by a margin of 56% to 34%, respondents said Democrats and Republicans should work together and find common ground. And Americans share plenty of common ground on issues such as education, immigration and corporate welfare, even as legislators have wrestled unsuccessfully with them.\\n\\nWhile that's what people said they want to see, what they said they expect to see is the opposite. By more than two-to-one, those surveyed said they believe divided government will remain divided, with the White House and Democrats in Congress failing to cooperate.\\n\\nSo we know the right thing to do, yet seemingly can't bring ourselves to believe it will happen, or find a way to make it happen. Is something wrong with our brains? Sort of. But like our politics, our brains are fixable.\\n\\nThe growing scientific field of neuroplasticity demonstrates the human brain's powerful potential for transformation, according to Norman Doidge, author of The Brain That Changes Itself: Stories of Personal Triumph from the Frontiers of Brain Science.\\n\\nHistory is replete with examples, but we don't have to search through musty texts to find them. Just take a look at what Congress, that much maligned institution, just accomplished.\\n\\nGet our free weekly newsletter Sign up for CNN Opinion's new newsletter.\\n\\nJoin us on Twitter and Facebook\\n\\nLawmakers put aside fear and partisanship to pass by wide margins in both chambers the FIRST STEP Act, which will expand second chances for formerly incarcerated individuals and help them succeed when they re-enter their communities.\\n\\nIt was a refreshing example of getting government institutions working again to solve problems and make a real difference in people's lives. It certainly did for Matthew Charles. The Tennessee man had been free for two years, then was ordered back to prison after another judge sided with prosecutors who argued he had not served the required mandatory minimum. US District Judge Aleta Trauger cited the new law as the reason she set Charles free. On his release, Charles talked about the dark cloud that had been hanging over his head, but noted, today, that dark cloud has evaporated.\\n\\nThat bipartisan victory can be an example going forward.\\n\\nRather than lean in on factionalism, let's lean in on the areas where there is wide agreement. The way the debate is often presented, you might be surprised to learn that there are actually quite a few such areas – if we choose to recognize and act on them."}

If no changes are made, the CBO projects that public debt will rise to 96% of GDP by 2028. A big chunk of that – $1.9 trillion between 2018 and 2028 – will be due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the CBO reported last April.\\n\\nAsked about the rising debt on Thursday morning, Council of Economic Advisers chairman Kevin Hassett said Trump is absolutely concerned about it, which is why he demanded a 5% budget cut from each Cabinet agency for the coming budget cycle.\\n\\nWe can disagree about a lot of things but we can agree maybe now is the time to get serious about the deficit, Hassett said.\\n\\nA congressionally-imposed cap on national debt kicks back in on March 2.

{"original": "New York (CNN Business) When the government releases its monthly jobs report on Friday, a history-making methodology change will be lurking in the footnotes.\\n\\nFor the first time ever, the Bureau of Labor Statistics will include same-sex couples in its count of married workers in the US economy.\\n\\nPreviously, categories tracking marital status only included people in heterosexual marriages.\\n\\nThat methodology change, which will be indicated in footnotes on Tables A-9 and A-10 , marks an incremental milestone for the LGBTQ community, which has pushed to be recognized in official government statistics.\\n\\nThe change will not impact the top-line jobs report numbers but rather only a few categories in the underlying statistical tables. Economists expect the report to show US employers added 160,000 jobs and the unemployment rate remained at 3.5% in January.\\n\\nStill, the new method is indicative of a bigger change underway at the government's statistical agencies. This year, the 2020 Census will change its questionnaire to include same-sex husband/wife/spouse and same-sex unmarried partner. The same married and unmarried options will exist for opposite-sex couples with the hope that more specific categories will decrease the room for error when people accidentally tick the wrong box.\\n\\nDuring the 2010 Census, when same-sex marriage wasn't yet legalized federally, the questionnaire didn't make a distinction between same-sex and opposite-sex marriages.\\n\\nThe methodology changes are a big step forward for the LGBTQ community in part because government statistics inform policymakers' decisions and actions.\\n\\nWe're very excited about the new data from the BLS and the Census, said Meghan Maury, policy director at the National LGBTQ Task Force. Maury has also served on a Census advisory committee since 2014, advocating for more data on the LGBTQ community. That data can help LGBTQ people build political power and get access to more services, she added.\\n\\nWe know that LGBTQ folks are more likely to be living in poverty , she said, adding that's why including the community in labor market data is so important.\\n\\nStill, much work remains to be done, Maury said.\\n\\nEven though the inclusion of same-sex married couples is a meaningful change in the government's monthly jobs reports, they won't get their own category. They'll be lumped in with heterosexual couples in the same category tracking workers by marital status. The jobs reports will not separately break out unemployment rates and other labor market statistics for LGBTQ people.\\n\\nWe're still missing so much of that community, Maury said. The real next step is to collect data on gender and sexual orientation in all surveys."}

{"original": "London (CNN) On January 2, 2020, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson tweeted that the following 12 months would amount to a fantastic year for Britain. Instead, a global pandemic and the political turmoil of Brexit have stretched the social fabric of the United Kingdom to ripping point.\\n\\nThe politics and constitutional arrangements between the four nations that make up the United Kingdom are a constant source of pain to any leader trying to reconcile their substantively different political and societal priorities.\\n\\nBut the two biggest peacetime crises faced by Britain -- one anticipated, and one that came out of thin air -- have combined to create a perfect storm of dissatisfaction with the status quo.\\n\\nFinally, after years of drawn-out political debate and tortuous negotiations, Britain left the EU's regulatory and trading universe on January 1, but with a myriad of unpredictable strains on the UK's political union that could lead the British Prime Minister into choppy constitutional waters. Simultaneously, the Covid-19 pandemic has laid bare how much political distance there is between the devolved governments -- in Edinburgh, Cardiff and Belfast -- and London.\\n\\nThe independence movement in Scotland has grown since the country's referendum in 2014, where Scots voted by 55% to remain in the Union. According to a recent poll in the Scotsman newspaper, independence is currently 16 points ahead.\\n\\nMuch of that support is attributed to Scotland's objection to Brexit. Even as Johnson celebrated securing a trade deal with the EU, Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon tweeted that there is no deal that will ever make up for what Brexit takes away from us. It's time to chart our own future as an independent, European nation.\\n\\nIn Northern Ireland, nationalist politicians that spoke to CNN admitted they have never been so confident that, should a vote be called, the north could be reunited with the Republic of Ireland.\\n\\nWhile there is not a strong independence movement in Wales, the support for business-as-usual has become untenable, as nationalists become increasingly hostile towards the Conservative government in Westminster.\\n\\nAnd in England, the largest, richest and most conservative of the four, resentment of a status quo that can easily be characterized as London sending money to fund its poorer relatives in the other three nations is growing.\\n\\nAll of which presents a problem for Boris Johnson, who is not only leader of the Conservative and Unionist Party, but also the self-appointed Minister for the Union. Indeed, ever since he took office, Johnson has painted himself as a defender of the Union and talked at length about strengthening ties between the four nations.\\n\\nBut Unionists within his own party are skeptical as to how much the PM really cares about three countries where a majority of the electorate don't vote Conservative, and where his personal popularity ratings are poor.\\n\\nWorse for Johnson, 2021 is a battlefield of trip wires and landmines that he's about to wade onto with -- his Unionist allies fear -- the parlous tread of a hyperactive elephant.\\n\\nBoris Johnson and Scottish First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon\\n\\nThe most dangerous of these landmines is May's Scottish parliamentary election.\\n\\nThe Scottish National Party has dominated the nation's politics since the independence vote in 2014. Though they lost the poll, by 45% to 55%, the SNP went on to win 56 of Scotland's 59 Westminster seats in 2015.\\n\\nBarely a year later, they were handed another propaganda victory, when 62% of Scottish voters backed remaining in the EU against the 52% across the UK that voted to leave. Ever since, the message that Scotland is being dragged out of Europe against its will has been powerful.\\n\\nThe support for independence has definitely been boosted by Brexit, says Nicola McEwan, professor of territorial politics at the University of Edinburgh. You can expect that sentiment to grow if the Conservatives' Brexit policy leads to food shortages, an economic crash and a dwindling of the UK's status in the world.\\n\\nScotland's First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon, has also been praised by many Scots for her handling of the pandemic, even though her policies and their efficacy have seldom differed dramatically from Johnson's.\\n\\nMcEwan thinks that this is mostly down to the fact that Sturgeon has fronted her government's response, giving a press conference nearly every day, whereas Boris Johnson has not been as visible.\\n\\nIt's not hard to see why the SNP's platform -- leaving the UK and re-joining the EU under the leadership of Sturgeon -- is so appealing to many north of the border. And Conservatives in England are seriously worried that Johnson doesn't have either the energy or passion needed to combat it.\\n\\nThere is genuine fear that Scotland could go under this government and that there is no energy going into addressing that, says one MP on the government's payroll. We've struggled to make an emotional case for the Union. Partly that's because our focus is on our heartlands in England, but we are going to need to make a positive case beyond the economic benefits to Scotland.\\n\\nIf the SNP does win May's elections with independence at the core of its campaign, Johnson has two options: Carry on ignoring calls for a referendum, or try and fight the SNP. Neither option is attractive, since the only effective way to counter the SNP is to fight on their terms.\\n\\nA Welcome to Northern Ireland sign is marked with bullet holes on February 17, 2019 in Ballyconnell, Ireland.\\n\\nWe need to make the case that Scotland's ability to govern differently only works because of the overarching economic structure of the UK, says Eddie Barnes, former director of communications for the Scottish Conservatives. We need to end the perception that devolution is a slow drift from the Union.\\n\\nEqually fraught, if less immediate a threat, is the rise in confidence among Northern Irish Republicans. Northern Ireland has long been the most likely casualty of Brexit.\\n\\nThe province, which is part of the UK, shares a land border with the Republic of Ireland, which is in the European Union.\\n\\nThe prospect of a customs border separating the two has raised all sorts of concerns, ranging from the flow of goods to a return of the sectarian violence of the 1970s and 80s.\\n\\nIn order to prevent that border, the UK government agreed with the EU to something called the Northern Ireland Protocol, which, Unionists in Northern Ireland fear, ties them to follow the EU's customs and regulatory rules rather than the UK's.\\n\\nIn practical terms, it has put Northern Ireland in a different position to the rest of the UK. So, the more now Britain shifts from the EU, the more in common Northern Ireland has with the EU, and thus the Republic of Ireland, says Katy Hayward, professor of political sociology at Queen's University Belfast.\\n\\nThe issue of the north becoming closer to the Republic has put a spring in the step of those who dream of reunification.\\n\\nSoft-nationalists who were pro-European -- and even some soft-Unionists -- have been forced to seriously rethink what Northern Ireland is and should be, says Matthew O'Toole, a Northern Irish lawmaker for the pro-reunification Social Democratic and Labour Party.\\n\\nPeople who identified as Irish had made their peace with Northern Ireland's status, in part thanks to the Good Friday Agreement, he explains. Brexit has dragged up issues that had felt settled here and put them to the top of our agenda.\\n\\nThe pandemic has also highlighted the political differences in the governance of Northern Ireland. The country has a power-sharing arrangement to ensure that Unionists and Republicans have an equal say in how things are run. Naturally, some have preferred that Northern Ireland follows the measures in the Republic, while others wanted to remain in lockstep with Britain.\\n\\nWe've had unhappy compromise after unhappy compromise, which probably summarises the politics of Northern Ireland, says Hayward. No one has got exactly what they want. It's exacerbated tensions that were always there and it's unlikely to stop being so fraught in 2021.\\n\\n2021 was supposed to be the year in which Northern Ireland celebrated its centenary. Instead, its citizens are likely to be more divided than they have been for years.\\n\\nA man waves Union flags from a small car as he drives past Brexit supporters gathering in Parliament Square, near the Houses of Parliament in central London on January 31, 2020 on the day that the UK formally leaves the European Union.\\n\\nMercifully for Johnson, the situation is less perilous in Wales, where there isn't a serious separatist movement. However, since Johnson faces the prospect of fighting in Scotland and Northern Ireland, he risks overlooking Wales.\\n\\nCovid has highlighted what devolution actually means, in terms of Welsh politicians being able to make independent policy that directly affects Welsh people, says Roger Awan-Scully, professor of politics at Cardiff University.\\n\\nOne error Johnson could make is that, in order to appeal to his base in England, he goes on the offensive against political leaders who are anti-Conservative -- meaning Wales's hostile Labour leadership could be a target.\\n\\nIf Conservatives take a more aggressive line against devolution and pro-centralised control from London, it risks emboldening the anti-Westminster movement in Wales, Awan-Scully adds.\\n\\nThe final piece in this puzzle, of course, is Johnson's base in England.\\n\\nThe Conservatives won a majority in 2019 by taking a string of Brexit-supporting Labour seats in the north of England. The party's heartlands in the south also voted heavily in favor of Brexit.\\n\\nWhen we eventually leave the EU proper, this government will need a new enemy, and the obvious choice is Scotland and to a lesser extent Wales, says Rob Ford, professor of politics at the University of Manchester. Many English Conservatives don't really care about the Union. They see the other countries as annoyances that are bankrolled by England.\\n\\n2021 is going to be a difficult year for all four nations of the UK.\\n\\nAnd the Prime Minister, who likes to wrap himself in the Union flag, might be tempted to keep his head down and ignore the separatist screams.\\n\\nBut if Johnson is unable to make leaving the EU look like a success and he alienates the public in Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales, it's inevitable that more and more voters will wonder if the grass is greener outside of the United Kingdom."}

View more opinion articles on CNN.\\n\\n(CNN) The lived effects of racism and inequality constitute America's biggest public health and safety crisis , and it demands bold, courageous action in 2021. The Biden-Harris administration's first 100 days should be devoted to developing, unveiling and implementing a National Racial Truth, Justice and Healing Commission, with executive authority charged with three broad missions. The commission could be run out of the Oval Office, perhaps overseen by senior domestic adviser Susan Rice, and have a staff that included a congressional liaison to help pursue legislative programs while simultaneously using executive authority wherever possible to achieve its objective.\\n\\nFirst, the new administration should organize a diverse group of scholars who will be charged with offering a comprehensive and holistic portrait of America's racial history. The Pulitzer Prize-winning 1619 Project by Nikole Hannah-Jones offers an important template in this regard, but one that -- even as it has been debated among historians -- has also been attacked on ideological grounds by conservatives and neo-Confederates for being overly critical of the nation's long political and cultural embrace of White supremacy.\\n\\nA major lesson of 2020 is that the past is not past. Relics and artifacts of White supremacy -- from Confederate monuments and flags to statues of generals who wanted racial slavery to continue forever -- still help shape the present, including policies that disenfranchise Black voters that were first promoted during the Reconstruction era.\\n\\nAmerica's racial history remains, now more than ever, deeply contested. President Donald Trump's appointment of a 1776 Commission to teach patriotic education in our school systems attests to this. It is past time for national leadership that helps us clearly establish our past in all of its complexity. Understanding, for instance, racial slavery's expansive reach -- North and South -- into the creation of American capitalism gives students, citizens and leaders a more holistic appreciation of the stubborn afterlife of structural racism . The stickiness of America's current racial divide is rooted in a history that we continue to distort, gloss over or ignore at our very nation's peril.\\n\\nSecond, 2021 must see a coordinated effort at the local, state and national levels to eradicate the thousands of racist policies that keep too many Black Americans at the bottom of the well of this society. Criminal justice reform is the tip of the iceberg on this score. Eliminating the cash bail system and disparate sentencing for crack versus powdered cocaine, releasing non-violent drug offenders and transforming a juvenile justice system that disproportionately harms Black children should be at the top of the policy agenda.\\n\\nAnd we mustn't stop there. The national racial healing that many long for cannot be purchased on the cheap. This commission must endorse and devise strategies to pursue policies for a living wage, housing reform, mental health and education programs and a universal basic income.\\n\\nThey must look to provide affordable health care for every American. While some major Democratic candidates for president in 2020 favored a Medicare for All plan , President-elect Joe Biden has vowed instead to add the public option to Obamacare -- reviving a measure that failed to pass in 2010. But we are long past the time for policy tinkering with the health of Americans. Of those who insist that Medicare For All is unaffordable we should ask another question: How can we afford not to? Medicare For All would increase jobs, employment and tax revenue through massive public investments that could increase worker productivity, economic mobility and ensure that families and children's health care would not be tied to a single job or eliminated amidst a pandemic.\\n\\nThis commission would work closely with governors and mayors at the state and local level to establish priorities, design implantation strategies, and innovate solutions that are based on the challenges, wants, and needs of grassroots communities across the nation.\\n\\nBut there's more.\\n\\nThe commission must explore targeted programs to repair the purposeful injury to Black Americans caused by racial slavery, Jim Crow bigotry, inequality in federal housing policies and the GI Bill and predatory lending during the Great Recession.\\n\\nThird, racial healing requires more than anti-racist hashtags from corporations, sports teams, philanthropists and public officials. Leaders in tech, philanthropy and higher education, along with elected officials, must pledge concrete action toward racial justice and equity, with measurable indicators of progress and accountability. The technology, finance capital and entrepreneurship sectors, in conjunction with local, state and federal government could invest in eco-systems that prioritize wealth creation, talent development and access to capital in Black communities on an unprecedented scale.\\n\\n2020 will exist in American and world history as a watershed: the shared trauma of a global pandemic unfolded alongside Black Lives Matter demonstrations and a political reckoning with racism's grip on American life. This year served as an inflection point that illuminates the challenges ahead for a new presidential administration in Washington and the collective hopes and will of the nation.\\n\\nJUST WATCHED Black doctor dies of Covid-19 after accusing hospital of racial bias Replay More Videos ...

{"original": "India's fast growing economy has a big problem: Not enough women are working.\\n\\nThis has a very significant cost to growth, said Frederico Gil Sander, author of a new report by the World Bank.\\n\\nIndia is growing at an enviable 7%, and the World Bank predicts that will increase to 7.5% by 2020.\\n\\nBut that could be much higher if it could increase the proportion of women in work.\\n\\nBased on 2012 figures, the last year for which official data is available, only 27% of Indian women aged 15 or older were working or actively looking for a job.\\n\\nThat's down from 37% in 2005, despite a strengthening economy and growing middle class.\\n\\nThat means India ranks 120 out of 131 countries, below far smaller economies such as Bangladesh, Vietnam and Indonesia and on par with Pakistan, Egypt and Yemen.\\n\\nThe World Bank estimates that increasing the rate of female workforce participation by as little as six percentage points could push growth up to 7.9%. If India closes just half the gap with Indonesia and Bangladesh, its economy could grow at 8.5% a year.\\n\\nIf India were able to increase the [female] labor force participation even more, the impact on potential GDP would be proportionally greater, Sander said.\\n\\nRelated: India's high tax on sanitary pads sets off storm of protest\\n\\nWomen are abandoning agricultural work as they move into India's booming cities.

But many say the generous policy is a double-edged sword that could deter companies from hiring women in the first place.\\n\\nThe World Bank says there is no substitute for creating more jobs and ensuring women can access them.\\n\\nGetting women into the labor force and into productive jobs will give the economy a boost, which is much needed, said Junaid Ahmad, the bank's country director for India.\\n\\nFocusing on inclusion... is the next agenda for India to achieve the double-digit growth that it can achieve."}

THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.\\n\\nWOLF BLITZER, HOST: Tonight: the United States and China get ready to fight over flights.\\n\\n\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\n\\n\\nARI FLEISCHER, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: You can expect some forthright conversations about these flights and about what took place.\\n\\n\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\n\\n\\nBLITZER: With the White House promising tough questions for Beijing, I'll discuss U.S.-Chinese relations with a man who's long had his own relationship with China: Pat Robertson, founder and chairman of the Christian Broadcasting Network.\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd a nightmare out of the past: authorities in West Africa are on alert for a ship believed to be carrying scores of children sold into slavery. We'll have a live report from West Africa.\\n\\n\\n\\nGood evening. I'm Wolf Blitzer reporting tonight from Washington.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn contrast to the tough talk on Friday, the Bush administration today sent out a more restrained message to China: It's now more important to look ahead than to continue exchanging bitter recriminations over the April 1st collision between a U.S. surveillance plane and a Chinese fighter. About 24 hours from now, the two sides will begin complex and difficult talks behind closed doors in Beijing, and that's our top story.\\n\\n\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\\n\\n\\n\\nBLITZER (voice-over): After two weeks, the search for the missing Chinese pilot is now officially over. But on both sides of the Pacific, deep tensions remain.\\n\\n\\n\\nFLEISCHER: Both nations have to make a determined choice about the future of our relations, and the first evidence of those determined choices will come in that meeting on Wednesday, and the president wants to hear what the Chinese have to say.\\n\\n\\n\\nBLITZER: An eight-member U.S. delegation will ask tough questions. Issues on the agenda: what the U.S. calls the aggressive style of Chinese intercepts of its surveillance flights, and the return of the damaged EP-3E, still on the ground in China.\\n\\n\\n\\nRecalling the crash, the U.S. pilot directly blamed the Chinese F-8 pilot and his superiors in Beijing.\\n\\n\\n\\nLT. SHANE OSBORN, U.S. NAVY EP-3E PILOT: The fact that he felt it necessary to come up that aggressive three times, was definitely -- shows their intentions.\\n\\n\\n\\nBLITZER: The White House is making clear its hope to avoid future encounters, but the Chinese insist the surveillance missions must end.\\n\\n\\n\\nSHEN JIRU, ACADEMY OF SOCIAL SCIENCES (through translator): They have spy satellites. Why do they have to send plane so close? They're always doing something on China's doorstep.\\n\\n\\n\\nBLITZER: The U.S. Counters: those flights will continue.\\n\\n\\n\\nRICHARD BOUCHER, STATE DEPARTMENT SPOKESMAN: It's a decision that we make where to fly, as long as we're in international airspace, when to fly, as long as we're in international airspace, and that we will continue to make those decisions on our own.\\n\\n\\n\\nBLITZER: Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld is working on his recommendation to President Bush on how and when to resume the flights.\\n\\n\\n\\n(END VIDEOTAPE)\\n\\n\\n\\nBLITZER: For more perspective on U.S. surveillance flights and China's response to them, I'm joined by Professor David Shambaugh, director of the China policy program at George Washington University here in Washington. He's an expert on the Chinese military.\\n\\n\\n\\nProfessor Shambaugh, thanks for joining us. The surveillance flights, the U.S. will say in the negotiation, they'll continue. The Chinese will say, we don't want them. What's going to happen?\\n\\n\\n\\nPROFESSOR DAVID SHAMBAUGH, GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY: Well, that's going to be the deadlock, and the Chinese well may say: You stop the flights, or you won't get your plane back. That would be one choice I suspect the Washington is going to have to face. But of course, we're going to continue with them. The question is, how far offshore an whether in fact, we escort them with our own fighters.\\n\\n\\n\\nBLITZER: Well, wouldn't than be seen by the Chinese as very a provocative step if a U.S. fighter jets started accompanying these flights?\\n\\n\\n\\nSHAMBAUGH: Yes, it would be.\\n\\n\\n\\nBLITZER: And what would be the People's Liberation Army, the Chinese military, how presumably, will they respond to that kind of stuff?\\n\\n\\n\\nSHAMBAUGH: I doubt that they would challenge and intercept the flights, certainly not in as provocative a way as they apparently have been doing. If they were escorted, I think they would stay some ways away, but you know, it's really unpredictable. It's hard to say.\\n\\n\\n\\nBLITZER: Are the Chinese -- is the Chinese leadership firmly convinced, as they say they are, that it was the U.S. fault for this collision?\\n\\n\\n\\nSHAMBAUGH: Well, there is some evidence that this is the story that the Chinese military told the Chinese leadership, indeed that the local Guangdong Chinese military region sent up the line. And once the Chinese leadership received that story, they put it out to their own people and to the world. And once you do that, you can't back down. Now they obviously have diametrically opposed information from the American side.\\n\\n\\n\\nBLITZER: And some speculation the Chinese may even ask the U.S. for reparations for the family?\\n\\n\\n\\nSHAMBAUGH: I have heard suggestion of that. We'll see if they put that on the table tomorrow.\\n\\n\\n\\nBLITZER: How in the big picture will all this affect U.S.- Chinese relations in the short term?\\n\\n\\n\\nSHAMBAUGH: Well, in the short term, I think it's going to leave a lot of scar tissue, if you want to call it that, on the relationship. Both sides were deeply suspicious of each other going into these last two weeks. Now I think the suspicions have hardened a bit, and we have Taiwan arms sales decisions coming up shortly and a number of other really very sensitive and delicate questions in the relationship. So, right now, it is a very fragile and suspicious time.\\n\\n\\n\\nBLITZER: Professor David Shambaugh, thanks for joining us.\\n\\n\\n\\nSHAMBAUGH: You're welcome.\\n\\n\\n\\nBLITZER: Thank you.\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd he's pursued religious business and philanthropic interests in China for more than 20 years, and he has long called for closer U.S.-China relation along with improved trade ties. Earlier, I spoke with Pat Robertson, founder of the Christian Broadcasting Network and the Christian Coalition.\\n\\n\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\\n\\n\\n\\nBLITZER (on camera): Pat Robertson, thanks for joining us on our program. And I want right to the issue at hand, namely China. Are you satisfied with the way the standoff with China was resolved?\\n\\n\\n\\nPAT ROBERTSON, RELIGIOUS BROADCASTER: Well, Wolf, I think the president handled himself very well on that. He was restrained. He didn't get us into some quagmire that we couldn't get out of.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut I'm really disappointed with the Chinese. If they want to get the Olympics in 2008 and they wanted to be treated as a member of the world community, they have to be more reasonable in the way they deal with people.\\n\\n\\n\\nBLITZER: So, do you have a message to them right now, what you want to see them do as these negotiation begin on Wednesday in Beijing, how to avoid these kinds of collision down the road?\\n\\n\\n\\nROBERTSON: Well, I'm a friend of China, but the Chinese must realize that they can't lay claim to the entire South China Sea, that they don't have hegemony all the way to Japan, that they don't own the Spratley islands, et cetera. And that the United States has a perfect right to patrol off the coast there in international waters, and they can't keep us from doing it.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe big thing is they must understand the United States has no hostile intentions toward China whatsoever, but we do have to monitor North Korea and we do have to protect our vital interests.\\n\\n\\n\\nBLITZER: You know, some of the conservatives write -- like Bill Kristol, the editor of The Weekly Standard here in Washington -- insist that the Bush administration, in effect, allowed the United States to be humiliated with the letter, the expression of regrets, the very sorry twice reference. You don't necessarily agree with Bill Kristol?\\n\\n\\n\\nROBERTSON: No, I really don't. I mean, listen, I've been over to China a number of times. I have some activity there and I have some spiritual activity in China, and, Wolf, there are 80 million Christians in China right now. There is a tremendous religious revival, and I have seen an emerging middle class come on in China that ultimately is going to win the day.\\n\\n\\n\\nGranted, there are some old people that are still in power that look back to a previous age, but there's just too much that has been said in place by Deng Xiaoping that can't be reversed. And so, I think we need to encourage that, not stifle it.\\n\\n\\n\\nBLITZER: How do you balance your historic support for closer relation with China, improved trade relations with China, with what many conservatives complain about, specifically the so-called forced abortions in China?\\n\\n\\n\\nROBERTSON: Well, you know, I don't agree with it. But at the same time, they've got 1.2 billion people, and they don't know what to do. If every family over there was allowed to have three or four children, the population would be completely unsustainable.\\n\\n\\n\\nRight now, they run the risk of a tremendous unemployment. There are some antiquated factories that the government owns that have to be shut down that is going to put hundreds and hundreds of thousands of people out of work. And the leadership is like on a teeter-totter board, they can fall off if the population gets too restive.\\n\\n\\n\\nSo, I think that right now they're doing what they have to do. I don't agree with the forced abortion, but I don't think the United States needs to interfere with what they're doing internally in this regard.\\n\\n\\n\\nBLITZER: But in effect, won't your critics on the right be saying that Pat Robertson is justifying abortions in China?\\n\\n\\n\\nROBERTSON: Well, I just think they need to get involved in what's happening.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut I'll tell you what the Chinese are doing, and it's going to be a demographic catastrophe. When they're having abortions, they're picking the girl babies for the slaughter, and they're allowing only the males to be born. And in another, say, 10 or 20 years, there's going to be a critical shortage of wives. The young men won't have any women to marry, so it will, in a sense, dilute the -- what they consider the racial purity of the Han Chinese.\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd that to them will be a great tragedy, because then they will have to be importing wives from Indonesia and others countries in order to fill up the population.\\n\\n\\n\\nBLITZER: Some also said that you're letting China off the hook too easily. They're pointing to what you said the other day on LARRY KING LIVE in the midst of the standoff. Let me read to you one of the statements that you did say then: What we ought to do is to say this was a wind draft, and blame it on the wind. Say it's an unfortunate thing. Find some fig leaf that both sides can put on and get on with life. It is too important to both countries to continue some sort of comity to blow it up on the basis of this one plane.\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd the argument is that you're letting the Chinese simply off the hook?\\n\\n\\n\\nROBERTSON: Wolf, I believe that's what it was. The pilot's name, interestingly enough, was Wang Wei. I mean, of all the ironies, Wang Wei, and he was a hot-dog pilot, and he crashed their plane. But the Chinese, in order to save face, don't want to admit it. So why not blame it on the wind, say it was a wind sheer? And then, both countries can continue their business, and we get our plane back, we get our pilots and our crew back, and we can continue some sort of a relationship.\\n\\n\\n\\nI think to blow this incident into a potential war would be tragic, and that is what could happen.\\n\\n\\n\\nBLITZER: What kind of grade would you give President Bush for his first 100 days in office?\\n\\n\\n\\nROBERTSON: I would say a B-plus, A-minus, something like that. I think he's done quite well in most of the issues.\\n\\n\\n\\nBLITZER: One of the issues that you've had some complaints about, some problems is the so-called faith-based initiative that he's put forward that would allow federal tax dollars to go to various religious organizations to provide social services. Do you still have a serious problem with that still?\\n\\n\\n\\nROBERTSON: Wolf, I agree with the concept. It's a wonderful, noble concept that faith-based organization should have the same treatment as secular organizations. I mean, that goes without saying. They do a superb job.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe problem is the implementation. If the government forces these faith-based institutions to give up their unique distinctives and no longer preach the Gospel or read the Bible or have prayer or use spiritual counseling, if that's denied them, then of course the government will ruin the organizations.\\n\\n\\n\\nSo I just want to make sure that they're protected and I'm not sure that the Bush administration has fully thought through all the ramifications of current federal law in that regard.\\n\\n\\n\\nBLITZER: OK, Pat Robertson, I want to thank you very much for joining us.\\n\\n\\n\\nROBERTSON: Thank you. It's a pleasure.\\n\\n\\n\\nBLITZER: Always a pleasure.\\n\\n\\n\\nROBERTSON: Thank you.\\n\\n\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\n\\n\\nBLITZER: And this programming note: At the bottom of the hour, is China a partner or an adversary of the United States. Greta Van Susteren will have more on the tensions between the United States and China.\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd up next, it's hard to believe that what we are about to report can still happen in the 21st century. But authorities in Africa are racing against time, searching for a ship with a human cargo: scores of children allegedly sold into slavery. We'll have a live report from the west coast of Africa.\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd later, escalating violence in the Middle East. Israel strikes at Gaza after one of its towns is shelled, and Syria puts its forces in Lebanon on alert.\\n\\n\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\n\\n\\nBLITZER: Welcome back. Authorities in West Africa are trying to bring an end to a nightmare voyage and the United States has agreed to help search for a ship believed to be carrying children sold into slavery. The vessel is thought to have departed, with its human cargo, from Benin two weeks ago.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt was turned away from Gabon and was last seen Thursday after being turned back from Cameroon. In an area which was once the center of the historic slave trade, poverty-stricken parents often turn their children over to traffickers and smugglers, who promise to find them jobs only to sell them into slavery.\\n\\n\\n\\nAs the vigil for this group of children continues, CNN's Stephanie Halasz joins us now live by satellite telephone from the port of Cotonou in Benin. Stephanie, first of all, tell us what's happening right now.\\n\\n\\n\\nSTEPHANIE HALASZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, Wolf, just a few minutes ago, a vessel came to the port here. It rolled slowly down the port key and has just now come to a halt. It is called Eterino. That's the name that we have been looking for. That is the name of the cargo vessel that people believe carried the children numbered up to a hundred...\\n\\n\\n\\n(AUDIO GAP)\\n\\n\\n\\nBLITZER: Looks like we have lost our satellite communication with Stephanie.\\n\\n\\n\\nStephanie, can you hear me?\\n\\n\\n\\nUnfortunately we can't. What she -- what Stephanie was about to report was that a ship has now come into the port in Benin, and it's unclear whether this is the specific ship that is allegedly carrying those children who have supposedly been sold into slavery. We'll of course try to reconnect with Stephanie as soon as we can and bring the latest on what is going on.\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd just ahead, if you haven't filed your taxes yet, don't worry. If you live on the East coast, you still have 3 1/2 hours. And if you still need a bit of extra help, you may be able to find it at an unlikely place, your grocery store. Stay with us.\\n\\n\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\n\\n\\nBLITZER: Welcome back.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn other news tonight, the United States is urging restraint in the Middle East. Palestinians opened fire on Jewish neighborhoods in the West Bank. Israeli forces quickly returned fire. Palestinians say the attack was in retaliation for an Israeli air strike on a Syrian radar station in Lebanon, which killed three Syrian soldiers.\\n\\n\\n\\nMore trouble within the airline industry. Comair Airlines announced today it's cutting 200 pilot positions. The move comes three weeks after Comair pilots walked off the job. Comair is a subsidiary of Delta Airlines, and says the cutbacks are a result of financial restructuring, which also includes plans to sell 17 of its 119 aircraft.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn Cincinnati, the mother of an African-American teen fatally shot by police spoke out today urging calm. Angela Leisure called for an end to the violence sparked by the killing of her son last weekend. Today, the city's mayor lifted an overnight curfew and announced plans for the creation of a commission to improve race relations.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn Birmingham, Alabama, jury selection began today in the trial of a former Ku Klux Klansman suspected in the notorious 16th Street Baptist Church bombing at the height of the civil rights era. The suspect, 62-year-old Thomas Blanton, has plead not guilty to taking part in the 1963 attack, which killed four African-American girls. If convicted, Blanton could get life in prison.\\n\\n\\n\\nTonight on The Leading Edge, procrastinating taxpayers have just a few hours left to file their taxes. CNN national correspondent Gary Tuchman joins us now live from Atlanta, where the IRS is helping taxpayers with last-minute questions -- Gary.\\n\\n\\n\\nGARY TUCHMAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, that's right, Wolf. Grocery stores aren't just for shopping anymore. Here in the state of Georgia, the Internal Revenue Services has sent its employees to 32 Kroger grocery stores to help out with tax preparation for free. Each of these 32 stores is open until midnight. And you can see, there is a line of people wanting to get their tax prepared for free. They've waited for the last second in many cases, and that's why they're here.\\n\\n\\n\\nNow, there are other programs in other states similar to this. But the IRS says Georgia is a model program, that there's more public/private cooperation in this state than any other state. One of the main reasons the IRS is doing this, to encourage people to e-file.\\n\\n\\n\\nWith us right now is Belinda McCafferty. She's with the Internal Revenue Service. Let me bring you over here Belinda so we can see you better if we can.\\n\\n\\n\\nBelinda, let me ask you this: What percentage right now, nationally, do we have for e-filing this year?\\n\\n\\n\\nBELINDA MCCAFFERTY, IRS: Right now, we have 44 percent of the returns that have been filed have been filed electronically, and that's an increase over last year.\\n\\n\\n\\nTUCHMAN: That's a big increase. So when people come here now, are there a lot of people who don't trust Internet e-filing and they want it on paper?\\n\\n\\n\\nMCCAFFERTY: Well, actually, we haven't had that many in this store that have not wanted the return filed electronically. The advantages clearly are that it's more accurate, and they get their tax refund faster.\\n\\n\\n\\nTUCHMAN: That's an important point. You can't stress that enough. How much faster do you get your refund if you file on the Internet?\\n\\n\\n\\nMCCAFFERTY: If you file electronically, you'll get your refund in 10 to 12 days as opposed to six to eight weeks if you file it manually. So, that's a big advantage to filing electronically.\\n\\n\\n\\nTUCHMAN: Thanks for joining us.\\n\\n\\n\\nRight now around this time -- we're talking right now it's 8:24 p.m. Eastern Time. Most post offices are closed. So people are actually coming to these Kroger grocery stores to bring their checks if they owe money to the IRS.\\n\\n\\n\\nWe are told that last year five people brought checks to grocery stores for more than $1 million in taxes, including one man who brought a check for $3.2 million to the Kroger grocery store. Wolf, back to you.\\n\\n\\n\\nBLITZER: Gary Tuchman in Atlanta, thank you very much.\\n\\n\\n\\nUp next, I'll open our mailbag: Should President Bush have gone to meet the 24 U.S. crew members upon their return home? Many of you have some strong feelings about that. Stay with us.\\n\\n\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\n\\n\\nBLITZER: Welcome back. The FBI is tracing a series of cyberattacks on U.S. Web sites, ignited by the standoff with China. The home page of Iplexmirra.com (ph) was replaced by a picture of the Chinese fighter pilot Wang Wei. A Web site which hosts the hackers union of China posted 10 sites recently hacked in memory of Wang.\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd China tops our mailbag tonight as well. Lots of reaction to the homecoming of the 24 U.S. crew members from China.\\n\\n\\n\\nB.J. from Minneapolis complains about President Bush's decision to skip the ceremony in Washington state: Traveling to the West Coast would have required a whole day of work for him and would have broken up his holiday weekend on the ranch. My comment is not meant to be snotty, but rather to point out just how predictable he is.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut Michael from North Carolina has a very different view: He did send a message, and for us in the military, the protocol involved with the president would mean more personal working, security screening and having a huge ceremony. We know he supports us, but the intent was to get the individuals home with family.\\n\\n\\n\\nFinally, Debbie in Tempe, Arizona, writes about the recent problems with China and Japan as well as in Cincinnati: While all three incidents differ in many ways, they have one thing in common. All in part touch on the issue of cultural diversity. Our world is a smaller place today, but clearly Americans, right or wrong, could use more education on different cultures.\\n\\n\\n\\nRemember, you can e-mail me at wolf@cnn.com. I just might read your comments on the air. And you can read my daily online column and also get a preview of our nightly program by going to our WOLF BLITZER REPORTS Web site: cnn.com/wolf.\\n\\n\\n\\nPlease stay with CNN throughout the night.

{"original": "(CNN) Internal rifts in both political parties are threatening to derail an effort to renew a set of powerful surveillance tools prized by law enforcement ahead of their expiration next month.\\n\\nWhite House officials are aligning with GOP Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio against Attorney General Bill Barr and Senate Judiciary Chairman Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican, over the best legislative strategy to renew the authorities. Divisions among House Democrats caused an abrupt decision to scrap a key committee vote on Wednesday. And a number of influential Democrats, including House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler, stiffened their opposition to Barr's and Graham's call for a quick extension of the authorities to avoid a lapse in the surveillance law.\\n\\nThe growing divisions over both the policy and the legislative strategy are raising the prospects that Congress might not reach a deal by a critical March 15 deadline when the authorities are set to expire.\\n\\nJordan, after meeting with White House officials on Wednesday about the matter, told CNN that he differed with Barr's strategy of a straight extension, arguing changes must be made now to the law.\\n\\nI think Barr has done a great job as attorney general, but I don't think we can do a clean reauthorization, Jordan said.\\n\\nAt issue is a trio of expiring authorities of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act , or FISA, that have been caught in a proxy fight over the future of the wider national security wiretap program in the wake of cutting criticism from the Justice Department's inspector general over the bureau's use of FISA in the Russia investigation. The House Judiciary Committee had been set to hold a hearing Wednesday afternoon to review legislation that would extend the authorization of some of the expiring provisions while also adding in limited reforms, but the hearing was canceled after a last-minute move by a Democratic lawmaker to propose more radical changes.\\n\\nThis week Senate Republicans seemed to be coalescing around their own strategy -- a clean reauthorization of the provisions followed by broader reform down the line -- further complicating the environment in which lawmakers are acting.\\n\\nPartisans on both sides of the aisle had dug into their opposition of the bill ahead of the House Judiciary Committee hearing. Rep. Zoe Lofgren , a Democrat from California, had said she wanted to add amendments to the legislation that would inject more civil liberties protections, and Georgia Rep. Doug Collins , the committee's top Republican, had said on Tuesday that the proposal failed to protect American citizens -- including future presidents and presidential campaigns -- from unlawful spying.\\n\\nAfter the committee vote was postponed, Collins slammed the Democrats in a statement for stall tactics.\\n\\nDemocrats are yet again putting our national security at risk with their stall tactics, Collins said. Critical counterterrorism provisions are hanging in the balance because Democrats chose to delay an already ill-timed markup.\\n\\nCollins and Jordan are among a group of House Republicans who have clamored for even more sweeping changes to the broader FISA system after the Justice Department inspector general reported in December that the FBI had made a series of errors as they sought to wiretap Carter Page , a former Trump campaign adviser.\\n\\nReform of the secretive surveillance court where national security officials obtain wiretaps in terrorism and espionage cases has long been a goal of civil liberties groups like the ACLU. The addition of conservative lawmakers inspired by the inspector general report and the President's criticism of the FBI has created an unusual marriage amid the current debate.\\n\\nThe surveillance bill that had been set to be marked up before the House Judiciary Committee Wednesday afternoon had been crafted over months of careful negotiation with the Judiciary and Intelligence committees, House leadership and outside civil liberties groups like the ACLU, but was scrapped at the last minute after Lofgren said she planned to introduce a group of amendments that were seen as making the legislation's eventual passage untenable, a committee aide said.\\n\\nThe committee aide said Lofgren's office had been included early on as the bill was being written, but after this report was published Wednesday, Lofgren denied that in an interview, saying her office had not been part of the negotiation process, had only been shown the text of the bill earlier this month and had expressed around that time that they were interested in making amendments.\\n\\nSome of the reform provisions from a bipartisan reauthorization bill Lofgren had co-sponsored in January were included in the bill eventually put forward by the Judiciary Committee, though Lofgren had wanted deeper reform, like the expansion of the role of an outside attorney to challenge the government's evidence before the FISA court.\\n\\nThey're simple things to protect the civil rights of Americans. There's no poison pill in there. If the Constitution is a poison pill we've got bigger problems, Lofgren said.\\n\\nTuesday afternoon, Lofgren told committee leadership that she would be introducing the amendments, the aide said. Nadler decided to scrap the markup Wednesday afternoon after consulting with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Rep. Adam Schiff, a California Democrat who leads the Intelligence Committee, the aide said.\\n\\nThe Republican fracture on the issue appears to have reached the White House, where influential factions have been pushing the divergent strategies. A number of House conservatives met earlier Wednesday with Jared Kushner and White House counsel Pat Cipollone on the FISA fight, two sources familiar with the situation told CNN.\\n\\nAfter the meeting, Jordan, who's close to the President and set to take over GOP leadership of the House Judiciary Committee with Collins running for the Senate , told CNN that he didn't support simply passing a clean reauthorization of the expiring provisions and saving the structural reform for a future date.\\n\\n(DOJ Inspector General Michael) Horowitz just told us that (the FBI) lied to the FISA court 17 times -- 51 mistakes that they made in the whole process, 17 misstatements, omissions, better known as lies, in the Carter Page FISA, Jordan said. So we have to reform. There are some good reforms I think we can do.\\n\\nSchiff is also resisting a clean reauthorization of the expiring provisions, according to a committee official.\\n\\nNo, Nadler said Wednesday when asked if he would back a straight extension of the three expiring provisions.\\n\\nAmong the committee's rank-and-file members, feelings about the bill were even further mixed.\\n\\nRep. Pramila Jayapal, a Washington state Democrat, suggested in an interview that she would be fine with letting the three FISA provisions lapse, though she added the committee was working to find an agreement with significant reforms that would make it palatable to a wider group of lawmakers.\\n\\nI'm one of those individuals probably that reflects concerns that society has, which is privacy, how much power do we give government and at what expense do we have additional security, said Rep. Lou Correa, a California Democrat who sits on the committee and was supportive of changes to the bill that was set to be voted on during the Wednesday meeting.\\n\\nOn Tuesday, Barr was on the Hill to lobby for his own plan for the surveillance reform. In a closed-door meeting, Barr urged GOP senators to extend the expiring provisions while he takes steps within the Justice Department to begin reforming elements of the law administratively, according to several senators and a senior Justice Department official.\\n\\nBarr also indicated that Congress could work on broader reforms to be enacted at a later time, and said he supported the effort by Graham to hold hearings on the issue in future weeks, the senators said.\\n\\nBarr told the lawmakers that his approach had the support of the National Security Council, the intelligence community and the FBI, although he acknowledged that there are differing opinions within the White House, including at the Domestic Policy Council, the DOJ official said.\\n\\nOn Wednesday, Republican Sen. John Cornyn of Texas warned Nadler that it would be a mistake to block a clean extension of the expiring provisions.\\n\\nI don't know if he wants to be responsible for the expiration of some essential tools for anti-terrorism investigations, said Cornyn, a member of the Senate Intelligence and Judiciary committees. I would be surprised if he wants to bare that responsibility but I think that's where we are right now.\\n\\nThis story has been updated with additional developments including comments from Rep. Zoe Lofgren."}
{"original": "(CNN) The Trump administration on Friday imposed new sanctions on Iran following attacks on US and allied troops in Iraq earlier in the week.\\n\\nThe latest round of penalties by the United States is set to target multiple sectors of the Islamic Republic's economy -- including construction, manufacturing, textiles and mining -- and name eight top officials, some of whom were already under sanction.\\n\\nThis order will have a major impact on the Iranian economy, President Donald Trump said in a statement. These punishing economic sanctions will remain until the Iranian regime changes its behavior.\\n\\nTrump had previewed the new sanctions on Wednesday -- an economic step that came amid a broader military de-escalation following the January 3 targeted killing by the US of top Iranian Gen. Qasem Soleimani\\n\\nYet while the latest measures many have a substantive impact on the Iranian economy, they're also a signal the Trump administration's list of targets may be shrinking.\\n\\nThe target selection list is getting pretty short, said Richard Nephew, director at the Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University and a former lead sanction expert for the US team negotiating with Iran under President Barack Obama. The fact that they had to redesignate a number of individuals also demonstrates that there aren't too many more targets to hit.\\n\\nThe US has been working to further isolate Iran in the hopes that it will return to the bargaining table to renegotiate a 2015 international agreement aimed at limiting its nuclear program, a key piece of Obama's legacy. Trump withdrew from the deal in 2018 and instead has since looked to impose increasing economic pressure with sanctions on Iranian oil -- leaving him with relatively little left to penalize now.\\n\\nLate last year, the administration targeted Iran's largest shipping company and a major airline for their roles in transporting material for the country's ballistic missile and nuclear programs.\\n\\nThat followed sanctions imposed in September by the US on a sprawling shipping network that Iran uses to sell oil along with a $15 million reward to anyone with information that would disrupt the scheme.\\n\\nThe shipping network, led by Rostam Ghasemi, Iran's foreign minister of petroleum, has been known to send money to Hezbollah and to the Syrian government, run by President Bashar al-Assad. The Treasury Department at the time also placed sanctions on 26 individuals and entities tied to the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps Quds Force, which the US claims had shipped roughly $500 million worth of Iranian oil.\\n\\nThe US also announced a round of sanctions against Iran's national bank later in September following an attack on Saudi oil fields.\\n\\nIn late June, new sanctions were imposed on Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the Supreme Leader of Iran, and his office to block access to the international finance system. A few weeks later, the administration also added Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, Iran's foreign minister and its top negotiator on the nuclear deal, to the sanctions list.\\n\\nSo far, Tehran has repeatedly scoffed at the Trump administration's bids to talk despite facing a worsening economic situation.\\n\\nExperts were skeptical that Friday's additional measures would offer the same leverage as previously applied sanctions on the regime's oil sector and banking sector.\\n\\nWhat's left that would inflict that much pain? All of that has been done. It's hard to see that much more pain being applied on Iran to move the needle, said Hagar Chemali, a nonresident fellow with the Atlantic Council's Economic Sanctions Initiative.\\n\\nStill, others said the sanctions on those commercial sectors, if fully enforced, will have significant macro-economic effects.\\n\\nThe executive order not only targets four important non-oil sectors of the Iranian economy, it tasks the administration to press ahead against other sectors that earn revenue for the regime, said Behnam Ben Taleblu, senior fellow for the Foundation for Defense of Democracies.\\n\\nThe sanctions were announced Friday by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin at the White House.\\n\\nThe President is issuing an executive order authorizing the imposition of additional sanctions against any individual owning, operating, trading with, or assisting sectors of the Iranian economy including construction, manufacturing, textiles, and mining, Mnuchin told reporters.\\n\\nMnuchin noted that the sanctions on metals and other industries would be both primary and secondary sanctions and that the executive order allows the US to designate other sectors in the future.\\n\\nAdditionally, the US is announcing 17 specific sanctions against Iran's largest steel and iron manufacturers, three Seychelles-based entities, and a vessel involved in the transfer of products. The actions, the administration says, will cut off billions of support to the Iranian regime.\\n\\nThe administration is also sanctioning eight senior Iranian officials who were involved in Tuesday's strike, Mnuchin said.\\n\\nThe moves, Mnuchin said, are part of our commitment to stop the Iranian regime's global terrorist activities, noting that the sanctions will be in effect until Iran stops its terrorist activities and commit to never having a nuclear weapon."}

If no changes are made, the CBO projects that public debt will rise to 96% of GDP by 2028. A big chunk of that – $1.9 trillion between 2018 and 2028 – will be due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the CBO reported last April.\\n\\nAsked about the rising debt on Thursday morning, Council of Economic Advisers chairman Kevin Hassett said Trump is absolutely concerned about it, which is why he demanded a 5% budget cut from each Cabinet agency for the coming budget cycle.\\n\\nWe can disagree about a lot of things but we can agree maybe now is the time to get serious about the deficit, Hassett said.\\n\\nA congressionally-imposed cap on national debt kicks back in on March 2.

(Photo by Alex Edelman / AFP)\\n\\n(CNN) —\\n\\nShould cable news networks air President Donald Trump's words in real time?\\n\\nSince the 2016 campaign, news organizations have evolved in terms of how they have covered Trump. Cable news networks, for instance, no longer air every Trump rally live, instead choosing to monitor the events and bring viewers information from them which is deemed newsworthy.\\n\\nBut while the cable news networks have taken a stringent approach on the President's rallies, the same networks have continued airing the President's remarks during lengthy pool sprays and briefings live or as soon as footage becomes available.\\n\\nOn Wednesday, for instance, CNN, MSNBC, and Fox News all aired more than thirty minutes of Trump rambling during a pool spray during a cabinet meeting.\\n\\nIn the pool spray, Trump made a number of false claims, including comments on Afghanistan so historically inaccurate that it prompted the conservative Wall Street Journal editorial board to say it could not recall a more absurd misstatement of history by an American President.\\n\\nOn Thursday afternoon, CNN and Fox News then aired in its entirety a political stunt initially promoted to reporters by the White House as a briefing.\\n\\nAnd on Friday, CNN, MSNBC and Fox News all carried Trump as he rambled for approximately 15 minutes before taking questions about the government shutdown and other topics at a Rose Garden press conference.\\n\\nIn effect, the practice of airing Trump's remarks in real-time, as networks did this week, gives the President a platform to reach millions of people at once and dominate the conversation – and Trump often uses the opportunity to deceive viewers by peddling misinformation and falsehoods.\\n\\nTrump's comments are almost always followed by informed analysis and fact-checking, but some media critics say cable news networks should still rethink carrying Trump on-air as he delivers remarks. The issue has even united some individuals on differing ends of the political spectrum.\\n\\nTodd Gitlin, a professor at and chair of the Ph.D. program at the Columbia Journalism School who is also a longtime progressive writer, and Jack Shafer, the libertarian Politico media columnist, both told CNN Business separately that they do not believe networks should rush to air Trump's remarks.\\n\\nAs Gitlin put it, networks should not air gibberish in a huge hurry.\\n\\nCut it into a piece interweaved with fact-checking ASAP, Gitlin said. Use corrective chyrons. What's the rationale, after all, for rushing to serve his schedule?\\n\\nBecause you can't know until after either event whether the event was newsworthy or just a PR stunt, maybe the best policy is to run more of the 'official' news the administration conjures each day on edited tape delay, Shafer said in a separate email.\\n\\nThat view was echoed by Margaret Sullivan, a media columnist for The Washington Post and former public editor for The New York Times, who told CNN Business, I would prefer to see news organizations harvest whatever is newsworthy from [rallies, sprays, briefings] and air parts of them with appropriate fact-checks and context. Otherwise we run the risk of being used for purely political purposes.\\n\\nMSNBC, the cable news network targeting a liberal-leaning audience, has to some extent adopted such a practice. White House press briefings are few and far between at this point, but when they have taken place, the network has recently avoided taking them live and in their entirety. When Trump gave up the microphone to allow members of the border patrol union to speak Thursday, MSNBC cut away.\\n\\nIf the President makes a new announcement or takes questions we will return to the briefing, explained the Twitter account for Deadline White House, the MSNBC program that was on air at the time.\\n\\nA spokesperson for MSNBC told CNN Business that such decisions are made on a case by case basis driven by the substance of the briefings and the pace of the day's news. The spokesperson added that show teams have a good deal of creative control, but noted that producers also coordinate closely with network executives.\\n\\nSpokespeople for both CNN and Fox News declined to comment on the record. But television executives privately argued that the President's comments are inherently newsworthy and should be aired to viewers.\\n\\nIn general, those 'sprays' which usually turn into press conferences are newsworthy and I would advocate airing them, one network executive told CNN Business. This is completely different than taking rallies live which are generally not newsworthy.\\n\\nThe only reason we run them on tape is because we can't always get a live signal out of every room of the White House. Otherwise we would take them live, the network executive added. And we air them quickly because the headlines are already coming out on the wires and stories are being written. TV shouldn't sit and deny our viewers the news that is being tweeted and disseminated widely while we wait and think about it.\\n\\nFrank Sesno, former CNN Washington bureau chief and current director of the George Washington University School of Media and Public Affairs, did acknowledge that it could well be newsworthy to see the president unedited.\\n\\nBut that doesn't necessarily need to be tethered to live coverage, Sesno told CNN Business. And even if it is, it could be rebroadcast later when networks could have had the time to do fact checks so that when the event is replayed it can be fact checked on screen or through panel discussions so that viewers have context and accuracy as part of the coverage.\\n\\nSesno added, The White House is not a reality show. It's not a game. It is not a propaganda platform. It is the place where the most powerful person in the world, accountable to the people, covered by the White House press corps, does his job. It should be treated and covered accordingly. Live cameras don't go with the territory….And false or misleading information should always be called out."}

This is not hard to understand, given that many employees at American and United knew people who were working the day of the terrorist attacks and who lost their lives in New York or in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.\\n\\nAirplanes are not cars and offer many risks that buses, trains and automobiles just cannot match: Altitude, weather and clear air turbulence, to name a few.\\n\\nFor that reason, the US pilots and cabin crews particularly are extremely well trained and will save your life in an instant when a problem develops. But in order to maintain safety in a metal tube with only one or two alleyways, the cabin crew needs your cooperation.\\n\\nIf you become unruly, they can throw you off in an instant. Without recourse. If you refuse to follow a crew member's instructions, they can throw you off and send you to jail.\\n\\nAnybody who thinks they can make a ruckus on a US airplane and get away with it is seriously mistaken. I see this every day in my law practice. On the other hand, sometimes the airlines go too far and can be held responsible.\\n\\nRecently we won a jury verdict in New York federal court for a young family that had been seriously mistreated on a return flight to New York from Cairo. They had purchased tickets for their infant child, but when they got to the airport, the airline could not find the ticket in the system. Instead of helping them or admitting any mistake, airline employees mocked the family and when they objected, had them arrested and incarcerated, the jury found. The airline paid dearly for this misbehavior, but these circumstances are rare.\\n\\nOn the other hand, the public – through the FAA – has been very good at making the airlines do the right thing when they overbook a plane, which they do every day.\\n\\nGet our free weekly newsletter Sign up for CNN Opinion's new newsletter.\\n\\nJoin us on Twitter and Facebook\\n\\nThe rules provide that a passenger who has a reservation and who is asked to give up their seat because the flight is overbooked is entitled to a lot of money and the airline is required to fill them in on their rights right away. In writing.\\n\\nCompensation depends on how quickly the airline can get one to the next place one is booked to, and can reach 400% of your paid fare or up to $1,350 if they cannot get you to your next destination within four hours. If they can get you somewhere you are booked to within an hour or two, the compensation is much less. And if you're flying on a free ticket, you're entitled to compensation equal to the ticket cost in your class of service. So if you're in coach on a free ticket with miles, you're entitled to compensation as if you had paid full price.\\n\\nJudging from the video, which may not tell the full story, it doesn't look like the people who escorted the United passenger off his flight gave him the immediate written instructions they are required to do by law. It also does not look like they told him about his compensation rights.\\n\\nUnfortunately, this is a typical game all of the airlines play. They start offering compensation and travel that is less than what is required under the FAA rule hoping that people who haven't been properly informed about their rights will take the cheap offer. When this doesn't work they slowly raise the offers.\\n\\nFlying for vacation travel or work on a modern US carrier's plane can be enjoyable and pleasant. Just do what you are told by the crew. And, to fulfill their part of the bargain, airlines need to follow the rules and treat passengers who get bumped fairly.\\n\\nIf United had taken a senior gate agent and brought him onto the airplane and said to the doctor, here is our written policy about denied boarding. I know you are in a seat, but you are mistaken that we can't remove you. But guess what? You will get refunded whatever you paid if we can get you to your destination within an hour and if it takes longer you could get up to 400 percent.\\n\\nHe would likely have gotten up and gotten off the plane in a second."}
{"original": "(CNN) It is officially, finally 2021. But while everyone on Earth has had enough of the year that was, Americans need to gird themselves for a bit more 2020, at least to start, as a large portion of Republican lawmakers put their names next to President Donald Trump's effort to overturn the election.\\n\\nThe President has brought his drama show back to Washington early , perhaps realizing his time in the White House is down to days and counting. He's also hoping to pressure Republican lawmakers to back his wild and inaccurate claims of fraud when the electoral votes that seal his exit are counted in what's normally an antiquated ceremony.\\n\\nHe will also travel to Georgia for his last political rally as President, when he encourages voters there to show up for the all-important January 5 runoff and protect Republicans' Senate majority. There are, as of this writing, two developing complications for Trump. He's spent months attacking the electoral system as fraudulent, particularly in Georgia , where he lost. And one of the Republican candidates, Sen. David Perdue, will have to quarantine after coming into contact with someone who tested positive for Covid-19.\\n\\nThere will be a show January 6. CNN's Jake Tapper reported Thursday that as many as 140 House Republicans could vote to throw out electoral votes from swing states. That's a strong majority of the Republicans in the House trying to overturn the election and swear fealty to the President.\\n\\nIt's an easier vote in the House, where objections to the election are destined to fall against the larger number of Democrats in that chamber.\\n\\nSenators who bit their tongues during his presidency will have a chance to find their independence.\\n\\nThere will be calls for sanity. Nebraska Sen. Ben Sasse criticized those who would object to the electoral votes of Pennsylvania, and perhaps other states, when they're counted January 6.\\n\\nI have been urging my colleagues also to reject this dangerous ploy, Sasse wrote in a six-part Facebook post , after Sen. Josh Hawley, a Missouri Republican, said he would be the senator who forced votes on the objections.\\n\\nIt'll be an aggravating vote for those Senate Republicans running for reelection in 2022, when the party is defending more Senate seats than Democrats.\\n\\nThere will be a split in the GOP. A vote for the objections Trump wants is a vote for conspiracy theory over fact and against the democratic will of the country.\\n\\nA vote against the objections is to accept the decision of the people but defy the grassroots of the GOP and fail a fealty test to Trump, likely inviting a primary challenge in the near future.\\n\\nFew Senate Republicans want to make this choice, which is why party elders had tried to shield themselves from it. But now that Hawley has decided to object, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has made it clear to lawmakers he's giving them room to vote their conscience, according to a source familiar with a Thursday conference call on which McConnell asked Hawley -- who was not in attendance -- to explain his rationale.\\n\\nStill, McConnell went on to tell his colleagues that even with a career as long as his, the vote would mark one of the most significant, perhaps the most significant, he'd ever cast -- and that it would mark the same for each senator on the call, two people familiar with the call told CNN.\\n\\nBut this intraparty split will carry over to other questions. As Trump weighs in, unbound by any sort of official responsibility, his sway over the party will be tested.\\n\\nPresident Trump's tweets in favor of $2,000 stimulus checks got several GOP senators to endorse the idea, although McConnell effectively killed it\\n\\nWhen former President Trump tweets in favor of something, will Republicans pay attention?\\n\\nThere will be a reckoning over the President's Twitter account. Even after he's left office, the President will have access to his Twitter account. It's been his preferred mode of communication while in office. The problem for the soon-to-be former President is that he may not be given the same deference by social media companies out of office as he's been given as leader of the free world.\\n\\nTwitter and Facebook have taken to marking as suspect the posts in which he spreads outright falsehoods about his election loss, but it may soon become difficult for those companies to justify allowing him to spread them at all.\\n\\nAccounts have been suspended for less than what Trump does on a daily basis and the social media companies will come under immediate pressure to censure Trump, perhaps by suspending his account.\\n\\nThe effects of such a move, were it to occur, would be interesting not only to see if his power to influence is clipped without his platform, but also to hasten GOP scrutiny of Section 230, a provision of telecom law that separates the companies from the content users publish on their sites.\\n\\nThere will be a split among Democrats. It's much easier to be united in pursuit of power than it is to stay united in power. Trump, to his credit, was able to effectively marshal Republicans, often through fear and bullying, during his time in office. As president, it's unlikely Biden will use those same tactics. And he'll have to contend with progressives on the left who want more attention to big problems like climate change and inequality that require systemic change the moderates in his party have less interest in pursuing. A year from now, it will be much easier for Republicans to focus on Biden's policies -- and he's likely to be a relatively moderate president -- in a way to aggravate and turn off progressives. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders won't quietly let Biden take the moderate route. Neither will Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez or the Congressional Black Caucus.\\n\\nThe proof of these divides is already evident in the scrutiny Biden has faced from progressives in the selection of his Cabinet.\\n\\nHis ability to navigate the demands of the groups that rallied behind his campaign, and navigate around Republican obstruction, will determine whether he can get anything done in the White House.\\n\\nThere will be a majority in the Senate. We just don't know yet which party will have it. That depends on what happens in Georgia's twin US Senate runoffs Tuesday. If the two Republican incumbents -- Sens. David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler -- win, Republicans will have 51 votes and control access to the Senate floor. Given McConnell's expertise in obstruction and interest in the 2022 midterms, a 51-seat majority could be Biden's biggest presidential headache. If the Democratic challengers -- Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock -- win, the resulting 50-50 tie won't give Democrats much wiggle room to pass legislation, but it will give them the ability to get measures on the Senate floor with Vice President-elect Kamala Harris able to break ties as president of the Senate.\\n\\nThere will be so much more Covid. The beginning of Biden's presidency will likely be judged more for what he does to kickstart the use of Covid vaccines than for any large policy proposals. The country is at war with the disease and, as he prepares to take office, thousands of Americans are dying each day. He's promised to move heaven and earth to get vaccines out to Americans, something more easily said than done as he navigates public skepticism of vaccines.\\n\\nThere will be something new. Think back to the beginning of 2020, when Covid was not yet known to be in the country, and the overriding political story was the historic impeachment of Trump for pressuring foreign governments to help him taint Biden.\\n\\nOne year later, those words seem like something from a different era. Covid rages, impeachment feels like a footnote to history and, rather than suffer Trump's sabotage, Biden will soon be president.\\n\\nThe coming year is sure to include its own twists, and our collective view of this strange and tumultuous period will change as it's stretched through time and perspective."}

(Photo by Ki Price/Getty Images for Ebay)\\n\\n(CNN Business) —\\n\\nThe World Bank has been warning of a worldwide economic slowdown for a while now, but its projections just took a turn for the worse.\\n\\nIn a 200-page report issued Tuesday, the international financial institution laid out evidence that emerging markets have been stagnating, as trade has contracted and financing conditions have worsened. The Bank knocked down its expectations for this year's global growth to 2.9% from its previous forecast of 3%. It also lowered its 2020 growth forecast to 2.8% from 2.9%.\\n\\nThe World Bank blamed the downgrade on the global economy's more-sudden-than-expected deceleration since the institution's last forecast in June.\\n\\nAnd the situation could deteriorate further — confirming Wall Street's concerns about next year being a difficult one for American companies with significant business abroad.\\n\\nDownside risks have become more acute, the Bank's report reads. Disorderly financial market developments could disrupt activity in the affected economies and lead to contagion effects. Trade disputes could escalate or become more widespread, denting activity in the economies involved and leading to negative global spillovers.\\n\\nThe United States is still among the best performing economies in the world, but its growth streak could run out soon, as the effects of the tax cuts and government spending wear off, and the era of easy money fades further into the distance as the Federal Reserve raises interest rates. Although a recession isn't obviously around the corner, a volatile political environment and mounting corporate debt loads are a toxic cocktail.\\n\\nThe policy mix in the United States will shift from expansionary to contractionary during the forecast horizon, with monetary, fiscal, and trade policies all expected to become a drag on activity within the next couple of years, the authors write. In this context, relatively small negative shocks have the potential to abruptly end the current expansion.\\n\\nStill, the implications of an economic crunch are probably worse for low-income countries, many of which haven't managed to raise per-capita incomes enough to keep closing the gap with the developed world. Although absolute poverty has been declining in places like India, progress has stalled in Sub-Saharan Africa, which the World Bank projects could hold as much as 87% of the planet's poor people by 2030.\\n\\nIn order to keep the global economy on an even keel, the bank recommends that countries invest more in developing their residents' skills, ease restrictions on investment, and reduce barriers to trade — rather than raise them, as the United States has recently done by imposing tariffs on 12% of its goods imports.\\n\\nThe World Bank is going through its own difficult transition, with President Jim Yong Kim unexpectedly resigning on Monday, three years ahead of schedule. President Donald Trump will now need to appoint a successor, since the United States is the bank's largest shareholder."}
{"original": "There's a reason Americans are known for being workaholics. It's estimated that 40% of U.S. employees work more than 50 hours per week, while 20% put in 60 hours or more.\\n\\nGiven the effort many of us sink into our careers, you'd think we'd feel entitled to a reward in the form of a much-deserved vacation. But in reality, Americans treat themselves to a ridiculously small amount of time off.\\n\\nIn a 2014 survey from Skift, a travel website, 42% of Americans admitted to not having taken a single day of vacation. Not surprisingly, lower earners were the most likely to avoid taking time off.\\n\\nBut it's not just low-income individuals -- presumably, those least likely to get paid time off in the first place -- who aren't snagging a break. A 2016 Bankrate study found that more than half of Americans across all income ranges forgo a portion of their paid vacation days each year.\\n\\nNot only does giving up vacation days essentially equate to leaving unclaimed money on the table, but it also puts you at serious risk of a major career zapper: burnout.\\n\\nAnd while it's a buzzword many of us are used to hearing, there's actually a real medical definition behind the term. According to the Mayo Clinic, burnout is categorized as a state of physical, emotional, or mental exhaustion combined with doubts about your competence and the value of your work.\\n\\nAnd that sounds pretty serious. Worse yet, in a 2015 study, more than 50% of employees felt they were experiencing job-related burnout, and while there are other factors that can no doubt contribute to this unfortunate phenomenon, not getting a much-needed break is a big one.\\n\\nIf you've fallen into the trap of giving up some, or all, of your vacation days, it's time to rethink that habit. Otherwise, you could actually end up putting your career at risk.\\n\\nWhy aren't we taking vacation?\\n\\nIt's one thing not to take vacation because you haven't earned any paid time off and can't afford to lose a portion of your income. But passing up the vacation days you're entitled to is a whole different story.\\n\\nAccording to Glassdoor, there are several reasons why Americans give up vacation time, including:\\n\\nFear of falling behind on work obligations\\n\\nNot having a backup available to handle key tasks in their absence\\n\\nA general inability to disconnect\\n\\nOf course, these are just some of the reasons to avoid taking vacation, but another big one is general job insecurity. Because most U.S. companies have an at-will employment policy, they can fire employees for any reason, provided they're not violating a specific contract, labor union agreement, or discrimination law. As a result, many workers feel that if they take vacation, and things don't fall apart in their absence, their companies will view them as less valuable and terminate their employment.\\n\\nThen there's the notion of coming home to a mountain of work that's enough to keep countless employees chained to their desks. Think about it: If taking a week off means spending the next three weeks working till all hours of the night to catch up, it erodes the value of that vacation and virtually eliminates its appeal.\\n\\nFinally, employees who are vying for a promotion or raise might also shy away from vacation for fear of falling out of management's good graces -- even if that fear is completely unfounded.\\n\\nYou need a break\\n\\nIf you're among the innumerable Americans who avoid taking vacations for fear of the consequences involved, you should know that you may be harming not just your career but your overall health.\\n\\nRather than forgo those earned days off, think about the reasons why you're so hesitant to escape and come up with a game plan to address them.\\n\\nImagine you've avoided a vacation thus far for fear of falling behind on deadlines. If you map out a plan of attack in advance, and put in extra time in the weeks leading up to your vacation, you'll be better positioned to escape with a clear head. Of course, in an ideal world, you wouldn't have to do this, and there'd be someone else in your company available to help pick up the slack. But in the absence of that, if you put in additional time before you go away, you'll be less stressed knowing that most of your work has already gotten done.\\n\\nSimilarly, if you're worried that an emergency situation at work might arise in your absence, you can designate a colleague to handle unplanned fire drills while you're away. Then, when that person decides he or she needs a break, you can return the favor.\\n\\nFinally, realize that while taking a vacation might seem like the sort of thing that could put your job at risk, if you perform well consistently and constantly make an effort to bring value to your company, you're less likely to lose your position over a week's escape in the middle of the year.\\n\\nSure, your team might grumble while you're away, but if anything, the fact that you're missed while on vacation is a good sign, as it means you're obviously relied upon to get things done.\\n\\nRelated links:\\n\\n• Motley Fool Issues Rare Triple-Buy Alert\\n\\n• This Stock Could Be Like Buying Amazon in 1997\\n\\n• 7 of 8 People Are Clueless About This Trillion-Dollar Market\\n\\nIt's easy enough to go without vacation time and uphold the routine of plugging away at the office. But if you don't grant yourself a break eventually, you risk reaching the point where you lose energy and motivation -- and that could compromise your job more so than any modest vacation will."}

Nicole Mason\\n\\nGains in the stock market and the robust economy obscure the reality that many of the most marginalized workers, those with limited skills and education, are still struggling. Under Trump, the wealthy are doing extremely well, while the middle-class is hanging on.\\n\\nOn Friday, more than 800,000 federal workers across the country will go without a paycheck if the government fails to reopen. Trump says these workers will make adjustments as the shutdown could last months, even years. This, no doubt, will have a trickle-down effect on small businesses and others who rely on these workers to purchase goods and products.\\n\\nThe wall between Mexico and the United States, cheered by Trump's most ardent supporters as a metaphorical and political symbol of America First, has lost its appeal to some as the government shutdown has dragged on. Furloughed workers and those who sympathize with them have begun to realize the wall will not feed their families, keep their lights on or make sure their mortgage is paid.\\n\\nBut there are other reasons American workers may be disenchanted with the President. Trump campaigned on a promise to bring back coal mining jobs. Yet, as Bloomberg reported, analysts say that Trump's plan for the coal industry is not likely to have a large effect on its fortunes.\\n\\nAt campaign rallies and in interviews, Trump likes to say that he turned the West Virginia economy around by cutting energy regulations, but over the last decade, middle-class West Virginia households have seen no overall income gains from the state's modest economic growth, and there has been no sustained surge in the state's economy under Trump. These kinds of results will continue unless we are able to turn away from the divisive politics and rhetoric, and focus on building an economy that works for the majority of Americans – not just the few.\\n\\nWorking-class black and Latino Americans are also losing under Trump. In his address to the nation Tuesday night, President Trump asserted that illegal migration hurts all Americans by driving down jobs and wages, specifically impacting African-Americans and Hispanics. This is a bid to whip up support among both groups for the wall and his nativist immigration policies.\\n\\nWhile it is true that African-Americans and Hispanics tend to be employed in lower wage jobs than white and Asian workers, and compete in the labor market with undocumented immigrants for those jobs, it cannot be ignored that some US employers and corporations often exploit immigrant labor for their gain, by paying them less, forcing them to work in deplorable conditions, or threatening to deport them if they complain.\\n\\nThese habits not only harm undocumented immigrants, but American middle-class workers as well by suppressing wages and making it nearly impossible to demand safer working conditions or benefits without the fear of being fired. If Trump is concerned about the well-being of these black and Hispanic American workers, he should do more than suggest a wall to address the income disparity.\\n\\nCome March, if the government fails to reopen, tens of millions of Americans could lose their Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits, putting their families at risk of food insecurity. According to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, in 2017, 42 million Americans participated in the SNAP program – and more than 44% of them were in working families. It is hard to accept that this protracted and partisan skirmish over a wall could soon bring real hardship to the lives of the most vulnerable Americans.\\n\\nGet our free weekly newsletter Sign up for CNN Opinion's new newsletter.\\n\\nJoin us on Twitter and Facebook\\n\\nIn 2016, the white working class was cautiously optimistic, while others of us held our breath for the deal-maker and mega-businessman Donald Trump to work his magic to bring back jobs and revive struggling industries.

{"original": "Washington (CNN) America's top diplomat on Iran was only a few minutes into a speech on Tuesday afternoon when he was handed an urgent note.\\n\\nBrian Hook, the special representative for Iran, was in Los Angeles to talk about US policy toward Iran. But by the time he stepped to the podium, he was already more than an hour late, having spent much of the day on a secure line speaking to US officials in Washington including his boss, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.\\n\\nAnd now, he had to leave.\\n\\nThe peoples of Iraq and Lebanon and Iran, they want their country back, Hook said. And they are tired of Iran being unable to stay within its own borders. Thank you.\\n\\nWith that, Hook walked briskly off stage. America's defense apparatus was spinning into action.\\n\\nMinutes earlier, US intelligence satellites had picked up signs of a heat signature from Iran, suggesting the country had just launched short range ballistic missiles. The US knew an impending attack was likely, thanks to a tip from the Iraqi government, which had been told by the Iranians an attack was coming and which bases to avoid.\\n\\nStill, using information from the satellites and US aircraft in the region -- which had intercepted Iranian communications -- US intelligence analysts quickly determined that two bases in Iraq were the targets, al-Asad and Erbil. Within minutes, US troops stationed there were warned. They'd already been on high alert and sought safety in bunkers, according to a source familiar.\\n\\nTroops took short-term cover the day before out of a concern of a possible attack. Now, the threat was imminent, and the troops were told of incoming missiles.\\n\\nAt 7:30 p.m. ET, the official announcement went out: Iran had launched more than a dozen ballistic missiles against US military and coalition forces in Iraq.\\n\\nJust five days after killing Iran's top military leader, Qasem Soleimani, in a drone strike in Baghdad, this was the moment that the Trump administration had been preparing for -- a direct retaliatory attack from Iran.\\n\\nNews of the missile strike came as the administration had spent days stuck in a chaotic series of self-inflicted wounds. First, Trump had threatened to target Iranian cultural sites. Then there was the shocking letter announcing the withdrawal of US troops from Iraq that the Pentagon had to walk back as a mistake.\\n\\nIt all raised questions about the administration's handling of the situation, and even had some Republican allies of the President privately expressing concern about whether the administration was truly prepared to deal with the events it had unleashed with the Soleimani strike.\\n\\nThe moment wasn't lost on Trump's top aides, who convened in the basement Situation Room knowing that the ensuing hours could redeem a chaotic several days -- or cement the impression of a rudderless ship.\\n\\nOn Tuesday evening, aides watched as the situation went from the potential for dramatic conflict to one that seemed to offer Trump a new opportunity to deescalate. Bolstered by incoming messages from Iran sent through back-channels, Trump's aides realized the damage would be limited.\\n\\nIran appears to be standing down, which is a good thing for all parties concerned and a very good thing for the world, Trump said on Wednesday morning.\\n\\nThe following account of the events that unfolded over the past are based on interviews with dozens of Trump administration officials, foreign diplomats, as well as staffers and top lawmakers on the Hill.\\n\\nScramble to inform\\n\\nWithin an hour of the strikes, leaders on Capitol Hill were being briefed. In the House, Speaker Nancy Pelosi was discussing the situation in Iran with a group of top Democrats when she was handed a note with news of a rocket attack on a US military base in Iraq. Among those present was Rep. Dan Kildee, who told CNN that Pelosi paused the discussion to alert members of the situation. Pray, Pelosi told members, according to Rep. Debbie Dingel.\\n\\nNot long after, Pelosi got on the phone with Vice President Mike Pence, who briefed her on the Iranian attacks. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer also received a call from Pence around the same time and was briefed on the attack.\\n\\nMeanwhile, GOP leaders were getting briefed directly by the President.\\n\\nAt the Pentagon, Secretary of Defense Mark Esper met with the Joint Chiefs of Staff and senior defense officials as soon as he got word of the attack. Less than an hour after news broke of the Iranian strike, Esper's office reached out to Iraqi Prime Minister Adil Abdul al-Mahdi, who just days earlier had criticized the US drone strike on Soleimani as a flagrant violation of the conditions for the presence of the American forces in Iraq.\\n\\nAt first Esper's team couldn't get through. It was around 3 a.m. in Baghdad and the number the Pentagon had for Mahdi's office wasn't working, said a source familiar with the outreach. They contacted the ambassador in Washington at home, who managed to connect the two parties.\\n\\nAfter making a few calls to senior congressional officials, Esper and Army Gen. Mark Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, headed to the White House.\\n\\nIn the Situation Room\\n\\nJust before 7:30 p.m. ET, Esper, Milley and Pompeo all pulled up to the White House within a few minutes of each other. Pompeo arrived first. As he waited for the others, Pompeo turned the light on in the back seat of his Cadillac sedan and was reading from two cellphones. Once the other two cars arrived, Pompeo, Esper and Milley all entered the West Wing together.\\n\\nSoon, a group of senior administration officials were gathered in the Situation Room. Along with Pence, Pompeo, Esper and Milley, the group included national security adviser Robert O'Brien, acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire and acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney. White House counsel Pat Cippolone and press secretary Stephanie Grisham were there, while CIA Director Gina Haspel joined by teleconference.\\n\\nThe first objective was to determine whether any Americans had died in the strike. A senator who spoke with Trump told CNN the President appeared ready to attack Iranian facilities had there been even one American casualty. Though it took well into the night to confirm, the early evidence suggested there had not been any American deaths.\\n\\nThat lack of casualties fed a sense of restraint in the room, according to sources. While some consideration was given to striking back at Iran that night, according to one White House official, the decision was made to hold off until more information came in regarding Iran's intentions and the conditions on the ground.\\n\\nOne of the initial reactions in the room was one of surprise that the Iranians fired so few missiles out of their arsenal of thousands, this source said. That, along with the expectation that Iran was always going to strike back, created a sense of calm. Though there was an obvious level of tension given the high stakes, part of the reason the group was more relaxed was the initial view among many administration officials that Iranians were more bent on sending a message than in killing Americans.\\n\\nOne source pointed to how accurate Iranians have been in the past with its ballistic missiles, such as the attack a Saudi oil refinery, suggesting the attack could have been lethal.\\n\\nWithin hours of the strike, the President had made clear he wanted to make a public address and began dictating an outline of what it should look like, according to a person familiar. As Trump and his advisers continued to meet in the Situation Room, aides began making urgent plans for an address to the nation, including prepping the Oval Office. The framework of a speech started coming together with aide Stephen Miller at the helm and senior advisers weighing in.\\n\\nOver the past few days, top White House officials expressed regret that Trump hadn't addressed the nation sooner after the strike that killed Soleimani, and worried he'd missed a chance to shape the narrative in his favor. Right after the strike, White House aide and Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner was among those pushing Trump to give a speech, but the decision was made to hold off.\\n\\nOn the Hill, Republican leaders were getting constant updates from the White House, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Senate Armed Services Chairman Sen. James Inhofe. The overall message to the White House from Republicans, according to a number of sources, was one of restraint, and that this was a moment for de-escalation.\\n\\nIn the end, White House officials said Trump would not emerge on Tuesday night to make an address. The news was met with a collective sigh of relief on the Hill, according to several GOP aides who spoke to CNN.\\n\\nAround 9 p.m. ET, Trump began making calls to several GOP lawmakers, including Inhofe, who told reporters Wednesday the President was in a very, very positive mood and said he was willing to negotiate with Iran. Inhofe agreed, telling the President this was an opportunity to not just de-escalate but start negotiations.\\n\\nAt 9:45 p.m. ET, Trump tweeted, All is well! Missiles launched from Iran at two military bases located in Iraq. Assessment of casualties & damages taking place now. So far, so good! We have the most powerful and well equipped military anywhere in the world, by far! I will be making a statement tomorrow morning.\\n\\nBut the night was far from over.\\n\\nIran Back Channels\\n\\nStarting late Tuesday night and into Wednesday morning, Iran initiated contact with the administration through at least three back channels, including Switzerland and other countries, according to a senior administration official. The message from Iran was clear: This would be their only response. They would now wait to see what the US would do.\\n\\nAs part of its response back, the US conveyed that it was fully aware that Iran controls its proxies in the region, including Hezbollah. The source told CNN that Iran tried to squeak out of it, saying they are not responsible for those proxies, but the US made clear it didn't buy that argument.\\n\\nBy around 1 a.m. ET, the battleground assessment came in, confirming no US casualties . Working through the night without sleep in secure rooms at the White House, national security teams put response options together, including plans to sanction Iran.\\n\\nBy early Wednesday morning, teams met again with the President, who was given an update on the latest assessment. That's when Trump made the final decision that the US response would be sanctions, signaling to advisers that the threat of escalation was off the table.\\n\\nThey've stepped back -- now we've taken a bit of a step back, said a senior administration official.\\n\\nTrump then began making his own edits on the draft of the speech, as did a handful of other national security advisers including Esper, Pompeo and Milley. As the White House prepared for an 11 a.m. ET address to the nation, advisers kept weighing in on the draft of the President's remarks, delaying Trump's address by nearly half an hour.\\n\\nAs junior staffers and reporters crowded into the red-carpet lined White House foyer, the President's top national security officials -- many wearing their military uniforms -- lined up on either side of the podium.\\n\\nThe wooden doors opened behind them and Trump -- silhouetted by late-morning sun -- emerged."}
{"original": "The US ranks last on this important issue (2015)\\n\\n(CNN) —\\n\\nAs if you needed another reason to pack your belongings and head west, California's governor just proposed a plan to give new parents six months of partial-paid leave – the most generous policy in the nation.\\n\\nDescribing the proposal as a no-damn-brainer, Gov. Gavin Newsom unveiled his plan on Thursday at a budget press conference in Sacramento.\\n\\n'We're committed to a six-month paid sick leave system, he said. Why? For no other reason than it's a developmental necessity.\\n\\nThe plan, part of the Democratic governor's $209 billion budget plan, would compensate new parents up to 70 percent of their wage when they take off to care for a newborn or newly adopted baby. Two parents or caretakers would be allowed to take advantage of the program for up to three months each.\\n\\nIt's a major upgrade to the state's current paid family leave policy, which provides up to only six weeks of partial pay for employees as part of the state's Disability Insurance and Paid Family Leave Program.\\n\\nCalifornia's Assembly Budget Committee and state senate have until June 15 to review and vote on the proposal.\\n\\nUS lags behind in parental leave\\n\\nIf passed, Newsom's proposal would set a precedent in the United States, but certainly not the world.\\n\\nThe US ranks last in maternity leave in an analysis of 42 countries by the Organization of Economic Co-operation and Development, a group of industrialized nations. No surprise there, as the US doesn't guarantee women any paid maternity leave. Instead, it lets individual employers decide how much to offer.\\n\\nThe 11 best countries for maternity leave are all European, with Bulgaria – which offers just under 59 weeks of paid leave – leading the pack, according OECD. Estonia and Poland are tied for 10th place with 20 weeks each.\\n\\nThe OECD study, based on policies that were in effect as of April 2016, notes that not all countries ranking in the top 10 offer fully paid time off.\\n\\nMothers in the UK, for example, get a whole year (52 weeks) of maternity leave. However, 39 of those weeks are partially paid. The amount women receive over that period works out at just 12 fully paid weeks, according to the OECD.\\n\\nThe US' failure to guarantee women any paid maternity leave breaks with The International Labor Organization's call for 14 weeks of maternity benefit to women, including a cash benefit that should be no less than two-thirds of her previous earnings or a comparable amount.\\n\\nWomen require protection to ensure that they will not lose their job simply because of pregnancy or maternity leave, says the UN agency.\\n\\nProtecting them from job discrimination is a precondition for achieving genuine equality of opportunity and treatment for men and women at work.\\n\\nCNN parenting contributor Elissa Strauss says that California's proposed bill is so much better than nothing, but leaves room for improvement.\\n\\nCalls for parental leave make headway\\n\\nThe idea of implanting a national paid-leave plan in the United States is making headway. In fact, it was included in the Trump administration's 2019 budget. The proposal calls for six weeks of paid leave for mothers and fathers.\\n\\nIt's a rare call for a new entitlement program from the administration.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Democrats have long called for paid family leave. Since 2013, congressional Democrats have introduced and reintroduced the Family and Medical Insurance Leave, or FAMILY, Act, which would allow workers to take up to 60 individual days of paid leave per year to care for a new child, sick family member or tend to one's own illness.\\n\\nIn lieu of a national law, some states have taken it upon themselves to enact family legislation.\\n\\nIn 2004 California became the first state to introduce paid leave through the creation of a temporary disability insurance program. New Jersey, Rhode Island and Washington DC followed suit with their own paid-leave programs.\\n\\nWashington state will start to offer paid family and medical leave to workers in 2020.\\n\\nPaid leave isn't just a policy. It's also an important cultural shift that shouldn't be overlooked, Strauss said. It sends the message that this is not just an important thing to do but an OK thing to do.\\n\\nCNN's Michelle Toh, Kathryn Vasel and Steven Findlay contributed to this report."}

{"original": "Watch the full conversation with SE Cupp and her panel of experts on What Comes Next? here . Kent Sepkowitz is a CNN medical analyst and a physician and infection control expert at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion at CNN.\\n\\n(CNN) Polls show more and more Americans are saying they will get the Covid-19 vaccine when it's their turn. That's good news. But skepticism, conspiracy theories and misinformation are still rampant, making it unclear just how much longer we'll be living amidst a viral pandemic and all that comes with it. This week, I talk to Dr. Kent Sepkowitz, a physician at Memorial Sloan Kettering, and Tom Nichols, author of Our Own Worst Enemy, to find out what comes next for America and the vaccine. But first, Sepkowitz writes our CNN op-ed. - SE Cupp\\n\\nLast month, the US introduced a pair of new vaccines that were developed using a novel scientific technique to stop the spread of a deadly virus. The goal is to vaccinate as many people as are willing, as soon as possible. This is all while the nation is changing presidents and trying to save a reeling economy.\\n\\nIn other words, we are in the midst of rolling out a completely unprecedented national program with no promise that things will work out as intended.\\n\\nThe first weeks of the vaccine rollout have drawn intense criticism from politicians, including President-elect Joe Biden, scientists and countless others who seem to have expected smoothly choreographed execution from production labs, transport truckers, supply chain workers and hundreds of clinics and millions of recipients.\\n\\nTheir unrealistic expectation makes some sense. After all, scientists had just pulled a once-in-a-century sort of rabbit from their hat, producing a seemingly first-rate pair of vaccines in record time with, up to now, very little evidence of concerning side effects. After doing the impossible once, many assumed that a second longshot would hit the mark as well and a flawless vaccine implementation program would magically appear.\\n\\nWishful thinking. Instead, we have a plodding, mediocre program in place despite the neglect of the Trump administration, which has extended its take no responsibility attitude to include a refusal to develop any semblance of a coordinated federal vaccine effort.\\n\\nWhich brings us to January 20 and the incoming Biden administration, full of plans and programs. Though this is assuring for many, they should expect strong political disagreement on many issues as officials try to vaccinate at warp speed.\\n\\nFirst, Biden has made clear that he believes in deliberate active governing rather than vague Darwinian market forces to optimize public programs. He already a Covid-19 response team led by capable experienced people whose job will be to organize and make decisions and do the many boring behind-the-scenes tasks of government. These are people at desks, on the phone, in meetings -- people with unmemorable faces and no political axes to grind.\\n\\nHere come the bureaucrats. Lots of them. They will build an ambitious but imperfect plan and become easy fodder for the (re-invigorated) Republican song of small government.\\n\\nNext, Biden et al. are believers in science, in the exact process -- fund the scientists and get out of their way -- that led to 2020's great vaccine miracle. But don't think that will help them win hearts and minds. Not everyone believes in the vaccine or even the virus itself.\\n\\nAs the Covid-19 vaccine story has evolved, medical historians have recalled the polio vaccine campaign of 1955 that led to elimination of the disease in the US decades later. It is important to remember that, in the decades it took to produce the Salk and then Sabin vaccines, many children were killed or crippled along the way.\\n\\nDespite the missteps, the polio vaccine program was embraced by most of the public, perhaps owing to the poignancy of a disease that could permanently harm children as well as a greater trust in both science and government in the decade after World War II concluded.\\n\\nIn contrast, the public attitude towards Covid-19 and the vaccine splits across political lines. Even the brutal fact that it has killed more than 1.8 million people globally, including 350,000 in the US, has failed to sway some. We continue to have inconsistent acceptance of basic public health measures, as if the recommendations were an assault on free choice, a capitulation to a bunch of whimpering scientists with their fake news graphs and charts.\\n\\nFinally, the poorly understood concept of herd immunity is likely to cause serious dispute among citizens, given that it focuses on the well-being of the community and not the individual. The idea of herd immunity was developed a century ago by veterinary researchers interested in livestock. They and others created a statistical model to estimate how many people (or animals) in a community must be immune (by vaccine or natural infection) to make it very unlikely for a non-immune person to become infected.\\n\\nViewed a different way, the premise of herd immunity (better referred to, in my opinion, as community immunity) is this: we want to vaccinate you to help you, sure, but mostly to protect that guy over there whom you have never met and with whom you might disagree about everything, who has decided not to get the vaccine. If we all pull together as a group, it makes life better for everyone!\\n\\nThis message of communitarianism is at odds with much of the current political discourse. And the e pluribus unum angle is likely to sharpen as we learn just how many people will decline the vaccine. As of early December, just over a quarter of the population were hesitant to take the vaccine, according the Kaiser Family Foundation. This group represents veteran anti-vaxxers, some additional Trump stalwarts determined to stare the infection down, others who already had the infection and think enough is enough, and of course some who believe the baseless conspiracy theory that Bill Gates wants to place a microchip into their bodies.\\n\\nNo matter how they arrived at their refusenik stance, if this group is large enough, it may prevent herd immunity, which experts estimate would require immunity from 70-85% of the population to achieve. That would precipitate discussions of mandatory vaccination, which, in turn, would inflame those already determined to avoid vaccination, threatening the entire national campaign and exacerbating a giant national argument about the role of government in daily health and safety.\\n\\nGet our free weekly newsletter Sign up for CNN Opinion's new newsletter. Join us on Twitter and Facebook\\n\\nPersonally, I doubt it will hit a boiling point -- if indeed more than half of the country is vaccinated and many additional people already are immune, at least for a while, from natural infection, we likely will see good, though not great, control of the Covid-19 pandemic.\\n\\nThis would mean that, rather than a runaway pandemic, we would see occasional small and moderate-sized outbreaks here and there, similar to what we see with measles whooping cough and other vaccine-preventable infections almost every year. It's terrible and tragic and unnecessary -- but it's not on the same scale as the current historic pandemic.\\n\\nIndeed, it is likely that by this time next year, we will be back to fighting tooth and nail about tax cuts and Middle East policy and reproductive rights. Which I suppose is some version of good news."}
{"original": "Editor's Note: Kimberly Churches is the chief executive officer of the American Association of University Women (AAUW), an organization devoted to advancing equity for women and girls through education, advocacy, philanthropy and research. Prior to joining AAUW, Churches served as the managing director of Brookings Institution. The views expressed in this commentary are her own.\\n\\n(CNN) —\\n\\nOn Tuesday, April 10, we will once again read reports about the gender pay gap and how, according to the Institute of Women's Policy Research, women only earn 80.5 cents to every dollar earned by men.\\n\\nIt will be Equal Pay Day, a symbolic marker that women have to work, on average, more than 15 months to make what men make in 12 months. We will be reminded of the sad truth that there is greater inequity among Latinas (54 cents to the dollar) and black women (63 cents to the dollar). We will discuss how pay gaps exist in every sector – from hourly retail workers to partner-tracked lawyers. And we will lament that it will not close for more than 100 years on its current course.\\n\\nPHOTO: AAUW Kimberly Churches\\n\\nBut that's only if we do nothing. Lawmakers, employers and workers all have a role in the fight for fair pay. And there are tangible, practical solutions all can take to achieve pay equity.\\n\\nThe reality is the pay gap is math, not myth. It matters every time women receive their paychecks and have less money to cover their bills, support their families or save for a home or retirement. It matters to our daughters and granddaughters, who grow up with less opportunity. It matters to spouses and partners who have to work more to help compensate for the difference. It matters to communities across the country, as women have less to contribute in spending power and taxes. It matters to employers, since closing the pay gap benefits businesses and organizations, creating a better workplace where everyone can thrive.\\n\\nAnd it matters to the economy. Projections from the Institute for Women's Policy Research show the US economy would produce additional income of more than $512 billion if women received equal pay. A recent McKinsey study showed that $12 trillion could be added to the global GDP by 2025 with stronger workplace gender equity practices.\\n\\nThe pay gap matters to everyone – and should be a top priority in every community across the country. I say it's time we work together to end it.\\n\\nAt the American Association of University Women (AAUW), our 170,000 members and supporters throughout the 50 states and US territories have a goal: Close the pay gap now.\\n\\nAnd we have a plan. No single act will do it – we need to bring the pieces together for change.\\n\\nFirst, we need strong federal and state pay equity laws. It's been more than 50 years since the Equal Pay Act of 1963, prohibiting workplace wage discrimination on the basis of sex and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, barring all employment discrimination on the basis of race, religion and national origin, as well as sex. While these laws helped to make advances, they are in need of 21st century updates.\\n\\nIn short, times have changed, and laws must too. And many states are now taking action. In 2017, 42 states introduced laws to address the wage gap. Their strategies ranged from banning salary histories to ensuring employees have vital access to salary information in order to identify if they are being paid unfairly. Five states and Puerto Rico succeeded in passing their laws.

Growing numbers of employers recognize fair pay and good benefits are not just good for employees, they are good for business and bottom lines. Businesses and organizations like Salesforce, Delta, LUNA and Starbucks are taking actions – conducting pay audits and banning the use of prior salary histories, which perpetuates cycles of underpay.\\n\\nThird, we must support women in advocating for themselves. At AAUW, we are launching a new commitment to train 10 million women to negotiate their financial futures by 2022. Through AAUW's Work Smart program, we will give women the skills they need to effectively understand their market worth – based on experience and accomplishments – and the tools and confidence to negotiate for it.\\n\\nIn workshops around the country, we have seen that when women negotiate for higher pay, it can result in more income for themselves and their families. While you can't negotiate around discrimination, this effort will help accelerate change for women and the broader movement for equal pay.\\n\\nGet our free weekly newsletter Sign up for CNN Opinion's new newsletter.\\n\\nJoin us on Twitter and Facebook\\n\\nWe are calling on mayors and governors around the country to join us. Thanks to leadership in Boston, Washington, D.C., Tempe, San Francisco, Long Beach and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, we are off to a good start. Beginning with Mayor Marty Walsh in Boston, all are partnering with AAUW to provide salary negotiation workshops that are helping women at every level of their career.

{"original": "(CNN) It took President Donald Trump years and tens of thousands of tweets to build up 88.7 million followers on Twitter. It took a single moment Friday to lose them forever .\\n\\nHe may yet be impeached for a second time, an historical stain on an already tainted legacy, but the loss of his Twitter handle may be one of the most immediately consequential prices he'll pay for his actions during these final two weeks of his presidency.\\n\\nThe company shut down the open window into the President's thoughts and cut off his favorite form of communication.\\n\\nIt'll be much harder for the attention-craving President to shove his way into public life if he can't so easily broadcast his thoughts.\\n\\nWhile Trump has complained about bias against conservatives in social media companies, Twitter has been the spigot from which he has spewed lies, fired Cabinet secretaries and aides, bullied opponents and stirred up his supporters.\\n\\nTwitter has been the lifeblood of his communications strategy as President -- and as President, the company has allowed Trump's account to continue when any other might have long ago been turned off. Facebook and Instagram temporarily suspended his accounts on those platforms until after he leaves office.\\n\\nTwitter permanently suspended Trump's campaign account, @TeamTrump, saying in a statement that using another account to try to evade a suspension is against our rules.\\n\\nThe company is also limiting the official @POTUS and @WhiteHouse accounts during his remaining time in office. It's not yet clear if he can start new accounts in the future.\\n\\nBut for a man who lived his presidential life as @realDonaldTrump, this must feel like losing an appendage.\\n\\nGeorge Conway , the anti-Trump activist and former Republican who made opposing and taunting the President on Twitter a cottage career, told CNN's Anderson Cooper the President's humbling on the platform has real importance in curbing his power over the type of people who stormed the Capitol on Wednesday.\\n\\nTaking him down by taking him off these platforms and not giving him, showing that he is powerless to do anything about it and then ultimately sending him back to Mar-a-Lago is going to diminishes appeal to these people who really seek some kind of authoritarian leader, Conway said.\\n\\nFor Trump supporters addicted to his brash ALL CAPS, 280-characters-or-less missives, this could signal a move further to the fringes of the social media universe, like Parler, the upstart Twitter clone where conspiracy theories are welcome. Google told CNN Friday it would remove Parler from its app store. It's not certain if it will remain quite the political force if they're walled off from the rest of the social media world.\\n\\nFor Americans used to waking up to read about what after-hours outrage the President pushed on social media, it's a strange moment of relief, elation and silence. All that remains of Trump's Twitter page is a blank space and a message that the account has been suspended.\\n\\nA long time coming\\n\\nAfter a warning and 12-hour hold on Trump's account earlier this week, the company announced its decision to permanently suspend @realDonaldTrump Friday, citing the risk of the further incitement of violence.\\n\\nAfter close review of recent Tweets from the @realDonaldTrump account and the context around them we have permanently suspended the account due to the risk of further incitement of violence.https://t.co/CBpE1I6j8Y — Twitter Safety (@TwitterSafety) January 8, 2021\\n\\nThe decisive action by Twitter, a publicly traded company, came in contrast to the much slower official action of lawmakers, where Democrats moved toward impeach, but it was unclear if Washington would agree to definitively censure Trump and bar him from holding future office for sparking a mob to storm Capitol Hill.\\n\\nTwitter referenced its Glorification of Violence policy in a long blog post assessment of his tweets it posted online Friday.\\n\\nRather than point to direct calls for violence, the company argued two relatively innocuous tweets, by Trump standards, had to be viewed in a larger context.\\n\\nTrump tweeted: The 75,000,000 great American Patriots who voted for me, AMERICA FIRST, and MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN, will have a GIANT VOICE long into the future. They will not be disrespected or treated unfairly in any way, shape or form!!!\\n\\nTwitter saw that as tacit approval for the mob that ransacked the Capitol.\\n\\nTrump tweeted: To all of those who have asked, I will not be going to the Inauguration on January 20th.\\n\\nTwitter saw that as further rejection of the election results and even, possibly, a transmission that the inauguration of President-elect Joe Biden could be a safe target for more violent protest.\\n\\nFor many, the move comes too late to make up for years of the President spreading lies and conspiracy theories on the website, where he fine tuned and continually repeated lies as mantras -- FAKE NEWS for the media, WITCH HUNT for his first impeachment, STOP THE STEAL for his opposition to his election loss.\\n\\nUnder pressure, Twitter had begun during the 2020 presidential campaign to label tweets with false information. But it shied away from actually suspending or hiding his tweets until he encouraged rioters this week.\\n\\nAnd Trump has increasingly attacked the platforms that helped make him, even vetoing the annual defense authorization act because Congress would not immediately take away some liability protections enjoyed by the tech companies against content, like his, published on their sites. Congress came together to override veto.\\n\\nIt's not clear they'll come together this week to censure Trump.\\n\\nTo re-impeach or not to re-impeach\\n\\nThat's the key question Democrats are facing as they prepare to take control of the US government in less than two weeks. Once that happens, they will own responsibility for cleaning up the many crises Trump is leaving behind.\\n\\nTrump has already said he'll skip the inauguration . It's not clear what he plans to do between now and then. But the flight of key Cabinet secretaries from his administration, the semi-chastened video in which he admitted defeat, and the silence of Vice President Mike Pence pretty much put a cork in Thursday's talk of invoking the 25th Amendment to remove him from office.\\n\\nThat means if there is to be swift accountability for Trump, it will have to be through impeachment, the Constitution's remedy for high crimes and misdemeanors -- in case you've forgotten in the very long year that's passed since Trump was first impeached.\\n\\nIn that first impeachment, over Trump's abuse of power in trying to corner Ukraine into helping him smear Biden, almost all but one Republican -- Mitt Romney -- rallied around the President and saved him from a conviction and removal from office.\\n\\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi clearly wants accountability. And she should, after the chamber she leads was attacked by Trump's mob.\\n\\nShe doesn't want him using the military, specifically the nuclear arsenal. Pelosi said Friday she talked to military leaders about what they'd do if Trump tried something rash. So she issued an ultimatum Friday: resign or face a new impeachment. Nobody expects Trump to resign. Democrats could vote with a simple majority to impeach him next week.\\n\\nBut a successful House impeachment of Trump still needs a vote in the Senate to remove Trump, and Republicans aren't likely to hold a trial anytime soon. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell indicated in a memo to senators Friday that the earliest the Senate could take up any articles would most likely be right after Trump's term ends. Even if it happened earlier, Republicans would have to join onto the effort in order to remove Trump from office and bar him from holding office again.\\n\\nAt least one Republican, Nebraska Sen. Ben Sasse, said he would consider convicting Trump because what the President did was wicked. That's not exactly a firm commitment.\\n\\nBiden, who will have to lead this country in less than two weeks, was asked during an appearance in Delaware about Pelosi's move and, far from endorsing it, firmly sidestepped it and asserted other priorities.\\n\\nI'm focused on the virus, the vaccine and economic growth. What the Congress decides to do is for them to decide, he said. But I'm going to have to, and they're going to have to, be ready to hit the ground running, because when Kamala and I are sworn in, we'll be introducing immediately significant pieces of legislation to deal with the virus, deal with the economy, and deal with economic growth. So we're going to do our job, and the Congress can decide how to proceed with theirs.\\n\\nThere are other emergencies\\n\\nHe's got a point. There's a lot more than Trump's assault on democracy going on.\\n\\nMore than 4,000 American Covid deaths were reported Thursday. Take every student from the two largest high schools you can find. That's how many deaths were reported.\\n\\n368,000 Americans and counting have died.\\n\\nBiden will immediately release vaccine doses to reach more of the population.\\n\\nThe US shed more than 140,000 jobs in December. All of them were held by women.\\n\\nBiden needs Republican help to get anything done this year. Passing any kind of major legislation -- on the virus or the economy -- will require at least ten Republicans in the Senate, unless Democrats find both the will and the votes to end the filibuster.\\n\\nOne indication of where Biden's heart lies was visible in how he referred to key Republicans that broke with Trump.\\n\\nHe's proud of McConnell, who squashed Trump's effort to overturn the Electoral College vote.\\n\\nHe has enormous respect for Romney, who called out the Republicans who supported Trump's effort and should be ashamed of themselves.\\n\\nThis isn't about Republican/Democrat anymore, this is about people who understand what this country is about and the things we have to agree on and move together on, Biden said."}

She was spokeswoman for international affairs in the Treasury Department during the Obama administration. Follow her on Twitter @karaalaimo . The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. View more opinion at CNN.\\n\\n(CNN) On Wednesday, rioters stormed the US Capitol after they were encouraged by President Donald Trump to engage in wild protests while Congress counted the electoral votes certifying that Joe Biden won the presidency. Republican Rep. Adam Kinzinger called their actions, which included breaking windows, invading the House and Senate floors and other violent behavior, a coup attempt.\\n\\nBesides President Trump himself, a portion of the responsibility for this attack on our democracy also rests on the shoulders of Jack Dorsey, Twitter's chief executive, and to a lesser extent, on Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg and other tech executives whose platforms have allowed Trump and his allies and supporters to spread malicious untruths about the 2020 election.\\n\\nWith the horrifying images of a Capitol under siege still glowing on most of our screens and amid pressure from groups like the NAACP, Anti-Defamation League and Free Press, it comes as little surprise that on Wednesday, Twitter, Facebook and YouTube all took action on Trump's posts.\\n\\nFacebook and YouTube both removed Trump's video addressing supporters earlier Wednesday, in which he urged them to go home but reiterated his debunked claims about election fraud. Twitter initially restricted retweets and disabled likes and replies to the video, but later r emoved it along with several other tweets . Then for the first time, Twitter locked Trump's account for 12 hours and said it might be banned altogether -- which stopped short of a call from the NAACP president, issued through a spokesperson, to ban his account entirely.\\n\\nAll of these actions come too late. One reason that things got so out of hand in the first place is because Twitter didn't shut Trump's account down sooner. I warned even before Trump took office that the way he won the 2016 presidential election was largely by sharing information that was untrue on Twitter. The platform, of course, allowed Trump to bypass the traditional media, which would have fact checked him, and make claims that were patently false . Trump continued to do this throughout his presidency . And because no one was willing to shut him down (@jack, I'm looking at you), he only became more emboldened.\\n\\nSocial networks should have held Trump to the same standards as other users from the start. The first few times he shared mistruths or used abusive language, his posts should have been immediately removed and he should have been issued warnings. If he then continued to share misinformation or hate, his accounts should have been permanently suspended. If this had happened, our Capitol might never have come under siege.\\n\\nBut because he wasn't held to account, Trump's claims grew more dangerous over time. According to The Washington Post's fact checkers, Trump initially made an average of 12 false claims per day, so it took him 827 days in office to reach 10,000 false claims. But it took him just 440 days more to reach 20,000 false claims -- an average of 23 per day.\\n\\nIn addition to lying more as he realized he could get away with it, he also began to use more abusive language. As Helio Fred Garcia wrote in his 2020 book Words on Fire: The Power of Incendiary Language and How to Confront It, over time, the frequency and intensity of Trump's language (on social media as well as in speeches and with the media) changed. Without anyone or anything to stop it ... he became more aggressive and his language more directly incendiary when discrediting his political rivals. And, predictably, Garcia noted, after Trump insulted members of different groups, hate crimes against them spiked. So, let's be clear: This is not the first time he has incited violence.\\n\\nOf course, many of Trump's tweets violated the rules Twitter applies to other users. But when Twitter was asked why it allowed Trump to tweet, for example, veiled death threats against North Korea's leader and foreign minister in 2017, the platform said he enjoys an exemption for being newsworthy. As I argued back then , no one should be allowed to abuse Twitter's platform, no matter how powerful they are.\\n\\nYet, because he enjoyed this impunity, Trump was able to build a base on Twitter that actually believes his mistruths. Now, the problem is that we have a huge number of citizens who falsely think the election was stolen and stormed the Capitol as a result.\\n\\nIn regard to the ongoing situation in Washington, DC, we are working proactively to protect the health of the public conversation occurring on the service and will take action on any content that violates the Twitter Rules, Twitter said on Wednesday. If Wednesday's events show us anything, it's that this kind of approach is antiquated at best and dangerously naïve at worst. It's too little, too late.\\n\\nWhile shuttering Trump's Twitter account now would make it too late to alter today's disturbing threat to democracy, we still need to prevent this from happening again anywhere. Being a world leader should not exempt anyone from being required to follow the community standards that apply to other Twitter users. No one should use the platform to spread hate and misinformation. Jack Dorsey should change this policy today.\\n\\nFacebook, for its part, called the rioting a disgrace, but also declined on Tuesday to shutter Trump's account. That's also a mistake.\\n\\nIn a televised address, President-elect Biden called on Trump to go on television and shut down the protesters -- a sentiment that was echoed by many others on Twitter, including Alyssa Farah, his former communications director. The problem is that these calls, however well intentioned, reinvested Trump with too much power, signaling that a single statement from him could end the insurrection.\\n\\nGet our free weekly newsletter Sign up for CNN Opinion's new newsletter. Join us on Twitter and Facebook\\n\\nIt's true that Trump probably did have the power to end this faster and more bloodlessly with a single tweet or address than was possible through any other channel. But our democracy can't hinge on the claims of a single person who lies and incites violence. We have to be stronger than this. We need institutions that keep us safe and ensure a peaceful transfer of power -- including the Congress, which clearly needs better security. And we need social networks that don't spread hate and lies.\\n\\nWhile all eyes have been on Trump this afternoon, they should also turn to Jack Dorsey, who holds extraordinary power to help prevent future attacks on our democracy. In the long term, it's social media platforms who have to make the next move."}

Radio Free Asia, a US Congress-funded station known for its extensive Uyghur reporting, attributed the figure to an anonymous security official in Kashgar.\\n\\nTensions have remained high in Xinjiang – a resource-rich area long inhabited by the Turkic-speaking ethnic Uyghurs – following a spate of violent attacks in recent years. The Chinese authorities have blamed the incidents on Muslim Uyghur separatists seeking to establish an independent state.\\n\\nWhile activists CNN spoke to couldn't confirm the figure reported by RFA, they say it fits with the increasingly bleak picture for the 10 million Uyghurs in Xinjiang, where the government has been waging unrelenting campaigns against what it calls the forces of terrorism, separatism and religious extremism.\\n\\nPHOTO: STR/AFP/AFP/Getty Images Chinese military police attend an anti-terrorist rally in Hetian, in northwest Xinjiang on February 27, 2017.\\n\\n'Brainwashing' process\\n\\nKanat and other human rights advocates describe, citing sources on the ground, how people supposedly prone to influences of Islamic extremism undergo a brainwashing process inside the detention camps – often housed in converted schools or government buildings.\\n\\nDetainees are required to praise the ruling Communist Party, sing revolutionary songs, learn to speak Mandarin, study the thought of Chinese leader Xi Jinping, and confess perceived transgressions such as praying at a mosque or traveling abroad, according to activists.\\n\\nIt's completely unlawful – the authorities provide no legal documentation to the families and there are no time limits (on the length of detention), said Maya Wang, Hong Kong-based senior China researcher for Human Rights Watch, which published a detailed report on the subject last September and called on Beijing to free all detainees.\\n\\nPHOTO: GOH CHAI HIN/AFP/AFP/Getty Images Pedestrians walk past anti-terror propaganda posters pasted along the streets of Urumqi, September 2014.\\n\\nThere's a lot of fear, with people losing contact with loved ones.\\n\\nXinjiang authorities have not responded to CNN's repeated requests for information on the political education camps and response to activists' allegations, but state media outlets have covered these facilities and touted their effectiveness in de-radicalizing the locals.\\n\\nOne newspaper article last April said that Uyghur residents eat and live alongside party cadres in one such camp that had already trained 2,008 people.\\n\\nCalling for a great wall of iron to safeguard the region's stability, President Xi has further expanded and strengthened China's vast security forces in Xinjiang.\\n\\nUbiquitous surveillance\\n\\nActivists say the regional government, now led by a hardline Xi loyalist, has not only continued to arrest and imprison many Uyghurs but also increasingly relied on high-tech tools to keep the population in check. They cite examples ranging from ubiquitous surveillance cameras, to mandatory GPS tracker installation in cars and DNA collection for all residents aged 12 to 65.\\n\\nThe authorities also enacted a sweeping anti-extremism law last year, with long beards, veils in public and home-schooling all on the ban list, prompting new denunciations from international human rights groups.\\n\\nAmnesty International has said Uyghurs face widespread discrimination in housing, education and employment as well as curtailed religious freedom in their homeland. Other critics have linked the rise of violence in Xinjiang to Beijing's repressive reign there – a claim the government vehemently denies.\\n\\nPHOTO: PETER PARKS/AFP/AFP/Getty Images A Chinese paramilitary policeman watches as an ethnic Uyghur family walks in front of Urumqi's Grand Bazaar, July, 2009.\\n\\nOver the past decades, the arrival in Xinjiang of waves of Han Chinese, the country's predominant ethnic group, has also fueled ethnic tensions, despite the government's best effort to paint a picture of ethnic harmony.\\n\\nWe guarantee the legitimate rights and interests of all ethnicities and prohibit the discrimination and oppression against any ethnic groups, Zhang Yijiong, a senior Communist Party official in charge ethnic minority affairs, told reporters last October. The cultures, histories, languages and traditions of all ethnicities are protected and respected by national laws.\\n\\nCritics of Beijing's Uyghur policy see a starkly different scenario in Xinjiang, as the authorities intensify their crackdown and forced political indoctrination spreads.\\n\\nThese campaigns are purportedly about counter-extremism and counterterrorism, but … it's really about surveillance, control and assimilation, said Wang, the Human Rights Watch researcher.\\n\\nThe real intention of the Chinese government is to eliminate the Uyghurs as a distinct ethnic group, Rebiya Kadeer, a longtime exiled Uyghur leader who recently stepped down as president of the World Uyghur Congress, told CNN in an interview in Washington last year.\\n\\nReligious suppression, cultural restrictions, Uyghur language ban – all this repression in Xinjiang only makes the Uyghurs hold on to their identity more firmly, she added.

If no changes are made, the CBO projects that public debt will rise to 96% of GDP by 2028. A big chunk of that – $1.9 trillion between 2018 and 2028 – will be due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the CBO reported last April.\\n\\nAsked about the rising debt on Thursday morning, Council of Economic Advisers chairman Kevin Hassett said Trump is absolutely concerned about it, which is why he demanded a 5% budget cut from each Cabinet agency for the coming budget cycle.\\n\\nWe can disagree about a lot of things but we can agree maybe now is the time to get serious about the deficit, Hassett said.\\n\\nA congressionally-imposed cap on national debt kicks back in on March 2. According to an analysis by the Bipartisan Policy Center, the Treasury will be able to finance the government's operations until at least mid-summer by moving money around from different pots."}

{"original": "Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam (CNN) — Visiting Vietnam's fastest-developing rising star proves that life doesn't have to be dull, ever. In recent years, Vietnam has become a pulsating, spirited destination . The nation's largest city, Ho Chi Minh City (population estimated at 9 million including surrounding areas) may be the best example.\\n\\nThe southern Vietnamese city, formerly called and still often referred to as Saigon, is changing at a speed that outpaces the most reckless of the city's motorcycle taxi drivers. Business towers, office blocks, glitzy shopping malls, high-end real estate developments, urban regeneration projects, visually stunning new bridges -- you name it, this city has got it and is about to get much more.\\n\\nWhile all the progress is sometimes mourned by old-timers, life is never slow when you're in the thick of it. In fact, it's the city's limitless vitality that provides much of its travel allure. Learn more about where to eat, stay and play:\\n\\nDining\\n\\nWith a no-reservation policy, getting a table at Quan Ut Ut is no easy task. courtesy Quan Tu Tu\\n\\nQuan Ut Ut\\n\\nVietnam's culinary love affair with the pig is long-established. Porcine-centered creations such as bun cha (vermicelli noodles with grilled pork meatballs) and thit heo kho (caramelized pork) are among the nation's most loved dishes.\\n\\nYet few could have predicted that one of the hottest tables in HCMC would turn out to be a humble American barbecue joint whose Vietnamese name, Quan Ut Ut , translates as Restaurant Oink Oink. They don't accept bookings so queues of up to an hour are common as diners wait patiently to, in the words of the owners, get their ut ut on and fill up on barbecued meat and a selection of local and imported beers.\\n\\nMonsoon\\n\\nWith its airy setting and immaculate interior design, Monsoon feels like a top-end venue, but stays true to the Asian street dining ideal of great food at low prices.\\n\\nWith Cambodian, Vietnamese, Burmese, Thai and Laotian dishes, it's one of the few places in town where eaters can mix and match a banquet from across mainland Southeast Asia. Top picks include a sweet pork curry from Myanmar and a flawless take on Khmer fish amok.\\n\\nCuc Gach Quan\\n\\nIt can be a long journey to Cuc Gach Quan, but it's always worth the effort. courtesy Cuc Gach Quan\\n\\nDespite serving some of the best Vietnamese food in the city in a serene converted house, Cuc Gach Quan 's location on the outer limits of District 1 is often a deterrent to short-term visitors. It shouldn't be.\\n\\nAs at many Vietnamese restaurants, the menu is a weighty tome. Homemade tofu is creamy and pliant. Other highlights include soft shell crab and beautifully textured red rice. An extensive wine list and reasonable prices make it even more imperative to fit in a trip here.\\n\\nPizza 4P's\\n\\nThe best authentic Neapolitan pizzas in Ho Chi Minh City are the work of a Japanese chef. The contemporary Pizza 4P's gives a pleasing first impression but it's the quality of the pizzas that linger longest in the memory.\\n\\nCrispy yet slightly chewy bases have a perfect texture while the toppings -- from classic Italian numbers such as margarita and quattro formagio to Japanese fusion creations such as teriyaki and marinated beef -- are judiciously applied and bolstered by the use of creamy freshly made mozzarella. Throw in a comprehensive wine list and a good selection of beers and you have the recipe for an uplifting evening out.\\n\\nBanh Xeo 46A\\n\\nIt's not hard to see why the banh xeo (sizzling pancake) has become such a hit with foreigners. Unlike some Vietnamese creations, there are no challenges or nasty surprises.\\n\\nRice flour, water, turmeric powder (the source of the pancakes' vibrant yellow coloring) and coconut milk are combined to make the batter, which is stuffed with fatty pork, shrimp and bean sprouts, then pan-fried. The crisp result is served alongside a veritable hedgerow of aromatic herbs and dipped in nuoc cham (fish sauce thinned with water and lemon). The result is one of the most addictive treats in the Vietnamese culinary armory -- this is one of the best venues at which to get hooked.\\n\\nNightlife\\n\\nChill Skybar courtesy Chill Skybar\\n\\nChill Skybar\\n\\nThis is Ho Chi Minh City's most opulent sky bar. Since opening in October 2011, Chill Skybar has earned a lofty reputation with great cocktails and good food. The A-list Vietnamese celebs and models who have made this their watering hole of choice may beg to differ, but the real star of the show is the stunning view over HCMC.\\n\\nBroma Not a Bar\\n\\nUp a rickety staircase, Broma feels like a discovery. Although it's been joined by several other idiosyncratic venues, the cozy space of the downstairs bar and expansive rooftop are reliably packed with the city's hip crowd. DJ nights keep weekend nights bumping. But Broma's most arresting feature is its upstairs area where you can sip on one of the bar's imaginative cocktails while admiring a sparkling view of downtown.\\n\\nSaigon Ranger\\n\\nIt's true: There actually are great music venues in HCMC these days. courtesy SAIGON RANGER\\n\\nGreat music venues used to be hard to come by in HCMC, but the city has been moving to a much steadier beat in recent days. This compact live music and event space is among the best of a new breed of venues. There's an eclectic feel to the lineup here.\\n\\nAn anything goes approach encompasses everything from Vietnamese death metal to acoustic nights and international acts. Live acts take center stage most nights, but Saigon Ranger 's frequent DJ events are also popular with a young crowd.\\n\\nYoko\\n\\nHCMC may be a party city, but cerebral types can have a tough task tracking down bohemia. Hipster hangout Yoko offers respite from all the dumb fun. While some of the cover bands are so-so, this is the place where the city's musicians convene for quality sets and jam sessions. Throw comfortable sofas into the mix and you've got a recipe for a cool, unpretentious, bar -- a simple but rare concept in HCMC.\\n\\nLush\\n\\nEvery upwardly mobile metropolis needs a place for its beautiful people to preen and Lush is Ho Chi Minh City's. Most nights stylish types check each other out over expensive cocktails on the crowded terrace.\\n\\nTop international DJs don't tend to make the detour from Bangkok, Kuala Lumpur and Singapore, but when they do, they usually end up here -- meaning there's a better than average hits-to-misses ratio with the music. Tuesday's Ladies Night is a popular weekly event.\\n\\nShopping/attractions\\n\\nBest way to tour the city? On a Vespa. Dean Irvine/CNN\\n\\nVespa Adventures\\n\\nNo vehicle encapsulates life in Ho Chi Minh City like the trusty Vespa. Therefore it's fitting that some of the most thrilling tours of Vietnam's southern hub are conducted on the famous Italian scooters. From a base at Zoom Cafe in the backpacker epicenter of Pham Ngu Lao, Vietnam Vespa Adventures takes guests on various voyages of discovery around the city.\\n\\nItineraries vary and encompass everything from foodie themes to insider journeys to some of HCMC's lesser-known sights. Between stops, guests get the chance to experience the pulsing energy of the city from a unique vantage point on the back of a vintage scooter.\\n\\nBen Thanh Market\\n\\nThe daddy of HCMC's many markets, Ben Thanh is by far the most popular tourist shopping spot in the city. From buckets of jumping frogs in the wet market to clothes, fabrics and souvenirs in the teeming narrow alleys, this place puts the Ay! into buying.\\n\\nPrices are somewhat higher than at markets elsewhere and only the hardest of bargainers are rewarded with anything approaching a good deal. Nevertheless, it's a lively experience and several great food stalls at the back of the market make it a fine place to take a crash course in Vietnamese street cuisine.\\n\\nSophie's Art Tour\\n\\nSophie's Art Tour gets behind the city's distinctive art scenes. courtesy Sophie's Art Tour\\n\\nDevised by English ex-pat Sophie Hughes, Sophie's Art Tour looks at Vietnam's tumultuous history through the eyes of its artists. The time line of colonialism, war, communism and breakneck free market development is familiar to most visitors, but the art these phases inspired is generally not.\\n\\nHughes spent nearly a year researching the tour, interviewing experts, artists and collectors, and the result is a fascinating introduction to Vietnamese art and a compelling history lesson.\\n\\nReunification Palace\\n\\nThis striking modern building was built on the site of the palace of the French governor-general of Cochinchina in the early 1960s. Its design, by Paris-trained Vietnamese architect Ngo Viet Thu, remains one of the finest examples of modern architecture in the city.\\n\\nWhen a North Vietnamese tank crashed through the wrought iron gates on April 30, 1975, it sounded the death knell for the South Vietnamese government. A replica of the tank sits on the lawn while attractions inside include the grand President's Receiving Room and an eerie basement with telecommunications center, war room and a network of tunnels.\\n\\nHo Chi Minh City's creative coffee shops\\n\\nSunday afternoon at The Workshop. courtesy The Workshop, Saigon\\n\\nThe Workshop\\n\\nThere are deep shades of artisanal cool to this cafe/co-working space. In fact, everything from the industrial fittings and exposed brickwork to the single-origin Arabica bean varieties -- imported directly from coffee farms in the Central Highlands of Vietnam -- feels like it came directly from a hipster handbook on how to do a cafe.\\n\\nThe owners of The Workshop apply a host of brewing methods to their premium beans. Given the immense attention to detail, the results are spectacular.\\n\\nL'Usine\\n\\nWith its high ceilings, polished concrete floors and conceptual mash-up that makes it part cafe, part boutique and part gallery, L'Usine was born to be a trendsetter.\\n\\nSo it has proved, with the venue inspiring a number of worthy imitators since it opened in 2010. Located up a set of stairs off Dong Khoi Street in the heart of the city, the cafe is a hub for HCMC's groovy set who come to for the free Wifi and outstanding coffee. So popular has the concept proved that a second L'Usine has opened around the corner on Le Loi Street.\\n\\nBanksy Cafe\\n\\nThe British street artist may not be to everyone's taste, but the HCMC cafe named in his honor is far less divisive. Like so many of the city's best venues, Banksy Cafe is located in a shabby-looking old apartment building.\\n\\nInside the decor is sharper, featuring psychedelic murals, photographs and canvases on the walls. The cafe attracts a creative crowd, while regular exhibitions are another nod to its inspiration."}
{"original": "Washington (CNN) The Justice Department on Thursday released more than 350 pages of FBI memos from key witness interviews in the special counsel investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 US presidential election, following a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit by CNN and BuzzFeed News.\\n\\nThe batch includes memos about what top advisers to President Donald Trump -- including Stephen Miller, Sarah Sanders, Rob Porter, Michael Cohen, Paul Manafort and others -- told then-special counsel Robert Mueller regarding Russian interference and the President's attempts to obstruct the investigation.\\n\\nThe release reflects notable interviews the Justice Department showed the US House of Representatives confidentially at the conclusion of the Mueller investigation.\\n\\nHere are highlights from the documents:\\n\\nWhy Trump did the Lester Holt interview\\n\\nTrump told White House counsel Don McGahn and then deputy White House counsel Uttam Dhillon that the communications team could not get the story right about the firing of former FBI Director James Comey, so he was going to participate in an interview with NBC's Lester Holt to say what really happened, according to Dhillon's interview with investigators.\\n\\nThe now-infamous May 2017 interview with NBC News was the first time Trump explicitly tied the Russia probe to his rationale for firing Comey. Trump told Holt he planned to fire Comey regardless of a recommendation from then-Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and expressed his frustration with the bureau's investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election.\\n\\nHow Trump fired Comey\\n\\nIn a separate interview with investigators, White House policy adviser Stephen Miller described the process for crafting the letter that was used to fire Comey, which began over dinner at Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, New Jersey. Trump began the dinner, which also included White House senior adviser Jared Kushner, by saying he wanted to fire Comey and articulate his reasons in a well honed letter. He told the group he already had a great concept for the letter and laid out his arguments.\\n\\nTrump dictated some of the passages to Miller, who then went to research the claims and craft the document, according to Miller's interview. He added his own thoughts to Trump's and pieced a draft together.\\n\\nTrump then made handwritten edits to a draft of the letter, along with Miller's own edits. The President was insistent that news of Comey's firing not leak.\\n\\nLater, at a White House meeting with senior staff, including Miller, McGahn and then-White House chief of staff Reince Priebus, Trump told the group, I'm going to read you a letter. Don't talk me out of this. I've made my decision.\\n\\nDhillon told investigators McGahn tried Trump to take out the part about the three times Comey had told the President he was not under investigation, but it seemed to be the most important part of the letter to Trump and he insisted on keeping it in.\\n\\nPre-pardons idea considered but scrapped\\n\\nTrump's former lawyer and fixer Michael Cohen told the FBI at some point he and Trump attorney Jay Sekulow discussed the concept of Trump issuing pre pardons, or pardons to everyone so that no one had to comply with the investigations.\\n\\nCohen said they learned, however, that pre-pardons would actually result in people having to cooperate with everything and that the blanket immunity of a pre-pardon would mean people would waive their right to take the Fifth Amendment against self incrimination. Cohen told the FBI he never spoke directly with Trump about pardons.\\n\\nTrump Jr.: 'Is there anything you have on Hillary?'\\n\\nOne of the eight people in the room for the June 2016 Trump Tower Meeting, translator Ike Kaveladze, gave Mueller's investigators a vivid account of Donald Trump Jr.'s annoyance mid-way through the meeting when Trump Jr. asked: Is there anything you have on HILLARY?\\n\\nKaveladze recounted how the meeting was initially described to him as about adoptions, but how he later learned Trump's campaign team was promised damaging information on Hillary Clinton.\\n\\nOn June 6, 2016, Russian businessman Aras Agalarov, who helped setup the meeting, called Kaveladze and asked him to take part in a meeting with someone from the Trump Organization, according to the FBI notes. Kaveladze said Aras did not provide much information, but during a second call that day, Aras asked Kaveladze if he knew anything about the Magnitsky Act. Kaveladze said he was familiar with it as it pertained to adoptions and Aras sent him a three-to-four page synopsis of the meeting topics and the business card of Nataliya Veselnitskaya.\\n\\nBut soon Kaveladze saw that they would be meeting with prominent members of the campaign including Trump, Jr., Jared Kushner, and Manafort and was surprised, so he called Roman Beniaminov who clarified that Veselnitskaya had negative information on Hillary Clinton and that was the purpose of the meeting.\\n\\nDuring the meeting, Kaveladze told investigators that Kushner appeared to be aggravated and stressed. He was really upset and said, 'What are we doing here?' Soon after, Trump Jr. asked for any information on Hillary Clinton.\\n\\nLater, Kaveladze reported to Aras the meeting was a complete waste of time. He told Aras the meeting was not with lawyers and they were 'preaching to the wrong crowd.'\\n\\nMystery witness\\n\\nThe batch of documents raise a new mystery about the Mueller investigation: Who spoke to Mueller on April 12 and 13, 2018, for apparently several hours?\\n\\nCould it be Jared Kushner? Or a witness whose name has never been publicly associated with the Mueller investigation before?\\n\\nSo far, the Justice Department has released public interview memos from more than 25 named witnesses who gave information to Mueller -- from former top Trump administration advisers Sarah Sanders and Miller to convicted campaign operatives Manafort and others.\\n\\nBut only one name is withheld entirely in the 356-page release. Interview of [REDACTED], one memo is titled.\\n\\nAccording to previous CNN reporting, witnesses including Kushner spoke to Mueller in April 2018. Other top advisers were interviewed potentially around that time, or at least before April 2018.\\n\\nThe mystery witness spoke with special counsel's office prosecutors Jeannie Rhee and Rush Atkinson -- who had focused on the Russian interference side of the investigation and prosecutions of Michael Cohen and Roger Stone -- voluntarily over two days within Mueller's offices, according to the sliver of unredacted text in the memo.\\n\\nThe interview appears to be a notably long one, worth 31 pages of single-spaced notes. It only appears to reflect what the witness told Mueller's team on the first interview day, April 12, according to the document.\\n\\nAside from a brief introduction, every paragraph that the special counsel's office wrote about the mystery witness' interview is redacted. The Justice Department gives several reasons for the redactions, including personal privacy and privilege reasons.\\n\\nThe level of redactions in the document is especially notable, since the Mueller investigation has been relatively transparent, especially in Mueller's report, in disclosing when and which witnesses spoke to Mueller.\\n\\nExtensive redactions about the details witnesses told Mueller, however, are common throughout the public records releases.\\n\\nIn a separate court proceeding, House Democrats revealed that they believed Kushner was interviewed by Mueller's team on April 11, 2018.\\n\\nManafort used Hannity as 'back channel' to Trump\\n\\nManafort said he used Fox News host Sean Hannity as a back channel to Trump in the period between the FBI raid of his apartment and his indictment months later, in October 2017.\\n\\nHannity would send supportive messages to Manafort, telling him to hang in there and that Trump had his back, according to newly released FBI interview notes.\\n\\nManafort said he didn't recall any direct or indirect communication with the White House in the period, but that Hannity, a personal friend, was certainly a back channel.\\n\\nHundreds of messages between the two men were released in June as part of the wind-down of Manafort's criminal case in Washington, showing a close relationship and shared disdain for the Mueller investigation.\\n\\nManafort told the special counsel's investigators that he did not believe Trump will pardon him, but, as revealed in the Mueller report, Manafort was hopeful for one and noticed how the President discussed pardons publicly, according to the interview notes.\\n\\nManafort said in an interview with the investigators that he never received any assurance from the President that he would get a pardon, according to the notes.\\n\\nWhile the President's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani raised the prospect of a pardon for Manafort in interviews with reporters, Manafort said he hadn't talked to Giuliani since his indictment, the interview notes say.\\n\\nHannity suggested Cohen hire Sekulow\\n\\nCohen also tells the FBI that after he received a letter from the House for his testimony he contacted Jay Sekulow on the advice of Sean Hannity. Sekulow didn't take Cohen on as a client.\\n\\nCohen and Sekulow met with Trump at the White House around May 18, 2017, to get direction about how to respond to the congressional request. Cohen told Trump he replied that he would not cooperate with Congress. Trump asked him why he would respond like that, according to the FBI notes. By the end of the meeting Cohen understood the direction from Trump was to cooperate, according to the notes. The Trump Tower in Moscow did not come up during that meeting.\\n\\nCohen later spoke again with Trump, this time over the phone, about his letter response to Congress. Cohen told the FBI he didn't recall discussing specific details, only that he planned to put out a letter in response.\\n\\nCohen said he and Sekulow never discussed the disconnect between the letter contents and facts Cohen knew to be true. Cohen said he never told Sekulow that there were more than three meetings about Trump Tower Moscow but he said there was more to the story, according to the notes. Sekulow, as previously reported, told Cohen to stay on message, according to the FBI notes.\\n\\nThe notes add that Cohen told the FBI he never told someone whose name is redacted but could have been his lawyer based on the content of the conversation -- that he was uncomfortable with the letter. The individual whose name is redacted wrote the letter response to the House based off of Cohen's memory, according to the FBI report.\\n\\n'Trump wanted them'\\n\\nAccording to notes from an interview with Trump campaign aide John Mashburn, not only the campaign but Trump himself was interested in finding Clinton's missing emails.\\n\\nEveryone was looking for them and Trump wanted them, according to the documents. Mashburn thought it would be great to find them so they could better understand several issues, like the Clinton Foundation, donations, etc.\\n\\nMashburn insisted that the campaign was not scouring the Internet to try and find them. The emails they were searching for were related to Clinton's private server, and not related to the emails that WikiLeaks released.\\n\\nPapadopoulos a 'problem child?'\\n\\nMashburn's interview also revealed attempts by the campaign to get rid of former Trump campaign aide George Papadopoulos, who later served 12 days in prison for lying to investigators about his contact with individuals tied to Russia during the 2016 campaign.\\n\\nMashburn and others were aggravated with Papadopoulos, and former Trump campaign aide and White House communications director Hope Hicks pushed for his ouster. But Mashburn thought the job should go to Sam Clovis, another campaign aide.\\n\\nAt one point, Hicks told Papadopoulos to talk to Mashburn because Papadopoulos was becoming a problem child with campaign and they wanted to get rid of him, according to the documents. Mashburn believed it was Clovis' responsibility to control Papadopoulos given that Clovis had initially brought him to the campaign.\\n\\nBut Mashburn's ire was specifically due to Papadopoulos' antics -- Mashburn just wanted (Papadopoulos) to go away because he had been cold-calling embassies and using the campaign to bolster his own profile, investigators wrote.\\n\\nNSC lawyer warned K.T. McFarland not to send email that could appear to be 'quid pro quo'\\n\\nLong before the current Ukraine controversy, the term quid pro quo came up in a White House conversation between K.T. McFarland, then a deputy national security adviser, and White House lawyer John Eisenberg, according to a heavily redacted account of her interview with FBI interviewers.\\n\\nThe discussion in February 2017 came after national security adviser Michael Flynn, McFarland's boss, had been ousted over his interactions with the then-Russian ambassador. McFarland, who had been privy to details of Flynn's Russia conversations, was also being forced out.\\n\\nMcFarland was offered an ambassadorship to ease her way out of the White House. But first, Priebus had a request, McFarland told the FBI.\\n\\nPriebus said words to the effect of 'the President would like you to send me an email saying,' the interview notes say before a redaction. The notes continue: could she say the President never directed Flynn to call the Russians about sanctions.\\n\\nMcFarland told the FBI she didn't respond to Priebus's request, but called Eisenberg to recount the conversation. She told the White House lawyer that she was being fired and offered an ambassadorship, but that the letter was being requested from her.\\n\\nThere are additional redactions in the interview notes, but McFarland, appears to be referring to Eisenberg, saying He offered his opinion it was a bad idea for her to write the letter because it was awkward and looked like a quid pro quo situation.\\n\\nMcFarland told the FBI that Priebus later came back to her and told her not do the email and to forget he even mentioned it.\\n\\nMcFarland's interview, much of which is redacted, described interactions with White House officials during the transition and after inauguration as the Trump administration tried to save a possible reset of Russian relations. A top concern was Russian retaliation after the Obama administration issued sanctions following Russian interference in the 2016 elections.\\n\\nMcFarland told the FBI about a meeting during the presidential transition in which Trump asked her if the Russians did it, an apparent query about the Russian hacking attacks and other activities to meddle in the 2016 election.\\n\\nMcFarland said she responded yes, to the President-elect. Trump repeated he was not sure, the interview notes say before another redaction. He said he had reason to doubt it was the Russians.\\n\\nWhat Manafort told Mueller on WikiLeaks\\n\\nIn one of the first glimpses by the public of what Manafort told Mueller, the former Trump campaign chairman described then-candidate Trump's interest in WikiLeaks email releases that Russia had stolen from the Democrats.\\n\\nDuring the campaign, Manafort did not want Trump distracted by the titillation of a WikiLeak's release, investigators noted about his September 2018 interview. Manafort viewed the drops as a gift but one that they could not control.\\n\\nMueller ultimately found in his final report that the Trump campaign welcomed the WikiLeaks releases because they could damage Clinton's presidential campaign, and the campaign strategized to take advantage of them politically. But Mueller charged no one on the campaign with conspiring with the Russians.\\n\\nThe interview notes have several paragraphs redacted, and the publicly released version doesn't appear to add more detail about Trump's potential knowledge of efforts to reach WikiLeaks, about which Manafort's deputy had told Mueller.\\n\\nInstead, Manafort offered to Mueller theories about why Trump may have publicly encouraged Russia to find Clinton's emails that summer. Manafort said he was surprised Trump had encouraged Russia specifically.\\n\\nManafort does not know why Trump asked Russia as opposed to another country, the notes from one of Manafort's cooperation sessions said.\\n\\nManafort also gave Mueller's team a theory about why Trump named Russia when he said at a campaign rally, Russia, if you're listening, I hope you're able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing.\\n\\nTrump would have been talking with his 'kitchen cabinet,' the investigator noted from Manafort's September 2018 interview. Manafort guesses that more people than not were identifying Russia so that stuck in Trump's head.\\n\\nManafort ultimately lied to investigators during some of his cooperation interviews and to a federal grand jury about certain topics. He is serving seven years in prison for financial and lobbying-related crimes prosecuted by Mueller's team.\\n\\nMichael Cohen and Borat?\\n\\nIn a redacted interview section, Cohen is shown an email referencing the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs. It doesn't explain the reference further but the notes indicate that while in Kazakhstan, Cohen met with someone who stormed out of the room after Cohen gave him his business card.\\n\\nA few minutes later the person returned, angry, and asked Cohen if he was related to Sasha Baron Cohen, the comedian who played Borat, a fictitious Kazakh journalist, in a satire. Cohen said after the election he had no meetings or contemplation of securing Russian investment money."}

Rajapaksa's supporters also criticized Sri lankan President Maithripala Sirisena for selling off national assets, including a controversial 99-year lease granted to China for the Hambantota port.\\n\\nUncertainty looms\\n\\nThough parliamentary elections are not scheduled for another two years, Rajapaksa's comeback comes at a perilous time for the country's first postwar national government, who have been stymied by infighting and accusations of political inaction.\\n\\nLed by Sirisena, the current administration was formed in 2015 with the help of a disparate coalition of minority groups, promising a more decentralized, transparent form of governance that would usher in a new post-war era of prosperity for the island nation.\\n\\nInstead, Sirisena, a former health minister under Rajapaksa, has struggled to maintain unity among his coalition partners while attempting to implement his ambitious reform agenda.\\n\\nPHOTO: LAKRUWAN WANNIARACHCHI/AFP/AFP/Getty Images Sri Lankans queue up to cast their vote in the country's local elections at a polling station in Colombo on February 10, 2018.\\n\\nRajapaksa's Podujana Peramuna, also known as People's Front won 44.65% of the seats available in the local vote, sweeping aside Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe's United National Party (UNP) who claimed just 32.63%, and the United People's Freedom Alliance (UFPA), a coalition led by Sirisena's Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) who came third with just 8.94%.\\n\\nThe opposition had not anticipated the scale of the victory, Paikiasothy Saravanamuttu, executive director of the Colombo-based think tank, Center for Policy Alternatives, told CNN.\\n\\nThere was always the argument that they (Podujana Peramuna) would probably emerge as first or second but they emerged as the largest party in terms of votes and councils by quite a large number, said Saravanamuttu, who attributed the result to problems relating to command, control and communication within the ruling coalition.\\n\\nThe President himself started attacking his coalition partners and thought that he would win voters but that did not happen at all. The government has been abysmal in its ability to communicate as to what it's doing, why it is doing what it is doing, and what it intends to be doing, added Saravanamuttu.\\n\\nSnap election?\\n\\nUnder the constitution, an early election can only be held with the endorsement of two-thirds of parliament, but with the ruling coalition weakened, the possibility of a snap election cannot be ruled out, say analysts.\\n\\nThere's going to be a lot of jockeying in the parliament, within the parties. The dust won't settle for another couple of weeks, said Alan Keenan, a senior Sri Lanka analyst at the London-based Crisis Group.

They need to go back to the drawing board and return to their fundamental principles and start to deliver, said Keenan.\\n\\nLingering controversies\\n\\nDespite his recent electoral success, Rajapaksa remains a controversial figure in Sri Lanka, where scars from the decades-long civil war have yet to heal.\\n\\nA 2011 UN report found credible allegations of war crimes and crimes against humanity committed by both sides during the final stages of the fighting.\\n\\nRajapaksa has long dismissed the report, and while in power refused to open an internal investigation into the findings\\n\\nAccording to the UN report, between September 2008 and May 2009, tens of thousands of civilians were killed in Vanni in northern Sri Lanka, a period that coincides with an advancement into the same area by the Sri Lankan army.\\n\\nRajapaksa's brother, Gotabaya Rajapaksa, was Sri Lanka's defense secretary at the time and in charge of government forces.\\n\\nThe government described the report as biased, baseless and unilateral."}

{"original": "(CNN Business) President Donald Trump's tweeting privileges were briefly restored following Twitter's temporary lock on his account this week for inciting what became a violent insurrection at the US Capitol. In his first tweet since being let out of the penalty box, Trump shared a video conceding that he will be a one-term president. He would tweet twice more before Twitter determined it had finally had enough.\\n\\nFor Twitter, the challenge of what to do about Trump's account was poised to only get more difficult, not less. As Trump reemerged, the company faced a test of its commitment that any further violations of its policies by the President would result in a permanent ban. Even one more transgression could land Trump in Twitter jail — forever. It happened even more quickly than many would have thought.\\n\\nIt was a game of chicken that Trump, whose entire presidency has been devoted to breaking rules and testing boundaries, barely got to play.\\n\\nFor the last four years, Twitter was central to Trump's presidency, a fact that also benefited the company in the form of countless hours of user engagement. Twitter took a light-touch approach to moderating his account, often arguing that as a public official, Trump must be given wide latitude to speak.\\n\\nBut as Trump neared the end of his term — and as public pressure grew against the platform — the balance shifted.

There have been family feuds, corruption accusations, rows over cow vigilante violence and recriminations over statues and misspent funds.\\n\\nIt's been nothing but dramatic, with most commentators saying the race is still wide open.\\n\\nSo why does it matter so much, and who are the major players involved?\\n\\nWHERE IS UTTAR PRADESH?\\n\\nThe enormous state of Uttar Pradesh lies in India's north. It has a population of 200 million people; if it were a country, it would be the fifth largest on the planet -- bigger than Brazil.\\n\\nIt's home to the majestic Taj Mahal and India's holiest city, Varanasi. Some 200 million tourists flocked to Uttar Pradesh in 2015 to soak up one of India's most varied, colorful and vibrant regions.\\n\\nIt's also one of India's most poverty-stricken states and home to 8% of the world's poor. The population is blighted by illiteracy; according to the last census , only half the state's women are literate, well below the national average.\\n\\nOver three quarters of the population are rural. Uttar Pradesh has the highest percentage of Dalits of any state -- traditionally seen as the lowest in India's caste system. Perceived as being unclean, Dalits are considered untouchable by the higher castes\\n\\nIn Uttar Pradesh the Dalit vote is critical and politicians will be looking to woo this group in an effort to make their mark on the ballot box.\\n\\nIn India, there's a famous saying: 'Indians don't cast their votes, they vote their caste.'\\n\\nWHY ARE THE ELECTIONS THERE SO IMPORTANT?\\n\\nAs India's most populous state, it has the largest parliamentary representation and holds huge political sway.\\n\\nDespite Prime Minister Narendra Modi's landslide victory in 2014, his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has been forced into battle with an upper house where his party does not have the majority.\\n\\nKey pieces of legislation have become stuck, and Modi's ability to enact his election promises of sweeping reform has been called into question.\\n\\nThese perceived failures to deliver have impacted his popularity. In 2015, he suffered decisive losses in the states of Bihar and Delhi, which further damaged his prestige and served to make parliament even more of an obstacle.\\n\\nAs well as boosting morale, a win in Uttar Pradesh would dramatically amplify the BJP's presence -- and strength -- in the upper house, and pave the way for a potential second term for Modi.\\n\\nThe election is of enormous significance, says Sumit Ganguly, professor of Political Science at Indiana University. In many ways, it could be harbinger of what's to come.\\n\\nWHO ARE THE MAJOR PLAYERS?\\n\\nMayawati -- who goes by one name -- is a Dalit politician and an icon for millions of low-caste Indians.\\n\\nShe's previously had four terms as Chief Minister -- but in 2012 her Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) was beaten convincingly by the Samajwadi Party.\\n\\nFor many, Mayawati embodies the Indian dream: a low-caste woman who overcame enormous odds to get to the top of the political pile.\\n\\nFollowing a poor performance in the 2014 general elections, the BSP hasn't been viewed as one of the key players in this pivotal election -- until recently.\\n\\nCows are revered in India and their slaughter is banned in several states, including in Uttar Pradesh. The vigilantes accused the Dalit men of killing the sacred animal rather than just skinning the carcass, as is their tradition.\\n\\nThe attacks received significant media attention and highlighted prevailing discriminatory, and occasionally violent, behaviors and attitudes towards people of the lowest caste. Nationwide protests ensued -- something that could work for Mayawati, who has long been seen as a defender of the Dalit population.\\n\\nA member of the Dalit caste community is detained during a protest against an earlier attack on Dalits in July, 2016.\\n\\nHowever, the colorful politician has been criticized in the past for displays of extravagance in the poverty-stricken state.\\n\\nShe's erected several statues of herself in public parks with funds critics suggested could have been better spent on social services.\\n\\nYou can win with identity politics first time around, by saying, 'I'm one of you, I represent your interests, and I will fight for you and my victory will be your victory,' says Sumit Ganguly, professor of Political Science at Indiana University. But then, people want to see issues of bread and butter addressed -- not statues and edifices ... Mayawati, for all her talk, has done very little to improve their material conditions.\\n\\nHowever, he says, her Samajwadi Party will probably still do well among the Dalit population. The tragedy with Dalits is that they have finite choice. Talking to the BJP is hardly a viable option, he says. Their alternatives are rather bleak.\\n\\nIn 2012, at the age of 38, Akhilesh Yadav became the youngest ever Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh.\\n\\nThe youthful, tech-friendly politician's promises of free laptops and tablets for students seemed to appeal to the state's younger population.\\n\\nHe tapped into a demographic keen to shed traditional stereotypes associated with the impoverished state: The new generation is aspirational, Yadav said in an interview with CNN affiliate, News18, in November. They dream of great things and see a bright future for themselves.\\n\\nRahul Gandhi's India National Congress party -- together they'll be hoping to In January of this year he cemented an alliance withRahul Gandhi's India National Congress party -- together they'll be hoping to galvanize the youth vote.\\n\\nAhmed, 55, pulls a rickshaw promoting Yadav's party but he's not sure who he'll he vote for: I will cast my vote for the right person, he says.\\n\\nHowever, the party has been blighted by dramatic family feuds. On December 30, Yadav was expelled from the party by his father, only to be reintroduced back into the fold less than 24-hours later, News18 reported.\\n\\nThe party is a bit fractured, says Ganguly. Some of the old guard have stuck with his father, some have defected.\\n\\nParty infighting aside, what could stall Yadav in this election is a lack of evidence for tangible improvements in people's livelihoods over the last five years, Ganguly added.\\n\\nModi's BJP has opted not to name a candidate for chief minister, which means there isn't an individual linked to its campaign.\\n\\nGanguly says the BJP will be hoping to leverage anti-incumbency sentiment swirling around Yadav and his fractured Samajwadi party, rather than focusing on a particular individual who could bring the electorate behind her or him.\\n\\nHe says Modi's supporters in Uttar Pradesh are likely to stick by the BJP -- viewing upper house deadlocks more as a form of obstructionism by opposition Congress, rather than a failure on the part of Modi.\\n\\nMaking Modi the face of the campaign could also work in the BJP's favor.\\n\\nDespite setbacks, he remains a hugely popular leader; a Pew Research Center survey from September 2016 found that more than 81% of Indians held a favorable view of Modi.\\n\\nBJP leader Narendra Modi waves to supporters in Varanasi from an open truck in April 2014.\\n\\nMuslim voters are a vital group for this election, and the BJP has a checkered history with them.\\n\\nModi was accused of allowing anti-Muslim riots in 2002. However, he's always denied any wrongdoing, making significant efforts to disprove assertions he would marginalize the Muslim community throughout his term.\\n\\nVillagers wait outside a bank to deposit and exchange large rupee notes on the outskirts of Allahabad in Uttar Pradesh.\\n\\nModi's move late last year to scrap its two largest rupee notes also hit the lower castes. Billed by the Prime Minister as a way to curb the influence of untaxed money -- or black money as it's known, Ganguly says the policy was rolled out ineffectively.\\n\\nIts effects were disproportionately on the backs of the poor, he says. Many artisans and day laborers and people in menial occupations were not being promptly paid, and a bit of a backlash developed.\\n\\nHe says that while literacy is low in India, political awareness is not -- something that could hold the BJP back in this state.\\n\\nThey simply can't do with the upper caste vote, that's not enough of a base.\\n\\nIn late January, the Indian National Congress party revealed it was forging an alliance with the state's ruling Samajwadi Party; vice president Gandhi and sitting Chief Minister Yadav were going to the polls together.\\n\\nCongress has suffered recently in Uttar Pradesh and will see the alliance as a means of regaining lost ground in the region, as well as holding back Modi's BJP -- a tactic they've employed in other state races and will look to use again elsewhere if it proves successful.\\n\\nBut according to Ganguly, the last era of Congress national government is still fresh in voter's minds -- something the BJP is relying on.\\n\\nIt was wracked with stratospheric financial scandal, which has really damaged its image, he says. The quality of governance was so poor, and there were so many accusations of ministers who allegedly had their hands in the till, says Ganguly, that Modi could capitalize on it -- something the BJP is gambling on in Uttar Pradesh.\\n\\nAmidst the intrigue, however, there's one thing interested parties can be sure of over the next four weeks. Between now and March 11, when the final count takes place, it'll be a long and bitter fight for a state with some serious political punch."}

Instead, it's because drugs cost more, doctors and nurses are paid better, hospital administration is more expensive and many medical services have higher price tags, the study found.\\n\\nThe new analysis – an update of a well-known 2003 report by Princeton health care economist Uwe Reinhardt titled It's the prices, stupid – found that the US remains an outlier when it comes to spending, which was $9,892 per person in 2016. That compares to a median of $4,033 for Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development countries in 2016 and to the $4,559 the US spent per person in 2000, adjusted for inflation.\\n\\nSpending increased at an average rate of 2.8% annually in the US between 2000 and 2016, compared to the OECD median of 2.6%. This was driven in part by how much Americans shell out on drugs, which increased 3.8% per year, compared to a median of 1.1% for OECD nations.\\n\\nIn spite of all the efforts in the US to control health spending over the past 25 years, the story remains the same, said lead author Gerard Anderson, a Johns Hopkins professor. The US remains the most expensive because of the prices the US pays for health services.\\n\\nOne reason for the jump in spending increase is the widening gap between what the federal government reimburses for Medicare and what private insurers and employers pay for those with job-based coverage, Anderson said. In 2000, the difference was roughly 10%. Now, studies have shown it has widened to 50% or more.\\n\\nAnderson attributes this to consolidation among hospitals and doctors' practices, which allows them to demand higher prices.\\n\\nDespite paying higher prices, Americans actually have less access to doctors, nurses and hospital beds. There are only 2.6 practicing doctors per 1,000 people in the US, compared to a median of 3.2 active physicians in the OECD, for instance.\\n\\nIt's not that we're getting more. It's that we're paying much more, Anderson said.\\n\\nPoliticians, policy experts, health care industry executives and employers have wrestled with the nation's high health care costs for decades. The efforts include raising deductibles to give consumers more incentive to shop around for health care services and paying doctors and hospitals based on patients' health outcomes rather than for every service rendered.\\n\\nCurrently in the spotlight are high drug prices, which are expected to be a major focus of both Congress and the Trump administration this year."}

A fully clothed woman taking selfies in the mirror. A photo of a vase. These images were all wrongly flagged by Tumblr as improper.\\n\\nTumblr began its crackdown on adult content several weeks ago. But behind the scenes its technology still struggles to figure out the difference between what's banned and approved nudity.\\n\\nIn December, Tumblr banned adult content — specifically images, videos, or GIFs that show real-life human genitals or female-presenting nipples to clean up its blogging platform. A handful of exceptions include nudity as art or part of a political event, and written content like erotica.\\n\\nTumblr said it would enforce its rules with automated detection, human moderators, and community users flagging objectionable posts. But some Tumblr users are complaining about reportedly misflagged images.\\n\\nIt's tough for AI to make distinctions between, say, nudity for the sake of art and politics or nudity that is pornographic. An algorithm must be so focused on a specific task, such as spotting faces in pictures, so it can get tripped up by differences humans would see as trivial such as lighting.\\n\\nTo get a sense for how well this can work online, CNN Business created a test Tumblr page and posted photos that don't violate the service's policy but might be challenging for AI to sort out. Images included nude sculptures, bare-breasted political demonstrators, and unclothed mannequins.\\n\\nMost of the posts had no issues. However, we received emails immediately after posting several images that said they were hidden from public view for possibly violating Tumblr's community guidelines.\\n\\nAs far as we could tell, none of the posts actually did. And the images that were flagged weren't always the ones we expected. Some images with political nudity — such as bare-breasted female French protesters, painted silver and clothed in red cloaks — appeared fine. Others, including a picture of topless women who had painted their bodies with the Spanish phrase Mi cuerpo no es obsceno (my body is not obscene), were not. A crowd of mannequins was flagged, too.\\n\\nTumblr declined to comment but said in a December blog post that making distinctions between adult content and political and artistic nudity is not simple at scale, and it knows there will be mistakes. The company has an estimated 21.3 million monthly users, according to eMarketer.\\n\\nEthan Zuckerman, director of the Center for Civic Media at MIT, said part of the difficulty in using AI to discern different types of nudity is that while there is plenty of pornography out there, there aren't all that many images of people getting naked for political reasons.\\n\\nYou just don't have as much training data to draw from, he said.\\n\\nTech companies such as Tumblr, Twitter and Facebook are increasingly turning to artificial intelligence as a solution to all kinds of problems, particularly for scrubbing unsavory posts from social networks. But AI's ability to moderate online content — whether it's photos, videos, or images — is still quite limited, Zuckerman and other experts say. It can help humans pick out bad posts online, but it's likely to remain complementary rather than become a panacea in the years ahead.\\n\\nFacebook in particular has emerged as an AI advocate. In April, CEO Mark Zuckerberg told Congress more than 30 times during 10 hours of questioning that AI would help get rid of social network issues such as hate speech and fake news.\\n\\nIt makes sense to deploy such technology, considering it'd be nearly impossible for human moderators to monitor the content created by a social site's millions (or, in Facebook's case, billions) of users.\\n\\nDan Goldwasser, an assistant professor at Purdue University who studies natural language processing and machine learning, believes AI will get better at this in the future and we should have realistic expectations for its use in the meantime.\\n\\nIn some sense, it's a matter of, well, if you set the bar quite low, AI can be very successful, Goldwasser said.\\n\\nA machine-learning algorithm — a type of AI that learns from mounds of data and gets better over time — can identify offensive language or pictures used in specific contexts. That's because these kinds of posts follow patterns on which AI can be trained. For example, if you give a machine-learning algorithm plenty of racial slurs or nude photos, it can learn to spot those things in text and images.\\n\\nOften, it's trickier for machines to flag the nasty things humans post online, Goldwasser said. Inflammatory social media posts, for instance, may not include clearly offensive language; they could instead include false statements about a person or group of people that lead to violence.\\n\\nAI also has a hard time understanding uniquely human interactions such as humor, sarcasm, and irony. It might sound like you're saying something mean when it's meant to be a joke.\\n\\nUnderstanding context — including who's writing or uploading an image, identifying the target audience, and determining surrounding social environment — can be key to figuring out the meaning behind a social-network post. And that's a lot easier for us than it is for AI.\\n\\nAs AI tools improve, humans will remain an important part of the moderation process. Sarah T. Roberts, an assistant professor at UCLA who researches content moderation and social media, points out that humans are especially good at dissenting when necessary.\\n\\nFor example, we may be able to identify that an image depicting a violent scene is actually a war crime against a group of people. This would be very hard for a computer to determine.\\n\\nI think people will always be better at [understanding] nuance and context, she said.\\n\\nZuckerman also believes humans will always play a role in finding and stopping the spread of negative online content.\\n\\nHuman creativity prevents full automation from coming into play, he said. I think we're always going to find ways to surprise and shock and create new imagery."}
{"original": "(CNN) Midway through his mission to learn chess, Tom Vanderbilt found himself facing off against an 8-year-old child.\\n\\nVanderbilt had a successful writing career, a college degree and decades of real-world experience. The kid, though, had superior skills. Vanderbilt lost in a few dozen moves.\\n\\nDefeat, however, couldn't dampen Vanderbilt's enthusiasm for chess, one of five hobbies the best-selling author pursued as research for his new book  Beginners: The Joy and Transformative Power of Lifelong Learning , released January 5 by Knopf.\\n\\nIn the book, he delves into the science of learning, a project inspired by his experience as a parent.\\n\\nFor years, Vanderbilt had encouraged his daughter to take on all kinds of challenges. He told her that learning new things was great — even as he stuck to the relative safety of what he already knew.\\n\\nParents are always foisting their children into new things, he said. We ourselves are not always following our own advice.\\n\\nWhen his daughter started learning chess, though, Vanderbilt finally decided to follow her lead. (That's what landed him at a chess tournament, getting matched against — and beaten by — an 8-year-old boy.) After chess, he added juggling, drawing, surfing and singing.\\n\\nBook author Tom Vanderbilt took up surfing, juggling and more: There's this whole new world that's open to you, he said.\\n\\nHis ensuing adventures were sometimes humbling: He lost endless chess matches and two wedding bands. (They slipped off while he was surfing.)\\n\\nAdults willing to undergo similar trials have more to gain than juggling skills. Research into adult learning shows the effort can pay off in increased well-being, plus mental and physical health.\\n\\nAs the new year unfolds, Vanderbilt's book is, above all, a call to action for a world facing ongoing lockdowns and pandemic fatigue. That's because the greatest benefit of learning something new might be starting 2021 with a fresh pair of eyes.\\n\\nWhy starting out can be scary — and thrilling\\n\\nIf pouring yourself into brand-new skill sounds more awkward than exciting, you're not the only one to see it that way.\\n\\nIn adulthood, Vanderbilt said, you get used to a certain level of competence. It can be hard to give that up for something new, because beginning again means embracing repeated slipups.\\n\\nIf you take up roller skating in adulthood, you're likely to end up with bruises. Try out newly acquired phrases in a foreign language, and you might get some strange looks from native speakers.\\n\\nChances are, you're going to look foolish in the beginning. You're going to ask dumb questions. You're going to fall down, Vanderbilt said. For him, those experiences nevertheless were easily offset by the excitement of discovering new things.\\n\\nThere's this whole new world that's open to you, Vanderbilt said. Practicing a nascent skill can be like opening a door, he explained, one that might lead to unexpected places. You go through that door, and suddenly there are other doors that you didn't even know existed.\\n\\nWhen Vanderbilt learned to surf, for example, he picked up knowledge about oceanography and tracked incoming swells using obscure buoy readings. He bonded with fellow newbies struggling among breaking waves, and he felt empowered by each small success.\\n\\nIn the same way, if you try a cold-weather sport like cross-country skiing or snowshoeing, you might find yourself snapping photos of ice formations or noticing winter wildlife for the very first time. In addition to new vocabulary, learning a new-to-you language can bring surprising discoveries about culture and history.\\n\\nPandemic-inspired learning across the globe\\n\\nWhen the Covid-19 pandemic paused some of his in-person learning, Vanderbilt took his skill-building online. His choir practice was called off indefinitely, so he signed up for the karaoke app Smule , which allowed him to sing with strangers across the globe.\\n\\nVanderbilt (left), shown with Adrian Conoboy (right), sings at a New York Choir Project gathering before sessions were put on hold due to Covid-19 social distancing measures.\\n\\nIf you, like Vanderbilt, plan to pursue online learning this year, you'll have plenty of (virtual) company.\\n\\nPeople in the United Kingdom pursued twice as much adult learning in 2020 as they did in 2019, found one long-running survey about adult education by the United Kingdom's Learning and Work Institute. (The researchers noted that this year's survey, conducted by phone due to the pandemic, differs in methodology from previous years so it may not be precisely comparable.)\\n\\nStill, it's a broad phenomenon. Online learning has surged across the globe, reported the intergovernmental Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.\\n\\nNewbies have enrolled in sessions including gourmet cooking coding and dance . To enjoy the perks of learning, experts say you really can try just about anything.\\n\\nWe see a broad range of benefits almost irrespective of what you learned, said Fiona Aldridge, director of policy and research at the Learning and Work Institute. The process of learning and achieving something — and being recognized for it — can build self-confidence, which enables you to go on and do many other things.\\n\\nEvidence from the UK shows inequities in access to online learning, as with so many things amid the pandemic. The people most likely to pursue adult learning are young, employed and relatively affluent, Aldridge said.\\n\\nLack of internet access is a major issue, but Aldridge also pointed to something more personal.\\n\\nThe biggest barrier is whether people feel that learning is for them, learning is relevant to them, learning is something they can do, she said. For people who struggled in school, learning might not seem particularly appealing. That's something for adult learning advocates to overcome, Aldridge explained.\\n\\nWe need to do quite a lot of work to make sure people understand the benefits of learning, so it's seen as a positive choice that will make a difference, Aldridge said.\\n\\nTaking a fresh look at 2021\\n\\nLearning new skills is a hot topic amid an ongoing pandemic. The advantages of getting a renewed perspective, though, are timeless.\\n\\nThe idea of a beginner's mindset is central to Zen Buddhism — practitioners use the Japanese term shoshin, which translates to beginner's mind in English. It's an ancient concept that hints at the very benefits Vanderbilt pointed to in his book.\\n\\nThe beginner's mind has curiosity, it has no experience, it has purity, said Jakusho Kwong-roshi, the 85-year-old abbot of Sonoma Mountain Zen Center in California. In Zen, that's treasure.\\n\\nKwong-roshi pointed to the 1970 book Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind by Shunryū Suzuki, which explains that a beginner's mind isn't about being an actual beginner. Instead, it's a perspective you can strive for over the course of a lifetime.\\n\\nEven small, daily actions can go a long way toward refreshing your mindset and getting a new perspective on life, Kwong-roshi said. He recommended taking a few minutes twice a day to just sit quietly: first thing in the morning, and before you go to bed.\\n\\nGet comfortable in a cross-legged position, on your knees or in a chair, he said. The important thing is to feel stable and upright, so you can focus on your breath, starting with the exhalation.\\n\\nSitting quietly for a few minutes twice a day can make a big difference in helping you gain a new perspective, said Jakusho Kwong-roshi, abbot of Sonoma Mountain Zen Center in California.\\n\\nIf it helps, Kwong-roshi said you can count slow breaths, numbering each exhalation from one to 10. (Kwong-roshi also invited would-be meditators interested in cultivating a beginner's mind to join the monastery's daily meditations by Zoom.)\\n\\nOf course, a change in mindset won't erase the terrible damage the pandemic has inflicted on communities across the globe. This is hard no matter what, especially if you've lost a loved one or gotten sick yourself, and the fallout will continue for years.\\n\\nBut studies have shown that perspective and mindset are powerful factors in how we cope with the challenges we do face. Whether you're meditating with Zen monks or enrolling in dance classes, a new skill could be key to a badly needed mental tune-up.\\n\\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\\n\\nAnd despite all the loss we've faced, the pandemic offers real opportunities for prospective students.

{"original": "(CNN) China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi concludes his tour of Africa this weekend without making a single concrete vaccine commitment to a continent hoping a benevolent Beijing will help inoculate its population out of the global coronavirus pandemic.\\n\\nLast year, as Covid-19 tore across the globe and wealthy countries began to pre-order stockpiles of vaccines for their citizens, Chinese President Xi Jinping pledged that African vaccinations were a  priority  for Beijing. His commitment followed mass donations of masks, testing kits and medical equipment to the continent by Beijing and private individuals, such as billionaire entrepreneur Jack Ma.\\n\\n#2020Roundup In 2020, #China and #Africa stand together to combat the coronavirus epidemic. 7 Chinese medical teams were dispatched to 15 African countries to assist the fight.

Its Sinopharm vaccine has been approved for domestic use, and four other Chinese candidates are in Phase 3 clinical trials -- the last step of testing before regulatory approval is sought. Unlike some other vaccines, it doesn't require storage at an ultra-low temperature, making shipment easier in developing countries.\\n\\nMillions of Chinese citizens have already been vaccinated at home and employees of state-owned enterprises in Africa were offered shots in trial phases as early as last June, enabling Chinese citizens to work safely on the continent. None of China's Phase 3 trials were conducted in sub-Saharan Africa, which would have given some countries advance access to a vaccine, despite such tests taking place in the Middle East and South America.\\n\\nA news program shows Chinese President Xi Jinping speaking via video link to the World Health Assembly, on a giant screen beside a street in Beijing on May 18, 2020.\\n\\nAnd while a cold chain vaccine air bridge from Shenzhen, in southern China, to Addis Ababa, in Ethiopia, has been established, and manufacturing capabilities are being set up to make Chinese shots in Cairo, Wang's trip made it no clearer when Africans can expect to receive a Chinese vaccine -- or on what terms.\\n\\nThe promises concerning vaccines in Africa have been really vague. There has been no timetable, only promises, said W. Gyude Moore, a senior policy fellow at the Center for Global Development and former Liberian minister of public works. Today, I am not aware of any African country that's taking delivery of Chinese vaccines.\\n\\nThe Chinese Ministry for Foreign Affairs did not reply to CNN's requests for comment on Beijing's plans to roll out vaccines in Africa, but state media has rejected claims that vaccines will be used as a bargaining chip to expand political influence.\\n\\nA power house and a continent in need\\n\\nWang's whistle-stop tour of Nigeria, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Botswana, Tanzania and the Seychelles continued a three-decade tradition of China's top diplomat making his first international trip each year to Africa.\\n\\nThat tradition signals Africa's diplomatic importance to China, with stops in places like the Seychelles, a sparsely populated archipelago, proving no nation is insignificant to Beijing, and serves to embarrass Western countries which typically neglect the continent but often view it as within their natural orbit of influence.\\n\\nThe Africa-first protocol was established in 1991, on a basis of mutual underdog brotherhood, but China has fundamentally changed since then. So much so that Wang's claims, in a video interview ahead of his trip, that China and Africa had a shared identity of the developing world, which had both suffered weal and woe, didn't tally with the two regions' recent history -- and very different experiences of the pandemic.\\n\\nof the first coronavirus vaccines. In 2020, as the world's second-largest economy, China announced it ended abject poverty , successfully contained a virus that has floored the globe's biggest superpower, the United States, and developed someof the first coronavirus vaccines.\\n\\nAcross Africa, countries didn't report the huge caseloads seen in India or the United States -- as of Thursday, the continent had reported fewer than 70,000 deaths, compared to the 150,000 in India and more than twice that in the US.\\n\\nAccording to the China Africa Research Initiative, Compounding the debt issue is another potentially worrying, and somewhat ironic, trend for African leaders: credit lines from China that once seemed almost free-flowing have been throttled in recent years, amid increasing criticism of reckless lending.According to the China Africa Research Initiative, Chinese loans to Africa dropped from $29.4 billion in 2016 to $8.9 billion in 2018.\\n\\nWang's visit also came on the back of the sharpest racial tensions between Africa and China in decades, after alleged coronavirus-related discrimination against African nationals in the city of Guangzhou sparked widespread anger across the continent last April. An extraordinary video was subsequently posted on Twitter of the Chinese ambassador to Nigeria being scolded by a Nigerian politician over the mistreatment of Africans.\\n\\nYet there was little chance of Wang being challenged on any of these points.\\n\\nIn Nigeria, Wang held closed-door meetings and signed a vague agreement to establish an intergovernmental committee. In the DRC, he postponed the repayment of interest-free loans from China that matured at the end of 2020, although it was not clear what the value of these were. While in Tanzania, China and local officials launched a training college , in Botswana Wang committed to deepening bilateral ties, and in the Seychelles he discussed importing more fish from the nation devastated by a collapse in tourism.\\n\\nCOVAX scheme to provide vaccines to those in the greatest need, which Beijing is a Moore, the former Liberian minister, said African countries needed to exercise more agency in the procurement of vaccines, taking the charge on placing orders. If countries are expecting the vaccines to be delivered for free, either directly from China or through the World Health Organization'sCOVAXscheme to provide vaccines to those in the greatest need, which Beijing is a signatory to , they will have no leverage in bargaining over the delivery timetable, he said.\\n\\nThe COVAX scheme has only pledged to work to secure enough doses to protect 20% of Africa's population in the initial phase, meaning nations will have to look at alternative options, such as Russia's Sputnik vaccine.\\n\\nThe director of African Centers for Disease Control (CDC), John Nkengasong, predicts the continent will need 1.5 billion doses of vaccine to inoculate 60% of the population -- the level needed to achieve herd immunity.

This year, however, African heads of state are scheduled to meet with Beijing's top brass in Senegal at the triennial Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC), usually attended by the Chinese President. Should the event go ahead in person, there could be an opportunity for countries to come together to press Beijing to clarify a timeline on its delivery of vaccines to the continent.\\n\\nA date for the event has not yet been set.\\n\\nOver the past two decades, this forum has traditionally been a showcase for headline pledges of Chinese investment in the continent, going from $5 billion in 2006 to $60 billion in 2015 and 2018.\\n\\nThis year is likely to be the first in which Beijing will announce a smaller investment than at the previous FOCAC. In the absence of that monetary commitment, vaccines are likely to be the most pressing issue.\\n\\nAfrican countries are so desperately in need of a vaccine, not because of the health implications, but because of the economic implications, said Moore. We'll soon be living in a two-tier world, where Western countries will be opening the door after vaccinating their populations and developing countries, especially in Africa, will lack access to the rest of the world.\\n\\nYet there is incentive for China to help African countries, says Yanzhong Huang, a senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations: They want to improve China's image. Secondly, they want to expand China's market share of the Chinese vaccines. Third, they want to use vaccines as a strategic tool, especially in countries where China has strategic interest.\\n\\nTellingly, Wang chose to wrap up his tour in the Seychelles, which this weekend will be one of the first African nations to begin inoculating its population. The country has received a donation of 50,000 doses of the Chinese Sinopharm vaccine -- but not from China. Instead, they were donated by the United Arab Emirates, which has commercial interests in the Seychelles, and procured the vaccines by conducting clinical trials for the Chinese pharma giant.\\n\\nWhile it is natural that China would want to vaccinate its most vulnerable before supplying other nations with resources, African leaders must be wondering what Xi means when he says African inoculations are a priority.\\n\\nAccording to analysis by the Economist Intelligence Unit, coronavirus vaccines are unlikely to be available in most of sub-Saharan Africa until April 2022, at the earliest.\\n\\nIf the vaccines aren't forthcoming, it will be hard for China to continue peddling the narrative that it shares weal and woe with its African brothers when those on the continent remain exposed to the virus, and thus trapped within their own borders, as millions in China attempt to put the pandemic in the past."}

And he said President Obama has weakened the country's ability to combat al Qaeda and other extremists by eliminating them.\\n\\nThe former vice president said U.S. intelligence officers were trying to prevent future killings and did not commit torture. But he defended the use of waterboarding, which the United States has prosecuted as torture in the past, as a valuable tool used on three top al Qaeda figures.\\n\\nIn my long experience in Washington, few matters have inspired so much contrived indignation and phony moralizing as the interrogation methods applied to a few captured terrorists, he said.\\n\\nCheney made his remarks during a speech at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank, just minutes after Obama laid out a similarly scathing criticism of his predecessors in an address on national security at the National Archives in Washington. Watch Cheney deny torture took place »\\n\\nCheney argued the power the Bush administration exercised in the war against al Qaeda was clearly granted by the Constitution and by legislation passed by Congress after the September 11, 2001, attacks on New York and Washington. The administration was responsible for preventing something much bigger and far worse than those attacks, which killed nearly 3,000 people.\\n\\nThe intelligence officers who questioned the terrorists can be proud of their work, proud of the results, because they prevented the violent death of thousands, perhaps hundreds of thousands of people, he said.\\n\\nCheney said Obama's decision to close the Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, detention facility was undertaken with little deliberation and no plan. And he argued Obama's decision to release Bush-era interrogation memos was a reckless and unfair distraction in the fight against extremists, noting it was opposed by Obama's own CIA director, Leon Panetta.

Dick Gephardt's run for the White House.\\n\\nJohn Edwards, a first-term senator from North Carolina, managed a second-place finish, and former Vermont Gov. Howard Dean, an early favorite in the polls, was left in third place.

(Full story)\\n\\nDean's third-place position in Iowa after being widely viewed as the national front-runner going into the caucuses will likely sap his momentum going into next week's New Hampshire primary. (Full story)\\n\\nGephardt, who was once battling Dean for supremacy in Iowa, indicated he was dropping out. (Full story)\\n\\nLife will go on because this campaign was never about me, a somber Gephardt told supporters, and he promised to support the party's nominee.\\n\\nCNN has learned that Gephardt will announce he is dropping out of the race at 1 p.m. Tuesday (2 p.m. ET) at the Americas Center in downtown St. Louis, Missouri.\\n\\nWith 98 percent of the nearly 2,000 precincts reporting, Kerry won 38 percent of the state convention delegates, with 32 percent for Edwards, 18 percent for Dean and 11 percent for Gephardt, according to figures reported by the Iowa Democratic Party.\\n\\nThe race tightened in recent days, bringing suspense, surprise and electricity to the Democratic fight.\\n\\nAn estimated 100,000 to 125,000 Iowans braved single-digit temperatures across the state to attend their precinct caucuses.\\n\\nThe caucuses attracted considerable attention, but the state's selections don't always mesh with who wins either party's nomination.\\n\\nFor example, Gephardt won the Iowa caucuses in 1988 but lost the Democratic nomination to Michael Dukakis. That same year, Bob Dole won the GOP caucuses in Iowa, but the nomination went to George H.W. Bush -- father of the sitting president.\\n\\nDean tried to put the best spin on his finish.

He is a partner in Darr Feedlot, a commercial cattle feeding business, and runs a family cattle business. The views expressed in this commentary are solely his.\\n\\n(CNN) —\\n\\nWith Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe meeting Friday with President Trump, the issue of international trade is once again front and center. And while we'll certainly hear a lot about how various industries are affected by trade, it's important to remember just how important access to international markets is to an often-overlooked sector: American farmers and ranchers.\\n\\nFor example, I'm a fourth-generation cattleman from Elwood, Nebraska, population 707, according to the 2010 census. I'm a partner in Darr Feedlot, a commercial cattle feeding business. My wife, Terri, and I also own and manage a cattle ranch. My son, Andrew, works with his own high-tech animal information company, contributing directly to the rural economy. My daughter, Blair, and her husband own a registered Red Angus herd in Minnesota.\\n\\nPHOTO: courtesy of Craig and Terri Uden Craig and Terri Uden\\n\\nWe – and hundreds of thousands of similar agricultural families – are the real, if often forgotten, American faces of international trade. Now, we don't sell our beef directly to restaurants or butchers in Canada, Japan, or China; we sell to others in the production chain, who then sell a sizeable – and growing – percentage of our high-quality cuts to customers in other countries. But that foreign demand – and the access to the markets where that demand is growing rapidly – means a better life for my family and hundreds of thousands of others just like mine.\\n\\nOver the past few years, politicians across the ideological spectrum have attempted to paint a portrait of how international trade has impacted the typical American worker. By now we're familiar with this portrait: the worker whose factory job disappeared when cheaper labor became available in other countries.\\n\\nTo be sure, many factory workers across rural America and the Rust Belt have lost their jobs in recent years, and the pain they feel is very real. However, recent research, such as a 2016 study by the Center for Business and Economic Research at Ball State University, shows that approximately 85% of the job loss in manufacturing between 2000 and 2010 resulted from technological advances and automation rather than trade.\\n\\nOn the other hand, international trade – especially the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) – has been one of the greatest success stories in the long history of the U.S. beef industry, and for American agricultural families in general. In fact, since NAFTA was implemented in 1993, exports of American-produced beef to Mexico have grown by more than 750%, according to the US Meat Export Federation. In addition, exports now account for as much as 13% of overall U.S. beef production – and it's more likely to be higher-quality cuts that bring in higher revenues for the hundreds of thousands of American families in the beef community.\\n\\nUnfortunately, all the heated campaign-trail rhetoric began to have real-world policy implications on Jan. 23, when President Trump signed an executive order that began the process of withdrawing the United States from the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) – the 12-nation trade deal that would have provided American producers with much greater access along the Pacific Rim.\\n\\nIn fact, American cattle producers are already losing out because we aren't competing on a level playing field with other beef producing nations. Tariffs on American beef into Japan are currently significantly higher than those for imports from Australia. TPP would have put American beef producers on equal footing with Australian producers, but now that competitive disadvantage will remain indefinitely.\\n\\nContrary to much of the rhetoric we've heard in recent years, the more accurate faces of trade in the United States look like the ones in my family, and they're much more likely to be smiling faces than those you might have seen on the campaign trail.\\n\\nGet our free weekly newsletter Sign up for CNN Opinion's new newsletter.\\n\\nJoin us on Twitter and Facebook\\n\\nI understand that foreign trade has been a convenient political punching bag for a long time. But sparking a trade war with Canada, Mexico, and Asia will only lead to higher tariffs (in other words: taxes) on American-produced beef in those markets and put our American producers at a much steeper competitive disadvantage. The fact remains that, according to the Small Business Administration, 96% of the world's consumers live outside the United States, and expanding access to those consumers is the single best thing we can do to help American cattle-producing families like mine be more successful."}

Bluntly, Brexit has shone a light on the fact that the foundations holding up the UK had been crumbling for some time.\\n\\nThe current deadlock in Westminster – and what it might mean for the union between England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland – is spooking politicians from all over the political divide.\\n\\nJacob Rees-Mogg, a longstanding Conservative Euroskeptic, told me earlier this week: The two greatest risks to the union are splitting Northern Ireland from Great Britain, as the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement with the EU proposes, and a second referendum, which would legitimize the calls for a second independence vote in Scotland.\\n\\nThe movement in the UK's politics and resulting divisions is nicely illustrated by the last eight years of its voting history.\\n\\nThe two greatest risks to the union are splitting Northern Ireland from Great Britain, as the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement with the EU proposes, and a second referendum, which would legitimize the calls for a second independence vote in Scotland. Jacob Rees-Mogg\\n\\nLet's take the 2010 general election as a starting point, in which voters opted for a coalition between David Cameron's Conservative Party and Nick Clegg's Liberal Democrats. These two centrists looked like a safe pair of hands at a time of turmoil in the immediate aftermath of the 2008 global financial crisis.\\n\\nOver the five years of the coalition, austerity measures were introduced that made most politics junkies certain that Labour would win back power under its then leader, Ed Miliband.\\n\\nBut a shock result in 2015 saw Cameron win a majority in Parliament. Scotland voted for the pro-independence Scottish Nationalist Party in huge numbers. After the failed Scottish independence referendum a year earlier, the general election result was a clear sign of just how wide the gap between England and Scotland had become.\\n\\nFast forward past the Brexit referendum and Cameron's own exit to Theresa May's 2017 snap election for more clues. Many voters in pro-Brexit areas of England snubbed her in favor of Labour's Jeremy Corbyn – who at the time had an unclear position on Brexit, though much of his party is pro-Europe. She lost her majority, but strangely picked up votes in Remain-supporting Scotland, despite her party backing the very definition of a so-called hard Brexit.\\n\\nPHOTO: TOLGA AKMEN/AFP/Getty Images Britain's Prime Minister Theresa May leaves from 10 Downing Street on December 17, 2018.\\n\\nClearly, the British public is divided – and that division is especially acute in the politics of the four nations.\\n\\nIn England, the UK's wealthiest and most populous city, London, stands in contrast to the rest of the country.\\n\\nIt is from London that the campaign for a second vote that could ultimately stop Brexit is being driven. But it was English votes that carried the victory for Leave. This creates tension not just in England, but in the union at large – the politics of the English are the most influential in the union and can often dictate policy that affects everyone.\\n\\nIn the case of Brexit, that means Scottish remainers feeling as though the English are dragging them out of the EU against their will. Alarmingly for unionists, recent polling showed that English Conservative voters (officially called the Conservative and Unionist Party) would be happy with the union breaking up in exchange for a good Brexit.\\n\\nThe division is more obvious in Scotland. The SNP would clearly like to push for a second independence referendum and rejoin the EU as an independent nation. Meanwhile, Scottish Conservatives would clearly prefer a softer form of Brexit to protect Scotland's economy while keeping the union together – something about which they disagree with their English counterparts.\\n\\nIn Northern Ireland, the devolved National Assembly has not sat in nearly two years after the power-sharing agreement that allows both unionists and republicans to be involved in government collapsed.\\n\\nDespite this, the Democratic Unionist Party holds the balance of power in Westminster and is currently one of the biggest obstacles to May getting her Brexit deal through Parliament.\\n\\nThey believe the deal ignores their most important demand: no friction between Northern Ireland and Great Britain. We do not want a hard border, we believe there are many ways of resolving it, the DUP's Emma Little-Pengelly said to me of the Irish border issue. Instead, she believes that May and the EU's solution aims to ensure no checks at all on the Irish border between two sovereign states by creating 68 new checks between Great Britain and Northern Ireland.\\n\\nIt must be worrying for the DUP that both those wanting May's deal to pass and hardline Brexit voters are so happy to see their red lines rubbed out for the sake of getting the job done.\\n\\nPHOTO: PAUL FAITH/AFP/AFP/Getty Images Traffic crosses the border into Northern Ireland from the Irish Republic.\\n\\nOne thing seems to have been forgotten by politicians in all this: some people in Brussels speak English. The UK's chaos has been watched with astonishment by EU officials.\\n\\nIt's still not clear what the UK wants, Guy Verhofstadt, Brexit coordinator for the EU Parliament, told CNN. I hope the deal agreed finds a majority. If not, then MPs have to work together to find a compromise solution on a future relationship. Whatever the choice, we need a withdrawal agreement to be agreed to avoid a disastrous no-deal outcome.\\n\\nLoathe as many in Westminster will be to take advice from a former Prime Minister of Belgium, he makes a solid point. Wild politics is not a good enough reason for a nation as important as the UK to fall into a black hole of its own creation.\\n\\nIt's still not clear what the UK wants. Guy Verhofstadt\\n\\nThe good news is that as things stand, both main parties believe the union should be preserved. It shouldn't be beyond the wit of our elected officials to forge some cross-party unity on a matter they claim to care so much about.\\n\\nAs Brexit reaches its apex, perhaps the minds of the political elite will sharpen and we will all start to see a way out of this hellscape. They need to make the public care about the union, or frankly, it's only going to crumble further.\\n\\nIf that doesn't happen, then the UK as we know it will have to continue to exist on life support.\\n\\nAnd if we don't take this moment to fix the union between the four nations, then distressingly few will be in mourning, should the switch get flipped."}
{"original": "Washington (CNN) Former national security adviser John Bolton has remained silent in the immediate aftermath of President Donald Trump's Senate impeachment acquittal, an outcome many Democrats have cast as the result of a sham trial due, in part, to the fact that they were denied a chance to hear the former top aide testify.\\n\\nThrough his legal team Bolton suggested at various points throughout the impeachment process that he had new information relevant to the probe.

{"original": "Donald Trump must be defeated: Another four years of him as president would be a disaster. Unfortunately, as I warned, the Democrats' hyper-partisan impeachment process has increased the likelihood that he will be re-elected. After Trump's acquittal in the Senate, his approval rating reached the highest levels since he took office. And the risk that he will win in November is much greater than before.\\n\\nThis was entirely foreseeable.\\n\\nFor years I have stressed the need for our leaders to make decisions based on thoughtfulness and foresight—not just emotion, or what may feel good in a given moment. This is especially important in the area of foreign policy, as politicians' desire to do something too often overrides careful consideration of the unintended consequences of the actions they take. Time and time again, their poor judgment has led to worse outcomes in the countries where we recklessly intervene, and for our own country's national security.\\n\\nAn egregious lack of foresight also led to this counterproductive impeachment of Trump.\\n\\nThose who wish to lead our country should have had the foresight to know that this result was inevitable. They need to understand that their decisions should not be dictated by what makes them temporarily feel good or look good, but rather by what will be good for the American people. Emotional gratification or political advantage should never determine one's votes or actions.\\n\\nI find it strange that the same people who loudly declare that Trump's re-election would be an existential threat to our country nonetheless advocated for the very thing which has increased the chances he will be re-elected. If they really believed that a second Trump term would be such a devastating catastrophe, perhaps they should not have given such a priceless contribution to his re-election campaign.\\n\\nI am not a genius; I simply had enough common sense to foresee that Trump would be acquitted. And I also used my common sense to predict that Trump would, upon his acquittal, use that as vindication. Unfortunately, common sense is not so common among politicians jockeying for power.\\n\\nIt's no secret that some presidential candidates believed that being the earliest and most emphatic to demand Trump's impeachment would profit them politically—and they were right. They did benefit politically by exploiting Democratic voters' disdain for Trump. But their political gain has been America's loss.\\n\\nOf course we've all heard their talking points: Sometimes you just have to do the right thing. Do they believe that the right thing is to help Trump get re-elected—and now embolden him to act with impunity for the remainder of his tenure in office—even as they claim his re-election would destroy our country, our Constitution, our democracy, and our world?\\n\\nThey say, We had to do this to protect our Constitution—but if you increase the likelihood of destroying the country, how is that protecting our Constitution?\\n\\nSome of my Democratic colleagues in the House have argued that this failed endeavor was still justified because Trump will go down in infamy as the third president to be impeached. But that will be cold comfort. While it may warm the heart of a self-serving politician eager for publicity and donations, a footnote in future history books will do nothing to comfort our children and our children's children—who will have to live with the disastrous consequences of another four years of Trump in the White House.\\n\\nForesight means being guided always by what is in the best interests of the American people, not what may be in one's political interest. It means getting past the shallow partisan divides that result in short-sighted thinking, and inflame the kind of tribal animosities that make it far more difficult to get even the most basic things done. That's why I am running for president—to bring a new era of leadership that moves us beyond this destructive pattern.

{"original": "Jerusalem (CNN) -- Israel's former top intelligence official says the country does not have the ability to stop Iran's nuclear program and that a pre-emptive attack against the Islamic Republic would result in a regional war that would pose Israel with an impossible challenge.\\n\\nWe do not have the ability to stop Iran's nuclear program. In the best case scenario we can push it off a bit, said former Mossad chief Meir Dagan in widely reported remarks to a Tel Aviv leadership conference Wednesday.\\n\\nIt is important to know what the outcome of an attack on Iran would be, what would happen on the day after and what situation Israel would find itself in on the international stage, Dagan said.\\n\\nAn attack on Iran would mean regional war, and in that case you would have given (Iran) the best possible reason to continue the nuclear program because the Iranians would then claim, 'We have been attacked by a foreign country that is reported to have a military nuclear capability. Now we have no choice but to defend ... against a country with strategic capabilities -- a compelling and principled argument for them to move to a large nuclear program, he added.\\n\\nIt is important to know that that war would not just be against Iran. It would be a regional war that would include Syria -- if we needed to attack Hezbollah targets in Syrian territory. The regional challenge that Israel would face would be impossible.\\n\\nThe blunt public comments, which have been printed in various Israeli newspapers, are not the first from Dagan, who spent the last eight years heading the Israeli spy agency. Dagan left his position in January and in recent weeks has made a series of comments that have been at odds with the public policy positions of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on the sensitive issue of Iran and it's nuclear program.\\n\\nNetanyahu has repeatedly maintained in public that all options including military force should be considered to force Iran to halt its nuclear program. Both Israel and the United States believe Iran is developing nuclear weapons -- an allegation leaders in Tehran deny, maintaining the program is for civilian use only.\\n\\nIn his comments, Dagan compared the strategic environment facing Israel to the eve of the Yom Kippur war in 1973 and warned that the country should go to war only if it was attacked or if there is a gun to your head -- that is to say, conflict is unavoidable and the only way to minimize the threat is to use violence.\\n\\nDagan suggested conflict was not yet unavoidable and offered advice to the prime minister not to make a decision to attack Iran.\\n\\nIt is important to consider all options and not to run straight for the war option. At the moment no decision has been made to attack Iran, and I am not familiar with any decision to attack in 2011 or 2012, Dagan told the audience.\\n\\nIn addition to Iran, Dagan said it was crucial for Israel to present some sort of plan for getting talks restarted with Palestinians and suggested adopting the 2002 Saudi Peace initiative, which outlines normalization of relations with Arab countries in exchange for a Palestinian state based on 1967 lines with a just solution to the Palestinian refugee issue.\\n\\nWe have no other way, and not because they are my top priority, but because I am concerned about Israel's well-being and I want to do what I can to ensure Israel's existence, Dagan said If we don't make proposals and if we don't take the initiative, we will eventually find ourselves in a corner.\\n\\nIt is not uncommon for former Israeli intelligence chiefs to be speak publicly, but for the widely respected Dagan to speak so openly and so soon after his departure has raised eyebrows in Israel. To that point, Dagan told the Tel Aviv audience it is important for ex-officials to make their opinions known.\\n\\nThe office of Prime Minister Netanyahu declined to comment on Dagan's remarks.\\n\\nEarlier in the year Dagan courted controversy when he stated that Iran would not be able to develop a nuclear weapon before 2015. which prompted Netanyahu to disagree publicly stating, I think that intelligence estimates are exactly that, estimates. They range from best case to worst case possibilities, and there is a range there, there is room for differing assessments."}
{"original": "(CNN) —\\n\\nFor many professionals and students alike, the new normal has meant trading in their cushy office space or classroom for a work-from-home space — one that may or may not have existed pre-pandemic. Carving out a comfortable workstation has perhaps required swapping your stiff dining room chair for an ergonomic office chair or finding a lap desk to upgrade working from your couch or bed.\\n\\nMaybe you've also been thinking about investing in a standing desk or desk converter to counter all those hours of sitting around, save for the occasional food or bathroom break. Not only has sitting for extended periods of time been linked to myriad health concerns, there is also research suggesting standing intermittently throughout the workday could help with productivity.\\n\\nSo which one should you get?\\n\\nWe researched all the best standing desks and converters on the market, ultimately settling on a pool of 11 products to test. We spent many hours assembling those desks, then even more using them in both sitting and standing positions, to determine which ones stood out in terms of function, comfort and build. While it turns out that most products we tested had their merits (scroll all the way down for more on all of the desks we used), we're confident saying the following standing desks are the ones most deserving of your hard-earned dollars:\\n\\nThe ApexDesk Elite Series 60 (starting at $599.99) is a sturdy, gorgeous standing desk available in two desktop sizes, both big enough to accommodate multiple monitors and devices. With a curved front, it's more comfortable to use in both sitting and standing positions compared with the other standing desks we tried, allowing us to sit closer to the desk. It also comes standard with covered grommets to manage your wires.\\n\\nThe Uplift V2-Commercial Standing Desk (starting at $549.99) offers the widest breadth of customization options out of any standing desk we've encountered, from size to finish to keypads — in addition to being a high-quality desk that's bound to look beautiful against any decor scheme.\\n\\nThe SHW Electric Height-Adjustable Computer Desk ($238.87) is a surprisingly functional, sturdy desk at an incredibly affordable price, comparatively. It comes standard with a cable management tray as well as a digital keypad featuring four memory presets, and it was a breeze to assemble.\\n\\nThe Flexispot Height-Adjustable Standing Desk Converter (starting at $99.99) is an excellent converter that's available in several sizes to accommodate a range of workspaces. Both its desktop and keyboard tray provide ample space, and it adjusts with the push of a lever.\\n\\nBest overall standing desk: ApexDesk Elite Series 60 (starting at $599.99 for 60x30; amazon.com)\\n\\nPHOTO: Natasha Hatendi/CNN ApexDesk Elite Series 60\\n\\nLet's get this out of the way: The ApexDesk Elite Series is a stunner. But it's not just pretty — form lends itself to function in this high-quality, exceptionally designed desk.\\n\\nTo be frank, all the electric standing desks we tested within the $500 to $650 starting price range had only minor discrepancies in function and build that we could determine from everyday use. Assembly times and clarity of instructions varied perhaps the most, but in general, they were all sturdy, functional desks that move up and down smoothly and can be programmed to four memory presets. They did vary a bit in terms of the number of components for wire organization and the like, and digital panels differed a bit.\\n\\nBut the ApexDesk's contoured desktop design was one of the many reasons we deemed it the best overall standing desk, especially at its price point and size. The curved design allowed us to sit closer to the desk, lending itself to a more comfortable experience both in standing and sitting positions compared with the other standing desks we tried. Its height is adjustable from 29 to 48 with a simple keypad that features the industry standard four memory presets along with up and down buttons.\\n\\nIt also earned top marks for build quality. The desk can support up to 225 pounds including its desktop. Given that a standard 24-inch monitor is generally no more than 10 pounds and a 16-inch MacBook Pro weighs in under 5 pounds, with a dual-monitor setup you'll be well under the limit and have capacity for plenty other equipment, books and the like. Its sturdiness both from side to side and front to back at all heights was unmatched — we noticed nearly no wobble whatsoever — which was especially impressive given that it isn't designed with a crossbar (a bonus for anyone who enjoys using an under-desk bike). The desktop is designed with two large, covered grommets at the back corners to organize your cords and cables, and an under-desk cable management tray is sold separately.\\n\\nAssembling the desk took some time — a little under an hour — because it arrived in four boxes (including the cable management tray) and has a lot of parts to build. Instructions were clear, and a Phillips screwdriver is needed; it's certainly helpful to have two people tag team assembly, though tackling it solo is doable.\\n\\nWhere the ApexDesk Elite Series lost points was in its LED display keypad, which displays desk height in full-inch increments rather than the 0.1-inch increments we saw on the other electric standing desks we tested at this price point. This means that whether the desk is standing at 40.1 or 40.7 inches high, the display will still read 40. If you're using the memory function to program a preferred height, that precise height you set will be programmed, though the number on the screen may not accurately reflect the height if it isn't a round number. All that to say: It isn't really a detriment to usage and we didn't consider it a deal-breaker by any means.\\n\\nThe desk is available in two sizes, 60x30 and 71x33, both of which provide ample space for two monitors, a laptop, a keyboard and then some. (If you're working with a smaller space that may not easily accommodate a 60-inch desktop, however, we'd recommend our pick for best customizable option, the Uplift, which offers a slew of customizable options, including desktops starting at just 42 wide.) While we were partial to the elegant look of the red apple colorway, the ApexDesk is also offered in six other desktop colors, all constructed of MDF wood: black, white, walnut, light oak, plus teakwood and gray (for the 71-inch desk only). Note that only black and white are currently in stock for the 60-inch desk, but the others will be available in mid-December.\\n\\nWith a two-year warranty on motor and moving parts and a five-year warranty on non-electric parts, the ApexDesk Elite Series is a solid, functional, ergonomic standing desk that will easily become the centerpiece of any room or office space.\\n\\nBest customizable standing desk: Uplift V2-Commercial Standing Desk (starting at $549.99, originally $599.99 for 42x30; upliftdesk.com)\\n\\nPHOTO: Natasha Hatendi/CNN Uplift V2-Commercial Standing Desk\\n\\nThe Uplift V2-Commercial Standing Desk is a handsome desk that we found supremely sturdy, easy to use, relatively straightforward to assemble, and as ergonomic at all heights as any of the other electric standing desks in our pool. When it came to wobble factor, we found it a tad less sturdy than the ApexDesk, particularly at higher heights, but nothing that interfered with our ability to use it comfortably. Where it truly shines, however, is in its many options for customization.\\n\\nWe tested the smallest available desktop size, 42x30, a perfect option for tighter office spaces or cramped city apartments with but a corner to spare. We found it more than comfortable for a monitor and laptop setup, though if you're working with multiple monitors and other equipment, you'll probably want to opt for a larger size. Good news: Uplift's got four more to choose from. The 48x30 will cost you an extra $50, the more standard 60x30 desktop size an extra $110, 72x30 will run you an extra $210, and the massive 80x30 desktop brings you to a total starting price of $849.\\n\\nThen, you've got a staggering 22 desktop finishes to choose from (including a whiteboard option, which could be fun for the kiddos). We tested the walnut laminate, and couldn't be more pleased with its quality and appearance. Solid wood and bamboo options are also available, as well as a contoured shape in four finishes; that will run the price tag up a bit more than the contoured ApexDesk at the same size, which is why the latter ultimately took top honors. You also choose from four finishes for the desk's legs, select the color of the grommets, plus you can add on a power grommet (i.e., one with two outlets) for an additional $39 or add two for $69.\\n\\nAs for the keypad, there are options here too (colors being one of them): The standard desk provides a no-frills keypad with just an up and down arrow. You can upgrade to the advanced comfort keypad — akin to what the ApexDesk comes standard with — or splurge for the advanced paddle keypad, at an extra $59.\\n\\nTo determine the extent of this desk's functionality, we chose the advanced paddle keypad and were wholly impressed by its breadth of features. In addition to displaying heights within 0.1-inch increments, from 22.6 to 48.7, the largest range of all desks we tested, the advanced paddle includes a standing reminder, which can be set to 30-, 60 and 120-minute intervals, plus a child lock feature, the ability to set minimum and maximum heights and, of course, memory presets. We found there is a bit of a learning curve with this keypad. We had some trouble lowering it from an elevated position, resetting it and setting up the memory presets. But after some tinkering and regular use, we did get the hang of it. TL;DR: You'll definitely need to consult the instruction manual for how to use this keypad, and possibly reset it a few times.\\n\\nLike our top pick, the Uplift arrived in four separate boxes, and assembly took nearly an hour due to all the parts required. Note that the instructions provided include those for two different models of the desk, so you'll just want to make sure you follow the instructions for the particular model you've purchased. A Phillips screwdriver is necessary, and again, because of how heavy-duty its parts are, it's definitely helpful to borrow a second set of hands and tackle assembly together. The desk comes standard with two grommets at the back corners as well as a cable management tray, though we found the tray to be a bit flimsy once installed.\\n\\nThe Uplift also comes with one of the best warranties of all the desks we tested, which is 10 years for the frame components, mechanical parts, motors and electrical components, and five years for the desktop.\\n\\nIf you're looking for a top-of-the-line standing desk designed exactly to your specifications that will last years to come, the Uplift V2-Commercial Standing Desk is the desk for you.\\n\\nBest budget electric standing desk: SHW Electric Height-Adjustable Computer Desk ($238.87; amazon.com)\\n\\nPHOTO: Natasha Hatendi/CNN SHW Electric Height-Adjustable Computer Desk\\n\\nIf you're on a tight budget — or you're just looking for a standing desk to use temporarily or infrequently — there is not a better option under $250 than the SHW Electric Height-Adjustable Computer Desk.\\n\\nFirst off, we were surprised by just how sturdy this affordable desk was once assembled, with minimal wobble from front to back and side to side at all heights. Assembly was easy-breezy, clocking it at roughly 25 minutes when all was said and done (note that you'll need a Phillips screwdriver). The desk is lightweight enough to move around a room with one set of hands, and building it solo is more than feasible, even for the furniture-assembly-averse.\\n\\nThis desk comes standard with a digital keypad featuring four memory presets; while programming the memory presets was not as intuitive as it was with some of the other desks we tested, once you know how to do so, it's a breeze. Adjustable from 28 to 46 high in round-number increments (though reflected on the LED screen as 69 to 114, which we can only explain as being a roughly accurate conversion from inches to centimeters), this desk moves smoothly up and down without a hitch. It also comes standard with one small, uncovered grommet at the left back corner as well as an under-desk mesh tray at the front.\\n\\nWe should note that the desktop is actually two planks of wood rather than one solid piece as the product photos may lead you to believe.\\n\\nThis desk efficiently supported our monitor, laptop, books, desk plants and more — including a spry cat frequently jumping on and off of it — without issue. It's offered in just one size, 47.25x24, a bonus for anyone working with limited space for their office setup. The desktop is available in black, oak, light cherry and walnut finishes, and while we found that the black desk easily showed smudges, you get, as they say, what you pay for.\\n\\nWhile a few customer reviews mention the motor slowing down over time, we experienced no such issues; we'll report back and update this piece should we notice any failure in that regard. The desk offers only a one-year warranty, but for an additional $30, an extended three-year warranty will cover any motor issues.\\n\\nSure, it looks and feels a bit cheaper than the $500+ models in our pool, and, well, that's because it is. But if you're looking for the best electric standing desk at an under-$250 price point that's sturdy and easily goes up and down as promised, with presets for multiple users — and particularly if you're a fan of the metric system — you can't go wrong with this SHW desk.\\n\\nBest standing desk converter: Flexispot Height-Adjustable Standing Desk Converter (starting at $99.99 for 28 or 31; amazon.com)\\n\\nPHOTO: Natasha Hatendi/CNN Flexispot Height-Adjustable Standing Desk Converter\\n\\nIf you're in the market for a riser that will convert your standard desk into a standing one, we recommend the Flexispot Height-Adjustable Standing Desk Converter for several reasons.\\n\\nWith a standard converter design, this riser is pretty much ready to be used right out of the box. Assembly only requires attaching the keyboard tray to the desktop, no tools needed. It takes a little maneuvering to align around the preinstalled screws, but within a few minutes we had it ready to roll. At just under 37 pounds, it's lightweight enough to be moved if need be, but we were also impressed by the solid construction, experiencing minimal, if any, wobble while in use. It also arrived with cable ties to help with cord management.\\n\\nThis converter is available in eight widths, from 27 to 47 (you can find the larger models here) to accommodate a variety of workspace sizes. Note, however, that it is only available in black. We tested the 35 model, which can comfortably fit two small monitors, or a monitor and a laptop, and measured the depth of the desktop to be 18.75 and the keyboard tray to be 12. Like any standard riser, a simple lever attached to a hydraulic device is used to raise it up or down, with a maximum height, from top to bottom, of 18.5.\\n\\nThe only place the Flexispot converter lost major points was in ease of adjustments; while it moved smoothly upward with a press of the lever, pushing it back down proved a bit more difficult, and some elbow grease was necessary. For that reason, it might not be the best choice if the intention is to share it between people of varying heights. That caveat aside, we were more than pleased with our experience using this product, which we found ergonomically designed and comfortable to use in every way.\\n\\nThe converter comes with a five-year warranty for the frame and desktop, and a three-year warranty for the gas spring system and other mechanisms, which seems more than fair for such an affordably priced item.\\n\\nHow we tested\\n\\nThe testing process for these desks lasted nearly two months. We unboxed and assembled each desk, paying special attention to the amount of time each unboxing and building process took. We noted how long it took to put each one together, how clear the product's instructions were and if any special tools were needed. Once each electric standing desk was fully built, we used it at both sitting and standing heights; desk converters, of course, were used only in standing positions. We used each product for at least three full workdays and carefully noted how each desk performed in terms of ease of adjustments and ergonomics. Overall, we evaluated them on what we considered the most important factors: function, build and length of warranty. After tallying up scores for each product, we also took value into consideration, factoring the starting price of each desk with regard to the features it delivered on, to determine our final winners.\\n\\nWe broke the testing into the following categories and subcategories:\\n\\nFunction\\n\\nComfort: We made note of whether the desk provided proper ergonomics at all heights, and, where applicable, in both sitting and standing positions.\\n\\nNumber of different height adjustments: We noted the range of heights the desk was capable of reaching.\\n\\nEase of adjustments: We considered how easy it was to adjust the height of the desk, noting how smoothly it was able to move up and down as well as how easy and intuitive the keypad, if there was one, was to operate.\\n\\nSturdiness from front to back: We noted how much the desk wobbled, if it all, from front to back.\\n\\nSturdiness from side to side: We noted how much the desk wobbled, if it all, from side to side.\\n\\nOrganization: We noted if the desk came standard with any slots/grommets to organize wires, cable management trays, extra outlets. etc.\\n\\nBuild\\n\\nBuild quality: We looked at the quality of the desk's materials, assessing whether it felt cheap or flimsy, as well as whether the desktop was prone to scratches and/or smudges.\\n\\nEase of assembly: We considered the time it took to unbox and fully assemble the desk, how clear the instructions were, if any special tools were necessary as well as if the included tools were efficient in the building process.\\n\\nAppearance: We assessed the aesthetics of the desk — how it looked in a room/home office, if it was available in different colors and if so, how many.\\n\\nSize: We noted how much equipment could fit on the desk, how much room it took up and whether it was available in more than one size and if so, how many.\\n\\nWarranty\\n\\nWe looked into the warranty for each product and noted the length of coverage and what parts were covered.\\n\\nHow we rated\\n\\nWe determined a maximum number of points each product could get for every category and subcategory test listed above, including a higher number of overall points for the features we identified as being most important to the experience of using a standing desk.\\n\\nFunction had a maximum of 50 points: comfort (15 points); number of different height adjustments (10 points); ease of adjustments (10 points); sturdiness front to back (5 points); sturdiness from side to side (5 points); organization (5 points).\\n\\nBuild had a maximum of 50 points: build quality (15 points); ease of assembly (10 points); appearance (10 points); size (10 points).\\n\\nWarranty had a maximum of 5 points: under two years (0 points); two to three years (2 points); five or more years (5 points).\\n\\nOther standing desks we tested\\n\\nFully Jarvis EcoTop Standing Desk (starting at $441.15, originally starting at $519 for 30x24; fully.com)\\n\\nPHOTO: Fully Fully Jarvis EcoTop Standing Desk\\n\\nLet it be known that we adored this desk, for myriad reasons. A newer model produced by Fully's Jarvis line, the EcoTop is the brand's most eco-friendly design to date, crafted from locally sourced fiber in Oregon that's a minimum 92% pre-consumer, recycled or recovered, meeting the Eco-Certified Composites (ECC) Sustainability Standard. Beyond this new desktop, it's identical in build and function to the customer-favorite (and also earth-friendly) Jarvis Fully Bamboo Standing Desk — and it's easy to see why it's so beloved. It scored top marks for its range of sitting and standing heights (25.5 to 51.1, the second largest range of all desks we tested, displayed in increments of 0.1) as well as its ease of adjustments, with the industry-standard four memory presets being intuitive to program. This desk felt high-quality — according to Fully, it can support upwards of 350 pounds — though a bit more wobbly from side to side at higher heights than our best overall pick. Similar to the Uplift's warranty, Jarvis desks are covered by an impressive all-inclusive 10-year warranty on all frame components, including motors and electronics, and a five-year warranty on desktop surfaces, excluding normal wear and tear, and damage caused by improper assembly, disassembly or repair.\\n\\nUltimately, this desk lost points when it came to assembly. It was one of the most complicated builds of our pool, taking the most time and clocking in at a bit over an hour; particularly we found that the giant allen key, with prongs of equal lengths, made things clumsy to assemble. While the EcoTop features two uncovered grommets at the back corners for your cables, if you'd like to attach cord organizer, you'll need a power drill to do so, as there are no pre-drilled holes. (We did appreciate that it came packaged with a surge protector, however.) The EcoTop is available in six sizes, and in black and white finishes.\\n\\nThis is a solid desk — and was indeed a solid contender for winner — particularly if you value sustainable, earth-friendly materials.\\n\\nVari Electric Standing Desk (starting at $650 for 60; amazon.com; starting at $550 for 48 and 60 models; officedepot.com)\\n\\nPHOTO: Amazon Vari Electric Standing Desk\\n\\nAnother one of our favorites, the Vari is a classic electric standing desk, and there's a reason — well, many reasons — why you may have seen it in myriad office spaces throughout the country as the standing desk du jour. For one, it's impossibly sturdy, racking up top marks in that category during our testing. And despite its heavyweight build, it was by far the easiest of the non-budget-priced electric standing desks to assemble, taking approximately 20 minutes to do so. The Vari moves up and down smoothly, from a minimum height of 25 to a maximum of 50.2 (the highest maximum height of all desks we tested), and its LED keypad displays increments of 0.1. Programming the four memory presets is easy as pie; we didn't even need to consult an instruction manual for that. And while there wasn't much difference among all our standing desks in terms of motor noise, we'd contend that the Vari was noticeably quieter than the others in our pool. It has a five-year warranty for all components.\\n\\nThe Vari Electric Standing Desk is available in two sizes, 60x30, 48x30 (starting at $550 at Amazon and Office Depot for the latter) as well as five finishes. Really the only place where it lost major points was in the category of organization. It features no grommets to contain wires, but rather a slightly indented back should you want to place it flush against the wall, so you'll still have space for all your cables to comfortably hang; an additional wire tray is sold separately. (We did appreciate the complimentary bag hook that was included with our shipment.) The Vari came in just one point behind our overall winner, the ApexDesk Elite, so suffice it to say that we would recommend this desk in a heartbeat, so long as you can make do with that caveat.\\n\\nReadydesk 2 Adjustable Standing Desk ($154.99; amazon.com)\\n\\nPHOTO: Amazon Readydesk 2 Adjustable Standing Desk\\n\\nWhile we were fans of this converter's artsy, minimalist design, constructed from sustainable birchwood (it just screams Brooklyn architect, does it not?), admittedly we can understand how not everyone might be — and how it may not necessarily vibe with your decor scheme. Aesthetics aside, we appreciated how easily this converter assembles: Literally, it took just five minutes to unbox and slot the shelves into the base, no tools necessary. Because of this, it's a good option for students living in dorms, or anyone else who may be moving around a lot and have minimal desktop space to work with. Disassembling is just as simple if you need to quickly get it out of the way and store it in a corner without taking up much space at all. Despite its lightweight build (it weighs in at less than 15 pounds), we found the Readydesk 2 to be impressively sturdy, both from front to back and side to side. It's also designed with two keyhole-esque slots on each ledge to manage wires. The product has a one-year warranty free of defects in craftsmanship and material and a generous 100-day free return policy in the US.\\n\\nIt fell short in a few categories, however: It's available in just one size and color, and doesn't provide as much room for equipment as other converters in our testing pool did. Its unfinished edges had us worried we might snag the fabric of our sleeve on it (a valid concern among reviewers as well, as we later learned). Because of the lack of grips at the base, depending on the surface beneath it, it could be prone to sliding, although we had no issues in this regard. And, given its unique design, it's not the most ideal product if two or more people of different heights are sharing use of it, as you have remove the piece of wood and manually move it to a different slot if you'd like to change up the adjustments, which is easy enough, but obviously not as simple as raising or lowering a lever.\\n\\nFlexispot Standing Desk 48x30 ($249.99; amazon.com)\\n\\nPHOTO: Amazon Flexispot Standing Desk 48x30\\n\\nThe Flexispot Standing Desk is another budget-priced standing desk model, similar to the SHW. It's available in black, white and mahogany finishes, and while it does look quite sleek, and the desktop is indeed one solid piece rather than two narrow pieces assembled side by side, for the same price as our best budget winner, it comes with some noticeable downfalls. For one, the basic model includes a keypad with only an up and down button; the desk has a standing range from 28–47.6, but in order to know what height you're standing at (if that's important to you), you'll have to tack on another $90 for the standard model, which is 55 long and includes a digital LED keypad with memory presets. There's also a smaller, 42x24 model, for $244.99.\\n\\nWe also noticed significant wobble once fully assembled, mostly from side to side but also from back to front. And on the topic of assembly: this desk arrives in two boxes, both pretty lightweight, but the instructions were confusing at times. A particularly baffling example: One step was to loosen bolts and stretch a rod, but the instructions didn't specify to what length to stretch it. So we guessed, and when it came time to add the desktop, we had to loosen the bolts once again and then measure it to the correct length. Another step also required backtracking and unscrewing screws from a previous step. This desk comes with a five-year warranty for the frame, motor and other mechanisms, and a two-year warranty for the controller and switch, electronics.\\n\\nSeville Classics 27.8 Tilting Sit-Stand Height Adjustable Mobile Laptop Computer Desk Cart with Mouse Side Ergonomic Table ($44.99; homedepot.com)\\n\\nPHOTO: The Home Depot Seville Classics 27.8 Tilting Sit-Stand Height Adjustable Mobile Laptop Computer Desk Cart with Mouse Side Ergonomic Table\\n\\nIf you're looking for a simple sit-stand option with enough room for your laptop and a mouse, and a laptop and a mouse alone, this Seville Classics desk is one worth considering. At just a hair under $50, unsurprisingly, you're not getting a super-sturdy, smart standing desk option — but you are getting a product that gets the job done (the job being: providing the option to stand while at your computer), and on wheels to boot. Assembly was easy enough, as the desk is lightweight, and though the flimsy hexagon key wrench proved a bit difficult to use, we were able to build it in approximately 25 minutes. It comes with a one-year limited warranty.\\n\\nThe desk adjusts from a minimum of 27.9 to a maximum of 40.7, so if you're above, say, 5'9, we can't imagine you'd find this the most ergonomic product to use. We should also note that the desktop's tilt is not adjustable, i.e, you cannot position it parallel with the floor, and the manual twist-lock knob can be a bit annoying to use to make adjustments to heights. Bottom line: If you're on a tight budget and looking for something that'll allow you to take standing breaks from time to time, this is a perfectly adequate solution. It's a desk that's perhaps best suited to students, children, and those with minimal space.\\n\\nVivo Height Adjustable 32-Inch Standing Desk Converter (starting at $119.95; amazon.com)\\n\\nPHOTO: Amazon Vivo Height Adjustable 32-inch Standing Desk Converter\\n\\nThis Vivo converter was quite similar in both build and function to the Flexispot converter. Assembly required only attaching the keyboard tray to the base, which was simple enough, and adjustment is controlled via lever. It's a standard desk riser, and we found its sturdiness to rival Flexispot's as well, but ultimately we didn't select it as a winner for a few reasons: We took value into consideration, and the Vivo is available only in one size, at a starting price of $119.99, versus Flexispot's $99.99 for its 31-inch option. (For $159.99, you can snag the Vivo in light wood or white finishes, or dark wood for $179.99.) The width of both the keyboard and desktop are a bit smaller than the Flexispot converter we tested, at 10 and 15.75, respectively, though it does rise to a maximum height of 19.5, one inch higher than our winning converter does. It comes with two cable clips to stick to the underside of the product, and it has a three-year warranty. If you're seeking a finish that isn't solid black, could make use of another inch of height as a tradeoff for some desktop space, and you're willing to shell out a bit more cash, we think the Vivo is a fine option.\\n\\nErgo Desktop Kangaroo Pro Junior ($399; ergodesktop.com or amazon.com)\\n\\nPHOTO: Walmart Ergo Desktop Kangaroo Pro Junior\\n\\nThis desktop converter is unique in its design, and we appreciated the dual ergonomics at play here: Basically, the desktop work surface and your attached monitor adjust separately, allowing you to customize the setup more so than typically possible with a traditional desk riser. The desktop surface, which measures 24x18 — enough to fit a laptop, or a keyboard and mouse — is adjustable to 14.5 above your desk. You'll have to mount your monitor, and though it took us a bit to figure out the twist-knob situation in order to adjust our monitor, we no sooner got the hang of it. However, we found the removable stabilization leg to, initially, be quite confusing, and ultimately, a crucial design flaw; while the adjustable rod is meant to provide extra stability to your desktop at all heights, we found it difficult to stay put, and ultimately not a reliable source of stability after all. The Kangaroo Pro Junior does, however, take up minimal space, and if you're working with a single monitor and a keyboard, we could see why you might be interested in this product.\\n\\nRead more from CNN Underscored's hands-on testing:"}

This is a choice between right and wrong, justice and injustice. This is about whether we fulfill our sacred duty to the American citizens we serve.\\n\\nHe castigated politicians who have deemed his proposed wall immoral, painting them as hypocrites.\\n\\nThe only thing that is immoral is the politicians to do nothing and to continue to allow more innocent people to be so horribly victimized, he said.\\n\\nAfter weeks of a partial government shutdown, Trump and his negotiators have made little headway in convincing Democrats a barrier is needed before agencies can reopen and federal workers can begin receiving paychecks again.\\n\\nThe administration has steadfastly refused to take steps that would restore funding to some agencies, believing the shutdown is its best leverage to secure the wall funds. Fearing he could lose a messaging battle as more Americans feel the pain of a shuttered government, Trump escalated his warnings that the country is unsafe without the border wall he promised as a candidate.\\n\\nIn making his case, Trump turned for the first time to one of the most recognizable symbols of the American presidency – an eight-minute direct-to-camera evening address from the Oval Office.\\n\\nThe idea for the shift in strategy was raised over the past week by top aides, who believed the administration's messaging was not resonating with Americans. The idea had been championed by, among others, the acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, and was a topic of discussion at a weekend senior staff retreat at Camp David.\\n\\n04:48 - Source: CNN Democratic leaders respond to Trump's address\\n\\nInside the White House, some viewed the quiet week between Christmas and New Year's Day as a lost opportunity that could have been used to drive home an urgent message about the necessity of a border wall while Congress was out of town.\\n\\nTrump was initially resistant, but was convinced by aides to adopt a new approach as it became clear his entreaties about securing funding for a wall were not gaining traction.\\n\\nTrump will continue the push in the following days, paying a visit to the Texas border town of McAllen on Thursday to highlight the situation.\\n\\nOn Wednesday, he'll join Republican senators during their weekly lunch. Later he'll return to the White House to resume talks with Democratic and Republican congressional leaders, though it wasn't yet clear whether either side would come offering new elements of a compromise.\\n\\nThis situation could be resolved in a 45-minute meeting, Trump said in his remarks.\\n\\nWhether the authoritative setting of Tuesday's remarks will convince more Americans there truly is a security crisis at the southern border remains an open question. Trump spoke to Americans while he suffers from a credibility lapse after he and his aides have repeated multiple false claims about immigration.\\n\\nFacts undercut the administration's portrait of a nation under siege by terrorists and criminals crossing the southern border; in July 2017, the State Department said there was no credible information that any member of a terrorist group has traveled through Mexico to gain access to the United States.\\n\\nThe administration's own figures show vastly more known or suspected terrorists were apprehended at airports.\\n\\nTrump and top White House officials have in recent days begun speaking more about the humanitarian crisis at the border, which Democrats say is real but of the administration's own making. A surge of families seeking asylum has strained health and child care facilities, and two children have died in US custody.\\n\\nNational emergency?\\n\\n02:42 - Source: CNN Avlon lays out the facts on border security\\n\\nIn the lead-up to the address, the President and his advisers made a public show of considering a national emergency declaration to secure funding for the border wall, a drastic step that would surely be challenged in court. Vice President Mike Pence refused in a string of morning television appearances to say whether a declaration would come during the evening speech.\\n\\nThe White House counsel's office continues to deliberate on the legality of the step. Trump has been under pressure from informal advisers and allies to take the step, which officials was still possible in the coming days.\\n\\nA source close to Trump told CNN's Jim Acosta on Tuesday that the President has been working the phones seeking advice from friends and aides in recent days about whether he should declare an emergency at the border in order to secure funding for the wall. The source said Trump has been told by several of his allies and advisers that a declaration probably won't work from a legal standpoint, though hasn't ruled one out entirely.\\n\\nAnother adviser to Trump said the President has been receiving advice telling him he should declare the state of emergency so he has something to sell to his base – and that if the step is held up in the courts, Trump can still say he tried.\\n\\nWork in progress\\n\\n02:53 - Source: CNN Brianna Keilar: Trump is pushing lies\\n\\nMidday on Tuesday, Trump was working closely with top aides, including policy adviser Stephen Miller, on drafts of the speech.\\n\\nDemocrats had a chance to rebut the President in a subsequent address on Tuesday; all the television networks that agreed to air Trump's remarks also agreed to air Democrats' response, delivered jointly by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer. The pair stood somewhat awkwardly side-by-side in a Capitol hallway for their five-minute long rebuttal.\\n\\nPresident Trump must stop holding the American people hostage, must stop manufacturing a crisis and must reopen the government, Pelosi said.\\n\\nTrump chose to deliver the address after weekend talks between administration officials and Democrats failed to generate a deal that could reopen the parts of government closed by the shutdown.\\n\\nThe closures have become more apparent this week, as more Americans return from holiday vacations to find some federal services unavailable. Most federal workers affected by the shutdown were due to receive paychecks on Friday; without an agreement, they won't be paid.\\n\\nTrump has insisted in public that unpaid workers are understanding in their plight, and that he feels their pain.\\n\\nBut in private, the President has worried an extended shutdown could erode his political support as more Americans feel the effects.

And last week, he backed off the idea of using U.S. policy on Taiwan as a bargaining chip.\\n\\nBut if he reverts to a more aggressive stance, the result could be a damaging tit-for-tat on trade between Washington and Beijing.\\n\\nI have a general view that a trade war would have no winners, Schoch said, echoing recent comments by President Xi.\\n\\nRelated: Why is Trump backing off his China threats?\\n\\nOne fear is that a spike in tensions could provoke a nationalist backlash, he said, pointing to the anti-Japan protests that erupted in China in 2012 over a territorial dispute. Japanese companies like Toyota were targeted during the demonstrations, some of which turned violent.\\n\\nI don't see that happening, Schoch said. I think Chinese customers think about American companies differently.\\n\\nBut KFC-owner Yum Brands (YUM) and McDonald's (MCD) both said their China businesses suffered last year from anti-U.S. protests over an international tribunal's ruling on territorial issues in the South China Sea.\\n\\nRelated: China hits GM joint venture with $29 billion fine\\n\\nFord's operations in China aren't purely American, though.\\n\\nLike other foreign carmakers, it works with local partners in China.

{"original": "(CNN) Andrew Lu moved to Georgia in 2017. By 2018, he was canvassing for Stacey Abrams' gubernatorial campaign.\\n\\nThe 35-year-old, who was working in Oakland, California, before the move, said he was a registered Republican until his early 20s. But even when he had a change of heart politically, he says he usually didn't vote.\\n\\nThat changed when he came to the East Coast.\\n\\nSince I'm no longer in California, I can't hide behind, 'Oh, it's a blue state,' Lu, who grew up in Los Angeles, said. Now I have to put my words into action.\\n\\nLu is among the hundreds of thousands of Georgia transplants who experts say have played a part in helping shift the state's political demographics -- a shift that made the once Red state a political battleground in 2020. Georgia voted for a Democratic president for the first time in nearly 30 years -- but the win was narrow, with President-elect Joe Biden taking the lead with fewer than 13,000 votes.\\n\\nNow another crucial race -- the US Senate runoffs -- is just days away, since none of the Senate candidates received a majority of the vote in November.\\n\\nNew residents have absolutely played a role, not only in our shifting demographics, but also in what's possible with our politics, and soon with policy, says Nse Ufot, CEO of the New Georgia Project, a nonpartisan voter registration group.\\n\\nThis influx of people coming into our state from not only across the country but across the globe, has only sort of underscored Georgia as this (cosmopolitan) melting pot, gathering place, in the Deep South.\\n\\nGeorgia ranked as the top fifth state to welcome the most newcomers in 2019, according to a US Census Bureau report . More than 50,000 people came from abroad, while thousands relocated from other states, including Florida, Texas, California and New York.\\n\\nIt's worth pointing out the state's flip during the Presidential elections is largely credited to Black women and their years-long efforts to register voters and get them to the polls -- efforts backed by community leaders like Abrams and Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms, among others.\\n\\nNewcomers have been just one part of the equation -- and experts say it's hard to tell just how big of an influence they've had in flipping Georgia.\\n\\nWhat experts do know however, is that many new residents are more likely to vote blue.\\n\\nWe know that the strongest Republican voters are people who've been in Georgia more than 20 years, said Charles Bullock, a political science professor at the University of Georgia in Athens. Individuals who have been in Georgia less time are more likely to be Democratic.\\n\\nWho the newcomers are\\n\\nWhile it's hard to track down who the newcomers are, Bullock says Georgia's voter registration rolls offer clues.\\n\\nWe know that a million new voters registered since 2016, Bullock said, adding that the number doesn't necessarily mean all of those new voters were newcomers, but that number likely also includes new residents.\\n\\nAbout two-thirds of those voters were minorities, he said. Half of them were under 35, Bullock added.\\n\\nWe know that minority group voters are more Democratic than Republican and that young voters are more likely to be Democratic than Republican, he said. So kind of triangulating on all that we can say, 'Okay, the folks who are moving here are bringing not only their furniture with them, but also their partisanship. And a lot of them are bringing Democratic leanings.\\n\\nPeople of color, residents ages 18 to 29 and unmarried women made up a significant part of the state's newcomers over the past decade, according to the New Georgia Project.\\n\\nThe majority of newcomers are Black, Ufot, of the New Georgia Project, said.\\n\\nMany are Black Americans, moving back in a reversal of the Great Migration -- a period roughly between the 1920s and 1970s, where many Black people left the South, fleeing racial violence and seeking better job opportunities.\\n\\nIt is why Black folks in Chicago trace their roots to Mississippi, Black folks in New York and New Jersey trace their roots to the Carolinas and to Georgia, Ufot said. Now those people are ... moving back South or their children are, their descendants are.\\n\\nOthers are African and Caribbean immigrants, who recently became US citizens, she said.\\n\\nBut to be clear, it is not just Black voters, Ufot said. We're also talking about a significant influx of AAPI (Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders) and Latinx Georgians.\\n\\nWith the changes that are taking place, Bullock says the Republican leadership in the state is beginning to awaken to the challenges that they're going to confront.\\n\\nThat with the younger voters, these more diverse ethnically voters, the warning signs are out there that if Republicans don't come up with broader and more encompassing policies, yeah, they may still control the legislature right now ... but their long-term positions are becoming perilous.\\n\\nThere's going to be some serious re-thinking in the leadership of the GOP in terms of how do they want to present themselves.\\n\\nWhy they're coming\\n\\nIn his Southern politics course, Bullock said he no longer divides the region between the Deep South and the Rim South (the peripheral states) for his students, like he used to.\\n\\nNow, what I tell my students is that that no longer really captures things in terms of partisanship, he said. What we talk about now in my class is the growth South versus the stagnant South.\\n\\nGeorgia falls in the former category -- one of several states across the Eastern seaboard, plus Texas -- that are growing and attracting more investment.\\n\\nThe stagnant parts of the South, where people are either leaving or (have) very slow growth, in those areas -- like Alabama, Arkansas, for example -- the Republican party is still growing, as opposed to the Democratic party beginning to stage a comeback, Bullock said.\\n\\nMuch of Georgia's influx is concentrated in and around the metro Atlanta area -- the state's liberal hub. A 2019 US Census Bureau report ranked the area as the fourth fastest growing in the nation between 2010 and 2018 -- with more than 660,000 new residents. It's where Biden's lead surged in November as votes were tabulated.\\n\\nTransplants are coming for all kinds of reasons. Many, like Lu, move because of job opportunities. But it's not just work: the state also offers an attractive housing market and a more affordable lifestyle, dissimilar to other populous areas of the country where the cost of living has skyrocketed.\\n\\nDiana Gu\\n\\nDiana Gu, a 29-year-old originally from Florida, has settled into Atlanta's Old Fourth Ward area in Fulton County -- a heavily blue part of the state -- after hopping around different parts of the country for months at a time to conduct botanical and wildlife research.\\n\\nI wanted to find a full-time job somewhere that was affordable, she said. Somewhere that was more diverse, and somewhere that it felt new, but also homey, I guess. And Atlanta fit all those things.\\n\\nThe booming populations are making a difference.\\n\\nIf you look to see where Democrats are beginning to stage a comeback, well, Virginia is a blue state already, Bullock said. Florida has voted Democrat for president ... three of the last seven elections. North Carolina has a Democratic governor.\\n\\nWhat they care most about\\n\\nNewcomers' priorities, Ufot said, are often no different than what many long-time residents want as well: safe communities, clear air and water, affordable healthcare, access to quality education and reliable transportation.\\n\\nI think A, they want the things that everyone else wants for themselves and their families and B, they're no longer ... interested in any sort of platitudes or excuses about the way things are down here.\\n\\nAnd so it's contributed to a push for accountability from our elected officials.\\n\\nGu said she began getting more involved in elections after the state's jarring 2018 gubernatorial race -- which was riddled with allegations of voter suppression after Democratic candidate Abrams lost to Gov. Brian Kemp by about 55,000 votes.\\n\\nIt was kind of a wake-up call, Gu said.\\n\\nShe estimates that she waited in line about three or four hours to vote back then. She voted again during the Presidential election, and has already cast her ballot for the January senate runoffs.\\n\\nThe past year's harrowing experiences -- everything from the summer's racial unrest to the devastating Covd-19 pandemic -- are still fresh in her mind and issues she cares deeply about.\\n\\nThe first thing on my mind would be police brutality, she said. I don't think I'll ever forget what this past year has felt and looked like in terms of going to protests and just what I saw out there.\\n\\nYoung voters like Gu are energized by similar issues, said Helen Butler, the executive director of the Georgia Coalition for the People's Agenda, a non-profit that works to register and mobilize voters across the state.\\n\\nButler, who's been involved in voter registration efforts for more than two decades, looks at voters based on age demographics, ethnic demographics and gender. She said that the 18 to 35-year-old group this time around played a tremendous role in terms of turnout.\\n\\nThese populations now understand how public policy immediately impacts their lives, she said, in everything from criminal justice, to health care, to schooling. And they have been fueled by the raging pandemic and the demonstrations against police killings, she added.\\n\\nSo I think that really galvanized them to be engaged and really helped change the landscape, she said. Were there new people that were involved? Yes, because I know they're new citizens, especially because we do voter registration and naturalization ceremonies, and you see that they're so enthused about being able to exercise their right to vote for the first time.\\n\\nFor Lu, the stakes are high.\\n\\nIn some cases, his concerns are personal: During his time in Atlanta, he said he grew more passionate about issues like LGBTQ rights, immigration and racial discrimination. He saw first-hand how his wife's wholesale business was affected by the President's trade wars . He says he often finds himself enraged reading news about limits placed on certain minorities , who basically share a similar story to how my parents got here.\\n\\nAnd a former public school student himself, he's also concerned about having a strong schooling system, something he said he wasn't confident about during the Trump administration.\\n\\nIt's like death by a thousand cuts, he said. It does feel like no matter where you go, there's an important issue, and the stakes are always high.\\n\\nIt's that sense of urgency, he said, that drives him to the polls."}

Now, the question is, who in Washington benefits most from the electoral result?\\n\\nLanhee Chen\\n\\nThe simple answer is that moderate US senators on both sides of the aisle are the new power brokers because President-elect Joe Biden will need to work with them to make policy.\\n\\nBecause control of the Senate will hinge on the tie-breaking vote of Vice President-elect Kamala Harris, Democrats cannot afford to lose any votes in their caucus if they want to confirm Biden's nominees for judgeships and positions in the executive branch, or if they hope to pass any major legislation. A few moderate Senate Democrats will therefore find themselves in a position to have significant influence.\\n\\nIf past is prologue, the Democrats who may be in a position to exercise the most influence, given their relatively more moderate voting records in recent years , will include Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Jon Tester of Montana. The support of these Democrats will be essential to Biden and Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer in the same way that the support of moderates has been to passing significant legislation in the past.\\n\\nOne example of this comes from 2010, when Democrats had a much healthier margin in Congress than they have now. Moderate votes were key to passage of the Affordable Care Act. Democratic leaders in Congress and the Obama administration had to grant concessions to moderate Democratic senators in return for their votes in favor of the law.\\n\\nRead More"}

They encouraged states to expand vaccine availability to pharmacies and allow more people to get their shots.

They're below.\\n\\nWINNERS\\n\\n* Pete Buttigieg: The former South Bend, Indiana, mayor proved Tuesday night that he is the best debater in this field. But he also did something more important than that, too: In the first 30 minutes of the debate, Buttigieg showed a competency, steadiness and depth of knowledge coupled with personal experience that should help him pass the commander-in-chief test in the eyes of voters. He spoke forcefully and powerfully about his issues with President Donald Trump's approach to Iran and the need to go back to the drawing board on Congress authorizing the use of military force. It's also worth noting that despite Buttigieg's status as one of the top-tier candidates in the contest, he rarely seems to be on the receiving end of damaging attacks from his opponents.\\n\\n: The Massachusetts senator delivered the line of the night, noting that the four men on the stage had lost 10 races while the two women on stage -- she and Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar -- had never lost a race. And wasn't just a zinger that will be quickly forgotten, either; it's an effective pushback against the idea that she is too liberal to beat Trump. While Warren seemed somewhat shaky during the foreign policy discussion at the start of the debate, she found her way into things when talking about health care -- demonstrating a commitment to aiming big, a contrast between her approach (on everything) and that of Buttigieg and former Vice President Joe Biden.\\n\\n* Amy Klobuchar: The Minnesota senator went into the debate with a simple goal: Cast herself as a pragmatic alternative to voters looking for someone other than Biden (or, to a lesser extent, Buttigieg) to vote for. She, generally speaking, accomplished that goal -- although Klobuchar was less of a standout in this debate than in the last one. (Her inability to remember Kansas Gov.

Also, yes.\\n\\n* Policy: The most common critique of these presidential debates is that the focus is on personalities, not policies. I hope those critics watched Tuesday night's debate.

The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author.\\n\\n(CNN) —\\n\\nOn Wednesday at the PyeongChang Olympics, American snowboarder Shaun White won his third gold medal (and the 100th gold for the US in the Winter Olympics) amidst news of sexual misconduct allegations against him.\\n\\nIf they are true, they should have disqualified him from ever competing in the first place.\\n\\nLena Zawaideh, a woman who played drums in White's band, accused him in 2016 of offenses including texting her pornography, touching her inappropriately and insisting she wear sexually revealing clothes. White admitted sending her text messages but denied other allegations before reportedly reaching a settlement with Zawaideh in 2017. He also claimed that her lawsuit was bogus.\\n\\nKara S. Alaimo\\n\\nAt a press conference Wednesday following White's victory, he said he didn't think the charges would affect his legacy – and while he has since apologized for doing so, he minimized them as gossip. None of the female journalists in the room were called upon to ask questions (though press officials with US Ski & Snowboard are denying allegations that this was deliberate).\\n\\nThe entire episode is a clear example of why the International Olympic Committee's (IOC) policy against sexual misconduct is inadequate.\\n\\nAthletes who commit offenses such as those of which White has been accused should never be allowed to participate in the Olympics. But instead of banning sexual offenders, the IOC abrogates its responsibility by putting national Olympic committees and sports federations in charge of policing abuse.\\n\\nEvery country that takes part in the games has signed a charter that requires the rejection of all forms of harassment and abuse, be it physical, professional or sexual. In November, the IOC launched a toolkit to help organizations develop policies to protect athletes from abuse.\\n\\nBut there are two problems with this approach.\\n\\nWhile the IOC is right to concern itself with the safety of Olympics participants, this focus is too narrow. After the 2016 Rio Olympics – during which two boxers were accused of assaulting housekeepers – the Committee updated its rules on ensuring the safety of athletes and others at the games.\\n\\nThere is now a hotline allowing people to report abuse during the sporting event, a reporting procedure for incidents at the games, and a dedicated IOC Safeguarding Officer. That's all great. But it isn't enough.\\n\\nThe IOC shouldn't merely be concerned with ensuring that athletes don't abuse women at the Olympics. They shouldn't allow athletes who commit abuse anywhere, at any time, to compete.\\n\\nThat's because, according to the IOC, the goal of the Olympic Movement is to contribute to building a peaceful and better world by educating youth through sport practised without discrimination of any kind, in a spirit of friendship, solidarity and fair play.\\n\\nPutting sexual abusers or harassers on pedestals, however, contributes to a more terrible world. Turning such people into idols suggests that sexual misconduct isn't such a big deal and that it's possible to get away with it. That's an unconscionable message to send to people around the world.\\n\\nUltimately, as the organization in charge of the Olympic Games, the IOC should take responsibility for deciding who is in violation of sexual misconduct policies, rather than directing countries and sports leagues to solve the problem. If the IOC sets standards of conduct, then find reasonable evidence that they've been violated, they should be the ones to take action to remove that athlete's privilege of competing.\\n\\nThe IOC should therefore develop a policy disallowing the participation of athletes who are found to have ever committed sexual harassment or abuse.\\n\\nAny athlete participating in the Olympics should have to sign a disclosure form indicating whether they have ever formally been charged with or accused of abuse, including in a lawsuit or through criminal charges. If the answer is yes, the IOC should investigate immediately to determine the validity of the charges.\\n\\nIf an investigation reveals the accusations are valid, the athlete should be automatically disqualified. Questions such as those about the allegations against White shouldn't be considered or addressed only after an athlete has won a medal.\\n\\nGet our free weekly newsletter Sign up for CNN Opinion's new newsletter.\\n\\nJoin us on Twitter and Facebook\\n\\nIn a 2016 statement, the IOC admitted that research on abuse and harassment outside of sport suggests that sport agencies cannot be complacent about this: there is no good reason to suppose that sport is exempt from the ills of wider society.\\n\\nThat's underplaying the IOC's role, too. By shirking responsibility for ensuring that sexual abusers aren't allowed to participate in the games, the IOC is creating an arena in which villains can still be held up to the world as heroes."}

Thank you all!\\n\\nEight members of the manufacturing council had already walked away in recent days, in the wake of Trump's repeated avowal that violence at a rally of white supremacists in Charlottesville was perpetrated by many sides.

It included some of the biggest players in finance and business: JPMorgan (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon, PepsiCo (PEP) CEO Indra Nooyi, General Motors (GM) CEO Mary Barra, and Walmart (WMT) CEO Doug McMillon.

{"original": "Donald Trump bashed Eaton, an industrial conglomerate with its roots in Cleveland, on the campaign trail because it merged with an Irish company a few years ago and then moved its headquarters out of Ohio to Dublin, Ireland.\\n\\nSuch a move allowed Eaton to lower its corporate taxes since Ireland has a much lower corporate tax rate than the U.S. But the company also became a target of Trump during the campaign.\\n\\nYou know our companies are leaving our country, rapidly, rapidly, whether it's Carrier Air Conditioning, whether it's Ford, whether it's Eaton. I was in Cleveland and Eaton Corp., they're leaving, and so many companies are leaving, Trump said during his Super Tuesday speech last March.\\n\\nFrankly, I'm disgusted with it and I'm tired of seeing it and there's no reason for it. It's just gross incompetence at the highest level. We should not allow it to happen, he added.\\n\\nEaton had been domiciled in Cleveland before it bought Ireland's Cooper Industries in 2012. The company was also a target of Trump's opponent Hillary Clinton. She called out Eaton for shutting a factory in Berea, Ohio, which led to the loss of more than 100 jobs.\\n\\nClinton also criticized the company for paying its former CEO Sandy Cutler more than $11 million.\\n\\nPresident Obama also wasn't a fan of deals that let U.S. companies move overseas, a practice called inversions. Obama called inversions unpatriotic and described the practice as insidious.\\n\\nRelated: These are the world's worst tax havens\\n\\nBut Eaton (ETN), which just reported its latest quarterly earnings on Thursday, isn't scared of these political attacks. In an interview with CNNMoney, CEO Craig Arnold defended his company's decision to expand globally.\\n\\nThe U.S. has only 5% of the world's population, said Arnold, who took over last June after Cutler retired. If you take the long-term view, the better growth opportunities lie outside of the U.S. -- despite what may happen in the short-term, Arnold said.\\n\\nArnold added that even if Trump and the Republican-led Congress wind up changing tax laws that would allow U.S. firms to pay a lower rate if they brought back cash overseas to America, he has no plans to move Eaton's headquarters back to Ohio.\\n\\nThe future of U.S. tax policy is a big uncertainty, he said, adding that based on current proposals he's seen, there is no reason to re-invert the company. Plus, we pay taxes on all our U.S. income, he said.\\n\\nArnold said he has not had any discussions with the president or anyone in Trump's administration since the election, but that he is open to having a dialogue -- just like many other businesses have been.\\n\\nAnd Eaton still has a major presence in the U.S. It sells electrical equipment, construction equipment, hydraulics and trucking parts.\\n\\nEaton may not be a household name, per se, but it is no slouch. It just reported annual sales of nearly $20 billion and the company is worth more than $30 billion.\\n\\nThe company also said it was proud of its record on jobs, pointing out that it had about 74,000 workers before the Cooper deal closed in 2012 and now has about 95,000 employees.\\n\\nBut Eaton does not break down where those jobs are. And the company has closed several plants in Iowa, Wisconsin and Ohio during the past few years, like the one in Berea that Clinton cited. In some cases, jobs have been outsourced to Mexico.\\n\\nRelated: 20% of big companies pay zero corporate taxes\\n\\nThat might be problematic for Eaton in the Trump era, especially as Eaton and its competitors try to win various parts of any infrastructure contracts that the government puts up for bidding -- assuming that the stimulus actually makes it through Congress.\\n\\nCould the Trump administration hold back on giving Eaton federal contracts unless it pledges to hire more American workers -- or even move its headquarters back to the U.S.?\\n\\nArnold said he is confident that there will be some form of stimulus -- and that his company would benefit.\\n\\nBut he also said he's a little concerned that investors -- and even companies -- are too optimistic about how much Trump will really be able to boost the economy.\\n\\nWe've spent a lot of time looking at stimulus. But until the reality of this enthusiasm shows up in our order books and our customers buy more, it's hard to predict how much it will impact us, Arnold said.\\n\\nThe industry has been too optimistic in the past. We're not great forecasters, Arnold added. We'll call the turn when we see it."}

Instead of saying thank you to the United States, they chanted 'Death to America.' In fact, they chanted 'Death to America' the day the agreement was signed.

And for those who've been paying attention, the thing China and Iran both have in common is that Trump is doing his best to poke both in the eye.\\n\\nHere's what this all means: Asking Europe to stand by America in its scrap with Iran is asking it to pick a side: does it try to keep its new friends in Beijing and Tehran happy? Or does it stand by its old ally, despite the fact it's led by a man that many European diplomats privately admit is so erratic that he gives them sleepless nights and might not even be in power next year?"}
{"original": "Washington (CNN) US diplomats overseas were told Wednesday to suspend all social media posts given the mob assault on Capitol Hill in Washington, three diplomatic sources tell CNN, a step normally only taken during a terrorist attack or major natural disaster.\\n\\nThe under secretary for public affairs sent a note to US diplomatic posts overseas ordering them to pause any planned context from your social media accounts and remove any scheduled content set for release on Facebook, Hootsuite and Twitter until further notice.\\n\\nThe message, a copy of which was provided to CNN, said planned social media posts from flagship State Department accounts are also being frozen.\\n\\nThe directive came as some of the most shocking scenes in modern American political history played out globally across Twitter streams, Instagram and Facebook posts, and other social media platforms, as lawmakers and reporters inside the besieged Capitol, observers outside it and members of the mob themselves sent real-time updates and mayhem erupted.\\n\\nWith one or two exceptions, State Department accounts fell silent Wednesday, while foreign leaders used social media to share their disgust and sadness, feelings echoed by foreign envoys based in Washington and US diplomats overseas, who struggled to explain the mayhem in the seat of US democracy.\\n\\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo, following the lead of Vice President Mike Pence, Health and Human Secretary Alex Azar and national security adviser Robert O'Brien, used Twitter to condemn the supporters of President Donald Trump who overran and injured police, broke into the Capitol and occupied the Senate chamber as lawmakers were trying to formally mark President-elect Joe Biden's election victory.\\n\\nDisgust and sadness\\n\\nTrump also continued to use social media -- but to defend, address and encourage his supporters, repeating so many lies in one video about the election he lost that Facebook and YouTube took it down.\\n\\nTwitter deleted three of his tweets for repeated and severe violations of our Civic Integrity policy and announced on Wednesday evening that it would freeze the President's account for 12 hours.\\n\\nIn contrast, Pompeo said the actions at the Capitol were unacceptable, O'Brien called them an utter disgrace and Azar said he was disgusted.\\n\\nRetired Gen.

For years, organizations like the Los Angeles Food Policy Council and Hunger Action LA have worked to reform policy that increases access to healthy food.\\n\\nThis has included the Good Food Purchasing Program for schools and the Market Match program, which doubles the value of SNAP vouchers at a farmers market. Both of these organizations provide a model of how to tackle local food inequity.\\n\\nMore recently, LA's burgeoning tech sector has been working to pursue meaningful change and use tech to improve food access.\\n\\nHack For LA convenes coders, designers, entrepreneurs, government agencies and activists to solve the region's biggest civic challenges. It builds community, political will, and software. In that order. Their most recent win is Food Oasis LA (FOLA), a mapping platform similar to Yelp, which simplifies complex data, like where to find the nearest food bank, farmers market or community garden.\\n\\nFOLA serves food seekers, policymakers and nonprofits by simplifying outreach efforts, streamlining food access, and consolidating vital data that indicate where healthy affordable food options are most needed.\\n\\nAs a representative and advocate, I find it both inspiring and effective to team with civic hackers to confront persistent social deficits head-on. Is technology the end-all solution? Absolutely not -- but it's definitely part of it. By taking advantage of these 21st century tools, we're growing a more equitable landscape that will someday serve everyone in our great city -- regardless of their income or zip code.\\n\\nAndrew Douglas is an areawide director for the Downtown Los Angeles Neighborhood Council and co-chairs the Los Angeles Food Policy Council Urban Agriculture Working Group."}

{"original": "(CNN) —\\n\\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer gave the Democrats' response to President Donald Trump's prime-time speech on immigration.\\n\\nRead the full remarks below.\\n\\nSpeaker Pelosi. Good evening. I appreciate the opportunity to speak directly to the American people tonight about how we can end this shutdown and meet the needs of the American people.\\n\\nSadly, much of what we have heard from President Trump throughout this senseless shutdown has been full of misinformation and even malice.\\n\\nThe President has chosen fear. We want to start with the facts.\\n\\nThe fact is: On the very first day of this Congress, House Democrats passed Senate Republican legislation to re-open government and fund smart, effective border security solutions.\\n\\nBut the President is rejecting these bipartisan bills which would re-open government – over his obsession with forcing American taxpayers to waste billions of dollars on an expensive and ineffective wall – a wall he always promised Mexico would pay for!\\n\\nThe fact is: President Trump has chosen to hold hostage critical services for the health, safety and well-being of the American people and withhold the paychecks of 800,000 innocent workers across the nation – many of them veterans.\\n\\nHe promised to keep government shutdown for 'months or years' – no matter whom it hurts. That's just plain wrong.\\n\\nThe fact is: We all agree that we need to secure our borders, while honoring our values: we can build the infrastructure and roads at our ports of entry; we can install new technology to scan cars and trucks for drugs coming into our nation; we can hire the personnel we need to facilitate trade and immigration at the border; and we can fund more innovation to detect unauthorized crossings.\\n\\nThe fact is: the women and children at the border are not a security threat, they are a humanitarian challenge – a challenge that President Trump's own cruel and counterproductive policies have only deepened.\\n\\nAnd the fact is: President Trump must stop holding the American people hostage, must stop manufacturing a crisis, and must re-open the government.\\n\\nThank you.\\n\\nSenator Schumer. Thank you, Speaker Pelosi.\\n\\nMy fellow Americans, we address you tonight for one reason only: the President of the United States – having failed to get Mexico to pay for his ineffective, unnecessary border wall, and unable to convince the Congress or the American people to foot the bill – has shut down the government.\\n\\nAmerican democracy doesn't work that way. We don't govern by temper tantrum. No president should pound the table and demand he gets his way or else the government shuts down, hurting millions of Americans who are treated as leverage.\\n\\nTonight – and throughout this debate and his presidency – President Trump has appealed to fear, not facts. Division, not unity.\\n\\nMake no mistake: Democrats and the President both want stronger border security. However, we sharply disagree with the President about the most effective way to do it.\\n\\nSo, how do we untangle this mess?\\n\\nThere is an obvious solution: separate the shutdown from the arguments over border security. There is bipartisan legislation – supported by Democrats and Republicans – to re-open government while allowing debate over border security to continue.\\n\\nThere is no excuse for hurting millions of Americans over a policy difference. Federal workers are about to miss a paycheck. Some families can't get a mortgage to buy a new home. Farmers and small businesses won't get loans they desperately need.\\n\\nMost presidents have used Oval Office addresses for noble purposes. This president just used the backdrop of the Oval Office to manufacture a crisis, stoke fear, and divert attention from the turmoil in his Administration.\\n\\nMy fellow Americans, there is no challenge so great that our nation cannot rise to meet it. We can re-open the government AND continue to work through disagreements about policy. We can secure our border without an expensive, ineffective wall. And we can welcome legal immigrants and refugees without compromising safety and security.\\n\\nThe symbol of America should be the Statue of Liberty, not a thirty-foot wall.\\n\\nSo our suggestion is a simple one: Mr. President: re-open the government and we can work to resolve our differences over border security. But end this shutdown now.\\n\\nThank you."}

He is a partner in Darr Feedlot, a commercial cattle feeding business, and runs a family cattle business. The views expressed in this commentary are solely his.\\n\\n(CNN) —\\n\\nWith Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe meeting Friday with President Trump, the issue of international trade is once again front and center. And while we'll certainly hear a lot about how various industries are affected by trade, it's important to remember just how important access to international markets is to an often-overlooked sector: American farmers and ranchers.\\n\\nFor example, I'm a fourth-generation cattleman from Elwood, Nebraska, population 707, according to the 2010 census. I'm a partner in Darr Feedlot, a commercial cattle feeding business. My wife, Terri, and I also own and manage a cattle ranch. My son, Andrew, works with his own high-tech animal information company, contributing directly to the rural economy. My daughter, Blair, and her husband own a registered Red Angus herd in Minnesota.\\n\\nPHOTO: courtesy of Craig and Terri Uden Craig and Terri Uden\\n\\nWe – and hundreds of thousands of similar agricultural families – are the real, if often forgotten, American faces of international trade. Now, we don't sell our beef directly to restaurants or butchers in Canada, Japan, or China; we sell to others in the production chain, who then sell a sizeable – and growing – percentage of our high-quality cuts to customers in other countries. But that foreign demand – and the access to the markets where that demand is growing rapidly – means a better life for my family and hundreds of thousands of others just like mine.\\n\\nOver the past few years, politicians across the ideological spectrum have attempted to paint a portrait of how international trade has impacted the typical American worker. By now we're familiar with this portrait: the worker whose factory job disappeared when cheaper labor became available in other countries.\\n\\nTo be sure, many factory workers across rural America and the Rust Belt have lost their jobs in recent years, and the pain they feel is very real. However, recent research, such as a 2016 study by the Center for Business and Economic Research at Ball State University, shows that approximately 85% of the job loss in manufacturing between 2000 and 2010 resulted from technological advances and automation rather than trade.\\n\\nOn the other hand, international trade – especially the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) – has been one of the greatest success stories in the long history of the U.S. beef industry, and for American agricultural families in general. In fact, since NAFTA was implemented in 1993, exports of American-produced beef to Mexico have grown by more than 750%, according to the US Meat Export Federation. In addition, exports now account for as much as 13% of overall U.S. beef production – and it's more likely to be higher-quality cuts that bring in higher revenues for the hundreds of thousands of American families in the beef community.\\n\\nUnfortunately, all the heated campaign-trail rhetoric began to have real-world policy implications on Jan. 23, when President Trump signed an executive order that began the process of withdrawing the United States from the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) – the 12-nation trade deal that would have provided American producers with much greater access along the Pacific Rim.\\n\\nIn fact, American cattle producers are already losing out because we aren't competing on a level playing field with other beef producing nations. Tariffs on American beef into Japan are currently significantly higher than those for imports from Australia. TPP would have put American beef producers on equal footing with Australian producers, but now that competitive disadvantage will remain indefinitely.\\n\\nContrary to much of the rhetoric we've heard in recent years, the more accurate faces of trade in the United States look like the ones in my family, and they're much more likely to be smiling faces than those you might have seen on the campaign trail.\\n\\nGet our free weekly newsletter Sign up for CNN Opinion's new newsletter.\\n\\nJoin us on Twitter and Facebook\\n\\nI understand that foreign trade has been a convenient political punching bag for a long time. But sparking a trade war with Canada, Mexico, and Asia will only lead to higher tariffs (in other words: taxes) on American-produced beef in those markets and put our American producers at a much steeper competitive disadvantage. The fact remains that, according to the Small Business Administration, 96% of the world's consumers live outside the United States, and expanding access to those consumers is the single best thing we can do to help American cattle-producing families like mine be more successful."}

The views expressed here are solely those of the authors.\\n\\n(CNN) —\\n\\nIn 2007, Lance Corporal Maria Lauterbach reported being raped by a fellow Marine. Several months later, he murdered her. During the eight months between Lauterbach's alleged assault and her murder, she was forced to show up to work every day and serve alongside Cesar Laurean, who was convicted of her first-degree murder. According to the Columbus Dispatch, she was denied a request for a base transfer, and according to NBC and others, endured retaliation from peers and superiors, and consistently struggled to find support from a chain of command and system that favored apathy over action.\\n\\nPHOTO: c/o House of Representatives Mike Turner\\n\\nPHOTO: c/o House of Representatives Niki Tsongas\\n\\nThis tragedy brought to light devastating flaws in the military hierarchy and its justice system; flaws that we discovered fueled a predatory culture. But Maria's story, and those of countless other alleged victims of military sexual assault, have also prompted historic changes to military policy (including new procedures for how the Pentagon investigates assault charges, new systems of reporting, and processes to shield victims from retaliation after reporting) and continue to influence the sustained push to change military culture for the better.\\n\\nFor the better part of a decade, we have worked with the military to identify root causes and institute safeguards that prevent sexual harassment and sexual assault and increase support for survivors.\\n\\nBut the organizational failures at the root of sexual harassment and assault are not unique to the military. Leaders abusing their authority; cultures that frequently close ranks to prevent negative attention; victims suffering retaliation; assailants protected by their colleagues; lack of institutional support; unclear or obstructed paths to justice – these are the same shortcomings now being revealed across industries, from entertainment to education; media to Congress. Sexual harassment and sexual assault in professional workplaces is widespread in America – but there are positive steps we can take.\\n\\nWhile not an apples-to-apples comparison, many of the systemic changes instituted over the past decade within the military can be translated to the civilian sector.\\n\\nThrough our bipartisan work, victims of military sexual crimes now have a right to legal assistance through the military's successful Special Victim's Counsel Program. Military personnel are required to complete anonymous climate surveys to better assess the prevalence of sexually-charged issues. Victims of sexual assault may also now request an expedited transfer to another workplace.\\n\\nConviction of sexual assault in the military now requires automatic processing for dishonorable discharge. These major changes have had positive results for survivors and the military climate as a whole.\\n\\nFor example, according to a military-wide survey conducted by the Defense Department's Office of People Analytics, 78% of victims who made reports were satisfied with their Special Victims' Counsel/Victims' Legal Counsel during the military justice process.\\n\\nSimilarly, private entities should, if victims request it, be encouraged to provide alternate places of work immediately to victims of sexual harassment or sexual assault. Responsible employers ought to provide victims no-cost legal support – you should not suffer financial hardship because you endured sexual harassment at work. Regular, anonymous climate surveys are useful tools every industry should adopt to determine the prevalence of harassment. And private institutions should clearly outline the professional consequences of sexually inappropriate or illegal behavior in the workplace.\\n\\nWhile every institution must wrestle with how best to change its culture and do right by victims, the fight against sexual assault in the military has imparted lessons and created tools that have broader applicability.\\n\\nA military unit succeeds or fails based on its members' ability to trust and cooperate with the women and men standing beside them. As we look around the halls of Capitol Hill, there are places where our culture trends toward insularity over transparency. But, like in the military, trust is essential between members, staff and all those involved in making our government run.\\n\\nWhich is why Congress, in particular, has an opportunity to set a powerful example by implementing quick and effective changes, and there are bipartisan efforts already underway to do so. We co-sponsored H.R. 4396, the ME TOO Congress Act, which incorporates many of the aforementioned military-specific recommendations, including victims' counsel, increased training, climate surveys, and enhanced responsibilities and authorities for the Congressional Office of Compliance to investigate sexual harassment and assault claims. This bill is an important next step now that Congress has mandated sexual harassment training for all members and staff.\\n\\nGet our free weekly newsletter Sign up for CNN Opinion's new newsletter.\\n\\nJoin us on Twitter and Facebook\\n\\nMilitary sexual assault is far from a solved crisis and we have much more work to do to change the military culture that has enabled these crimes for too long. But systemic changes in the military have had an impact and can also serve as a model for how broader society moves forward from this watershed moment."}

The gallery is part of Design Society, a much larger arts-and-culture district emerging in the Shekou Peninsula, in western Shenzhen.\\n\\nRunning through August 2019, the opening Values of Design exhibition will explore the influence of design on culture both in Shenzhen and around the world.\\n\\nWell before international names began moving in, Shenzhen already dedicated 37 acres of urban area to the OCT Loft (Kaiping St, HuaQiaoCheng, Nanshan Qu, Shenzhen Shi, Guangdong Sheng), just east of Happy Valley theme park (but a world away).\\n\\nEvolved from a defunct factory zone, the creative culture park comprises leafy lanes and open squares with exhibition spaces, large-scale installations and alfresco coffee shops.\\n\\nIt's an idyllic enclave for wandering through the gardens or catching a bout of live music at one of the stylish bars.

Chuck Hagel of Nebraska described the move as the most dangerous foreign policy blunder in this country since Vietnam, if it's carried out.\\n\\nI will resist it, he said.\\n\\nHagel's comments sparked applause from the Senate gallery, where lawmakers were engaged in a heated debate with Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, who came to Capitol Hill to answer questions about the president's new strategy for Iraq.\\n\\nThe fundamental question the American people and, I think, every senator on this panel -- Republican and Democrat -- are having to face now is: At what point do we say 'enough?'  Democrat Sen. Barack Obama of Illinois asked Rice.\\n\\nWhat leverage do we have that would provide us some assurance that six months from now, you will not be sitting before us again saying, 'Well, it didn't work?' \\n\\nRice replied, The leverage is, we're not going to stay married to a plan that's not working in Baghdad.\\n\\nAnd she assured skeptical senators that Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki is up to the challenges he faces.\\n\\nDemocrat Russ Feingold of Wisconsin so far is the only senator to suggest that Congress cut off funds for the war and force the withdrawal of U.S. troops.\\n\\nSenate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada, however, has said he intends to introduce a largely symbolic resolution next week expressing opposition to Bush's plan.

He has not said whether he has the votes to do so.\\n\\nSen. Barbara Boxer of California took the opportunity to point out that Rice, with no children of her own, will not feel the loss of a son or daughter in Iraq.\\n\\nWho pays the price? Boxer asked Rice. I'm not going to pay a personal price. My kids are too old and my grandchild is too young. You're not going to pay a personal price, as I understand it, with an immediate family. So who pays the price? The American military and their families ... not me, not you.\\n\\nRice replied: I fully understand the sacrifice that the American people are making, and especially the sacrifice that our soldiers are making, men and women in uniform. I visit them. I know what they're going through. I talk to their families. I see it.\\n\\nBoxer interrupted: Madam Secretary, please. I know you feel terrible about it. That's not the point. I was making the case as to who pays the price for your decisions.\\n\\nAnd the fact that this administration would move forward with this escalation with no clue as to the further price that we're going to pay militarily ... I find really appalling.\\n\\nRepublican Sen. John McCain of Arizona, a strong proponent of sending more troops to win the war in Iraq, has said it would be within Congress' rights to outline how the conflict is funded.\\n\\nBut he also said he'd like to give this new strategy a chance to succeed. (Watch how corruption is making war pricier )\\n\\nI believe that, under the Constitution, Congress has the right to cut off funding. They did that during the Vietnam War, said McCain, who was a prisoner of war during that conflict. I also believe that if that vote is successful, then those who were the proponents of it then assume the consequences of failure.\\n\\nDemocratic Sen. Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts said he was introducing legislation to curtail the president's ability to deploy troops and dispense funding.\\n\\nKennedy said the bill states that no additional troops can be sent and no additional dollars can be spent on such an escalation unless and until Congress approves the president's plan."}

Obama said the pact didn't reflect a shift in U.S. allegiances, however, citing longstanding efforts to bolster the security of Middle East allies.\\n\\nThe fact of the matter is friendship and cooperation between the United States and Gulf countries has been consistent for decades, Obama said following a day of talks at the ornate Diriyah Palace in Riyadh. He cited ongoing efforts to battle ISIS and install a functioning government in Libya as examples of current areas of agreement.\\n\\nBut he acknowledged tactical differences in dealing with Iran, which the Sunni Gulf nations are carefully monitoring as Western sanctions are eased.\\n\\nWe have to be effective in our defenses and hold Iran to account when it's acting in ways that are contrary to international rules and norms, Obama said, adding that it was also important to engage the moderate elements of Iran's government to produce deals like the nuclear accord.\\n\\nRELATED: Obama looks for allies' support on ISIS as ties and nerves fray\\n\\nObama spent Thursday working to persuade other Gulf leaders to take a more muscular role in stabilizing their region.\\n\\nHe pressed the various kings, emirs and sultans of Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Oman, Bahrain and Qatar to provide more support to war-torn Iraq as a U.S.-backed coalition takes back ground from ISIS. He also worked to convince leaders to provide more resources to opposition fighters in Syria, and to lend firmer backing to a political transition process in the civil war-torn country.\\n\\nHe said after his meetings that he shared the Gulf leaders worries' about the government of Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi, citing significant disputes among the country's Shiite political blocs.\\n\\nI'm concerned. I think Prime Minister Abadi has been a good partner for us, Obama said. Ultimately it's up to Iraqis to make decisions.\\n\\nSaying he's secured commitments from the assembled leaders to step up assistance to Iraq, Obama said it was too soon to tell where those new resources would be used.\\n\\nThursday morning Obama met individually with the leaders of Kuwait and Qatar to make his case, the White House said, followed by a series of group meetings. But in both his bilateral talks and in the larger sessions, Obama faced the same skepticism that has clouded ties between Washington and Riyadh: fears over a resurgent Iran, doubts at Obama's Syria strategy and differences in fighting terror.\\n\\nThree sessions\\n\\nObama's schedule at the Gulf Cooperation Council summit was broken into three sessions Thursday, with the first focused on stabilizing regional conflicts. U.S. officials said that discussion included Yemen, where a fragile ceasefire between the government and Iran-backed rebels hasn't stalled fighting; and Libya, where a power vacuum has led to an inflow of ISIS militants.\\n\\nI think there's broad agreement on where we're trying to go in the region, Obama's deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes told reporters Thursday. People would like to see stability restored to Yemen and a political transition in Syria away from (President Bashar al-) Assad, and people would like to see Iraq maintain its unity and increase its stability. On the core issues there's agreement on where we want to go.\\n\\nBut Rhodes acknowledged there have been occasional tactical differences on what we are emphasizing at any point of time.\\n\\nThe President and the Gulf leaders also convened two other separate sessions, one focused on fighting terror and another on Iran, whose moves following the easing of Western sanctions are being closely monitored by its Arab Gulf neighbors.\\n\\nObama departed Riyadh soon after his meetings ended for a three-night stay in London.\\n\\nSaudis' wary eye\\n\\nObama arrived for his brief visit to the Saudi kingdom Wednesday, looking to overcome a strain in ties between Riyadh and Washington.\\n\\nAside from fears over the Iran deal, the Saudis are anxiously eyeing Obama's decision on declassifying pages that could shed light on the country's hand in the September 11 terror attacks. They're also monitoring U.S. efforts to combat ISIS in Iraq and Syria with some degree of doubt.\\n\\nRELATED: White House threatens to veto 9/11 lawsuit bill\\n\\nOfficials here also balked at Obama's suggestion in a recent magazine interview that the kingdom wasn't pulling its weight in global military efforts.\\n\\nEmerging from a two-and-a-half hour meeting between Obama and Salman, U.S. officials described a productive session they claimed reduced some of the awkwardness that had seeped into the bilateral relationship. One official said Obama really cleared the air with Salman during their talks at the Erga Palace in Riyadh.\\n\\nWhile Saudi officials have recently threatened to withdraw assets from the United States if pending legislation allowing families of September 11 victims to sue foreign governments, that topic did not arise during Obama's meeting with the monarch.\\n\\nU.S. to Gulf nations: Do more\\n\\nIn parallel meetings this week, U.S. Defense Secretary Ash Carter has pressed his Gulf nation counterparts to step up their assistance to Iraq, where a U.S.-backed government is still struggling to rebuild after years of war and invasion of certain regions by ISIS.\\n\\nCarter said during a news conference he encouraged Sunni-majority Gulf nations to do more … not only militarily, as Saudi Arabia and the UAE have been doing – and I really appreciate that – but also politically and economically.\\n\\nSunni support for multisectarian governance and reconstruction, particularly in Sunni areas of Iraq, will both be critical to ensuring that ISIL stays defeated, Carter said, using the administration's term for ISIS.\\n\\nOPINION: U.S. and Saudi Arabia, trapped in a bad marriage\\n\\nIn particular, American officials have pressed Gulf nations to help rebuild areas of Iraq previously held by ISIS, including areas of Anbar province. Obama often touts successes on the ground in Iraq and Syria as evidence of a successful anti-ISIS campaign, but officials worry that retaken ground could be lost without an influx of resources.\\n\\nIn a meeting with Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan late Wednesday, Obama reiterated the importance of stabilizing areas of Iraq liberated from ISIL, according to the White House.\\n\\nThe pair also discussed Libya and the fragile ceasefire in Yemen. U.S. officials hope that an end to fighting there will free up Gulf nation resources to go after ISIS more aggressively.\\n\\nOpinion: How art can help diffuse Middle East tensions\\n\\nRegional conflicts\\n\\nThe GCC meetings are a follow-up to a summit convened at Camp David last year, which was meant to reassure U.S. allies amid final negotiations over the Iran nuclear deal. In both his talks with Salman and the Abu Dhabi crown prince, Obama sought to underscore the U.S. commitment to regional stability while encouraging a new relationship with Iran.\\n\\nThis conflict between the GCC and particularly between Saudi Arabia and Iran, it fuels chaos, sectarianism, and instability in the region, all of which help ISIL and other terrorist groups, said Rob Malley, Obama's coordinator for Middle East policy, using a different term for ISIS. It's clear who our allies and who our partners are. But if there could be a different relationship between the GCC and Iran, one that is less prone to fuel proxy wars. It's our conviction, and certainly the President's conviction, that that would be good for the region."}

{"original": "Washington (CNN) The Trump administration will designate Yemen's Houthi rebels as a foreign terrorist organization in a move that diplomats, members of Congress and international aid groups fear could further inflame the situation on the ground, upend UN peace talks, and exacerbate the country's humanitarian crisis.\\n\\nIn a statement released just before midnight Sunday, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said that the State Department would notify Congress of its intent to designate the group as a foreign terrorist organization as well as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist entity. Pompeo said he also intends to designate three of the group's leaders -- Abdul Malik al-Houthi, Abd al-Khaliq Badr al-Din al-Houthi and Abdullah Yahya al Hakim -- as specially designated global terrorists.\\n\\nThese designations will provide additional tools to confront terrorist activity and terrorism by Ansarallah, a deadly Iran-backed militia group in the Gulf region, Pompeo said. The designations are intended to hold Ansarallah (the Houthi rebels) accountable for its terrorist acts, including cross-border attacks threatening civilian populations, infrastructure, and commercial shipping.\\n\\nYemen has been embroiled in a years-long civil war that has pitted a coalition backed by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates against the Iran-backed Houthi rebels, a Shia political and military organization from the north of Yemen. The conflict has cost thousands of civilian lives and plunged the country into a humanitarian crisis.\\n\\nThe group's leadership condemned the designations, which were praised by Yemen's Saudi-backed government. The news was also welcomed by the Saudi and Emirati governments -- some sources believe that the designation was a parting gift to Riyadh and Abu Dhabi.\\n\\nThe foreign terrorist designation will go into effect on January 19, just a day before the administration leaves office.\\n\\n'A big mistake'\\n\\nIt's a big mistake, said former US Ambassador to Yemen Gerald Feierstein. It mostly is a problem for the US government more than for the Houthis.\\n\\nThe Houthis will be more or less unaffected by this. Obviously, Iran doesn't care whether we designate the Houthis as a terrorist organization or not, he told CNN Monday. But it does make it much more complicated for the US government to play a positive role in helping to resolve the conflict.\\n\\nThe move was rebuked by Democratic and Republican lawmakers. Democratic House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Gregory Meeks called the designation short-sighted and accused the administration of politicizing sanctions authorities. Republican Sen. Todd Young said it comes at the worst possible time as it will prevent the critical delivery of food, medical supplies, and other items necessary to combat both COVID-19 and famine.\\n\\nThe top Republicans on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and House Foreign Affairs Committee, Sen. Jim Risch and Rep. Michael McCaul, said in a joint statement they fully support efforts to compel the Houthis to end their dangerous and destabilizing behavior but are concerned designating them as a Foreign Terrorist Organization, without mitigation measures in place, will have devastating humanitarian impacts.\\n\\nOne congressional aide said that a Monday call with State Department officials about the action was an absolute dumpster fire and that the designation appeared rushed out without proper assurances that it wouldn't do significant damage to the ability to deliver crucial outside humanitarian assistance to the war-torn country.\\n\\nA State Department spokesperson told CNN they don't comment on internal deliberations or our conversations with Congress.\\n\\nThe United Nations warned in December that the number of people facing catastrophic food insecurity could triple in the first six months of 2021, and the opportunity to prevent famine in Yemen is slipping away with every day that passes, in the words of the World Food Programme executive director.\\n\\nPompeo said in the statement that the United States is planning to put in place measures to reduce their impact on certain humanitarian activity and imports into Yemen.\\n\\nWe have expressed our readiness to work with relevant officials at the United Nations, with international and non-governmental organizations, and other international donors to address these implications, he said.\\n\\nA UN spokesperson said they are studying the announcement closely to assess its potential impact. But the decision is likely to have serious humanitarian and political repercussions.\\n\\n'Pure diplomatic vandalism'\\n\\nInternational aid groups swiftly condemned the 11th hour move.\\n\\nThe head of the International Rescue Committee called the decision pure diplomatic vandalism.\\n\\nThis policy, in the name of tying up the Houthis, will actually tie up the aid community and international diplomacy. The opposite is needed -- effective pressure on all parties to the conflict to cease using civilians as hostages in their war games, David Miliband said. The further immiseration of Yemenis, which will be the product of this policy, is a disgrace to the name of the US, and will have the perverse result of strengthening precisely the forces it claims to oppose.\\n\\nMercy Corps CEO Tjada D'Oyen said the Trump administration's designation of the Houthis as a foreign terrorist organization will undermine the overstretched humanitarian response in Yemen, threatening the lives of millions of Yemenis who rely on humanitarian assistance.\\n\\nOXFAM America's humanitarian policy lead, Scott Paul, said this dangerous policy will put innocent lives at risk.\\n\\nThe Norwegian Refugee Council said the sanctions will hamstring the ability of aid agencies to respond, and without additional safeguards and broader exemptions for the commercial sector, Yemen's faltering economy will be dealt a further devastating blow.\\n\\nGetting food and medicine into Yemen -- a country 80% dependent on imports -- will become even more difficult, NRC Yemen Country Director Mohamed Abdi said in a statement on Monday. We are calling on the US government to provide unambiguous safeguards and guarantees so that humanitarian aid can still be delivered without delays and across conflict territories regardless of who is in control, and protect aid workers from being criminalized.\\n\\nEven if humanitarian organizations are able to continue to operate in the country, a source familiar with the situation noted that it could deter the shippers who bring affordable food to the population in Houthi-controlled areas of the country, as the rebels control the docks and customs in the key port city of Hodeidah.\\n\\nThey provide food to 15 million people who are now one step closer to famine because of this, this source said.\\n\\nBiden's ability to reverse the decision\\n\\nSome of the organizations called on President-elect Joe Biden to reverse the decision, with Paul of OXFAM saying, in this instance, acting 'on day one' cannot be only a figure of speech, as lives hang in the balance.\\n\\nFeierstein, the former US ambassador to Yemen who also worked on counterterrorism issues at the State Department, said that while bureaucratically it is possible for Biden to reverse the foreign terrorist organization designation, it is also a question of politics and bandwidth.\\n\\nYou have the Trump administration saying these people are terrorists.

Matheswaran, a retired Indian Air Force marshal who previously commanded forces in India's northeast, China's J-11 fighter jets have been in use for at least five years in the Tibetan area, and therefore the timing of the media report may be viewed as a hint.\\n\\nIt's not India threatening China, it's that they're threatening India, said Matheswaran. I don't think India has the force size to threaten China at the moment.\\n\\nThe J-11 jets are China's answer to India's Sukhoi-30 fighters, which are Russian in origin. While the Chinese report claims the J-11 are 3.5 generation jets and outclass India's third generation jets, Matheswaran said that both sides are in actual fact operating fourth-generation jets.\\n\\nEarlier this month, China announced its newest domestic stealth fighter jet, the fourth-generation J-20, was combat ready.\\n\\nSeen as China's answer to US F-22 and F-35 stealth fighter jets, the J-20 is intended to improve the air force's overall fighting ability.\\n\\nA spokesperson for India's Ministry of External Affairs declined to comment on the report, saying they only comment on official statements from the Chinese government.\\n\\nTerritorial flare-ups\\n\\nThe newest media reports are just the latest step in a decades-long contest between the two rivals for dominance in South Asia, and come at a time of steadily deteriorating ties, say analysts, who point to Chinese investment in countries in the Indian Ocean like the Maldives and Sri Lanka, and Chinese frustration with India's unwillingness to join its One Belt One Road (OBOR) development initiative as recent points of contention.\\n\\nIn 2017, the two countries were involved in a tense months-long border dispute in Doklam – a thin strip of land bordering both countries and Bhutan – in the Himalayas. Though not a part of Indian territory, the area is close to the chicken's neck, a strategic corridor that serves as a vital artery between Delhi and its far northeastern states.\\n\\nThe stand-off was sparked after Bhutan accused China of constructing a road inside its territory in direct violation of treaty obligations.

{"original": "Senate TV\\n\\nRep. Sylvia Garcia, one of the House impeachment managers, raised and then debunked the theory that President Trump says is at the heart of his efforts in Ukraine.\\n\\nOn the July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, Trump asked Zelensky to do him a favor and look into, among other things, potential interference in the 2016 election and Vice President Joe Biden.\\n\\nAs the theory goes, said Garcia, Vice President Biden tried to remove Ukraine's prosecutor all to make sure the prosecutor wouldn't investigate that specific company Burisma because, again, his son was on the board. Then senators, if that doesn't sound far-fetched and complicated to you, it should.\\n\\nIn breaking down the theory, Garcia noted that when Hunter Biden joined the board of Burisma in 2014, its owner was under investigation. The following year, Victor Shokin became Ukraine's prosecutor general.\\n\\nLater in 2015, Biden publicly called for Shokin's removal. But as Garcia noted on Thursday, Biden was not alone in trying to get Shokin fired at the time.\\n\\nLet's be very, very clear, Garcia said. Vice President Biden called for the removal of this prosecutor at the official direction of US policy because the prosecutor was widely perceived as corrupt and with the support of all of our international allies, his actions were therefore supported by the executive branch, Congress, and the international community.\\n\\nFurthermore, when Biden called for Shokin's removal, the case against Burisma was no longer active, Garcia noted.\\n\\nAlthough Shokin vowed to keep investigating Burisma amid an international push to root out corruption in Ukraine, he allowed the Burisma investigation to go dormant, Garcia said. That is when he was removed. He was not actively investigating Burisma.\\n\\nGarcia's assertions are supported by Shokin's deputy prosecutor, Vitaliy Kaso, who resigned in February 2016, a month before Shokin himself was fired. Kasko told Bloomberg that the case against Burisma was dormant by the time Shokin was removed, saying There was no pressure from anyone from the US to close cases against Zlochevsky. It was shelved by Ukrainian prosecutors in 2014 and through 2015.\\n\\nYou can read more about this here."}
{"original": "The Federal Reserve's regulatory czar departs Wednesday, potentially clearing a path for President Trump to loosen the rules governing Wall Street.\\n\\nBut before Daniel Tarullo walks out the door of the U.S. central bank, he has some parting advice for the Trump administration: Leave Dodd-Frank alone.\\n\\nIn his final speech at Princeton University on Tuesday, the outgoing Fed governor objected to efforts by the White House and Congress to weaken the rules that regulate the country's banks, making the case that American taxpayers shouldn't bear the risk of fewer safeguards protecting the financial system.\\n\\nTarullo said it's crucial that banks continue to maintain strong capital, especially the largest banks.\\n\\nNeither regulators nor legislators should agree to change that would effectively weaken that regime, whether directly or indirectly, said Tarullo in prepared remarks. It would be tragic if the lessons of the financial crisis were forgotten so quickly.\\n\\nAppointed by President Obama in 2009, Tarullo is the Fed's key voice on bank supervision.\\n\\nFor the past eight years, the 64-year old Massachusetts native has spearheaded efforts to impose tighter restrictions on U.S. banks in order to avert a repeat of the 2008 financial crisis. He led the charge in requiring banks to undergo a yearly stress test to ensure firms can continue to lend even at the brink of a meltdown. He's also pressed for the biggest U.S. banks to hold higher amounts of better quality capital.\\n\\nRelated: Tough federal bank regulator calls it quits\\n\\nWall Street has often depicted Tarullo as a tyrant, arguing tougher rules have crimped lending and stifled economic growth. Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein and JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon have been pushing for changes for years, arguing the industry has been too constrained by the 2010 regulatory reform law.\\n\\nBut Tarullo has stood firm.\\n\\nEight years at the Federal Reserve has only reinforced my belief that strong capital requirements are central to a safe and stable financial system, said Tarullo.\\n\\nRaised in Woburn, Massachusetts, Tarullo grew up in a predominantly Italian and Irish middle-class suburb of Boston and graduated from Roxbury Latin School in 1969. He attended Georgetown University and went on to receive a law degree from the University of Michigan.\\n\\nIn 1981, he paused his law practice in Washington to teach at Harvard Law School. He later returned to D.C. to advise Senator Edward Kennedy on employment and labor market issues and would later work in the Clinton White House in various economic policy roles.\\n\\nA pivotal moment in Tarullo's career came as he was getting ready to leave the Clinton White House. Discussions were beginning about crafting a bill that would replace the Glass-Steagall Act, a Depression-era law separating commercial and investment banks. It was then that he began to worry about how the financial industry was being regulated. His intellectual curiosity shifted to bank capital: the only regulatory instrument he believed policymakers had control over. It would become the focus of his work at Georgetown and the subject of his book.\\n\\nIn 2005, Tarullo met then-Illinois Senator Barack Obama at an informal policy dinner, and gradually became an important resource for the campaign's policy staff as it became clear a full blown financial crisis was imminent. Tarullo's influence would help shape one of the two speeches Obama would give days after the 2008 collapse of Bear Sterns -- laying the groundwork for what eventually would become Dodd-Frank.\\n\\nAfter helping to lead the new president's economic transition team, Obama nominated Tarullo to a 14-year term as a member of the board of governors. In May 2009, just months after arriving at the Fed, he would play an instrumental role in the first round of stress tests conducted on the largest U.S. banks. Tarullo then argued that the Fed should release the results to the public to allay market fears of how badly the banks were faring at the time. It was a risky and controversial decision, but it laid the groundwork for the Fed's annual stress tests.\\n\\nThe quick action in assessing the firms, recapitalizing them where needed, and sharing the results of the stress tests with the public stands as one of the turning points in the crisis, Tarullo said, recollecting that first trial.\\n\\nRelated: Get ready for Trump's team of Wall Street watchdogs\\n\\nTarullo's departure Wednesday will give Trump, who has called the Dodd-Frank reform of Wall Street a disaster, greater rein to fill the vacancy with an official who will offer a lighter touch when it comes to overseeing the banks. In addition to Tarullo's seat, Trump will also have the chance to fill two other vacancies on the board, along with one more early next year when Janet Yellen's term as chairwoman expires.\\n\\nBut Karen Shaw Petrou, a managing partner at policy analysis firm Federal Financial Analytics, said any proposed changes would stop short of a complete overhaul.\\n\\nEven if the Trump administration's appointees to the Fed seek to dismantle much of this -- and I suspect they will -- change will take time and only partially restructure the rules that have totally redefined American finance, Petrou told CNNMoney.\\n\\nIn February, Trump signed an executive order, setting into motion the administration's game plan for scaling back what he views as overly burdensome financial rules. Trump's order for a regulatory review won't roll back regulations by itself. Congress will need to approve some policy changes, while others will need to be implemented by financial regulators the president hasn't appointed yet.\\n\\nStill, that hasn't kept the president from repeating his campaign promise to dismantle the reform law.\\n\\nWe're going to do a very major haircut on Dodd-Frank, said Trump at a town hall with CEOs, including Citigroup (C) boss Michael Corbat.\\n\\nWe want strong restrictions. We want strong regulation, but not regulation that makes it impossible for the banks to loan to people that are going to create jobs, Trump continued.\\n\\nRelated: Democrats seek probe over weakening SEC's subpoena\\n\\nThe Trump administration has singled out one provision of Dodd-Frank: the Volcker Rule, which bans the largest banks from taking bets with taxpayer money as a target. Two other potential marks: the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and a requirement that advisers on retirement accounts work in the best interest of their clients.\\n\\nOn Tuesday, Tarullo agreed there's room for change on certain aspects of the reform law, including the Volcker Rule, which he said may be too complicated. He said he also supported lifting the asset threshold of $50 billion, which triggers whether banks face tougher restrictions. For several years, Tarullo has endorsed raising the threshold significantly and exempting community banks from some of the rules under Dodd-Frank.\\n\\nAnd while there's room for debate, Tarullo said critical aspects of the reform law, particularly stress tests, should not be altered.\\n\\nHe said proposals to remove the Fed's ability to approve a bank's payout to shareholders based on the results of their stress test were ill-advised. Tarullo also strongly advised against giving banks deeper instructions on the annual exam to avoid firms from gaming the system.\\n\\nThe Fed governor hasn't announced what his next role will be. For now, he'll return to Boston for several weeks as a distinguished fellow at MIT's Golub Center for Finance and Policy.\\n\\nIn the meantime, his legacy hangs in the balance as proposed changes surface.\\n\\nWe're going to have to wait-and-see what changes are made to the Dodd-Frank rules, said Brian Gardner, a policy analyst with Keefe Bruyette & Woods told CNNMoney. How deep is the roots of the work that he's done? I suspect it's pretty deep."}

Some of those accounts were used to discuss the December firings of eight federal prosecutors, a shake-up that has triggered a spreading controversy on Capitol Hill.\\n\\nCongressional investigators have questioned whether White House aides used e-mail accounts from the Republican Party and President Bush's re-election campaign for official government business to avoid scrutiny of those dealings.\\n\\nSen. Patrick Leahy, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, accused the White House of trying to hide messages on the Republican Party system related to the firing of the U.S. attorneys, which has stirred up a hornet's nest on Capitol Hill.\\n\\nYou can't erase e-mails, not today, said Leahy, D-Vermont. They've gone through too many servers. They can't say they've been lost. That's like saying, 'The dog ate my homework.'  (Watch Leahy compare e-mails to Nixon tapes )\\n\\nLeahy said the e-mails would have remained on party or campaign computer servers, and he compared the situation to the famous 18½-minute gap in one of the Watergate tapes.\\n\\nThey're there, he said. They know they're there, and we'll subpoena them, if necessary, and we'll have them.\\n\\nPerino told reporters that the e-mails from those accounts should have been saved, but said policy has not kept pace with technology. She said computer experts were trying to retrieve any records that have been deleted.\\n\\nWe screwed up, and we're trying to fix it, she told reporters.\\n\\nE-mails sought by special prosecutor also missing\\n\\nPatrick Fitzgerald, the special prosecutor in the CIA leak case, disclosed last year that some White House e-mails in 2003 were not saved as standard procedure dictated.\\n\\nIn a January 23, 2006, letter to the defense team of former White House aide I. Lewis Scooter Libby, Fitzgerald wrote: We advise you that we have learned that not all e-mail of the Office of Vice President and the Executive Office of President for certain time periods in 2003 was preserved through the normal archiving process on the White House computer system.\\n\\nRobert Luskin, personal attorney for Rove, told CNN Friday that he has no reason to doubt Fitzgerald's assertion that some White House e-mail was missing.\\n\\nYou're quite right, Luskin said in a telephone interview. There was a gap there.\\n\\nDemocrats charge this raises questions about whether the public has gotten the full story on everything from the CIA leak case to the fired U.S. attorneys controversy.\\n\\nThe biggest problem here is really that here is a White House that is deliberately violating an existing statute that requires them to preserve all records, said Sloan. And we have significant evidence now both from the RNC e-mail and the White House e-mail that are missing that the White House was using every means possible to avoid complying with the law.\\n\\nLuskin said it was foolish speculation for CREW -- which serves as counsel to former ambassador Joe Wilson and his wife, Valerie Plame, in a private suit against Rove and other Bush officials -- to suggest that the gap in White House e-mail helped Rove avoid indictment in the CIA leak case. Luskin said Fitzgerald told him that Rove was cleared in the case because he did nothing wrong.\\n\\nLuskin added that until this month, Rove believed his RNC e-mail was being archived and did nothing wrong.\\n\\nRove has always understood from very early on in the Bush administration that RNC and campaign e-mail were being archived, said Luskin. He was absolutely unaware until very, very recently that any e-mails were lost. And he never asked that e-mails be deleted or asked for the authority to delete e-mails.\\n\\nCNN's Ed Henry and Lisa Goddard contributed to this report."}

{"original": "Editor's note: Malika Saada Saar is the founder and executive director of the Rebecca Project for Human Rights. The Rebecca Project is a nonprofit organization that advocates for justice, dignity and policy reform for vulnerable women and girls in the United States and in Africa.\\n\\n(CNN) -- Last month, two girls trafficked for sex through the website Craigslist wrote an open letter to its founder, Craig Newmark, pleading with him to get rid of the adult services section, where sex ads are placed.\\n\\nI was first forced into prostitution when I was 11 years old by a 28-year-old man, M.C. wrote. I am not an exception. The man who trafficked me sold many girls my age, his house was called 'Daddy Day Care.'\\n\\nAll day, me and other girls sat with our laptops, posting pictures and answering ads on Craigslist. He made $1,500 a night selling my body, dragging me to Los Angeles, Houston, Little Rock -- and one trip to Las Vegas in the trunk of a car. I am 17 now, and my childhood memories aren't of my family, going to middle school, or dancing at the prom. They are making my own arrangements on Craigslist to be sold for sex, and answering as many ads as possible for fear of beatings and ice water baths.\\n\\nNo one from Craigslist responded to M.C.\\n\\nAccording to the most recent Department of Justice statistics, an estimated 100,000 to 300,000 children are sold for sex every year in the United States. Most are from 11 and 14 years old. Try for a moment to imagine your fifth-grade child, niece or sister, sold for sex.\\n\\nIf you live in a city, imagine that happening within one square mile of where you are right now. New York, Ohio, Georgia, Oregon and California have among the highest rates of trafficked teens. And it turns out that the best-known online trading post is not some sleazy child porn website, but the ubiquitous Craigslist, where you shop for cars, clothes and musical instruments.\\n\\nLaw enforcement officials and anti-trafficking organizations have repeatedly asked Craigslist to rein in its sex ads in an effort to stop the selling of children for sex.\\n\\nCraig Newmark and Craigslist CEO Jim Buckmaster have made some efforts to screen the site for children sold for sex and cooperate with law enforcement investigations. But for the most part, they have ignored such pleas, maybe because they just made an estimated $36 million in profits from these sex ads in the last year alone.\\n\\nRead Craigslist's answer to these accusations\\n\\nWhile Craigslist has made selling children a virtual stop-and-shop for predators, it alone doesn't by any means account for the explosion of child trafficking. Prostituting children has become a growth business for all sorts of criminal elements because it is hugely profitable and virtually unprosecuted.\\n\\nThe U.S. government annually spends 300 times more money to fight drug trafficking than it does to fight human trafficking, and the criminal penalties for trafficking cocaine, for example, are 20 times greater than the criminal penalties levied against those who buy and sell girls.\\n\\nAlthough the government estimates hundreds of thousands of children have been sold for sex, only a few hundred of the pimps who victimize them have been prosecuted. Almost none of the Johns are prosecuted.\\n\\nLet's be clear. The men who purchase girls for sex are no different from men who snatch children off the street for sex. Both are rapists. Period.\\n\\nWhatever the circumstances, no child wants to sell her body to a stranger. In fact, no child is permitted to sell her body -- the law says they can't consent.\\n\\nYet arresting these perpetrators of child rape is rare, and prosecution is even rarer, according to the international anti-trafficking organization Shared Hope. Actress Demi Moore, who has vigorously joined the campaign against trafficking girls, calls it America's dirty little secret. And it's true that while we applaud efforts to end trafficking in Cambodia or India, the similar plight of disadvantaged girls in this country is routinely ignored.\\n\\nChanging this shameful situation requires three things:\\n\\nFirst, the commitment of state and local governments to prosecute the men who buy and sell underage girls for sex to the full extent of the law. Those laws exist, yet they are rarely enforced.\\n\\nSecond, residential treatment must be available for girls rescued from trafficking, where they can feel safe and begin to heal. This will require recognizing that the sexual exploitation of underage girls is a human rights issue, as we have already done when it involves young girls in the developing world.\\n\\nThird, Craigslist should set the industry example and shut down the adult services section until it can create a comprehensive surveillance and monitoring system that ensures children are not being bought and sold for sex.\\n\\nYou can do that, Craig. It might not stop child trafficking, but it will save many children like M.C.\\n\\nThe opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Malika Saada Saar."}

Elizabeth Warren arrived in Iowa on Friday evening and, through four events over a little more than 24 hours, quickly made clear that even as her presidential campaign evolves, she is poised to rise or fall with the same brand of wonky populism that took her from the classroom to Capitol Hill.\\n\\nIn speeches to packed rooms from the state's western border with Nebraska to its capital in Des Moines, Warren spent the weekend demanding structural change in Washington, where the partial government shutdown is entering its third week. She wants to strengthen our unions, our workers and our consumers while breaking the hold of an army of lobbyists occupying the capital, as she describes it, under the banners of big corporations.\\n\\nRELATED: Elizabeth Warren in Iowa: 'I am not a person of color'\\n\\nEven during her occasional strolls in the policy weeds, Warren, who has set the tone for her remarks so far by opening them with the story of her mother's struggle to find a minimum wage job to help save their house after Warren's father suffered a debilitating heart attack, keeps up a low fury. When her microphone cut out at the opening event in Council Bluffs, Warren didn't yell because, even in a room of 300 (with 200 more outside) she didn't have to.\\n\\nThere are too many people who get their power from turning working people against working people, the Massachusetts Democrat said a day later in Storm Lake during a riff on long-stalled talks over comprehensive immigration revisions. A few hours earlier, in Sioux City, she declared, Washington keeps working great for those with money, but not for anyone else. We need to call this out for what it is: It is corruption, pure and simple.\\n\\nIf Warren has strong feelings about ethanol, an important issue for Iowa voters and favorite means for out-of-state candidates to pander to them, she hasn't yet let on. Warren has also steered clear of some national progressive hits, like Medicare-for-all, which she hasn't mentioned through her first few stops.\\n\\nAsked on Saturday why the Democratic left's signature policy proposal had not gotten a mention through two events, Warren demurred.\\n\\nNo one's raised it, she said. But I have had a chance to talk about Medicaid, partly because I think we've had a national conversation about health care, and I think it's been enormously valuable.\\n\\nThe issue was indeed a winner for Democrats running during the 2018 midterm elections. In her opening foray, Warren has seemed content to continue on that path, advocating for Medicaid not just as a program for the poor but also as one that benefits seniors and Americans suffering from mental illness, while assailing the shameful behavior of insurance companies. On Saturday night, she won hearty applause when she called health care a basic human right.\\n\\nBut if Warren has appeared entirely self-assured in diving into the policy positions that she has been crusading for in Washington for years – All right! she cheered when an audience member in Sioux City began asking about internet regulations – her tone has changed when faced with questions about the 2016 election, a kind of riddle that she and so many other Democrats are still struggling to unwind.\\n\\nAsked how she planned to prevent a repeat of the undemocratic behavior between the DNC and Hillary's campaign in 2016 against Sen. Sanders, Warren told supporters in Des Moines, I'm not relitigating 2016, before pivoting to call all Democrats running for president to disavow super PACs, saying, I think that all of the Democratic candidates, whoever they turn out to be, should link arms and say our primary is not for sale to billionaires.\\n\\nIn a gaggle with reporters at her Council Bluffs rally on Friday, she bypassed a question about the comparisons being drawn between her campaign and Hillary Clinton's four years ago.\\n\\nYou know, look – I'd never run for public office before I got into the Senate race in Massachusetts, Warren responded. I was pulled into this because I have watched how America's middle class has been hollowed out. I am in this fight for working families. I'm going to stay focused on that all the way through.\\n\\nLike her colleague and ideological ally Sen. Bernie Sanders, the Vermont independent whose decision to enter the 2016 presidential campaign was partly a reaction to Warren's decision to sit it out, the Massachusetts senator seems least at ease when political conversation turns personal. But hers is a distinct challenge, and a lonely one during this period when Warren stands as the lone, high-profile female presidential candidate.\\n\\nShe has already been faced with a story focused on whether she risked being viewed as too unlikable, gamely parlaying it into a fundraising tool. Many Democrats seized on the same report, determined to lay down a marker to ensure that Warren and the other women likely to run – so many of them politically and personally distinct from Clinton in so many ways – be spared a very similar treatment.\\n\\nOutside Warren's debut event on Friday night, Natalie Wertz, 29, who was waiting for the candidate with a friend – both of them having purchased pink T-shirts emblazoned with Warren's de facto slogan, Nevertheless, she persisted – spoke confidently of Warren's potential as a candidate.\\n\\nNeither woman had heard about the likability flap, though Wertz smilingly proclaimed Warren a very likable person.\\n\\nBut her decision in 2020, Wertz said, would turn on more concrete questions.\\n\\nAs a lower middle class American, budget and finances sometimes – living paycheck to paycheck is very hard, she said. And it's a toxic world that has set us into this cycle of vicious debt. I think that Warren has great ideas about how to get us out of that.\\n\\nCNN's Carolyn Sung and DJ Judd contributed to this report."}

Bluntly, Brexit has shone a light on the fact that the foundations holding up the UK had been crumbling for some time.\\n\\nThe current deadlock in Westminster – and what it might mean for the union between England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland – is spooking politicians from all over the political divide.\\n\\nJacob Rees-Mogg, a longstanding Conservative Euroskeptic, told me earlier this week: The two greatest risks to the union are splitting Northern Ireland from Great Britain, as the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement with the EU proposes, and a second referendum, which would legitimize the calls for a second independence vote in Scotland.\\n\\nThe movement in the UK's politics and resulting divisions is nicely illustrated by the last eight years of its voting history.\\n\\nThe two greatest risks to the union are splitting Northern Ireland from Great Britain, as the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement with the EU proposes, and a second referendum, which would legitimize the calls for a second independence vote in Scotland. Jacob Rees-Mogg\\n\\nLet's take the 2010 general election as a starting point, in which voters opted for a coalition between David Cameron's Conservative Party and Nick Clegg's Liberal Democrats. These two centrists looked like a safe pair of hands at a time of turmoil in the immediate aftermath of the 2008 global financial crisis.\\n\\nOver the five years of the coalition, austerity measures were introduced that made most politics junkies certain that Labour would win back power under its then leader, Ed Miliband.\\n\\nBut a shock result in 2015 saw Cameron win a majority in Parliament. Scotland voted for the pro-independence Scottish Nationalist Party in huge numbers. After the failed Scottish independence referendum a year earlier, the general election result was a clear sign of just how wide the gap between England and Scotland had become.\\n\\nFast forward past the Brexit referendum and Cameron's own exit to Theresa May's 2017 snap election for more clues. Many voters in pro-Brexit areas of England snubbed her in favor of Labour's Jeremy Corbyn – who at the time had an unclear position on Brexit, though much of his party is pro-Europe. She lost her majority, but strangely picked up votes in Remain-supporting Scotland, despite her party backing the very definition of a so-called hard Brexit.\\n\\nPHOTO: TOLGA AKMEN/AFP/Getty Images Britain's Prime Minister Theresa May leaves from 10 Downing Street on December 17, 2018.\\n\\nClearly, the British public is divided – and that division is especially acute in the politics of the four nations.\\n\\nIn England, the UK's wealthiest and most populous city, London, stands in contrast to the rest of the country.\\n\\nIt is from London that the campaign for a second vote that could ultimately stop Brexit is being driven. But it was English votes that carried the victory for Leave. This creates tension not just in England, but in the union at large – the politics of the English are the most influential in the union and can often dictate policy that affects everyone.\\n\\nIn the case of Brexit, that means Scottish remainers feeling as though the English are dragging them out of the EU against their will. Alarmingly for unionists, recent polling showed that English Conservative voters (officially called the Conservative and Unionist Party) would be happy with the union breaking up in exchange for a good Brexit.\\n\\nThe division is more obvious in Scotland. The SNP would clearly like to push for a second independence referendum and rejoin the EU as an independent nation. Meanwhile, Scottish Conservatives would clearly prefer a softer form of Brexit to protect Scotland's economy while keeping the union together – something about which they disagree with their English counterparts.\\n\\nIn Northern Ireland, the devolved National Assembly has not sat in nearly two years after the power-sharing agreement that allows both unionists and republicans to be involved in government collapsed.\\n\\nDespite this, the Democratic Unionist Party holds the balance of power in Westminster and is currently one of the biggest obstacles to May getting her Brexit deal through Parliament.\\n\\nThey believe the deal ignores their most important demand: no friction between Northern Ireland and Great Britain. We do not want a hard border, we believe there are many ways of resolving it, the DUP's Emma Little-Pengelly said to me of the Irish border issue. Instead, she believes that May and the EU's solution aims to ensure no checks at all on the Irish border between two sovereign states by creating 68 new checks between Great Britain and Northern Ireland.\\n\\nIt must be worrying for the DUP that both those wanting May's deal to pass and hardline Brexit voters are so happy to see their red lines rubbed out for the sake of getting the job done.\\n\\nPHOTO: PAUL FAITH/AFP/AFP/Getty Images Traffic crosses the border into Northern Ireland from the Irish Republic.\\n\\nOne thing seems to have been forgotten by politicians in all this: some people in Brussels speak English. The UK's chaos has been watched with astonishment by EU officials.\\n\\nIt's still not clear what the UK wants, Guy Verhofstadt, Brexit coordinator for the EU Parliament, told CNN. I hope the deal agreed finds a majority. If not, then MPs have to work together to find a compromise solution on a future relationship. Whatever the choice, we need a withdrawal agreement to be agreed to avoid a disastrous no-deal outcome.\\n\\nLoathe as many in Westminster will be to take advice from a former Prime Minister of Belgium, he makes a solid point. Wild politics is not a good enough reason for a nation as important as the UK to fall into a black hole of its own creation.\\n\\nIt's still not clear what the UK wants. Guy Verhofstadt\\n\\nThe good news is that as things stand, both main parties believe the union should be preserved. It shouldn't be beyond the wit of our elected officials to forge some cross-party unity on a matter they claim to care so much about.\\n\\nAs Brexit reaches its apex, perhaps the minds of the political elite will sharpen and we will all start to see a way out of this hellscape. They need to make the public care about the union, or frankly, it's only going to crumble further.\\n\\nIf that doesn't happen, then the UK as we know it will have to continue to exist on life support.\\n\\nAnd if we don't take this moment to fix the union between the four nations, then distressingly few will be in mourning, should the switch get flipped."}

{"original": "(CNN) While former President Jimmy Carter is often remembered as a strait-laced figure, he embodied countercultural cool in 1976, when he was the Democratic presidential nominee. Jimmy Carter: Rock and Roll President, an engaging documentary that airs on CNN on January 3, takes us back to when this largely unknown governor from Georgia -- mocked as Jimmy Who? -- ran for the highest office in the land and defeated incumbent Gerald Ford.\\n\\nThroughout his political journey, some of the hippest musicians of the time kept flocking to support him.\\n\\nRockers and edgy country singer-songwriters like Bob Dylan and Willie Nelson have always been among some of his biggest fans. From the moment that Carter announced his presidential run, the Allman Brothers, among the most legendary bands from the era, played benefit concerts to raise money for his campaign. As U2's Bono reminisced during a speech featured in the documentary, He campaigned with the Allman Brothers. You got the feeling that if his hair was a little longer, he'd be in the Allman Brothers.\\n\\nWhen Carter first met Dylan, the meeting made the music icon feel uneasy, since he was as anti-establishment as they came, but Carter put my mind at ease by not talking down to me and showing me that he had sincere appreciation for the songs that I had written. Most important, Dylan realized then that Carter was a different kind of politician than most.\\n\\nCarter's friendship with Willie Nelson one that has endured through several decades. Nelson and singer Emmylou Harris visited Carter in the Oval Office in 1977.\\n\\nWhy would the rock-and-roll set flock to a man who, as president, is remembered today as being a micro-managing, straight-arrow engineer who failed to inspire or understand leadership?\\n\\nThe reason is that in his prime, Jimmy Carter was cool. He championed a kind of political populism that was extremely attractive to Americans disillusioned with Washington in the wake of Vietnam and Watergate. Sick and tired of elected officials who betrayed them, they found a refreshing change in Carter, a former peanut farmer who was seen as an anti-establishment outsider. As Bishop Michael Curry recalls in the documentary, We were coming out of the Watergate era and looking ...to be a country of integrity again.\\n\\nThe Imperial Presidency, as the historian Arthur Schlesinger Jr. famously described in his 1973 book of the same name, applied to those modern presidents who had expanded their executive powers beyond what was outlined in the Constitution. As a result, these presidents -- many of whom showed a willingness to move the nation in dangerous directions -- had become disconnected from voters.\\n\\nWhen Dolly Parton performed at a 1979 country music gala in Washington, DC, Carter and wife Rosalynn were in the front row.\\n\\nLyndon Johnson, younger Democrats complained, brought us deeper into the quagmire of Vietnam; Richard Nixon abused his power so that he could maintain it. The Allman Brothers' Chuck Leavell remembers thinking in the 1976 election, Isn't it time for someone with great integrity and dignity to take his office?\\n\\nIn contrast to President Donald Trump's populism, which has revolved around racial resentment, Twitter tirades and rally rhetoric attacking people and institutions that didn't support him, Carter hoped to bring the nation a stripped-down presidency, defined less by pomp and circumstance and more by tackling the difficult problems facing the nation.\\n\\nWhen Paul Simon sang American Tune at the inauguration in 1977, hitting the words, I'm all right, I'm just weary to my bones, he seemed to speak for many disaffected people who didn't believe that Carter could be anything better than Richard Nixon. When Aretha Franklin belted out God Bless America she tapped into the hope, buried deep in many Americans at the time, that this country could still reach its promise. Carter understood all of that and was determined to give them hope again.\\n\\nThough Carter's presidency has often been disparaged, he did deliver in many ways. As Jonathan Alter recounts in his new book, His Very Best: Jimmy Carter, a Life, President Carter was notable in that he was willing to tackle difficult policy challenges, from the environment and energy to peace in the Middle East, even if they were not politically smart issues to take on. He constantly burned bridges with his own coalition to take on issues\\n\\nHis presidency was also filled with symbolic gestures meant to show that a president could be sensitive to the limits of his own power. During his inauguration, Carter, along with his wife and daughter, stepped out of the limo and walked the streets as an elated crowd looked on. He did away with the Hail to the Chief anthem before public entrances and spoke on television wearing a cardigan sweater\\n\\nFrom the start, he didn't seek to put himself on a pedestal above those he was meant to lead. And this meant something at the time. For a people desperate for a new direction, it offered hope that politics could be different. He made the presidency so engaging that even bands like Crosby, Stills and Nash would show up at the White House just to have a chance to meet him, as the film recounts.\\n\\nJimmy Carter said of friend Johnny Cash: I was glad when he brought June Cash (left) down here to meet me. We always claimed that she was my cousin.\\n\\nOf course, in the end the presidency didn't work out as well as he had hoped . Carter, who was overwhelmed by the Iran Hostage Crisis and a flagging economy, ended up losing reelection. He backtracked on some of his populism, such as rejecting bolder proposals to use public spending to stimulate the economy or backing away from national health insurance (which caused an immense rift with liberal stalwart Senator Ted Kennedy), and gradually came to be seen as more establishment.\\n\\nBut it's worth looking back on those original years -- when rock and rollers, as well as country music mavericks -- saw something fresh and inspiring in Carter's political populism. He was one of the rare leaders who tried to make himself a little less important to benefit the overall health of our democracy. In recent years, the nation has been sold a brand of populism wielded by a deeply divisive president who abused his executive powers and did little to address the needs of average Americans.\\n\\nGet our free weekly newsletter Sign up for CNN Opinion's new newsletter. Join us on Twitter and Facebook\\n\\nAfter his presidency ended, Carter returned to the spirit that animated him in 1976. Rather than spending his time giving high-paid speeches or living in seclusion, Carter created the Carter Center, devoted to diplomatic initiatives, eradicating disease and promoting democracy. He has worked for Habitat for Humanity, building houses for those without economic means.\\n\\nThere has not been a president . . . who has done more since they left office . . . just the humanitarians that they have been to us as a nation and to the world, says country singer Trisha Yearwood, who along with her husband Garth Brooks has worked with the Carters on Habitat.\\n\\nIn other words, Carter has used his position as a platform for promoting social justice, defining a post-presidency that has been radically different from that of those who came before him.\\n\\nJimmy Carter showed us that populism isn't always a bad thing if it comes with integrity and a genuine concern for the nation's citizenry. We need that more than ever today after four years of chaos, instability and dysfunction"}
{"original": "New York (CNN Business) Georgia isn't just the center of the political universe. It's center stage on Wall Street, too.\\n\\nThe Peach State's Senate runoffs will decide control of the US Senate -- and that in turn will play a pivotal role in shaping the economic recovery as well as the investing environment.\\n\\nIt is impossible to overstate how critical these races are for fiscal, tax and regulatory policy over the next two years, Chris Krueger, policy analyst at Cowen Washington Research, told clients in a report Monday.\\n\\nA sweep by Democrats would open the door to more powerful fiscal stimulus that the shaky economy may very well need. But it would also raise the risk of corporate tax hikes that investors despise.\\n\\nUntil recently, Republicans were expected to retain control of the Senate by winning at least one of the Georgia races.\\n\\nHowever, the odds of the Democrats retaking the Senate have surged in prediction markets in recent days and weeks -- a point that investors are just awakening to. If Democrats sweep in Georgia, they will effectively control the upper chamber of Congress, with Vice President-elect Kamala Harris casting the deciding vote to break any 50/50 stalemates.\\n\\nControl of the Senate is a 50/50 chance in either direction, Ed Mills, Washington policy analyst at Raymond James, wrote in a note to clients Monday.\\n\\nBettors on PredictIt , a prediction market, are paying just 55 cents to win $1 if the GOP keeps control of the Senate. That's down sharply from 87 cents on Election Day and 75 cents in late December.\\n\\nGiven the totally unprecedented nature of the election, Krueger said, the Georgia races are a jumpball.\\n\\nTrump call adds to uncertainty\\n\\nThe Senate outlook is being further clouded by the bombshell revelation that President Donald Trump pressured Georgia officials to find 11,870 votes that would reverse his loss in the state.\\n\\nThis doesn't help the Republicans at all, said Greg Valliere, chief US policy strategist at AGF Investments.\\n\\nHe added that Trump's efforts to cast doubt on the integrity of the election may have confused Republican voters in Georgia -- just when he needs them to vote.\\n\\nInvestors may be confused, too.\\n\\nUS stocks surged after Election Day in part because Wall Street believed neither party would be firmly in charge of Washington. The thinking was that the incoming Biden administration would be blocked from implementing sweeping tax and climate policies by a GOP-led Senate.\\n\\nHowever, Wall Street is now bracing for the possibility that there may be less gridlock in Washington than previously thought. And that has positives and negatives for investors.\\n\\nStocks fell sharply Monday and some analysts pointed to the uncertainty over Georgia as one of the culprits knocking down the previously red-hot market.\\n\\nThe possibility of Kamala Harris being a tiebreaker on any 50/50 vote makes investors nervous near-term, said Lindsey Bell, chief investment strategist at Ally Invest.\\n\\nTax hike fears may be overdone\\n\\nThe big fear for investors is that GOP losses in Georgia would pave the way for large tax hikes that not only eat into corporate profits but derail the recovery, too. In theory, Democrats could use budget reconciliation to enact sweeping policy changes with party-line votes.\\n\\nBut some analysts say fears of immediate tax hikes are overblown given the economic and political realities of the moment.\\n\\nI don't sense a mood in Congress to move quickly on taxes until people are sure the economy has recovered, Valliere said.\\n\\nKeep in mind that a 50/50 tie in the US Senate is hardly the blue wave that progressives hoped for. All 50 Democrats would have to approve legislation -- including moderates such as Joe Manchin of West Virginia.\\n\\nManchin would not be a rubberstamp for the Democrats, said Valliere.\\n\\nMichael Cembalest, chairman of market and investment strategy at JPMorgan Asset Management, agreed that Democrats may find it difficult to pass Biden's tax and spending proposals through very narrow Senate and House majorities. He added that Manchin is ideologically closer to moderate Republicans than he is to progressive Democrats.\\n\\nHow much more help for the economy?\\n\\nUnlike tax hikes, Democrats are likely to unite behind legislation that would provide more help to the Covid-ravaged economy.\\n\\nLate last month, Congress finally passed a $900 billion federal relief package that provided aid to small businesses and households.\\n\\nThe worsening pandemic -- and the sluggish start to vaccine distribution -- suggest the economy may very well need more help in the coming months. But with Republicans out of the White House, the GOP is now signaling concern over the surging federal budget deficit. If the GOP retains control of the US Senate, there may be little appetite for another round of substantive federal aid.\\n\\nA Democratic-run Senate could mean bigger stimulus will be on the way to ensure the recovery gets back on track, said Ally's Bell.\\n\\nPresident-elect Joe Biden has called for $3 trillion in infrastructure spending to accelerate the economy and rebuild crumbling roads, bridges and airports.\\n\\nAnalysts have said Biden's plan is a real possibility if Democrats sweep in Georgia. If not, it may be difficult to convince Congress to spend even $1 trillion on infrastructure.\\n\\nInvestors would view big spending on infrastructure as a big positive for the market, said Bell.\\n\\nAll of this explains why Bell is betting that a knee-jerk selloff on Wall Street over a potential sweep by Democrats in Georgia could prove to be a buying opportunity for investors."}

{"original": "(CNN) -- Federal health authorities announced Thursday the recall of a commonly used flavor enhancer after samples of the product were found to contain salmonella.\\n\\nI would say it's likely to be in thousands of food products, said Dr. Jenny Scott, senior adviser to the director at the Office of Food Safety at the Food and Drug Administration's Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, about the product, called hydrolyzed vegetable protein, also called HVP.\\n\\nThe bacterium, identified as Salmonella Tennessee, was found in HVP manufactured by Basic Food Flavors Inc. of Las Vegas, Nevada, the officials said.\\n\\nHVP is used in processed foods, including soups, sauces, chilis, stews, hot dogs, gravy, seasoned snack foods and dressings.\\n\\nWe are working hard to respond to this particular outbreak; we also are working hard to put in place the kinds of preventive control measures to prevent this kind of contamination from happening in the first place, said FDA Commissioner Dr. Margaret A. Hamburg.\\n\\nOfficials noted in a telephone conference call with reporters that no illnesses have been reported and any risk to consumers would be considered low.\\n\\nMany of the foods that incorporated this product at very low levels have kill steps in place that would eliminate salmonella, said Dr. Joshua Sharfstein, FDA's principal deputy commissioner. He was referring to steps in preparation that would heat the product enough to kill any bacteria. For those that don't, we're providing specific guidance around the need to recall, he said.\\n\\nBut officials acknowledged they did not yet know just how many products might wind up being recalled.\\n\\nThe manufacturer had many first-level consignees who obviously had individuals and firms that they sold to, said Dr. Jeff Farrar, associate commissioner for food safety, FDA's Office of Foods. We expect this to get larger over the next several days to, actually, maybe several weeks.\\n\\nA call to the manufacturer was not returned immediately.\\n\\nSharfstein said the agency learned of the problem in early February, when a Basic Foods customer tested the product and reported to FDA that it was contaminated.\\n\\nFarrar said he did not know when the plant was last inspected.\\n\\nThe recall affects all bulk HVP produced at the facility since September 17. The FDA posted several dozen products containing the ingredient at www.foodsafety.gov, but officials said the list was not complete. The recalled products include dips, salad dressings and soup mixes.\\n\\nSee the list of recalled products\\n\\nFarrar said the agency was recommending recalls of those products containing HVP that might be eaten without processing or cooking that would kill the bacteria. But more needs to be done, he said. This situation clearly underscores the need for new food safety legislation to equip FDA with the tools we need to prevent contamination, said Farrar.\\n\\nSalmonella bacteria sometimes cause fatal infections in young children, elderly people and anyone with a weakened immune system.\\n\\nSymptoms in healthy people might include fever, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain.\\n\\nThe Center for Science in the Public Interest said the recall is yet more proof that the Food and Drug Administration needs more authority, more inspectors and more resources to ensure that our food supply is safe.\\n\\nIt added, Most Americans would be stunned to learn that FDA doesn't even have the authority to make recalls like these mandatory.\\n\\nA bill passed in July by the House with overwhelming bipartisan support would go a long way toward beefing up the agency's ability to intervene in such cases, said Erik Olson, director of food and consumer product safety at The Pew Charitable Trusts.\\n\\nThe existing law is basically a reactive law, he said. If you find contamination problems, the FDA reacts and goes out and tries to find the problem and asks for a voluntary recall.\\n\\nThe FDA Food Safety Modernization Act, the law pending in the Senate, would change the whole system, modernize it to say we're going to try to prevent the contamination before it occurs.\\n\\nBut support for the bill is not universal.\\n\\nThe National Sustainable Agriculture Coalition is seeking changes in the bill before passage, according to Senior Policy Associate Kate Fitzgerald.\\n\\nThe last thing we want to do as a government is to inhibit these regional food systems by poorly crafted regulation, she said. Under the proposed legislation, a farmer selling broccoli heads would be classified as a farmer, but a farmer selling broccoli florets would be classified as a facility and subject to more rigorous controls, she said.\\n\\nNo one benefits if we pass a food-safety bill but it doesn't make the food system better, she said.\\n\\nSteve Etka, legislative director at the National Organic Coalition, offered a similar view. We want to make sure the bill is clear that it's targeted toward the riskiest behaviors, he said. Right now, we think it's kind of missing the mark in that regard."}

THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.\\n\\n\\n\\n[21:00:00]\\n\\n\\n\\nANDERSON COOPER, CNN HOST: Whatever's going on there, I mean, if you look at the President when he's outside, these - it's clearly it's not a light bulb problem. You can see the line around his face where the makeup, or the tanner, whatever it is, stops. It's a whole system. It's a whole thing.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut hey, you heard him say, his Administration's looking to all this, so let's leave it there. Sleep well America, and know that the President is working hard from his Throne Room to get the gridlock unclogged on The Ridiculist.\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd that does it for us. The news continues. Want to hand it over to Chris and CUOMO PRIME TIME. Chris?\\n\\n\\n\\nCHRIS CUOMO, CNN HOST: It is good a metaphor for the state of play as there can be. Anderson, thank you very much. I am Chris Cuomo. Welcome to PRIME TIME.\\n\\n\\n\\nNow, as you know, a U.S. Naval base has become a crime scene for the second time in a week. This time it was a Saudi military member named as the murderer. We're waiting on a presser from the FBI. They took over the case.\\n\\n\\n\\nNow, one obvious item of interest is motive, specifically, was this an act of terror? And that means something different to the FBI. They have to check certain boxes. We'll see what they say. As soon as it goes live, I'm going to take it.\\n\\n\\n\\nWe're also going to look more deeply tonight at how does our government decide who comes here and from where? And are events like this something that they figure in to the calculation?\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd Rudy Giuliani is making moves that may be making things worse for this President. We have a big Senate player here tonight with what it all means to him.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat do you say? Happy Friday. Let's get after it.\\n\\n\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\n\\n\\nTEXT: CUOMO PRIME TIME.\\n\\n\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\n\\n\\nCUOMO: All right, like I said, as soon as they tell me that the press conference is ready, I think we should listen to it. Yes, we have a lot of other show planned but, you know, we can get fresh information on this very primary interest of why did this person do this.\\n\\n\\n\\nNow, we know what happened at the base in Pearl Harbor, right? They are investigating that as some type of mental health situation. This one seems to be different, all right? So, when the FBI is ready, we will go to them.\\n\\n\\n\\nHere's what we know.\\n\\n\\n\\nA Saudi Air Force member, a second lieutenant in the Saudi military, is named as the suspected murderer of three. And as many - I think it was eight people went away originally with injuries, a couple of left were waiting for an update on all of their dispositions as well.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe suspect had been training three - for two years on the dime of the Saudi government, according to the Pentagon. Now, this is done a lot. There's a lot of training that goes on with international people in America.\\n\\n\\n\\nPresident Trump was quick to help distance the Kingdom from the attack.\\n\\n\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\n\\n\\nDONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: The King said that the Saudi people are greatly angered by the barbaric actions of the shooter, and that this person in no way, shape, or form, represents the feelings of the Saudi people who love the American people so much.\\n\\n\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\n\\n\\nCUOMO: Now, if you've noticed in the past, this President is slow to excuse people when things happen, but not the Saudis.\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd we do know that they are cooperating with the FBI's investigation. Terror, of course, is a great concern here, and is being examined. But we'll have to see if the FBI feels that that's what this was about.\\n\\n\\n\\nNow, as we wait for more word, let's bring in CNN Counterterrorism Analyst, Phil Mudd, and CNN Global Affairs Analyst, Aaron David Miller. It's good to see you both.\\n\\n\\n\\nPhil, I don't know if you heard my question there. But you were part of this type of process. You also did some work for the Saudis in - individually.\\n\\n\\n\\nPHIL MUDD, CNN COUNTERTERRORISM ANALYST: Yes.\\n\\n\\n\\nCUOMO: So, what do you understand about how the U.S. government makes these kinds of determinations and whether or not this risk is part of the analysis.\\n\\n\\n\\nMUDD: It's got to be part of the analysis. Look, I remember, after 9/11, when I was at - at the Bureau, you have to sit back and look at a couple categories of people there - there are people here who are immigrants from Saudi Arabia.\\n\\n\\n\\nThere are not thousands but tens of thousands of students on this base alone. There is hundreds of foreigners. There's a lot of Saudis training in this country on military bases because we obviously sell billions of dollars in military equipment.\\n\\n\\n\\nSo, you step back, and say, Look, if you're dealing with tens of thousands of people from the Saudi military, from the student population, you've got to do a risk assessment, look at things like do they have a criminal history. That's what you--\\n\\n\\n\\nCUOMO: All right, hold on, Phil, Phil, let me--\\n\\n\\n\\nMUDD: Go ahead.\\n\\n\\n\\nCUOMO: --let's hold it up because they were just doing introductions. But now we're into the meat of it. Let's listen.\\n\\n\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\n\\n\\nRACHEL ROJAS, FBI JACKSONVILLE SPECIAL AGENT IN CHARGE: --grieving along with all of you. We are working tirelessly to find answers to the many questions surrounding what happened today.\\n\\n\\n\\nFBI personnel have been here since very early this morning, first, to assist our partners at Escambia County Sheriff's Office and NCIS. And now, we are here as the agency, coordinating this investigation, moving forward.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe FBI has available and is providing a wide range of resources, including agents, Intelligence analysts, and professional staff, from multiple field offices, as well as experts from the FBI Laboratory Division, the Evidence Response Teams from numerous field offices, and Victim Services and many more.\\n\\n\\n\\n[21:05:00]\\n\\n\\n\\nThese resources will likely continue to increase and come into this area over the next several hours and days. Just want to remind everybody here that we are all in this together.\\n\\n\\n\\nToday, our Evidence Response Teams began processing what is a large crime scene. Their work will continue tonight and into the morning.\\n\\n\\n\\nTheir work is going to be methodical. And it will not, and cannot be rushed. They have only one chance to get this right. And this is what we owe to the families. They will be here to uncover, are going to be our critical answers that we are all seeking.\\n\\n\\n\\nWe have also been working side by side throughout the day with our law enforcement partners, with the U.S. Attorney, Larry Keefe, and his team, to push forward in any direction this investigation may take us.\\n\\n\\n\\nThat being said, we are not prepared at this hour to confirm what may have motivated the shooter, to commit this horrific act today.\\n\\n\\n\\nThere are many reports circulating, but the FBI deals only in facts, and this is still very much an active and ongoing investigation. As soon as we can, we will share more.\\n\\n\\n\\nWe are also not yet officially confirming the shooter's name. There is a process of notifications and coordination that is still taking place at this hour. But we will provide that information to you when we can, and as soon as we can.\\n\\n\\n\\nUntil then, I want you all to know that we are working this together. We are going to work this around the clock. This is a 24/7 operation. We need to do this for 24/7 because we got to get this right for the community, and everybody gets the answers that they deserve.\\n\\n\\n\\nThis is going to take us some time, and we want to thank the public, and we want to thank the media, for your patience. And I know that's a lot to ask, and I do thank you sincerely for taking the patience with this.\\n\\n\\n\\nOn behalf of FBI Jacksonville, and obviously, the entire Federal Bureau of Investigation, we offer our support to the families of our innocent victims that was taken today from all of us, and to this entire community.\\n\\n\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\n\\n\\nCUOMO: I mean, a really excellent job of this Agent who is in charge of the scene there, Agent Rojas, conveying a lot of emotion at the hurt that happened because of this murder on this Navy base in Pensacola.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe headlines are this. It's a big crime scene. We do know that the shooter traveled around. There are eight people who were hurt, initially. We're waiting for an update on that. They didn't have update information. They asked us to be patient. It's understandable.\\n\\n\\n\\nAs for motive, they have no information available at this time. Rojas even said that the name is something they're not confirming.\\n\\n\\n\\nSo, the one that you see swirling around out there - you probably know by now, my policy is I don't talk about murderers' names in these situations, whether they're school shootings, or something that's terror-suspected, I don't believe the name is meaningful for us, frankly. But they don't have any new information.\\n\\n\\n\\nSo, let's get to the analysis of what we do know now, what the right questions are going forward.\\n\\n\\n\\nSo Phil, you were making the point that you actually did at the governmental level weigh in, almost like an actuarial kind of assessment--\\n\\n\\n\\nMUDD: Yes.\\n\\n\\n\\nCUOMO: --that yes, at some point, one of these people may likely go bad. What - what's that about?\\n\\n\\n\\nMUDD: I mean the business of America is business. Whether you're in the university business, or in the corporate business, we open our doors to ensure that America is a cultural center for the world.\\n\\n\\n\\nWe want students around the world and businessmen to see America, and to ensure that America allows businessmen and students in, to - to ensure the America - the American economy moves forward.\\n\\n\\n\\nSo, you look, and we did this at - at the FBI, and say, if we have tens of thousands, just in Saudi Arabia's case alone, tens of thousands of students coming in, you can't say you're going to close the door to that number of students.\\n\\n\\n\\nYou can step back, and say, if we're going to look at that number of students, we got to work it - with the Saudis, and determine things like simple, Chris, do they have a criminal background? Tougher. Let's look at their email or social media accounts, and see if they have any connectivity with people who are of concern.\\n\\n\\n\\nCUOMO: This guy was vetted as clean.\\n\\n\\n\\nMUDD: It's about risk mitigation. It's--\\n\\n\\n\\nCUOMO: This guy was vetted as clean.\\n\\n\\n\\nMUDD: Yes.\\n\\n\\n\\nCUOMO: One other quick thing, Phil, and I want to get to ADM.\\n\\n\\n\\nMUDD: Yes.\\n\\n\\n\\nCUOMO: You're not supposed to have gun - as anybody's been around the military, you're supposed to check weapons. You're supposed to check ammunition. This was a hand gun. How hard is it to sneak a weapon onto a base?\\n\\n\\n\\n[21:10:00]\\n\\n\\n\\nMUDD: Oh, give me a break! This is America. First, the person's been here for a while. You're talking about up to two years, according to reports, in this case.\\n\\n\\n\\nSo, if you want to go into a major military base, and ensure that everybody driving onto that base gets a full personal and car check going out of the base, no way, Chris. That's just not going to happen.\\n\\n\\n\\nCUOMO: OK.\\n\\n\\n\\nMUDD: That's easy.\\n\\n\\n\\nCUOMO: Aaron, thank you so much. It's great to have you on the show. The President was very quick to help the Saudi King give distance\\n\\n\\n\\nhere. And we have no information that this was anything other than one evil act, at this point. But when it comes to Saudi Arabia they do seem to get a wide berth from this President.\\n\\n\\n\\nDo you perceive the same? And, if so, what do you see as the basis?\\n\\n\\n\\nAARON DAVID MILLER, CNN GLOBAL AFFAIRS ANALYST: Oh, there's no question about it, Chris. It would take an atomic crowbar, I think, to separate this President from Saudi Arabia.\\n\\n\\n\\nOil money, the prospects of Saudi Arabia, not as an ally, and I consider it more a episodic security partner, and an important partner. But the President, I think, has created a margin of error and freedom of maneuver for the Saudis.\\n\\n\\n\\nHaving worked for four or five Administrations, never have I seen this degree of acquiescence or placating of Saudi Arabia.\\n\\n\\n\\nCUOMO: No.\\n\\n\\n\\nMILLER: And I think you saw it again today. The President was right to express what he heard from King Salman.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut the President could also have said, You know, I have the assurances, firm assurances from the Government of Saudi Arabia, the King himself, that they're going to cooperate, leave no stone unturned.\\n\\n\\n\\nThey'll cooperate with the FBI in Riyadh, and we're going to get to the bottom of the motivation and the circumstances in the deaths and woundings of these Americans.\\n\\n\\n\\nCUOMO: What is the risk--\\n\\n\\n\\nMILLER: That, he did not say.\\n\\n\\n\\nCUOMO: What is the risk of the gentility? This is a man, this President, who usually works on gut, as we know. 9/11 may have led this country into Iraq. But there were no Saudis involved than anyone else.\\n\\n\\n\\nThis President has talked about Islam hating this country. We do know that the Saudis export about as much money for terroristic activities as anyone in that region. We know what happened with Khashoggi. And in every one of these situations, this President has held off.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat do you think the risk is there?\\n\\n\\n\\nMILLER: Well the risk is if - you basically reinforce bad behavior. You create the logic in the mind of an already impulsive and reckless Crown Prince that in fact Mr. Trump and the Administration will have their back, and empirically, that's exactly what the Saudis have concluded. That's the risk.\\n\\n\\n\\nCUOMO: Something that is important for reminding, Phil. When people look at this, they'll be like, Well the guy is Saudi. He's a Muslim. He must hate us. That's why it's got to be terror. What are you waiting for?\\n\\n\\n\\nRemind of what an act of terrorism means to people in the government investigative capacity?\\n\\n\\n\\nMUDD: It is really frustrating for people to jump to conclusions. Let me tell you why the Bureau's not.\\n\\n\\n\\nYou've got to look for an act that has a political motivation, that is, you know what's inside the person's mind, against civilians, that is non-warring peoples, not the - not a military act overseas.\\n\\n\\n\\nSo, especially when you're asking about somebody who is operating, maybe alone, we don't know if this person was operating with somebody else, you've got to understand what they were thinking when they did this.\\n\\n\\n\\nDid they want to do this for political purposes? You got to know that. We don't know that yet, Chris.\\n\\n\\n\\nCUOMO: We don't even know if he's Muslim, frankly. I'm just talking about the--\\n\\n\\n\\nMUDD: Yes.\\n\\n\\n\\nCUOMO: --kinds of assumptions. I know that there are - you know, that of course being in Saudi Arabia, there could be a presumption, but we don't know, and there's no reason to jump.\\n\\n\\n\\nMUDD: Yes.\\n\\n\\n\\nCUOMO: Aaron, when - with what's going on right now, in terms of how we are dealing with that region of the world, we don't know that this has anything to do with it. But what is important in terms of how it's handled?\\n\\n\\n\\nMILLER: I mean it's - it - I mean, in large part, Chris, it's a - it's a question of - of American credibility.\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd it's - it's a willingness on the part of the Administration to understand that relationships in this part of the world have to be reciprocal that you don't simply apply honey in response to a security partner or an ally. Sometimes, it's necessary to - to apply vinegar as well.\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd if we don't inject this sort of reciprocity in our relations, we - we end up with a situation where you end up with bad allies, Chris, and worse adversaries. And that is in fact the conundrum that the United States faces in the Middle East today.\\n\\n\\n\\nCUOMO: The interesting thing is that, you know, you - you can imagine this President having said, You know, I'm sure you're sorry about this. Who was this guy?\\n\\n\\n\\nYou know, why it is he the one who did this? What do you know about him? Tell us what you know right away. Your people are not foreign to you, especially when you send them over here.\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd we didn't hear any of that from him. Maybe it's going on behind the scenes. But probably not, and that's the bigger question.\\n\\n\\n\\nPhil Mudd, thank you very much.\\n\\n\\n\\nMUDD: Thank you.\\n\\n\\n\\nCUOMO: ADM, I appreciate it.\\n\\n\\n\\nNow, if any other information were to arise, we'll get right back into it, and bring it to you, but that is not expected from what we heard from the FBI. It's a big scene. It's going to take them time. We don't even have any updates on the injured. If I get it, I'll give it to you.\\n\\n\\n\\nNow, this question of Well, does this make you rethink what we do? Phil Mudd said, No. We want people in here. We want military training. We want students. We want businessmen.\\n\\n\\n\\n[21:15:00]\\n\\n\\n\\nLet's ask a politician. Senator Richard Blumenthal has long called for a tougher stance against the Kingdom, not because of this shooting, but for many other reasons.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Foreign Affairs Committee Member on that, and what Rudy Giuliani means to the overall case for impeachment with the newest information, next.\\n\\n\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\n\\n\\nTEXT: CUOMO PRIME TIME.\\n\\n\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\n\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\n\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\n\\n\\nTEXT: LET'S GET AFTER IT.\\n\\n\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\n\\n\\nCUOMO: I'm sad to report, we've had a pair of shooting sprees on domestic military bases this week, five people lost their lives, murdered, a lot of questions, not a lot of answers at this point.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe situation in Pearl Harbor is very different than what we're dealing with in Pensacola, Florida, with this Saudi Arabian man, a military officer, who's been training there.\\n\\n\\n\\nWe just took the FBI presser. They're not ready to give us information about motive or whether this has any connection to terror. They said they couldn't event confirm his name.\\n\\n\\n\\n[21:20:00]\\n\\n\\n\\nConnecticut Senator, Richard Blumenthal, sits on the Armed Services and Veterans Affairs Committee.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt's good to have you, Sir, as always.\\n\\n\\n\\nSEN. RICHARD BLUMENTHAL (D-CT): Thank you, Chris.\\n\\n\\n\\nCUOMO: I'd like talk to you about how this is being handled because we don't know enough to proceed about what was done and what the response should be.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut the president could have put pressure on the Saudi King to give information about this guy. I mean this president has said all of Islam is out to get us. We don't know that the man is Muslim. But it is the predominant religion there.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut he goes easy here. He helped them separate themselves from this individual, in this event, as he's done in the past with Khashoggi.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhy do you think that happens, this apparent deference, and what does it mean to you?\\n\\n\\n\\nBLUMENTHAL: Well, first of all, as you have observed very correctly, the President has given the Saudis a very wide berth. And the exact reasons for it are somewhat a mystery. He has financial interests that may be coming into play.\\n\\n\\n\\nOne of the reasons that I, and 200 Members of Congress, have sued the President in Blumenthal versus Trump, and there'll be a hearing this Monday, is that financial interests, taking benefits and payments from foreign governments have been very much a part of this Administration.\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd the Saudis have spent a lot of money in his hotels, on his properties in New York. It may be an interest that comes into play.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut I've advocated re-evaluating the entire Saudi relationship because of the killing of Khashoggi, their disastrous military campaign in Yemen, using our arms, arguably, to kill civilians, their subjugation of civil rights, and particularly the rights of women, and they're exporting, in many instances, terrorism.\\n\\n\\n\\nYou mentioned very correctly, and this point is very profoundly important, their role in the 9/11 case. And I have advocated on behalf of the 9/11 families who still are seeking justice in our courts against the Saudis.\\n\\n\\n\\nCUOMO: Now, look, we don't know that this shooting has anything to do with any political motive whatsoever. But it would be nice to have the Saudis trying to give everything they know about this individual to us as quickly as possible.\\n\\n\\n\\nWe don't know that it's not happening. We just don't know that the President asked for it, at least in his public comments.\\n\\n\\n\\nAll right, now on to the world of the known, Rudy Giuliani, I do not believe is the bad guy in this story. I believe he's an agent. I don't know if he's a lawyer, working for the President, but he's an agent.\\n\\n\\n\\nHe's now over in Ukraine, making it very public that he is there, looking for dirt about corruption with the Obama Administration, the former Ambassador, the Bidens, it's all going on, and even a tweet that said, If Ukraine doesn't start helping in these events, they're not going to have U.S. help with their own anti-corruption reforms.\\n\\n\\n\\nSignificance?\\n\\n\\n\\nBLUMENTHAL: Giuliani is apparently continuing to pursue this crackpot conspiracy theory that the Ukrainians, not the Russians, interfered in our 2016 elections.\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd not only has that theory been completely debunked, it is, in effect, part of Putin's propaganda. It's a talking point for Vladimir Putin that it was the Ukrainians, not the Russians.\\n\\n\\n\\nEven though our entire Intelligence Community says the Russians interfered, the Senate Intelligence Committee, headed by a Republican, says that the Russians interfered. Mueller obviously found a sweeping and systematic interference by the Russians, but Giuliani, in Ukraine right now, is seeking more evidence to support this conspiracy theory.\\n\\n\\n\\nCUOMO: And he said in a tweet that the basic construct is exactly what this President's being prosecuted for, politically, right now, which is If Ukraine doesn't step up and help me with what I'm doing, they are not going to get their - the help they want with anti-corruption reform.\\n\\n\\n\\nOne, he's speaking for the United States. And two, everybody on the Republican side of the Intelligence Committee said there is no proof that there was any kind of holding them up unless they helped with Biden.\\n\\n\\n\\nHe just suggested the same. Did he not?\\n\\n\\n\\nBLUMENTHAL: He did. And he is continuing to operate this apparent shadow foreign policy that the three amigos and he pursued, now established in the very powerful evidence that's come before the Intelligence Committee.\\n\\n\\n\\nCUOMO: They say it's all hearsay. It's all hearsay and speculation.\\n\\n\\n\\nNow, they don't have an answer for why all these people were never corrected in their misbelief about what was going on. It was obviously very apparent, and contagious, and being discussed.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhy didn't ever - anybody ever say You're all wrong, except for this mystery September 9th phone call that we don't know ever really happened, where the President used the same language that the whistleblower did, except the whistleblower wasn't public yet.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe White House knew about it, used quid pro quo, he used it as well. What does that mean for you in terms of the compelling nature of the case?\\n\\n\\n\\nBLUMENTHAL: The compelling nature of the case comes from the President's own words.\\n\\n\\n\\nThat July 25th phone call is the smoking gun here, where the President of the United States is asked by the Ukrainian President in one portion, We need those anti-tank missiles.\\n\\n\\n\\n[21:25:00]\\n\\n\\n\\nThe next sentence, virtually out of the President's mouth, is I need you to do us a favor though.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat's established here is soliciting a bribe. And remember, soliciting a bribe is itself bribery.\\n\\n\\n\\nCUOMO: It doesn't have to be effected.\\n\\n\\n\\nBLUMENTHAL: It doesn't have to be effected, and it can be an act that would have been done. Anyway, it is soliciting bribery amounts to asking for a favor or a personal benefit in return for performing an official act.\\n\\n\\n\\nCUOMO: So, what do you do when the Senate, if there's a trial, and it seems like there will be, and it's obviously controlled by the Republicans, and they have Rudy Giuliani, and others, come in, and just dump tons of information about how Ukraine was the source of interference, and the Bidens and Burisma were thick with corruption, that's what that trial could be about, if they want to. They control the rules. It's just a simple majority vote.\\n\\n\\n\\nBLUMENTHAL: Their effort obviously is going to be to distract and distort. That's the meaning of Giuliani's trip abroad insofar as it tries to aid the President's defense. But it's more than distracting.\\n\\n\\n\\nCUOMO: He says he'll testify, you know, this new friend of his over there says he wants to come in and talk about it.\\n\\n\\n\\nBLUMENTHAL: The question will be whether or not the Republicans in the Senate want that kind of circus and show--\\n\\n\\n\\nCUOMO: Why wouldn't they?\\n\\n\\n\\nBLUMENTHAL: Which may undermine their position, may demean the solemn and serious effort that's underway, and here's the other point, Chris.\\n\\n\\n\\nThis theory, a conspiracy theory that has no basis in fact of law that the Ukrainians somehow interfered in our election is more than a distraction. It is actually dangerous to our national security.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt is Putin's talking point, his propaganda and disinformation. And it makes us complacent about the continuing Russian attack on our elections. Nothing could be more serious.\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd I hope my Republican colleagues will not only face their constitutional duty, to abide by the facts, and the law, but also avoid this kind of circus and show that I think will backfire on them.\\n\\n\\n\\nCUOMO: It was pleasantly surprising to hear Lindsey Graham say exactly that. It was Russia.\\n\\n\\n\\nI have to tell you, in the House side, I have to do some real dentistry to get Republicans to say Yes, the Russians did it in 2016. And you're going to be up against that when it comes to the Senate.\\n\\n\\n\\nSenator, thank you so much on a Friday night.\\n\\n\\n\\nBLUMENTHAL: Thank you.\\n\\n\\n\\nCUOMO: For being with us, and an important night as well.\\n\\n\\n\\nBLUMENTHAL: My pleasure. Thank you.\\n\\n\\n\\nCUOMO: I'll see you soon.\\n\\n\\n\\nBLUMENTHAL: Great.\\n\\n\\n\\nCUOMO: All right, so there is someone who knows a lot more about the Ukraine showdown than even maybe some Congressional investigators. Has Vladimir Putin been closely listening in on President Trump's calls?\\n\\n\\n\\nIt's a big concern. Why? Andrew McCabe explains next.\\n\\n\\n\\n[21:30:00]\\n\\n\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\n\\n\\nTEXT: CUOMO PRIME TIME.\\n\\n\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\n\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\n\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\n\\n\\nTEXT: LET'S GET AFTER IT.\\n\\n\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\n\\n\\nCUOMO: All right, if you're following Rudy's rovings, he tells CNN he is no longer in Ukraine, but he was there, and we know what he was doing, drawing a lot of attention, and really casting a pretty big shadow over this impeachment situation.\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd now let's talk about what it could mean. Let's bring in Andrew McCabe.\\n\\n\\n\\nSo, there are two big things to look at in terms of significance. Help me understand why I should care about this first one, which I only kind of care about. So, don't be nice about it.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe idea that they were communicating over cell phones, and not secure lines, Russia could be listening, why does that matter a lot?\\n\\n\\n\\nANDREW MCCABE, CNN CONTRIBUTOR: OK. So, here's why it matters. The job of every Foreign Intelligence Service is to collect what - what professionals refer to as information about the policies, plans, and intents, of your adversary.\\n\\n\\n\\nSo, their job is to go out and collect information about what our leadership is thinking, what they're planning to do, and how they're going to execute those actions. There is no bigger target in the world for policies, plans, and intense information than the President of the United States. He is the Crown Jewel of all targets.\\n\\n\\n\\nSo, let's put aside for a moment the question of whether or not the President is actually using a cell phone from the Oval Office, and think about the President speaking to someone else, in a country like Ukraine, who's using a cell phone.\\n\\n\\n\\nRight now, we know that Rudy Giuliani is - is supposedly doing that. We have reason to believe from the phone records that he has talked to the President from there before. And we know that Gordon Sondland did that as well.\\n\\n\\n\\nUkraine is probably the most thoroughly-penetrated country on earth by the Russian Intelligence Service. They operate almost com - with complete freedom there. Rudy Giuliani is known as a close adviser, and confidant, and counselor of the President.\\n\\n\\n\\nCUOMO: How easily can they tap your phone?\\n\\n\\n\\nMCCABE: Easily, Chris, very easily. In that part of the world, Intelligence Services have almost unfettered access to cellular service providers, to internet service providers, things of that - that nature.\\n\\n\\n\\nAlso, the technology to intercept individual cell phones, that are in use is widely available now, things that were like totally, you know, cutting-edge a few years ago are widely used across Intelligence Services around the globe.\\n\\n\\n\\nSo, the idea that Rudy is being covered by a Foreign Intelligence Service, I'd bet the farm on it. And if they are listening to his phone, they now know the private conversations of the President of the United States, and his attorney.\\n\\n\\n\\n[21:35:00]\\n\\n\\n\\nCUOMO: And my point of emphasis is that all they have to do is watch the news, or read Twitter, and they'll know more than they need to know about what the plans and the intent is right now because Rudy Giuliani said something that I can't believe the President's team wants him to say.\\n\\n\\n\\nHe said in a tweet, Hey Ukraine, you're not going to get U.S. help in your anti-corruption reform efforts if you don't help me with what I'm doing with the Bidens.\\n\\n\\n\\nHow is that helpful to the President's impeachment case?\\n\\n\\n\\nMCCABE: Boy, it's not helpful at all. I mean it really resonates with all of the concerns that are being voiced by the Democratic side, right, so.\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd it also undercuts, in a significant way, the President's, one of his primary defenses, which is that he was - he was pressuring Ukraine, not for his own benefit, but rather to address legitimate corruption issues.\\n\\n\\n\\nHaving his own personal attorney off the grid doing God-knows-what in Ukraine, talking to people like Andriy Derkach who has a - an extensive historical connection with Russian-backed politicians and Intelligence officials in Ukraine, I mean it's just a perfect storm of - of bad circumstances.\\n\\n\\n\\nCUOMO: Well you're certainly not going to have a hard time finding Russians in Ukraine, who want to put stink on Ukraine for what happened in 2016. We know that out of Putin's own mouth.\\n\\n\\n\\nNow, here's the part I don't get Andrew. This is why we need your mind on this.\\n\\n\\n\\nI don't understand how any of this helps the case. Forget about the subtle threat to Ukraine, to step up, otherwise they're not going to get the U.S. help, which is exactly what the President's accused of doing.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut even if Rudy's right about everything, Obama was dirty, you can't - you know - you know, the former Ambassador was dirty, the Bidens with Burisma was done a little dirty, even if he's right about all of it, how does it change the case against the President, because it's still how you went about getting that type of investigation done.\\n\\n\\n\\nYou should have done it yourself, or in the Senate, with the DOJ. You're not supposed to go to Ukraine, and hold up aid to get it, even if it's true. Isn't that right?\\n\\n\\n\\nMCCABE: That is right. That's absolutely right. So - so, why he's doing this? I mean only Rudy knows. But two things I would suggest.\\n\\n\\n\\nOne, there is clear political value to the President to just create a distraction, to go, to put up as many false narratives and conspiracy theories to get people thinking about those potential bad things rather than the bad things that the President is alleged to have done.\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd the second thing is I do think that there's an element here of Rudy kind of saving himself in a way.\\n\\n\\n\\nHe seems to be going like further and further down this rabbit hole, in an effort maybe to find the one, you know, verifiable piece of proof that will show the world that Ah-ha, he was right all along.\\n\\n\\n\\nCUOMO: And he may be right. He can be right. And it doesn't change the analysis. That's why I always say, you know, people think it's personal, even though, you know, Rudy basically tried to decapitate me on television.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut that I say he's not the problem here. Rudy is the agent. That's all he is. If he's right about all of it, Burisma, the Bidens, Ukraine, fine. Present the evidence. Let's see what we do about it. It doesn't change the analysis. It's not about Rudy.\\n\\n\\n\\nMCCABE: Yes.\\n\\n\\n\\nCUOMO: It's about how the President went about getting what he wanted, and why. Andrew, I'm out of time. Thank you so much. Have a great weekend. And I appreciate it. You're always a plus for the audience.\\n\\n\\n\\nMCCABE: Thanks, Chris.\\n\\n\\n\\nCUOMO: All right, something very important has come up. The President's bringing it to our attention, and I pass it along to you right now.\\n\\n\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\n\\n\\nTRUMP: We have a situation where we're looking very strongly at sinks and showers and other elements of bathrooms where you turn the faucet on.\\n\\n\\n\\nPeople are flushing toilets 10 times, 15 times.\\n\\n\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\n\\n\\nCUOMO: And the Democrats don't have somebody that for sure can beat this guy?\\n\\n\\n\\nI want to bring in the Wizard of Odds.

Now, it seems they're scrambling to find anyone who can beat this President. But today, we got a good look at what they are up against.\\n\\n\\n\\nThis was the President trying to attack the EPA for over-regulating. But he did it like this.\\n\\n\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\n\\n\\nTRUMP: We have a situation where we're looking very strongly at sinks and showers and other elements of bathrooms where you turn the faucet on in areas where there's tremendous amounts of water, where the water rushes out to sea because you could never handle it, and you don't get any water.\\n\\n\\n\\nYou turn on the faucet. You don't get any water. They take a shower and water comes dripping out. It's dripping out, very quietly dripping out.\\n\\n\\n\\nPeople are flushing toilets 10 times, 15 times, as opposed to once. They end up using more water. So, EPA is looking at that very strongly, at my suggestion.\\n\\n\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\n\\n\\nCUOMO: At his suggestion! And you wonder why Bloomberg got in! And yet, this President is seen as very formidable to the Wizard of Odds himself, Harry Enten, and here is why.\\n\\n\\n\\nDespite what we just heard--\\n\\n\\n\\nHARRY ENTEN, CNN POLITICS SENIOR WRITER AND ANALYST: Yes.\\n\\n\\n\\nCUOMO: --and the hypocrisy of the fact that his Administration has been hurting water standards, hurting the money for keeping things protected, he's basically attacking over-regulation, big government.\\n\\n\\n\\nENTEN: Sure.\\n\\n\\n\\nCUOMO: He's still tough to beat not because of how he is, but because of what's gone on, despite him, mostly in the economy. What do we know?\\n\\n\\n\\nENTEN: Yes. So, I think this is rather important. First, let me just say, what a Shabbos (ph) conversation, toilets and so on, so forth.\\n\\n\\n\\nCUOMO: I know. But let's--\\n\\n\\n\\n(CROSSTALK)\\n\\n\\n\\nENTEN: But OK - ha, ha, ha, hilarious!\\n\\n\\n\\nCUOMO: Thank you.\\n\\n\\n\\nENTEN: Look, this is basically the yearly job growth weighted each - weighted over each terms last two years. And what we see here is that the winners tend to have very good job growth, right? All of them had at least 1.1 percent or above.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe blow-outs, Nixon, 3.6 percent, 4.1 percent for Reagan.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe losers on the other hand tended to have pretty poor job growth. Carter and Bush, of course, basically got blown out, and they were below 1 percent.\\n\\n\\n\\nSo, what we see here is very clearly what has often been described as It's the economy, stupid! And we see that to be the case. CUOMO: We just got more good job numbers and some income pressure going up that helps the President as well.\\n\\n\\n\\nENTEN: Yes, so look, let's put this into some context where the President is versus where the winners versus the losers were.\\n\\n\\n\\n[21:45:00]\\n\\n\\n\\nSo, the average yearly job growth, again, in those final two years, the Presidents who won re-election, 2.5 percent growth, the Presidents who lost, they averaged 1 percent growth.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhere is Trump? Trump over the last year is right in the middle there at 1.5 percent. And I think this is rather important.\\n\\n\\n\\nCUOMO: But he sells it as being the best ever.\\n\\n\\n\\nENTEN: Well he sells a lot of things at being the best ever, you know. So, that's not too much of a surprise. Sometimes he sells toilet pressures being the best ever.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut I think this is rather important is that growth is what's important. It's not the absolute levels. It's basically where you've grown, and basically with the economy at this point, we're kind of running into a wall, since we're near max employment.\\n\\n\\n\\nCUOMO: So, you think that the Democrats can use the economy against this President?\\n\\n\\n\\nENTEN: I - I - I think that the economy is not the Silver Bullet that he necessarily thinks it is, although it's certainly rather helpful because, you know, if you take a look here, what we see is Trump standing on the economy, his approval rating 55 percent in our latest poll, but that is below his overall approval rating of 42 percent.\\n\\n\\n\\nSo clearly, voters are judging him stronger on the economy than overall, which is perhaps why he should be talking more about the economy than about other things.\\n\\n\\n\\nCUOMO: But - and this also goes to the point I made on the last panel, which is he sells it as the best ever. It's obviously working.\\n\\n\\n\\nENTEN: It--\\n\\n\\n\\nCUOMO: Because the number of growth, that growth percentage you're showing, middle-of-the-road, would not justify 55 percent.\\n\\n\\n\\nENTEN: Yes. It's certainly working to the extent that if, you know, basically you were to say, OK, if you approve of Trump's job, why is it? Here are the top five reasons. This is rather interesting.\\n\\n\\n\\nSo, among those who say they approve of Trump's job, 26 percent say the economy, look at this, jobs and unemployment, 8 percent, getting things done, doing a good job, generally speaking, again, related to the economy, 10 and 9 percent.\\n\\n\\n\\nSo, people who approve of the job that the President is doing, they do so because of the economy.\\n\\n\\n\\nCUOMO: So, if you are looking to figure out what the best avenue is for change, what is it? Is it to go with the man directly?\\n\\n\\n\\nENTEN: Yes, I - I - I think that that's exactly right.\\n\\n\\n\\nIf you were to say why should we change this President, look at these, these are Trump's qualities, essentially Presidential qualities, has stamina and sharpness to be a President, could bring the type of change the country needs, so on, so forth, you can read that, you see it up on the screen.\\n\\n\\n\\nLook at this. This is so important because on this, yes, what do we see? Majorities all say in fact No, he does not have these qualities.\\n\\n\\n\\nMajorities are saying the President doesn't have these Presidential qualities. And that is why, in spite of what they approve of as a strong economy, he is behind, at least in a number of the horserace polls that we've seen so far.\\n\\n\\n\\nSo, go after the man, say he's un-Presidential. And that's why I think you saw a lot of good response to Biden's ad this week.\\n\\n\\n\\nCUOMO: Do you think you could have - you could name another person who could ever win a Presidential election talking about people needing to flush 10 to 15 times?\\n\\n\\n\\nENTEN: No. But, you know, perhaps that might be a Student Council election. I should have used that.\\n\\n\\n\\nCUOMO: One-of-a-kind, one-of-a-kind.\\n\\n\\n\\nENTEN: One-of-a-kind, just like you.\\n\\n\\n\\nCUOMO: Wiz, thank you so much.\\n\\n\\n\\nENTEN: Good Sabbaths.

This is a tough one tonight.\\n\\n\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\n\\n\\n(JULY 10, 2015, COLUMBIA, SOUTH CAROLINA VIDEO OF CROWD CHEERING THE CONFEDERATE FLAG COMING DOWN)\\n\\n\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\n\\n\\nCUOMO: This moment was a defining moment for then-Governor Nikki Haley, when the Confederate Flag came down at South Carolina State, at the Capitol, and after the Charleston Church massacre. It was big. It meant a lot all over the country and for her personally.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut now, Haley is floating a new theory about why the flag had to come down. Listen to this.\\n\\n\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\n\\n\\nNIKKI HALEY, FORMER UNITED STATES AMBASSADOR TO THE UNITED NATIONS: Here is this guy that comes out with his manifesto, holding the Confederate flag, and had just hijacked everything that people thought of.\\n\\n\\n\\nYou know, people saw it as service, and sacrifice, and heritage, and - but once he did that, there - there was no way to overcome it.\\n\\n\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\n\\n\\nCUOMO: Service, sacrifice, and heritage? Service to slavery, the sacrifice of the slaves, and the heritage of slavery, that's what it was about.\\n\\n\\n\\nHaley knows one murderer didn't co-opt that flag. He used it for what it is, like every other bigot and White extremist, these guys, the KKK, neo-Nazis, Right-wing nationalists.\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd again, Haley knows this. This is the worst part. Here's the proof.\\n\\n\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\n\\n\\nHALEY: It just never should have been there.\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd these grounds are a place that should be that belonged to the people of South Carolina. And what I realize, now more than ever, is people were driving by, and they felt hurt, and pain. No one should feel pain.\\n\\n\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP) CUOMO: Never should have been there. She got it, and she should, because it was, is, and always has been obvious, especially as a family like hers, immigrants who felt the sting of being an Other.\\n\\n\\n\\nSo, the question is, why pump up this flag? Is she falling in line with this Trumpy forgetfulness of what bigotry is, the malignancy of it? Is she trying to curry favor with certain voters like the leader of her Party does?\\n\\n\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\n\\n\\nTRUMP: You know what I am? I'm a nationalist, OK? I'm a nationalist.\\n\\n\\n\\n(CROWD CHEERING)\\n\\n\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\n\\n\\nCUOMO: You really want to be like that, playing with ideas and labels that are used by White nationalists, 20th Century dictators, and now, apparently the President of the United States?\\n\\n\\n\\nYou're going to start to wonder about whether Islam is now out to get us because maybe this Saudi murderer is Muslim, and the Navy base is proof that she's got to be like her ex-boss?\\n\\n\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\n\\n\\nTRUMP: Donald J. Trump is calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States.\\n\\n\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\n\\n\\nCUOMO: It's not about Haley. It's bigger than she is.

They're bringing crime. They're rapists.\\n\\n\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\n\\n\\nCUOMO: Is this what Nikki Haley wants to be? Talk like bigotry is benign, nationalism is patriotism, xenophobia is just common sense suspicion of an entire faith? It is not OK. And we know where Trump got it. He went out early in this process to visit Steve King, as in the King of Contempt for Latinos.\\n\\n\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\n\\n\\nREP. STEVE KING (R-IA): For everyone who's a valedictorian, there's another 100 out there that they weigh a 130 pounds, and they've got calves the size of cantaloupes because they're hauling 75 pounds of marijuana across the desert.\\n\\n\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\n\\n\\n[21:55:00]\\n\\n\\n\\nCUOMO: Right. You know, he learned from that guy, from Tom Tancredo. He learned that that could be effective with a certain population of his Party.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut is that who Haley wants to be? She was seen as this Party's, you know, the hope. I'll get more of that in a second because what the Party is dealing with right now is capitulation to this fetid BS.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe biggest indicator of this Party's leaning has become its silence. It is like the malignancy of the ideas from this President will lead nowhere but to more victory, so Shh!\\n\\n\\n\\nWell the midterms told you otherwise, but so should this. You don't sell hate in America.\\n\\n\\n\\nYou don't do that, and get a majority, not now, not ever. Too many of us are just a couple generations removed from being the people you attack or that you just sit quiet in the face of when some big-shot is doing the same. You empower what you ignore. And you are complicit in what you excuse. Silence is not safety.\\n\\n\\n\\nThat's the problem with Nikki Haley, saying what she did about the Confederate flag. She's ignoring the obvious, and we know that she knows it's obvious, because she said it before she said what she said now.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe latest example of a Party that has surrendered principle for - for power, and we see it with impeachment, collective blindness of the obvious.\\n\\n\\n\\nThey all know Trump was wrong to do what he did, how he did it, and why he did it. They know. They were more righteous about Clinton's escapades than this obvious escapade to procure foreign help in the election.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut the normalization of evil symbols and words is even more toxic than impeachment.\\n\\n\\n\\nNikki Haley, please, tell us you didn't mean it, tell us that you haven't surrendered the truth for some Trumpy notion of popularity. So many saw you as the hope for the future of your Party. Don't stand as proof that hope is lost.

But a lawyer for seven women who are suing the university over its handling of sexual harassment allegations say the efforts miss the mark.\\n\\nThe announcement comes nearly two months after a federal complaint was filed against the Ivy League school by seven current and former graduate students who allege three professors created a toxic environment where female subjects were routinely subjected to sexual harassment and even rape.\\n\\nA school inquiry led to the resignations of the three professors in 2018 and the school pledged to take steps to improve the campus culture. The new Campus Climate and Culture Initiative is the latest step in that direction, school officials said in a press release.\\n\\nThe new program will include the following components:\\n\\n- A single policy to address sexual misconduct for faculty, staff, and students, with appropriate processes for adjudicating potential violations;\\n\\n- A mandatory online sexual violence prevention training program for all faculty, staff, professional and graduate students, and postdoctoral scholars;\\n\\n- Research advisory committees for all graduate programs to ensure that all graduate students have access to multiple advisors.\\n\\nThe announcement comes as American universities grapple with how to handle allegations of campus sexual misconduct and their obligations under Title IX, the federal law that bars discrimination based on sex, including harassment, in federally funded education programs and activities.\\n\\nThe Department of Education in November proposed new rules for dealing with sexual harassment and assault on college campuses that would bolster the rights of those accused of wrongdoing.\\n\\nThe lawsuit accuses the New Hampshire school of failing to create an environment free from gender-based discrimination, in violation of Title IX.\\n\\nDartmouth says the new program will expand the school's Title IX office, which is responsible for reviewing reports of sexual misconduct and conducting investigations. The school also pledged to increase mental health resources at Dartmouth and said that an outside expert who specializes in creating inclusive communities will review academic departments.\\n\\nThe lawsuit claims that the prominent researchers, who no longer are allowed on campus, coerced female students into drinking and made the women feel as if their success depended on their willingness to participate in their alcohol-saturated culture the men created.\\n\\nThe complaint claims that Dartmouth knew about the professors' behavior for more than 16 years and did nothing until 2017, when several female graduate students reported the allegations to the college's Title IX office. During the Title IX investigation, the lawsuit claims that Dartmouth failed to provide the plaintiffs with support, accommodations or guidance, then unilaterally terminated the disciplinary process without seeking their input.\\n\\nPreviously, school officials said they applauded the courage of the women who came forward. However, we respectfully, but strongly, disagree with the characterizations of Dartmouth's actions in the complaint and will respond through our own court filings, they said.\\n\\nDeborah Marcuse, an attorney representing seven women plaintiffs in the sexual harassment lawsuit, said the initiatives miss the mark and simply bring the school into compliance with federal law.\\n\\nTo the extent that Dartmouth is now seeking to conform its policies to what federal law requires, we certainly support that though we think it's long overdue, Marcuse said. What's striking about this is that Dartmouth continues to fail to acknowledge or accept responsibility for the damage that its long history of inaction has caused.\\n\\nMarcuse faulted the school for not reaching out to her clients for their input. Dartmouth's formal response to their complaint is due in a little over a week on January 15.\\n\\nIt appears to us that for all of the lip service to their courage, there has been no interest from Dartmouth in materially responding to or really listening to these women despite a lot of vague call outs to 'we want to include everyone and everything', she said.\\n\\nIf you just look at the nature of the various responses there really just isn't any acknowledgment that what these women experienced is something that has had any impact on Dartmouth at all."}

Nicole Mason C. Nicole Mason\\n\\nGains in the stock market and the robust economy obscure the reality that many of the most marginalized workers, those with limited skills and education, are still struggling. Under Trump, the wealthy are doing extremely well, while the middle-class is hanging on.\\n\\nOn Friday, more than 800,000 federal workers across the country will go without a paycheck if the government fails to reopen. Trump says these workers will make adjustments as the shutdown could last months, even years. This, no doubt, will have a trickle-down effect on small businesses and others who rely on these workers to purchase goods and products.\\n\\nThe wall between Mexico and the United States, cheered by Trump's most ardent supporters as a metaphorical and political symbol of America First, has lost its appeal to some as the government shutdown has dragged on. Furloughed workers and those who sympathize with them have begun to realize the wall will not feed their families, keep their lights on or make sure their mortgage is paid.\\n\\nBut there are other reasons American workers may be disenchanted with the President. Trump campaigned on a promise to bring back coal mining jobs. Yet, as Bloomberg reported, analysts say that Trump's plan for the coal industry is not likely to have a large effect on its fortunes.\\n\\nAt campaign rallies and in interviews, Trump likes to say that he turned the West Virginia economy around by cutting energy regulations, but over the last decade, middle-class West Virginia households have seen no overall income gains from the state's modest economic growth, and there has been no sustained surge in the state's economy under Trump. These kinds of results will continue unless we are able to turn away from the divisive politics and rhetoric, and focus on building an economy that works for the majority of Americans – not just the few.\\n\\nWorking-class black and Latino Americans are also losing under Trump. In his address to the nation Tuesday night, President Trump asserted that illegal migration hurts all Americans by driving down jobs and wages, specifically impacting African-Americans and Hispanics. This is a bid to whip up support among both groups for the wall and his nativist immigration policies.\\n\\nWhile it is true that African-Americans and Hispanics tend to be employed in lower wage jobs than white and Asian workers, and compete in the labor market with undocumented immigrants for those jobs, it cannot be ignored that some US employers and corporations often exploit immigrant labor for their gain, by paying them less, forcing them to work in deplorable conditions, or threatening to deport them if they complain.\\n\\nThese habits not only harm undocumented immigrants, but American middle-class workers as well by suppressing wages and making it nearly impossible to demand safer working conditions or benefits without the fear of being fired. If Trump is concerned about the well-being of these black and Hispanic American workers, he should do more than suggest a wall to address the income disparity.\\n\\nCome March, if the government fails to reopen, tens of millions of Americans could lose their Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits, putting their families at risk of food insecurity. According to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, in 2017, 42 million Americans participated in the SNAP program – and more than 44% of them were in working families. It is hard to accept that this protracted and partisan skirmish over a wall could soon bring real hardship to the lives of the most vulnerable Americans.\\n\\nGet our free weekly newsletter Sign up for CNN Opinion's new newsletter.\\n\\nJoin us on Twitter and Facebook\\n\\nIn 2016, the white working class was cautiously optimistic, while others of us held our breath for the deal-maker and mega-businessman Donald Trump to work his magic to bring back jobs and revive struggling industries. It hasn't happened.\\n\\nIt is time to admit there is no sensible agenda, policy or plan for the working or middle class to thrive in Trump's America. Once we do, we'll be better able to focus our energy on identifying a leader who prioritizes all of us."}

It could also be an attempt to signal to recalcitrant congressional Republicans that cut:[President] Trump is serious about his threat to walk away from health care legislation if the AHCA fails in the House.\\n\\nEither way, the announcements come amid mounting doubts about Republicans' ability to pass the bill through the House.\\n\\nAt the same time on Friday, White House officials were trying to offload responsibility for the health care bill's possible failure onto House Speaker Paul Ryan.\\n\\nOne senior administration official told CNNMoney that Ryan will be blamed if the bill doesn't pass, whereas Trump will get credit if it does.\\n\\nNot Ryan's finest hour, the senior administration official said.\\n\\nIf the White House is indeed trying to distract attention away from the health care fight, it hasn't been working.

Since October, the Fed has pumped $60 billion into the world's financial markets each month. The Fed said it would continue those purchases to maintain reserve balances at or above the levels that prevailed in early September 2019.\\n\\nInvestors have been looking for clues from the Fed on whether the pace of those purchases would slow down. Powell provided a note of optimism that its support for the short-term lending market won't last forever: He said the Fed is buying more short-term Treasury bonds and fewer long-term Treasuries, which should reduce the need for the Fed to continue propping up that market.\\n\\nPowell predicted the short-term lending market would be adequately funded with at least $1.5 trillion by sometime in the second quarter, and the Fed will gradually reduce the amount of support it offers to shore up the market, which banks use to fund their loans.

We would then focus on paying off & refinancing the debt! There is almost no inflation-this is the time (2 years later!)\\n\\nLast year, the Fed cut rates three times to help bolster the economic expansion, one of the longest in history, amid the Trump administration's turbulent trade negotiations with China.\\n\\nTrade worries\\n\\nPolicymakers at this month's meeting were buoyed by the fact that a number of headwinds facing the economy had appeared to wane, including the signing of a preliminary trade deal with China, a budget to fund the federal government and the outcome of the elections in the United Kingdom.\\n\\nFed officials have also signaled that any unexpected twists could force them to lower rates in the future.\\n\\nFears of a slowdown in global growth have been renewed due to the coronavirus outbreak in China as well ongoing tensions between the US and Iran following the killing of top Iranian Gen. Qasem Soleimani in early January.\\n\\nEven without the outbreak taking hold in the US, the domestic economy could be impacted somewhat by the effect of disruptions to supply chains and reduced travel, mainly in Asia, that are already underway, Kevin Burgett, a founding member of the economics research team at Monetary Policy Analytics, wrote in a note to clients.\\n\\nDiane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton, also told clients that in 2003 the SARS virus caused a fairly sharp slowdown in growth in China, shaving 2% off GDP and had spillover effects in 37 countries.\\n\\nNow, China is much more connected to the rest of the world and has fewer ways to offset economic weakness, wrote Swonk."}

The opinions in this article belong to the author.\\n\\n(CNN) That's right, Britain's governing Conservative Party is having another leadership crisis. It must be because it's Monday.\\n\\nJust over a year ago, when British Prime Minister Theresa May gave her uncompromising Brexit speech at London's Lancaster House , the hardline Brexiteers were sure they had won.\\n\\nIt's worth remembering how uncompromising it was. Britain's best-selling Sun newspaper dwelt on her threat to withdraw security cooperation with the EU, if Brussels didn't give Britain a favorable exit deal. PM's Brexit Threat to EU: Your Money or Your Lives, screamed the headline.\\n\\nBut then she called the election to win a mandate to take back control of our laws, our borders and our money -- and lost.\\n\\nInstead of basking in triumph at Downing Street, she now clings to power because her party, like her country, is split down the middle. Her own Chancellor (finance minister) and Home Secretary, to say nothing of the civil service, wholly oppose her policy, but are too weak to change it either.\\n\\nToo weak -- but not silent. Philip Hammond, the Chancellor, told an audience of ultramontane globalists at Davos that he hoped to make only modest changes to Britain's relationship with the EU.\\n\\nBut this has given Brexiteers the right to ask what's the point of going to all the trouble of leaving the EU, only to end up with modest changes?\\n\\nWhatever happened to what is, after all, UK government policy of taking back control of borders, laws and money? What if it wasn't just her belligerent language on security that had been replaced by a far wiser unconditional guarantee to come to Europe's military aid? What if her whole Brexit policy was coming unstuck? The Brexiteers had to make their presence felt before it was too late.\\n\\nIf the Chancellor's intervention provided the pretext, the EU's own negotiation guidelines provide the real reason: Brexit will take time to implement, and this has given rise to the notion of a transition period. The term's a misnomer. Everyone has always known that far from a smooth gradation towards Brexit, it is just a delay of most of its effects.\\n\\nJUST WATCHED Why the Irish border is impacting Brexit Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Why the Irish border is impacting Brexit 01:59\\n\\nThe EU is prepared to grant Britain a so-called transition -- but on the condition that EU law continues to apply to the UK while it goes on and Britain does not get a vote in European institutions. Brexiteers have finally decided that this, which had been acceptable to them this summer, is now a concession too far.\\n\\nIt would, said anti-European leader Jacob Rees-Mogg, a man whose effete demeanor disguises fanaticism of Cromwellian intensity, render Britain a vassal state.\\n\\nThe hardliners are afraid their country would end up in a gilded cage. By keeping disruption to a minimum, it would prove far too convenient to extend such a status indefinitely (they overlook that the EU itself has said it can't go beyond 2020). This Eunuch Brexit, which was supposed to make Britons tough and free, would have achieved the exact opposite.\\n\\nHammond's unguarded remarks gave the hardliners an excuse to launch their latest rising.\\n\\nThe instrument this time was Graham Brady, the MP who chairs the Conservative backbench group the 1922 committee and must trigger a vote of confidence in the Prime Minister if he receives 48 letters from Tory MPs saying they would like one.\\n\\nPretending he was concerned for her safety -- but obviously communicating the reverse -- he let it be known that the number was awfully close to the threshold. Nice leadership you've got there, shame if anything would happen to it. Can I interest you in some Brexit insurance, Madam?\\n\\nStill, this Brexit mob has been living off the reputation it gained in the 1990s, when it subjected then Prime Minister John Major's government to legislative guerrilla warfare.\\n\\nThe current crop are, by comparison, soft. They plead loyalty to the Prime Minister. They have accepted concessions on everything from Northern Ireland to budget contributions and even the role of the European Court of Justice in overseeing elements of British law that they had previously insisted were unthinkable.\\n\\nThe rules to replace a Conservative leader -- who at the moment is also the Prime Minister -- eventually work in the hardliners' favor. The final decision is made by party members, who will vote for the most pro-Brexit of candidates.\\n\\nBut before that they have to win the vote of no confidence in the incumbent. There's every risk that they would lose it, and be left with their worst nightmare -- a weak prime minister hostage not to them, but to the MPs who voted remain and favor a softer Brexit.\\n\\nThe hardliners need her to resign before the confidence vote can take place, and for that they need some of her cabinet ministers to walk out. The ministers will have to do so under the shadow of the ancient rule of leadership contests: He who wields the dagger never wears the crown.\\n\\nIf they are to remove May, at least two cabinet ministers will have to sacrifice their ambitions to replace her. Unless they discover such courage, May will keep going, as though she herself were one of Margaret Thatcher's policy programs: Because there is no alternative."}

If no changes are made, the CBO projects that public debt will rise to 96% of GDP by 2028.

It also shouldn't burden those who have operated harmoniously within our communities for decades, and who already comply with AMA's registration system.\\n\\nOther players in the drone world felt differently about the news. AUVSI, a leading robotics organization, said Friday it planned to work with Congress to make drone registration possible in order to help create a culture of safety that deters careless and reckless behavior.\\n\\nDrone registration is a good policy because it promotes accountability and provides an opportunity for the FAA to educate pilots on the guidelines for safe operation, Brendan Schulman, the vice president of policy and legal affairs at DJI, told CNNTech. DJI is the world's largest drone manufacturer.\\n\\nThe court's decision does not impact registration for commercial drones."}
{"original": "Miguel Ramirez Valiente speaks to reporters from the pulpit at All Souls Unitarian Universalist Church in Colorado Springs, Colorado, where he says he's taken sanctuary because he can't fight his case in court.\\n\\n(CNN) —\\n\\nAn undocumented immigrant in Colorado says he's taken shelter in a church because the government shutdown leaves him with no other choice.\\n\\nMiguel Ramirez Valiente is facing a deportation order – but his lawyer says right now he has no way to fight it.\\n\\nMost immigration courts are shuttered because of the shutdown. Judges are only hearing the cases of detained immigrants, while other cases are being postponed. But Immigration and Customs Enforcement's fugitive operations and removal divisions are still operating.\\n\\nSo Ramirez Valiente stood at the pulpit at All Souls Unitarian Universalist Church in Colorado Springs, Colorado, on Wednesday and told reporters he was seeking sanctuary to fight for the chance to remain with his wife and three children.\\n\\nAttorney Lisa Guerra said that Ramirez didn't realize until recently that officials had reopened the immigration case against him last year. Ramirez, she says, missed a court date in October because notice never reached him. He learned in December that he'd been ordered removed, she says.\\n\\nGuerra said she's filed a motion to reopen the case in the Denver Immigration Court, which is closed. And now her hands are tied.\\n\\nWith the government shutdown, mail basically goes into a box, she told reporters. There are no judges to decide that motion to reopen. There is no office of chief council to speak with about the case. … We are basically in a legal limbo, waiting for the government to reopen.\\n\\nWife: 'My three children and I are terrified'\\n\\nIn an automated email reply to CNN's request for comment on the case, ICE said its media personnel can't respond to queries due to the shutdown.\\n\\nNotifications are sent to someone's last known address, an ICE official told CNN. The official said they could not comment on Ramirez's case, but said that in general, not receiving notice is not a legal defense.\\n\\nICE fugitive operations and removals are continuing during the shutdown, the official said, but some removals are delayed because immigration courts aren't hearing cases for immigrants that aren't detained. And some attorneys for the agency are furloughed.\\n\\nRamirez, a stonemason, said gang violence forced him to flee El Salvador 14 years ago. He's been fighting his immigration case since 2011, after a traffic stop by a local sheriff landed him in ICE custody.\\n\\nA judge administratively closed the removal case against him last year, Guerra said, after Ramirez survived a workplace assault and applied for a visa for crime victims.\\n\\nRamirez said he would have showed up in court if he'd known the case against him had been reopened.\\n\\nI've been fighting my case for eight years, he said. I never missed a court date.\\n\\nHis wife, Alisha Ramirez Valiente, told reporters Wednesday that she didn't know what she'd do if authorities sent her husband to El Salvador.\\n\\nThe government shutdown is tearing our family apart. My three children and I are terrified that he will be deported. His children need him. So do I, she said. I hope that him being in sanctuary will give him enough time for the government to reopen and his motion to be reviewed.\\n\\nDozens in sanctuary\\n\\nThe partial government shutdown has lasted for weeks as President Trump and lawmakers spar over funding for his proposed border wall. Much of the US immigration system has ground to a halt during the stalemate.\\n\\nImmigration courts that don't handle detainees' cases are completely closed.\\n\\nAnd it could be a matter of years, not a matter of a few weeks, before postponed cases are heard in court, the head of the immigration judges' union told CNN last week.\\n\\nIt's a huge, huge disruption for the orderly processing of cases, Judge Ashley Tabaddor said, describing the shutdown as another disruption on top of the docket shuffling the administration already does.\\n\\nIt's not clear why Ramirez's case was reopened last year. Officials from the Executive Office for Immigration Review, the branch of the Justice Department that runs US immigration courts, could not be immediately reached for comment. Many judges and office employees have been furloughed as a result of the partial government shutdown.\\n\\nLast year, former US Attorney General Jeff Sessions ruled that immigration judges were not allowed to use their discretion to close cases. Closure effectively ended proceedings but didn't dismiss cases altogether.\\n\\nRamirez is one of some 50 immigrants who've taken sanctuary in churches since President Trump took office, according to Church World Service.\\n\\nThey are searching for solutions to their immigration cases and hoping ICE will stick to its policy of not arresting anyone in sensitive locations – schools, hospitals or houses of worship – except in extenuating circumstances.\\n\\nOn Wednesday, the Colorado Springs church's minister told reporters that her congregation was honored to offer sanctuary to Ramirez.\\n\\nIt's important to remember the true crisis is not at the border, but rather within the borders of the United States, beyond hardworking government employees being put on furlough and services being shut down, the Rev. Nori Rost said. The true crisis we face is the moral one of not honoring the country's history of providing a safe haven for those fleeing violence.\\n\\nCNN's Sara Weisfeldt, Geneva Sands, Samuel Romano and Priscilla Alvarez contributed to this report."}

Authorities said Tuesday, Oct. 31, 2017, that three Dartmouth psychology professors are under criminal investigation for allegations of sexual misconduct. The previous week the college said the professors were put on paid leave and had their access to campus restricted due to allegations of serious misconduct. The college later told authorities it had received allegations of sexual misconduct. (AP Photo/Jim Cole, File)\\n\\n(CNN) —\\n\\nDartmouth College says it is launching a new initiative to combat sexual harassment and abuses of power on campus. But a lawyer for seven women who are suing the university over its handling of sexual harassment allegations say the efforts miss the mark.\\n\\nThe announcement comes nearly two months after a federal complaint was filed against the Ivy League school by seven current and former graduate students who allege three professors created a toxic environment where female subjects were routinely subjected to sexual harassment and even rape.\\n\\nA school inquiry led to the resignations of the three professors in 2018 and the school pledged to take steps to improve the campus culture. The new Campus Climate and Culture Initiative is the latest step in that direction, school officials said in a press release.\\n\\nThe new program will include the following components:\\n\\n- A single policy to address sexual misconduct for faculty, staff, and students, with appropriate processes for adjudicating potential violations;\\n\\n- A mandatory online sexual violence prevention training program for all faculty, staff, professional and graduate students, and postdoctoral scholars;\\n\\n- Research advisory committees for all graduate programs to ensure that all graduate students have access to multiple advisors.\\n\\nThe announcement comes as American universities grapple with how to handle allegations of campus sexual misconduct and their obligations under Title IX, the federal law that bars discrimination based on sex, including harassment, in federally funded education programs and activities.\\n\\nThe Department of Education in November proposed new rules for dealing with sexual harassment and assault on college campuses that would bolster the rights of those accused of wrongdoing.\\n\\nThe lawsuit accuses the New Hampshire school of failing to create an environment free from gender-based discrimination, in violation of Title IX.\\n\\nDartmouth says the new program will expand the school's Title IX office, which is responsible for reviewing reports of sexual misconduct and conducting investigations. The school also pledged to increase mental health resources at Dartmouth and said that an outside expert who specializes in creating inclusive communities will review academic departments.\\n\\nThe lawsuit claims that the prominent researchers, who no longer are allowed on campus, coerced female students into drinking and made the women feel as if their success depended on their willingness to participate in their alcohol-saturated culture the men created.\\n\\nThe complaint claims that Dartmouth knew about the professors' behavior for more than 16 years and did nothing until 2017, when several female graduate students reported the allegations to the college's Title IX office. During the Title IX investigation, the lawsuit claims that Dartmouth failed to provide the plaintiffs with support, accommodations or guidance, then unilaterally terminated the disciplinary process without seeking their input.\\n\\nPreviously, school officials said they applauded the courage of the women who came forward. However, we respectfully, but strongly, disagree with the characterizations of Dartmouth's actions in the complaint and will respond through our own court filings, they said.\\n\\nDeborah Marcuse, an attorney representing seven women plaintiffs in the sexual harassment lawsuit, said the initiatives miss the mark and simply bring the school into compliance with federal law.\\n\\nTo the extent that Dartmouth is now seeking to conform its policies to what federal law requires, we certainly support that though we think it's long overdue, Marcuse said. What's striking about this is that Dartmouth continues to fail to acknowledge or accept responsibility for the damage that its long history of inaction has caused.\\n\\nMarcuse faulted the school for not reaching out to her clients for their input. Dartmouth's formal response to their complaint is due in a little over a week on January 15.\\n\\nIt appears to us that for all of the lip service to their courage, there has been no interest from Dartmouth in materially responding to or really listening to these women despite a lot of vague call outs to 'we want to include everyone and everything', she said.\\n\\nIf you just look at the nature of the various responses there really just isn't any acknowledgment that what these women experienced is something that has had any impact on Dartmouth at all."}
{"original": "New York Federal Reserve President William Dudley sat for an interview with CNN's Richard Quest on Tuesday.\\n\\nHere is the transcript of that interview.\\n\\nRichard Quest: Mr. President, thank you, sir. Much appreciated. There's a lot to talk about, but don't worry, we won't talk about it all. We'll be judicious in our time with you. But here, if you like, are the controversial bits, the sexy bits: The last minutes of the FOMC used the phrase fairly soon. We all know what fairly soon means. If you and I go to have a cup of coffee, we'll have it fairly soon. We could meet for dinner fairly soon. What does fairly soon mean in the context of the minutes?\\n\\nPresident Dudley: I think it means what it says. It doesn't say it's a week, a month, a couple months. Fairly soon means in the relatively near future. I think the key thing in terms of thinking about monetary policy is -- what are we basically communicating to people in the markets? We've basically been saying that if the economy continues on the trajectory that it's on, slightly above-trend growth, gradually rising inflation, we're going to continue to remove monetary policy accommodation. So let's look at what we've actually gotten. It seems to me that most of the data we've seen over the last couple months is very much consistent with the economy continuing to grow at an above-trend pace, job gains remain pretty sturdy, inflation has actually drifted up a little bit as energy prices have increased. So we're very much on the trajectory that we said -- that we thought we'd be on and we said if we were on that trajectory we're going to gradually remove accommodation. What else have we seen? We've also seen things that should make us even more confident that this is going to continue in the future. After the election we've seen very large increases in household and business confidence, we've seen very buoyant financial markets -- the stock market is up, credit spreads are narrow. And we have the expectation that fiscal policy will probably move in a more stimulative direction. So, put it all together, I think the case for monetary policy tightening has become a lot more compelling.\\n\\nQuest: And that's obviously fairly soon, which implies sooner rather than later?\\n\\nDudley: I think that's fair.\\n\\nQuest: There's also one new wrinkle into this, of course, which is the role of fiscal policy. A large increase in government spending is coming. We know it's coming. The president is going to talk about it tonight. How does the Fed factor in what you know is coming but is not here yet?\\n\\nDudley: Well, it's hard to actually put it into your forecast yet because we don't know what it is, how big it is or when it's actually going to hit the economy. But we do know that fiscal policy is going to move in a more stimulative direction. So what that says to me is that the risks to the outlook are now starting to tilt to the upside. So while I haven't really built it into my GDP forecast, when I think about the balance of risks -- up or down in terms of economic activity -- I think the fiscal side tends to push things -- the risks to the upside.\\n\\nQuest: But you can't wait for it to happen, can you? I mean the whole question of monetary lag. I know you've got to think about many of these policies not coming into force until 2018, but you have to plan now.\\n\\nDudley: Well, look, I think monetary policy is pursued on the basis on the economic outlook. Fiscal policy outlook obviously affects that -- the trajectory of GDP, unemployment and inflation. So that's a factor weighing on us but the fact that we have so little specifics yet about what's going to happen -- it's got to wind its way through Congress -- means I don't put a lot of weight on it in terms of my modal forecast. I just think it makes the risks to the outlook a little bit tilted to the upside at this point.\\n\\nQuest: And from what you've heard -- and I'll accept that the detail is few and far between -- from what you've heard, are the sort of spending, fiscal plans that you're hearing, are they the right sort in terms of productivity gains that the Fed can live with?\\n\\nDudley: Well, I think we're going to have to see. To the extent that you reduce the burden of regulation, that should lift productivity growth. To the extent that you pursue greater infrastructure spending, that should lift productivity growth. So those are the aspects of changes on the fiscal side that would actually be supportive to stronger economic activity.\\n\\nQuest: But, for instance, I'm going to throw the numbers that we've seen -- the $50 billion on defense spending that the president said that yesterday, $50-odd billion on defense. Is that the sort of thing that you find is -- leads to greater productivity as opposed to just shear consumption?\\n\\nDudley: I wouldn't think that defense spending would have a huge benefit to the productivity growth, but obviously we have to spend money on the military to keep the country safe. Also, if you're increasing spending on military but cutting spending on discretionary or domestic programs, the net effect may not be very powerful in terms of supporting the economy.\\n\\nQuest: Into this difficult area we have the financial markets. They're on a tear. I mean today could be the 13th record high, we could be in record territory, you know the numbers better than myself. You can't wait for the fiscal plans completely until next year, but you have to take into account what's happening in the markets at the moment, don't you?\\n\\nDudley: Well, financial conditions are very important in terms of how they influence economic activity. So if the stock market is up, credit spreads are narrow, financial conditions are more buoyant, that's going to tend to make the economy stronger. The important thing for us, though, is not to overreact to every little movement in the stock market. It's got to be something that lasts for a period of time for it to actually affect household and business behavior. So if the stock market goes up, and then goes right back down, it's not going to have much consequence for the economic outlook. But if it goes up and stays up, then that's going to support, presumably, consumption through higher household wealth.\\n\\nQuest: What do you believe you're seeing at the moment?\\n\\nDudley: Well, there's no question that animal spirits have been unleashed a bit post the election. Stock market is up a lot. Household and business confidence have increased significantly. There's a survey of small businesses that showed a very large increase in December and sustained that increase in January. So, there's no question that sentiment has improved quite markedly post the election.\\n\\nQuest: That -- animal spirits or whatever you want to call it -- that market influence. It transmits itself around to the entire economy, doesn't it?\\n\\nDudley: Well, we would expect to have some consequence for economic activity. But we'll have to see if that actually -- one if the confidence is sustained, and whether it actually materializes in terms of increases in spending. I would say so far we haven't seen much effect of the improvement in confidence actually leading into greater spending. I think the economy is still on about a 2% GDP track, which about what it's been over the last year or so.\\n\\nQuest: When you hear the president looking for 3 to 4% -- and the Treasury secretary looking for 3% to 4% economic growth -- admittedly not next week, next month, maybe not even next year. But as a medium-term, longer-term goal, do you find that acceptable?\\n\\nDudley: I think it would be great if we have 3% to 4% GDP growth because that would mean productivity growth is very strong and that would lead to rapidly rising living standards, so that would be good for everybody. The key is, what actually happens to productivity growth.\\n\\nQuest: Do you find 3% to 4% realistic?\\n\\nDudley: I would say it's possible. You know, we had productivity growth back in the late 1990s where productivity growth was averaging over 2.5% a year. If we could get back to that kind of level of productivity growth, then I think 3% plus growth would actually be achievable. But that's a pretty high standard to reach for.\\n\\nQuest: You are no longer the only game in town, to use the phrase. For the last five years, six years, seven years, you -- not you personally but you and your colleagues -- central bankers around the world have been saying 'Hey, c'mon, we can't do this on our own. You're requiring us to do all the heavy lifting.' Well, guess what, you've now got a bit of help from Washington, haven't you?\\n\\nDudley: Well, I think it is correct that monetary policy has had to do most of the heavy lifting over the last few years. And I think that's unfortunate because monetary policy is a blunt tool. Monetary policy can't allocate resources across the economy. Monetary policy can't do much to affect productivity growth. So I think it's good that the burden is going to be more broadly shared.\\n\\nQuest: How close do you believe -- and in this I'm not just asking about the Fed but I'm thinking about the Bank of Japan, I'm thinking about the ECB, the BoE -- how close do you believe central banks have come to being out of ammunition?\\n\\nDudley: I don't think we're close to being out of ammunition. Certainly speaking for the United States, the federal funds rate is now well above zero --\\n\\nQuest: But if there's another recession and you've got rates down at just about zero, and you've already done QE and the efficacy of QE is starting to dissipate --\\n\\nDudley: I mean, obviously one can imagine a circumstance when central banks might be ultimately out of ammunition. But that's -- the U.S. is nowhere close to that situation.\\n\\nQuest: On the question of the Fed and the leadership of the Fed, there's going to be, there's already two seats, there's a third one that's about to become vacant. There's obviously the question of the chair and the vice chair, whether they stay on the board after their terms in office come to an end, entirely constitutionally correctly, this President is going to be able to completely reform the board of the Fed.\\n\\nDudley: Well the President is obviously going to be able to make some appointment to the board of governors. Of course, remember, the Federal Open Market Committee also consists of the Federal Reserve bank presidents and more importantly than that, the Fed's mandate is set by Congress. Congress wants the Fed to achieve maximum sustainable employment and price stability. So I would expect that whoever gets named to the Federal Reserve is going to try to carry out that task set for the Fed by Congress.\\n\\nQuest: Oh sir, you know we talk about doves and we talk about hawks when we talk about Fed governors.\\n\\nDudley: I've heard that.\\n\\nQuest: And therefore a new president can -- my word, not yours -- manipulate the board?\\n\\nDudley: I think -- I don't expect that. I think Congress has been very clear about what the Fed's objectives are and people who are named to the board of governors and people who serve on the FOMC try to conduct monetary policy consistent with those goals of maximum sustainable employment and price stability. Right now you'd have to say we're doing pretty well in those objectives. We're pretty close to full employment, and we're pretty close to our 2% inflation objective. So it's not clear why you'd want to change any of that.\\n\\nQuest: That inflation objective, 1.6% at the moment, you can't -- inflation is one of those things, you dare not let it get ahead, because by the time it gets ahead it's too late to do anything about it. Most people don't seem to understand this, do they?\\n\\nDudley: Well you mean the long lags of monetary policy?\\n\\nQuest: Yeah.\\n\\nDudley: Look, I think it's very clear you don't want to keep monetary policy too accommodative for too long. This is something that Chair Yellen talked about in her testimony. Because if you do, then you're going to have to hit the brakes really hard later, move up rates very sharply and that could actually cause the next recession. So slow and gradual seems to me the right way to proceed, moving monetary policy relatively early to make sure the economy doesn't overheat and that can actually allow you to sustain the economic expansion.\\n\\nQuest: I need to ask you, one of the biggest issues at the moment is cybersecurity. Now, I emphasize when I mention the Bangladesh case that I'm not suggesting for a moment that anything was wrong. I know the background to that particular case. We don't need to go into the minutiae of the whole SWIFT system, but when we look at the issue of cybersecurity, do you believe it is one of the most significant threats facing us at the moment?\\n\\nDudley: I think it is one of the most significant threats because we have a lot of people out there that want to do us harm and they're building their capabilities just as we're building our capabilities, so it's little bit of an arms race on both sides. The other thing I think we need to be very conscious of in terms of cybersecurity is we need to really define well the roles and responsibilities of all the different actors. So the person who is making the payment, they need to make sure that their systems are secure. The person transmitting the payment has to make sure that the people that are transmitting payments through their payments mechanisms are well buttoned up. And the person receiving the payment has to be also secure. So it's very important to get those responsibilities well defined and insure that there's an assurance regime to make sure everyone is doing what they're supposed to be doing.\\n\\nQuest: Do you worry that there are weaknesses in the current system that make the global financial system vulnerable to cybersecurity? Because it's the nightmare scenario, and we're sitting in the building, frankly, where if anything were to happen, financial Armageddon is not far off if something happens to one of the major central banks in the world, or one of the big clearing banks or one of the big investment houses.\\n\\nDudley: Well it's certainly something to be concerned about. That's why we spend so many resources trying to strengthen our defenses in the cybersecurity space -- both securing the perimeter but also teaching our employees the insider threat.\\n\\nQuest: But is it taken seriously?\\n\\nDudley: Absolutely.\\n\\nQuest: By policymakers, by CEOs, by shareholders, by government leaders?\\n\\nDudley: I think so. I think so. Because when I talk to other people, the CEOs at major banks, that's the thing they worry the most about too. So it's definitely very, very high up on our agenda -- right at the top of our agenda. And I think it's right at the top of most people's agendas as well.\\n\\nQuest: As we come to the end here, Mr. President, what is it about this job you enjoy? If you think about it, you're sitting at the top of the financial system, you're the president of the New York Fed, which of course is responsible for monetary policy, the open market policies of the federal government. What is it that you enjoy about it?\\n\\nDudley: Well, I mean, how I think about it is I spent a long career in the financial industry and I learned a lot about financial markets and learned a lot about the macro economy and to bring all that experience to bear in the context of monetary policy, to try to get good outcomes for the American people, that's challenging but also rewarding when we're close to achieving our objectives.\\n\\nQuest: But has there been a moment -- because you were here during the crisis --\\n\\nDudley: Yes, I was.\\n\\nQuest: Has there been a moment, where you suddenly say 'Ah, I never realized it was that difficult to do that.' Or 'I pontificated as a private economist about why doesn't the Fed do this. Well now I darn well see why they didn't do it. You can't do it' or 'It's too difficult to do it' or 'We tried to do it.' Anything like that?\\n\\nDudley: Well, I think that, definitely I saw many things during the financial crisis that I never expected to see. There were a couple speeches I gave at the time, basically looking at all of the things that happened in financial markets that are totally outside the realm of our experience. I think when you're on the inside, you are constrained by the fact that the FOMC is a committee and it consists of many different members. So even if you're seeing something, you have to convince your colleagues what you're seeing is actually important. So it's really important to bring along your colleagues so you can rise to the occasion and do what's necessary to actually stabilize the economy. I think one of the things that I brought to bear in terms of the crisis is that I know a lot about financial markets and the people within this institution know a lot about the financial market plumbing and I think that really helped the New York Fed contribute to the Fed's response during the financial crisis.\\n\\nQuest: Did you ever fear that it was going to get away from you? That this train was going to run out of track?\\n\\nDudley: Absolutely. But it didn't.\\n\\nQuest: But you did?\\n\\nDudley: I definitely worried. There were days in the fall of 2008 that you really didn't know exactly what's going to happen. That's why we pulled out everything -- all the tools at our disposal to help support the economy because we were very, very close to a Great Depression.\\n\\nQuest: And today?\\n\\nDudley: Today I think we're in much better shape. I think the regulatory changes put in place post the financial crisis have made the banking system of the United States a lot more secure, higher capital, higher liquidity, a better means of resolving large institutions should they get in trouble. We've addressed some of structural weaknesses in the financial system, for example money markets. Money market mutual fund reform.\\n\\nQuest: But you don't want those reforms to be taken away -- Dodd-Frank.\\n\\nDudley: Well, look, I think it's fair that we want to take a look at regulations and make sure we got the cost-benefit right. But if you look at the U.S. banking system today, is it a good thing that we have more capital? That we have more liquidity? Absolutely. We don't want to roll that back. Because we saw in the financial crisis what happens to households and businesses if we don't have a financial system that can do what it needs to do in terms of intermediating flows of credit between savers and borrowers. We really had a fundamental breakdown in our financial system in the fall of 2008, and I don't ever want to go back there. Therefore we certainly need to keep things like capital, like liquidity, like resolution in place so we don't ever have a financial crisis like that again. That was the worst economic environment of my lifetime. It was certainly the worst financial crisis of my lifetime. And I hope to never see one like that again."}

If no changes are made, the CBO projects that public debt will rise to 96% of GDP by 2028.

He might have been wearing a tuxedo or a pink bikini, and on one occasion he said it while appearing to be roasting on a spit.\\n\\nAfter the debacle of 2020 — a year that felt a little like being on that spit -- many people are yearning for a clean break, something completely different.\\n\\nIt might be too much to ask.

{"original": "Editor's Note: The Axe Files, featuring David Axelrod, is a podcast distributed by CNN and produced at the University of Chicago Institute of Politics. The author works for the podcast.\\n\\n(CNN) —\\n\\nBy Cody Keenan's recollection, President Barack Obama gave 3,577 speeches during his eight years in the White House. And Keenan, his former chief speechwriter, was there for every one of them.\\n\\nEntering the White House as a junior speechwriter, Keenan remembers being immediately awed by the significance of the office he served and quickly learning the weight of responsibility that's placed in a president called on to console a nation.\\n\\nWhen you come in here as a speechwriter…you have big visions of State of the Union addresses, and commencements and moonshots and all sorts of great speeches. It never crosses your mind that you're going to have to write a bunch for tragedy, Keenan told David Axelrod on The Axe Files, a podcast from the University of Chicago Institute of Politics and CNN.\\n\\nAnd it happened way too often, he said.\\n\\nOn his last day in the White House, Keenan paused to reflect on his journey that began as an intern on Obama's 2008 presidential campaign and ended with him serving as the President's chief speechwriter.\\n\\nHe also spoke about his close collaboration with the President, who Keenan is quick to credit as the true head speechwriter at the White House.\\n\\nI've learned along the way that [a speech] doesn't have to be perfect; it has to give him something he can work with and then he can work magic in about a tenth the time that you did, Keenan said, offering the speech memorializing the victims of the Charleston church shooting as an example of when President Obama's own writing elevated the address to another level.\\n\\nI pulled two all-nighters on that, and then in the span of five hours he crossed out the last two pages of the speech and rewrote them longhand in a way that I couldn't reach, Keenan recalled. And it's frustrating that you can't get there but it's also just incredibly rewarding to see that he can.\\n\\nOne of Keenan's most memorable speeches from his White House tenure is one that he surely wishes he'd never written: the memorialization for the six victims of the 2011 Tucson shooting that targeted then-Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords.\\n\\nOne of the victims was nine-year-old Christina-Taylor Green, who was born on September 11, 2001. Like other children born on that day, Green happened to be featured in a book Keenan's research aide discovered, in which her picture and others were placed next to experiences people wished for them to have in their lives. One of the wishes near Green's photo said, I hope you jump in rain puddles.\\n\\nSo I was reading this, and I think it was the morning of the speech, Keenan said. I emailed myself while I was getting ready in the morning, saying, you know, 'If there are rain puddles in heaven, Christina's jumping in them today.' And then added that in to the speech.\\n\\nIt is these personal stories, Keenan says, that give a speech life and resonate with an audience. He remembers drawing on his own personal stories when he came into the White House, as members of his own family experienced the pain of job loss and the anxiety brought on by financial hardship during the height of the recession.\\n\\nI channeled all of it, because you've got to figure whoever the President is talking to has those same concerns and fears, and they might have lost their job, they might be on the brink of losing their home, Keenan added. And you've got to connect with them rather than just rattle off a list of bullet points on some policy or program.\\n\\nWithout hesitation, Keenan says that the White House is the greatest professional experience of his life. But he didn't learn the importance of people-focused politics scaling the heights of political speechwriting.

Authorities said Tuesday, Oct. 31, 2017, that three Dartmouth psychology professors are under criminal investigation for allegations of sexual misconduct. The previous week the college said the professors were put on paid leave and had their access to campus restricted due to allegations of serious misconduct. The college later told authorities it had received allegations of sexual misconduct. (AP Photo/Jim Cole, File)\\n\\n(CNN) —\\n\\nDartmouth College says it is launching a new initiative to combat sexual harassment and abuses of power on campus. But a lawyer for seven women who are suing the university over its handling of sexual harassment allegations say the efforts miss the mark.\\n\\nThe announcement comes nearly two months after a federal complaint was filed against the Ivy League school by seven current and former graduate students who allege three professors created a toxic environment where female subjects were routinely subjected to sexual harassment and even rape.\\n\\nA school inquiry led to the resignations of the three professors in 2018 and the school pledged to take steps to improve the campus culture. The new Campus Climate and Culture Initiative is the latest step in that direction, school officials said in a press release.\\n\\nThe new program will include the following components:\\n\\n- A single policy to address sexual misconduct for faculty, staff, and students, with appropriate processes for adjudicating potential violations;\\n\\n- A mandatory online sexual violence prevention training program for all faculty, staff, professional and graduate students, and postdoctoral scholars;\\n\\n- Research advisory committees for all graduate programs to ensure that all graduate students have access to multiple advisors.\\n\\nThe announcement comes as American universities grapple with how to handle allegations of campus sexual misconduct and their obligations under Title IX, the federal law that bars discrimination based on sex, including harassment, in federally funded education programs and activities.\\n\\nThe Department of Education in November proposed new rules for dealing with sexual harassment and assault on college campuses that would bolster the rights of those accused of wrongdoing.\\n\\nThe lawsuit accuses the New Hampshire school of failing to create an environment free from gender-based discrimination, in violation of Title IX.\\n\\nDartmouth says the new program will expand the school's Title IX office, which is responsible for reviewing reports of sexual misconduct and conducting investigations. The school also pledged to increase mental health resources at Dartmouth and said that an outside expert who specializes in creating inclusive communities will review academic departments.\\n\\nThe lawsuit claims that the prominent researchers, who no longer are allowed on campus, coerced female students into drinking and made the women feel as if their success depended on their willingness to participate in their alcohol-saturated culture the men created.\\n\\nThe complaint claims that Dartmouth knew about the professors' behavior for more than 16 years and did nothing until 2017, when several female graduate students reported the allegations to the college's Title IX office. During the Title IX investigation, the lawsuit claims that Dartmouth failed to provide the plaintiffs with support, accommodations or guidance, then unilaterally terminated the disciplinary process without seeking their input.\\n\\nPreviously, school officials said they applauded the courage of the women who came forward. However, we respectfully, but strongly, disagree with the characterizations of Dartmouth's actions in the complaint and will respond through our own court filings, they said.\\n\\nDeborah Marcuse, an attorney representing seven women plaintiffs in the sexual harassment lawsuit, said the initiatives miss the mark and simply bring the school into compliance with federal law.\\n\\nTo the extent that Dartmouth is now seeking to conform its policies to what federal law requires, we certainly support that though we think it's long overdue, Marcuse said. What's striking about this is that Dartmouth continues to fail to acknowledge or accept responsibility for the damage that its long history of inaction has caused.\\n\\nMarcuse faulted the school for not reaching out to her clients for their input. Dartmouth's formal response to their complaint is due in a little over a week on January 15.\\n\\nIt appears to us that for all of the lip service to their courage, there has been no interest from Dartmouth in materially responding to or really listening to these women despite a lot of vague call outs to 'we want to include everyone and everything', she said.\\n\\nIf you just look at the nature of the various responses there really just isn't any acknowledgment that what these women experienced is something that has had any impact on Dartmouth at all."}
{"original": "President Trump's promises to slash taxes and rip up regulations are making America's CEOs more confident about hiring workers.\\n\\nA new Business Roundtable survey of CEO projections for hiring, investments and sales growth over the next six months jumped by the most since the fourth quarter of 2009.\\n\\nWhile business leaders were planning to cut jobs as recently as the middle of last year, 41% of the CEOs polled now say they expect to ramp up hiring.\\n\\nThe employment index of the survey, which took place between February 8 and March 1, is now at the highest level in nearly three years.\\n\\nIt's the latest evidence that the pro-growth parts of the Trump agenda are exciting corporate leaders.\\n\\nThis country can do better. We're not believers that we're somehow stuck in low growth. We just need good policy at this point, said JPMorgan Chase (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon, who serves as chairman of the Business Roundtable, which represents large companies.\\n\\nHe added that these policy changes would be good for all Americans, not just big companies.\\n\\nDimon specifically cited enthusiasm among CEOs to work with Washington on far-reaching tax reform as well as a smarter approach to regulation.\\n\\nRelated: Bush economist: Trump should get moving on tax cuts\\n\\nOf course, it remains to be seen how much of this CEO confidence will translate to actual job creation. The U.S. is at a level that many economists consider full employment -- unemployment is sitting at just 4.8% as of February, and it's not like corporate chiefs are anticipating the economy will boom this year.\\n\\nCEOs in the Business Roundtable survey predicted 2017 GDP growth of just 2.2% for 2017. That's up a bit from a few months ago, but well shy of the 4% growth Trump has promised to eventually deliver.\\n\\nNevertheless, Trump's pledge for massive tax cuts has fired up the stock market. The S&P 500 has surged by 11% since the election to all-time highs.\\n\\nOf the CEOs polled, 52% indicated tax reform would create the most pro-growth environment for their business.\\n\\nRelated: Trump is pushing 'Buy American' But customers (mostly) don't care\\n\\nHowever, tax reform is incredibly complicated, and so far there has been little movement in Congress on this issue as lawmakers instead focus on repealing and replacing Obamacare.\\n\\nEfforts to rewrite the corporate tax code will be further muddied by opposition to a Republican proposal for a border adjusted tax (BAT) that would aim to encourage more stuff gets made in America. Retailers have warned a BAT could jack up prices on shoppers.\\n\\nWe don't think the hopes will be dashed, said Joshua Bolten, the CEO of the Business Roundtable and President George W. Bush's former chief of staff.\\n\\nWhile it's never easy to do tax reform, we think this really is a once-in-a-generation opportunity.\\n\\nAnother 27% of CEOs surveyed by the Business Roundtable say they are most excited by Trump's regulatory reform efforts.\\n\\nTrump has vowed to do a big number on the Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law. He has argued that regulations are holding back the economy, even though business loans and bank profits are at record highs. Trump also wants to dial back environmental regulations impacting the coal, oil and gas industries."}
{"original": "Jess McIntosh is a Democratic strategist and former communications adviser for Hillary Clinton. She is also the co-host of the SiriusXM radio show Signal Boost. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. View more opinions on CNN.\\n\\n(CNN) Georgia, a state that shocked the nation in November when its voters chose President-elect Joe Biden, the first Democratic presidential candidate to win there in over two decades, has done it again. This time, a majority of Georgians supported two new Democratic US Senators -- Jon Ossoff and Rev. Raphael Warnock -- in a runoff vote this week.\\n\\nThey also dealt a devastating blow to anti-democratic forces within our government by sending Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell back to the minority. The legacy of McConnell will be as a powerful opponent to voting rights -- a man who had to step down after years of doing little to stop voter suppression efforts. He will leave his position, for example, with the John Lewis Voting Rights Act , which would restore the voting protections first secured in 1965, still languishing on his desk.\\n\\nLewis, the late Georgia representative, made the expansion of voting rights his legacy, calling the vote the most powerful nonviolent tool we have in a democracy. America has been using that tool to improve our democracy for as long as we have been a country.\\n\\nWhenever we have expanded the American electorate to include more than just the property-owning White men first allowed to vote here, we have strengthened our system of governance against anti-democratic forces, such as racism and misogyny, that threaten to install a tyranny of the minority while calling it democracy.\\n\\nAmerica has historically prided itself on being a democracy -- but the fact that adult American citizens have had to fight over and over again to be allowed to participate in its democratic process shows the country has not yet lived up to that ideal.\\n\\nOf course, Trump was never the only threat to this vision of a true democracy in America. That ideal has come under attack whenever political leaders, particularly those wanting to hold onto power, create barriers to voting for Black and brown Americans.\\n\\nTake Georgia, in 2018, when Republican Brian Kemp served as Secretary of State in his own race for governor against Stacey Abrams. In the years leading up to his race for governor, voting rights activists say Kemp used his position as the state's highest election official to purge over 1 million inactive Georgian voters from the rolls. Kemp claimed they fell short of the state's exact match policy for such offenses as a missing hyphen or middle name. In addition, between 2013 and 2016, Kemp rejected 35,000 applications for voter registration, with minorities disproportionately impacted by this policy.\\n\\nAbrams lost by about 55,000 votes two years ago. But Abrams didn't concede, and she didn't give up. Abrams and her organization Fair Fight registered 800,000 new voters by 2020, helping turn blue a traditionally red state and deliver a victory to Biden. And she persisted in her efforts in the lead up to the Georgia Senate runoffs as well, undoubtedly playing a critical role in the Democrats' January victories.\\n\\nBut threats to democracy extend far beyond Trump or even Georgia. During Barack Obama's presidency, McConnell prevented the democratically elected President from nominating scores of judges , most famously holding a Supreme Court seat vacant for eight months following the death of Justice Antonin Scalia, saying it was too close to the election to seat a new justice. When Trump became President, McConnell worked with his administration to pack the federal courts with ideologues, some far more extreme than the country they're meant to serve, and ultimately helped seat Amy Coney Barrett on the Supreme Court after voting in the 2020 election had already begun. This wasn't just rank hypocrisy -- it was a subversion of the democratic principle he set just four years prior.\\n\\nMcConnell has also stood in opposition to considering statehood for Washington D.C. or Puerto Rico, where American citizens live and pay taxes without representation in the legislative body he leads. If McConnell were committed to a fair democracy, he would be working to expand voting rights to these Americans, too -- even if many of them might be Democratic voters.\\n\\nMcConnell hasn't stopped there. In 2019, the Democratic-led House passed a bill to end the anti-democratic process of gerrymandering, which allows elected officials to draw their own districts and regularly disenfrachises Black and brown voters. McConnell blocked the bill from advancing in the Senate.\\n\\nCollectively, his actions -- or, in some cases, inaction -- have contributed to the erosion of both our system of governance and our faith in democracy itself.\\n\\nGet our free weekly newsletter Sign up for CNN Opinion's new newsletter. Join us on Twitter and Facebook\\n\\nNow that Georgia has removed most of McConnell's power to accomplish his agenda, the John Lewis Voting Rights Act will likely be passed. The next election will see more Americans with access to the ballot -- and we will finally have the chance to create a country that is truly governed by the people via free and fair elections.\\n\\nAmerica is fighting to become the democracy we've always been told we already were. Georgia gave us hope that that dream could become a reality.\\n\\nWe have a long road ahead of us to rebuild faith in our country, ourselves and our institutions -- and part of that is recognizing the democratic shortcomings that brought us to this moment. We might be a republic if we can keep it, but we're only going to remain a democracy if we can keep building it."}
{"original": "(CNN) — In days gone by, Europe's high Alpine meadows were the summer destination of shepherds and cowherds, who brought their sheep and cattle up the valleys for herb-rich grasses.\\n\\nThese seasonal visitors built rudimentary dwellings, and made money on the side by providing accommodation for occasional hunters and travelers foot-slogging across the mountains. The seasonal relocation of livestock has since decreased, but the numbers of recreational hikers in the Alps has multiplied.\\n\\nThese days, more than 3,000 huts are spread across the Alps. Despite the primitive implications of the name, some huts are large enough to allow as many as 300 people a night to sleep a great deal closer to heaven. As those numbers suggest, hut is a misnomer.\\n\\n'Huts' with full amenities\\n\\nThese Austrian huts are the perfect place to unwind after a day hiking. Sean Gallup/Getty Images Europe/Getty Images\\n\\nThese places usually have a bar, restaurant, sun terrace, showers, drying rooms and a mixture of dormitories and bedrooms of various sizes.\\n\\nBeds, mattresses, sheets and duvets are all provided. Some even have Wi-Fi. Yet the vast majority are unreachable by road, sitting at around 2,000 meters (6,500 feet) or higher, relying on helicopters or goods-only cable cars for their supplies.\\n\\nIn season (they're usually open from May or June until September or October, depending on snowfall) they can be hugely popular. Thanks to these huts, high-altitude hikers no longer have to descend into the valleys at night, seeking shelter. Nor do they have to carry their own food or bedding.\\n\\nIn effect, the huts are sturdy lodges for sturdy people, invariably in magnificent settings, where the combination of plentiful beer and shared satisfaction after a day's walking well done create impromptu (and multilingual) house parties.\\n\\nThe huts' shelter policy -- no one is turned away -- allows hikers to alter hut-to-hut hiking plans at short notice, according to changing weather conditions.\\n\\nFor a private room, you need to reserve in advance, which is done directly with the individual hut.\\n\\nThis can take some research. You can find a listing of huts on the German Alpine Club site, along with links to the sites of other Alpine associations, and their individual properties. Association memberships usually include a discount on huts, although some are privately run.\\n\\nHere are six of the best:\\n\\n1. Anhalter Hütte, Austria\\n\\nA hammock in the Alps at Anhalter Hutte. Courtey Anhalter Hutte\\n\\nAnhalter Hütte is a 100-year-old former hunting lodge located in the Lechtal Alps, surrounded by magnificent peaks. The interior has wood-paneled walls and portraits of be-whiskered German huntsmen.\\n\\nAlthough German-run, it's staffed partly by Nepalese women, so there are Buddhist prayer flags on the ceiling and Nepali noodles on the menu. Magnificent views are its calling card, with supplies flown in by helicopter.\\n\\n2. Hanauer Hütte, Austria\\n\\nThe Alps aren't just great in winter, in summer they are equally stunning. Sean Gallup/Getty Images Europe/Getty Images\\n\\nA spectacular day's walk through fields of gentian and forests of pine from the Anhalter Hütte along the Eagle's Way, the Hanauer Hütte is larger and newer and has a cable-car lift from the valley floor below for supplies.\\n\\nThe Eagle's Way is one of Austria's finest long distance, high-altitude hikes, and a couple of other long distance routes intersect here, so this is a busy place. Marmots and mountain-cupped lakes are in the vicinity.\\n\\n3. Schachenhaus Hütte, Germany\\n\\nHead to Schachenhaus Hütte for stunning views. Courtesy IMBiblio/Creative commons/Flickr\\n\\nThis privately run hut is in the German Alps, not far from the Zugspitze (Germany's highest point) and the mountain resort of Garmisch Partenkirchen.\\n\\nThe Schachenhaus is both a hikers' hut and a tourist destination in itself, accessible by a relatively easy two-hour walk from the road end below. Hikers come in numbers for the stupendous King's House mountain lodge, built by King Ludwig II, the crazy monarch who built Neuschwanstein, Disney's model for Sleeping Beauty's castle.\\n\\n4. Kredarica Triglav, Slovenia\\n\\nAfter a hike like this, you'll be ready to party. Sean Gallup/Getty Images Europe/Getty Images\\n\\nMount Triglav is the Slovenian Everest, and the Kredarica is its base camp. Or rather, its three-quarters-way-up camp, with Triglav topping out at 2,864 meters (9,396 feet) and Kredarica located at 2,515 meters (8,251 feet).\\n\\nThat last hike takes an hour, so the hut fills with hikers and climbers preparing for the final push on the summit. The nearest roads are about five hours away by foot, and yet this hut run by the Slovenian Alpine Association is incredibly busy in summer, with as many as five restaurants in operation.\\n\\nIt has roughly 300 bed spaces and stays open in winter.\\n\\n5. Rifugio Regina Margherita, Monterosa, Italy\\n\\nDefinitely one for the thrill seekers. Courtesy Rifugimonterosa\\n\\nIn thin air up at 4,554 meters (14,941 feet) on the flanks of Monterosa, this highest mountain hut -- Rifugio Regina Margherita -- in the Alps is a remarkable place to stay.\\n\\nPerched on rock, gripping hard with claws of wood, it looks fragile and vulnerable, but nevertheless clings on from one year to the next. It's around five hours' walking from neighbor refuges, and in conditions that can be tricky, so proper mountaineering equipment and a guide are advised.\\n\\nIt's run by a private company, which has several other refuges.\\n\\n6. Cabane des Vignettes, Valais, Switzerland\\n\\nIf hiking isn't your thing, try mountain biking. Sean Gallup/Getty Images Europe/Getty Images\\n\\nThe Chamonix-to-Zermatt route is a well-trodden trail, but that doesn't make it easy. The Vignettes hut is a sturdy building, making it especially welcome to hikers slogging in bad weather.\\n\\nRecent renovations have brought proper sanitation, replacing a long-drop outside loo that was a chilly walk along a perilous path."}

(Photo by Thomas Peter-Pool/Getty Images)\\n\\n(CNN) —\\n\\nPresident Donald Trump has wasted no time getting down to business as US commander in chief, but few countries in the world will be watching his moves as closely as China.\\n\\nSince his election in November, President Trump has challenged Beijing over its military build-up in the South China Sea, slammed its currency and trade policies and, perhaps most controversially, upended decades of diplomatic protocol by questioning a longstanding US policy towards Taiwan.\\n\\nHe's also handed key jobs to people with controversial views on China, not least his choice for Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who has suggested that Beijing be blocked from accessing its artificial islands.\\n\\nThe leaders in Zhongnanhai, the gated compound that is China's equivalent to the White House, want to know how seriously they should take such statements. Will they translate into policy? And within Trump's inner circle, whose voice will prevail?\\n\\nThey (China's leaders) might be willing to give up something but if Trump asks too much, China is willing to fight, says Zhang Baohui, a professor of political science at Lingnan University,\\n\\nHere's four ways China could try to handle the Oval Office's unpredictable new occupant.\\n\\n05:08 - Source: CNN How will Trump affect ties with China?\\n\\nTrump's bluster could be just that. There's a long history of US presidents taking a tough stance on China only to moderate it once in office.\\n\\n1. Play the long game\\n\\nPresident George W. Bush came to power vowing to treat China as a strategic competitor only to default to engagement. President Ronald Reagan said he would cut off diplomatic links with Beijing. Two years after he was elected, he visited China.\\n\\nJon Huntsman Jr., a former US ambassador to Beijing, says Trump's fiery talk on China fits that pattern.\\n\\nThis is kind of a replay of what we've seen before. Trump at some point is going to have to say 'I've gotta sit down and do business with the Chinese, he told CNN.\\n\\n03:12 - Source: CNN China and the U.S. in the next four years\\n\\nTrump has already moderated one of his key stances on China. In an interview with the Wall Street Journal, he walked back on an earlier pledge to name China a currency manipulator on day one of his administration.\\n\\nHowever, analysts say this strategy is risky for China. If President Xi Jinping stays too quiet in the face of Trump's provocations, it makes Xi, who has built his credibility on being a strong leader, look weak.\\n\\nThis could trigger protests — something Xi is unlikely to want in a year that will also see some leadership changes in Beijing when the Chinese Communist Party holds its once-every-five-years congress.\\n\\nXi definitely doesn't want relations with the US to stir up trouble. He's anxious not to allow nationalistic young men and women to demonstrate against the US, says Willy Lam, an adjunct professor at the Centre for Chinese Studies at the Chinese University of Hong Kong.\\n\\nXi Jinping: The power and fragility of China's leader\\n\\n2. Cozy up and negotiate\\n\\nMany Chinese observers stress Trump's background as a business man and believe his posturing over Taiwan and the South China Sea is simply an opening gambit in advance of real business negotiations.\\n\\nI don't think Trump and his team will carry out the bulk of their threats, says Lam.\\n\\nWe need to remember that Trump is a shrewd businessman. He's raising an extreme position from which he might do a bit of climbing down if the Chinese were amenable to making other compromises.\\n\\nChina has been busy behind the scenes reaching out to people close to Trump, says Zhang Baohui, a professor of political science at Lingnan University,\\n\\nMany saw the meeting between Trump and Jack Ma, Alibaba founder and Asia's richest man, as an example of this outreach.\\n\\nThey will first try and shape his China policy by trying to work with him, says Zhang.\\n\\nThey've floated the idea of trying to invest in US infrastructure. The Chinese fundamentally think he is a businessman who wants to create jobs – even if he's willing to play dirty tricks over things like Taiwan.\\n\\nIt's a strategy that's worked well elsewhere for Beijing, with China building and forging infrastructure deals in Africa, Eastern Europe and southeast Asia.\\n\\nPHOTO: Getty Images\\n\\nWhy 2017 is impossible to predict\\n\\n3. Get personal\\n\\nPersonalities count, especially in China where connections or guanxi are viewed as key to getting anything done.\\n\\nZhang says that many in China want a meeting between Trump and Xi as soon as possible, with some suggestion that Trump could be invited to a multilateral meeting on China's one belt, one road initiative in May.\\n\\nAnother opportunity would come in July when the G20 meeting is held in Germany or November when Vietnam hosts APEC – the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation summit.\\n\\nWhen they meet directly and have glass of Maotai together over dinner, Xi could disarm Trump. He's a good diplomat, says Zhang, referring to a popular Chinese liquor.\\n\\nChina may also use Trump's pick for US ambassador to Beijing, Iowa governor Terry Branstad, to cement ties between Xi and Trump.\\n\\nBranstad and Xi have known each other since 1985, when Xi visited Iowa as a provincial official on a state exchange program during Branstad's first term as governor, and have maintained a friendship of sorts.\\n\\nDonald Trump rooster statue takes China by storm\\n\\nPHOTO: Getty Images\\n\\n4. Make Trump's life difficult\\n\\nOf course, China could make life difficult for Trump if it wants to. Lam at the Chinese University of Hong Kong says China is already quietly preparing for a trade war.\\n\\nThe Chinese commerce department has drawn up a meticulous list of possible retaliatory measures – which US companies would be hit with what kind of tariffs should the US (fire) a salvo in a trade war, he says.\\n\\nIt's not something to take lightly, especially for a US president who's staked his legitimacy on delivering jobs and an economic revival, says Jing Ulrich, Managing Director and Vice Chairman of Asia Pacific, JPMorgan Chase.\\n\\nRemember Boeing has projected selling in the next 20 years $1 trillion worth of aircraft into China. If tariffs were put on that would be very damning to an iconic US company. And that's just one example, she says.\\n\\nChina could hit back in other ways. It could choose to squeeze Taiwan economically, become more aggressive in the South China Sea or shore up its ties with North Korea.\\n\\nCan Taiwan trust Trump?\\n\\nShen Dingli, a professor of International Relations at Fudan University in Shanghai, says he believes that China is willing to negotiate with the US and the two should be able to resolve their differences on trade – but Taiwan is a red line for China's leaders.\\n\\nWe cannot do Taiwan as a bargaining chip, he says.\\n\\nIf Trump still plays the Taiwan card then China and the US would have a very serious confrontation. This is hopefully not what Trump wants to have.\\n\\nCNN's Kristie Lu Stout contributed to this report"}

He also added that steep tariffs could mean that Fiat Chrysler pulls back from Mexico entirely.\\n\\nIt's possible if tariffs are imposed, if they're sufficiently large, we'd have to withdraw. It is quite possible, he said. Right now they [rules] are all on the table. We'll wait.\\n\\nRelated: Fiat Chrysler to put $1 billion into U.S. jobs and revive Jeep\\n\\nLast week Ford (F) announced it was scrapping plans for a $1.6 billion plant in Mexico and instead investing $700 million in a Michigan plant, a move that will create 700 jobs there.\\n\\nOn Sunday, Fiat Chrysler announced its own $1 billion investment in two plants in Michigan and Ohio, creating 2,000 jobs.\\n\\nTrump tweeted about the move, saying It's finally happening. But Marchionne said Monday that the strategy had nothing to do with Trump or his trade policies.\\n\\nIndeed, Fiat's investment plans were part of a labor deal Fiat Chrysler reached with the United Auto Workers union in 2015. It calls for the company to invest a total of $5.3 billion in U.S. plants.\\n\\nI wish I could give him [Trump] credit for this, the CEO told reporters Monday afternoon. But the thinking was in place beforehand.\\n\\nAnd he said he isn't concerned about Trump's Twitter attacks Fiat Chrysler. This is new territory for most of us. None of us have had a tweeting president before, he said.\\n\\nThe CEO added at a press conference later Monday that he'll never get into a Twitter war with the president-elect.\\n\\nIf I ever start tweeting, shoot me, Marchionne told reporters. He doesn't even have a Twitter account.\\n\\nMarchionne stressed that the decision made economic sense for the company.\\n\\nWe're not going to do anything about President-elect Trump, he said. We'll just respond to relevant policies.\\n\\nRelated: Best loved new cars of 2016\\n\\nThe CEO said he'd like to talk about trade policy with Trump directly. Specifically, he would urge that any tariff imposed on Mexican imports would grandfather in plants that are already in place. Marchionne said that would discourage new investment in Mexico without punishing U.S. companies for previous investments there.\\n\\nHe said he doesn't even know whether Fiat Chrysler's Canadian plants would be subject to the same tariffs as those in Mexico, though he hopes that won't be the case.\\n\\nTo the best of my knowledge there have been no tweets on Canadian production of cars, Marchionne quipped.\\n\\nAnd he cautioned that if new U.S. policies lead to a global trade war, it will be bad for all U.S. workers, including those at auto plants.\\n\\nTariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada also would be lethal for Fiat Chrysler's plants in those countries, since they depend on selling into the U.S. market. But they wouldn't close immediately.\\n\\nYou can't do it overnight. For us it would be impossible, he said. You can't just pick up all your toys and go home.\\n\\nFiat Chrysler (FCAU)has seven Mexican plants that employ about 11,500 workers. The plants primarily serve the U.S. market, but also build vehicles for Europe, South America and Australia. They build the Fiat 500, Dodge Journey, the Ram ProMaster van and the Ram 1500-3500 pickups. The new Jeep Compass will also be built in Mexico."}

The opinions expressed in this commentary are hers.\\n\\n(CNN) —\\n\\nAs President Barack Obama heads to Saudi Arabia to meet with Gulf leaders, back here at home, misinformation is being spread, misinformation that could impact families who have been fighting for over a decade to bring to justice those who aided the brutal murder of our loved ones on September 11, 2001.\\n\\nAs the widow of Tom Strada, who died in World Trade Center Tower One, I am outraged. And as the mother of three children who face the prospect of a future living in the shadow of radical Islamic terrorism, I am very concerned.\\n\\nAlong with the family members and survivors of 9/11, we have fought long and hard to stand in a courtroom and lay out the long trail of evidence that leads back to the kingdom of Saudi Arabia.\\n\\nTerry Strada\\n\\nAfter years of neglect and, at times, willful opposition from our own government to our efforts, we now learn that the administration is campaigning in Congress to stop them from passing a very simple, bipartisan bill that says anyone, including foreign sovereigns, can be held liable if they indeed assist in an attack on American soil. As Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas and lead sponsor of the bill, has noted, the administration has been trying to kill this legislation by private conversations. That is not an acceptable way of treating such important legislation.\\n\\nContrary to what Secretary of State John Kerry has said, this bill, the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act, or JASTA, does not open the floodgates for lawsuits against the United States from the rest of the world – not against our citizens abroad and not against our military. It would not be the disaster he alleges.\\n\\nWhy? Because it is actually good policy to hold accountable anyone who enabled the 19 hijackers to live here in the United States for 18 months, plan and then execute the heinous murders on 9/11. It is good policy to enact legislation that protects the rights of Americans to utilize our judicial system and hold accountable foreign states that aid in terrorist attacks on U.S. soil. And it is good policy to enact legislation that addresses the funding sources of terrorist organizations. After all, without money, terrorists cannot pay for their travel, training camps, bomb-making material, weapons or even their basic living expenses. They cannot forge passports or recruit new jihadists. Without money it is far harder for terrorists to kill Americans. Unfortunately, Kerry's floodgate comment wrongly equates collaboration with designated terrorists (which JASTA addresses) with conduct to protect our national security (which JASTA does not address). He also wrongly assumes the bill would expose boots on the ground, while the bill focuses solely on the foreign state's accountability for those boots.\\n\\nThe Senate has considered JASTA for six years. It passed in the Senate in 2014, and in January it was passed by the Senate Judiciary Committee by a vote of 19-0. It has been vetted for policy concerns by some of the best lawmakers in our country, and each concern has been answered.\\n\\nYet now, just as JASTA was positioned to move forward, the Saudi government is pressuring the United States to kill the bill, threatening to sell off billions of U.S. assets if the bill is passed. The White House has threatened to veto the bill, effectively asking us all to turn our backs on our pursuit of justice.\\n\\nSetting aside the fact that the Saudi threat is laughable – economists have said doing so would be damaging to the Saudi economy, and the numbers are actually not all that threatening – this push by our own government is unconscionable.\\n\\nThe reality is that this is not Congress trying to make foreign policy – this is Congress protecting American citizens and enacting legislation that ensures the courts have jurisdiction to hear our case. It is based on basic American law. If there is plausible evidence that a foreign state aided a terrorist attack in the United States, that foreign state must respond based on the merits of their argument.\\n\\nIf enacted, this bill would not decide guilt or innocence – it just enables us to present our case. We are Americans who deserve an opportunity for justice – one of our most cherished American values. We deserve our day in court, no matter who we are accusing, as long as we have plausible evidence. It is their right to defend themselves against the evidence.\\n\\nBy enacting JASTA, Congress is simply doing its job. By siding with Saudi interests and working against JASTA, on the other hand, the administration is sabotaging not only our rights, but a very important tool in combating terrorism.\\n\\nI agree with the administration that diplomacy is important. This is America. We can be diplomatic and pursue justice at the same time.\\n\\nJoin us on Facebook.com/CNNOpinion.\\n\\nRead CNNOpinion's Flipboard magazine.\\n\\nTerry Strada is the widow of Tom Strada, who died in the World Trade Center Tower One during the 9/11 attacks.

{"original": "(CNN) Do Iran's latest actions represent minor trouble, as Tehran could have done so much more? Or real trouble, as the paper cuts just don't stop?\\n\\nIran's persistent rhythm of half-measures, a drum beat of self-assertion, rarely lets up, leaving its adversaries -- from hawk to moderate -- able to choose from either of those options. Monday's admission that it is now enriching uranium to the 20% purity level -- a further breach of the collapsed nuclear deal (the JCPOA) and perhaps the singular most open step they've taken towards an alleged nuclear weapon -- rings some of the loudest non-proliferation alarms in the region so far.\\n\\nBut it is not a complete surprise: Iran's Majlis, or parliament, outlined such a move in December as part of a timetable of steps it wanted President Hassan Rouhani to take in a bid to escalate pressure on US President-elect Joe Biden's administration for sanctions relief.\\n\\nWhile uranium enriched at 20% is immediately useless if you want to make a weapon, it is a lot closer to the desired threshold of 90% -- months away, at a push. It is a sign of potential potency that Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu immediately seized upon to suggest that Iran seeks the Bomb. The timing of the move -- in the face of Rouhani's general rejection of the aggressive Majlis proposals -- was quicker than many expected, but you would have to feign shock that it happened.\\n\\nInspectors from the UN's International Atomic Energy Agency will now assess how significant the enrichment at the Fordow facility has been.\\n\\nThe move was also not isolated. Moments earlier, Iran's naval forces stopped a South Korean tanker for alleged pollution and arrested the crew. Any emissions aside, the move acted as a relatively low-risk reminder of Iran's potential influence on shipping in the Gulf.\\n\\nSouth Korea is a relatively neutral victim -- with some Iranian assets held still in their accounts, allies enough to be noticed, but none who would act over this event alone.\\n\\nThe night of January 3 also passed without incident. Last year, a US drone killed Iran's most prominent military commander, Gen. Qassem Soleimani , plunging the region into paroxysms of panic over wider conflict. Tehran's pledged retaliation came as a limited missile strike against a US base in Iraq, that seems to have been adequately telegraphed so that nobody was killed.\\n\\nSince then, Iran has been pummeled by the US campaign of maximum pressure of further sanctions during the pandemic, and has lost its most prominent nuclear scientist, Dr Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, killed by gunfire outside Tehran . For that, again, it has pledged to strike back, but has not done so.\\n\\nThe anniversary of Soleimani's death was heralded with impressive CGI videos on Twitter, suggesting the revenge Iran's allies could take, if they were indeed animated eagles, swooping down on video-game US soldiers. Yet nothing happened here either, with Iran's allied militia in Iraq very clearly choosing not to repeat their earlier attacks on the US Embassy in Baghdad.\\n\\nThe US has also continued its dance of deterrence in the region, almost literally. Acting Secretary of Defense Christopher Miller took the USS Nimitz aircraft carrier out of the region -- so as to not provoke any escalation, ahead of the Soleimani anniversary -- and then sent it back in again , at the apparent request of President Donald Trump. A little like their adversary, even the current bumbling US administration seems to want to play tough, yet not actually so tough that they get mud on their knees.\\n\\nThe mutual posturing -- if hopefully that is all it remains -- is almost transparently geared towards re-igniting negotiations with the incoming Biden administration.\\n\\nJake Sullivan, President-elect Biden's national security advisor designate, told CNN the US would re-enter the JCPOA if Iran also did -- if Iran dismantled centrifuges, and stopped enrichment. (It is unclear who would do what first, or whether the vast number of ancillary sanctions put on Iran by the Trump administration would still cause so much damage to the Iranian economy that the JCPOA alleviation of sanctions would become less beneficial).\\n\\nSullivan said once both sides were back in the JCPOA -- which would be a huge feat of synchronicity and speed, given the Iranian presidential elections later this year in which hardliners are well-placed -- then a follow-on deal was possible over Iran's ballistic missile technology. Iran has flatly rejected any such deal, and said there's nothing to renegotiate over the JCPOA: it is those original terms or nothing.\\n\\nThe churn and swill left behind by Trump's maximum pressure policy has muddied waters enough that Sullivan and Biden will face an uphill challenge. But Tehran's mostly rhetorical response to intense sanctions, repeated assassinations and a fair deal of US inflammatory rhetoric, does suggest it is keen for diplomacy and, with it, sanctions relief. Foreign minister Javid Zarif tweeted that while 20% enrichment had begun, it was in line with the JCPOA and fully reversible upon FULL compliance by ALL.\\n\\nAnd the Trump experience -- chaotic and counter-productive as it has been -- afforded perhaps one lesson: that Iran, faced with a high-profile killing that many thought would spark a conflagration, knew it would lose any wider conflict with the US, and opted to not respond by publicly racing for a nuclear weapon. They've shown a pretty clear grasp of where Trump's red lines are.\\n\\nThe lesson is two-fold. Iran is weaker than its angry, vengeful rhetoric suggests. But it follows that it is also not the rampaging, imminent threat its most hawkish adversaries would contend.\\n\\nThe challenge of the next 16 days of bloated tensions is to be sure that neither side reassesses the long-term intentions of the other, as they both talk loudly and carry big sticks, while hoping diplomacy picks up again."}
{"original": "Washington (CNN) A day before the Senate votes on whether to convict or acquit him on two charges of impeachment, President Donald Trump gave his annual State of the Union speech in the House.\\n\\nWhile Trump is known for his ad-libbed remarks rife with false claims, he tends to stick to the script for formal speeches such as the State of the Union. Nonetheless, here are the facts around what the President said in his third State of the Union.\\n\\nEnergy\\n\\nOil and gas production\\n\\nTrump talked up the production of oil and gas in the US during his time in office.\\n\\nThanks to our bold regulatory reduction campaign, the United States has become the number one producer of oil and natural gas anywhere in the world, by far, Trump said.\\n\\nFacts First: The US did not become the world's top energy producer under Trump: It took the top spot under the Obama administration The US did not become the world's top energy producer under Trump: It took the top spot under the Obama administration in 2012 , according to the US government's Energy Information Administration.\\n\\nThe US became the top producer of crude oil in particular during Trump's tenure. The United States has been the world's top producer of natural gas since 2009, when US natural gas production surpassed that of Russia, and it has been the world's top producer of petroleum hydrocarbons since 2013, when its production exceeded Saudi Arabia's, the Energy Information Administration says.\\n\\n— Tara Subramaniam\\n\\nEconomy\\n\\nUnemployment for disabled Americans\\n\\nTrump claimed the unemployment rate for disabled Americans has reached an all-time low under his presidency.\\n\\nFacts First: The unemployment rate for Americans with disabilities is lower than at any point in the Obama administration, but it did go up from 6.1 percent in September of last year to 7 percent in December. In addition, describing this as an all-time low obscures the fact that the government has only tracked this data since 2008.\\n\\n— Sarah Westwood\\n\\nUnemployment for African Americans, Hispanics and Asians\\n\\nTrump said the unemployment rates for African Americans, Hispanics and Asians are at the lowest levels ever. The unemployment rate for African-Americans, Hispanic-Americans, and Asian-Americans has reached the lowest levels in history, Trump said in his speech.\\n\\nFacts First: Trump is correct. The unemployment rate for each of these three groups is at a record low, at least since the government has been issuing data on them. (The data for African Americans and Hispanics goes back to the early 1970s, while data for Asians only goes back to 2000.)\\n\\nTrump inherited a positive trend that has continued during his tenure. The unemployment rate for all three groups had fallen substantially under President Barack Obama from the recession-era levels of 2009.\\n\\nThe African-American unemployment rate was 5.9% in December 2019. That is an uptick from the 5.4% all-time low in August 2019, but it is still lower than the rate at any point under any other president for whom we have data.\\n\\nThe Hispanic unemployment rate was 4.2% in December 2019 -- an uptick from the 3.9% all-time low in September 2019 but, again, lower than any point under any other president for whom we have data.\\n\\nThe Asian unemployment rate was 2.4% in December, an uptick from the 2.0% low of May 2018 but still a smidgen lower than the pre-Trump record -- 2.6% in December 2016, Obama's last full month in office.\\n\\n— Donna Borak\\n\\nFactories\\n\\nTrump said that after losing 60,000 factories under the previous two administrations, America has now gained 12,000 new factories during his time in office.\\n\\nFacts First: Both figures are correct, though it's worth noting that the numbers include both large traditional factories and tiny facilities that produce goods with fewer than five employees.\\n\\nThere are different ways to measure the number of manufacturing establishments in the country. According to the Census Bureau's Statistics of US Businesses data series, the number of manufacturing establishments in the US fell by 61,076 between 2001, the beginning of the George W. Bush administration -- when there were 352,619 establishments -- and 2016, the last full year of the Obama administration, when there were 291,543 establishments. That's a reduction of about 17%.\\n\\nAnother government measure, the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages, shows an increase of 12,074 in the number of manufacturing establishments between the first quarter of 2017 (343,972), when Trump took office, and the second quarter of 2019, the most recent data available (356,046).\\n\\n— Daniel Dale\\n\\nJob creation\\n\\nTrump said seven million new jobs have been created since his election, more than government experts projected during the previous administration.\\n\\nFacts First: Trump is correct. Between November 2016, the month of his election, and December 2019, the last month for which we have data, the economy added 7.3 million jobs.\\n\\nBetween February 2017, Trump's first full month in office, and December 2019, the economy added 6.7 million jobs, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Jobs added in January 2020 and the early days of this month likely took the total under Trump even closer to 7 million. The jobs report for January is due on Friday. But pre-election, Trump said he would create 25 million jobs. Regarding the projection it was not immediately clear what Trump was referring to.\\n\\n— Anneken Tappe\\n\\nFood stamps\\n\\nTrump touted how the strong economy has lifted people out of poverty, noting that fewer people are enrolled in food stamps.\\n\\nUnder my administration, 7 million Americans have come off food stamps, Trump said during Tuesday's address.\\n\\nFacts First: It's true that fewer people receive food stamps than when Trump took office, but he exaggerates the figure.\\n\\nSome 36.4 million people were enrolled in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP -- the formal name for food stamps, in October 2019, according to data from the US Department of Agriculture.\\n\\nThat compares to 42.7 million who received food stamps in January 2017, when Trump became President. That's a difference of 6.3 million.\\n\\nHowever, the October 2019 figure does not include data from North Carolina. Factoring in that data, the decline was closer to 5 million, according to the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.\\n\\nWhile much of the recent decline in food stamps is due to the stronger economy, experts said, the Trump administration is pushing policies that will kick millions more off the rolls.\\n\\nOfficials unveiled a rule in December that will require more food stamp recipients to work in order to receive benefits. The new requirement limits states' ability to waive existing work mandates and could result in 688,000 people losing assistance, according to the Agriculture Department.\\n\\nThe move is one of three Trump administration efforts to overhaul SNAP. Another proposed regulation, which would tighten the rules governing who qualifies for aid, could end up stripping more than 3 million people of their benefits and leave nearly 500,000 children without access to free school meals. The third proposal would change how allowances for utility expenses are calculated, which would have a mixed impact. The agency is still working on the latter two proposals.\\n\\nTogether, the proposed regulations would have decreased the number of people on food stamps by 3.7 million had they been implemented last year, according to a November report from the Urban Institute.\\n\\n— Tami Luhby\\n\\nImmigration and the border\\n\\nUS-Mexico border\\n\\nTrump said his administration has taken an unprecedented effort to secure the US-Mexico border.\\n\\nFacts First: While it's unclear what measures Trump is specifically referencing when he says unprecedented effort, his administration has taken some steps previous administrations haven't and officials have credited those measures with having reduced the influx of migrants into the US.\\n\\nStill, crossings at the southern border remain and many of the policies put forth by the Trump administration have resulted in prolonged court challenges.\\n\\nIn the last fiscal year, Border Patrol arrested more than 851,000 people trying to cross the southern border, leading to overcrowding in border facilities and straining the administration's resources. Since then, border arrests have declined , but they remain high. Last December, for example, Border Patrol arrested 32,858 people.\\n\\nOver the last year, the Trump administration has rolled out a series of policies to curtail the flow of asylum seekers to the border, such as the so-called remain in Mexico policy. Forcing migrants, many of whom are from Central America, to Mexico marks an unprecedented shift in US asylum policy. Instead of living in the US as they work their way through the immigration court process, migrants are required to stay in Mexico, under the policy formally known as the Migrant Protection Protocols.\\n\\nDespite ongoing legal challenges, a federal appeals court allowed the policy to continue. Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman Heather Swift has called the policy an effective tool to address the ongoing crisis at the southwest border, echoing similar praise from other administration officials.\\n\\n— Priscilla Alvarez\\n\\nBorder wall\\n\\nTrump claimed to have built over 100 miles of a long, tall and very powerful border wall.\\n\\nFacts First: US Customs and Border Protection said that, as of January 31, 115 miles of new border wall system had been built. The overwhelming majority has replaced dilapidated barriers with a new, enhanced wall system. Around one mile has been built where there was no previous barrier.\\n\\nThe Trump administration calls all miles new, arguing that it is all a major improvement on what was there before. Critics scoff at the inclusion of replacement and reinforcement barriers in the new category, yet administration officials have stood by their classification.\\n\\nOne thing I want to emphasize is that every inch of the 100 miles that we have constructed is new border wall system, acting DHS chief Chad Wolf said in January. It's not so-called replacement wall, as some of our critics claimed. It is new wall.\\n\\n— Daniel Dale and Priscilla Alvarez\\n\\nCatch and release\\n\\nTrump repeated a concern he's voiced previously about the so-called catch and release practice, claiming migrants who were released never showed up for their assigned court date.\\n\\nBefore I came into office, Trump said Tuesday, if you showed up illegally on our southern border and were arrested, you were simply released and allowed into our country, never to be seen again.\\n\\nFacts First: This is not true. Government data shows that, as of 2017, a majority of asylum seekers show up for their court hearings.\\n\\nAccording to data from the Department of Justice, the rate of asylum seekers who did not appear for their court hearings rose from 9% in 2016 to 11% in 2017, meaning that roughly 90% of those actually do show up for their court hearings.\\n\\n— Tara Subramaniam\\n\\nIllegal crossings\\n\\nTrump, touting his efforts to curb illegal migration, said that as a result of our unprecedented efforts, illegal crossings are down 75% since May -- dropping eight straight months in a row.\\n\\nFacts First: Trump is correct about the recent decline, but he's cherry-picking the most favorable possible starting point: May 2019 was the month with the largest number of illegal crossings at any point in his presidency. The total number of illegal crossings under Trump has increased, not decreased, from the late Obama era.\\n\\nThe number of apprehensions and people deemed inadmissible at the southwest border, used as a proxy for the number of illegal crossings, was 144,116 in May. The number dropped every month through December, when it was 40,620 -- a decline of 72%. There was another decline in January, according to data obtained by CNN and not yet published by the government.\\n\\nBut the total number of people apprehended or deemed inadmissible for the 2019 fiscal year was 977,509. That's the highest number since 2007 and 77% higher than the 553,378 figure for the 2016 fiscal year, President Barack Obama's last full fiscal year in office.\\n\\n— Daniel Dale\\n\\nHealth\\n\\nPre-existing conditions\\n\\nTrump has repeatedly promised to protect those with pre-existing conditions, even as he has sought to kill the Affordable Care Act, which greatly expanded those safeguards.\\n\\nI've also made an ironclad pledge to American families. We will also protect patients with pre-existing conditions, he said during Tuesday's State of the Union address.\\n\\nFacts First: Trump's claim about protecting those with pre-existing conditions is false. Though Trump says he would do this, his administration has consistently taken steps to undermine the Affordable Care Act -- including joining a lawsuit aimed at striking down the law -- without presenting alternative plans that would offer similar benefits.\\n\\nThe Affordable Care Act barred insurers in the individual market from denying people coverage or charging them higher premiums because of their health histories. Also, carriers had to provide comprehensive coverage -- offering 10 essential health benefits, including maternity, mental health and prescription drugs.\\n\\nTrump has worked to undermine the Affordable Care Act from his first day in office, when he issued an executive order directing agencies to interpret its regulations as loosely as possible. He championed congressional Republicans' bills in 2017 that would have weakened the law's protections.\\n\\nAnd his Justice Department is siding with a coalition of Republican states that are fighting in federal court to invalidate the Affordable Care Act. An appellate panel in December upheld a lower court ruling that found Obamacare's individual mandate unconstitutional but sent the case back to the lower court to decide whether the entire law must fall.\\n\\nThe President has said repeatedly that he would roll out a new health care plan that would protect those with pre-existing conditions, but he has yet to do so. Last April, he backed away from pushing for a vote on a replacement plan until after the 2020 election.\\n\\nMeanwhile, he issued another executive order in late 2017 that would make it easier for Americans to buy alternatives to the Affordable Care Act that are cheaper, but offer fewer protections, such as short-term health plans . The law's defenders, however, fear that such plans could siphon off younger and healthier people, which could cause premiums to rise for those left buying policies in the Obamacare exchanges.\\n\\nTrump's administration is also allowing states to make major changes to their Obamacare markets, which could also leave low-income, older or sicker residents with few choices and higher costs. Few states have taken the federal government up on this offer so far.\\n\\n— Tami Luhby\\n\\nDrug overdose deaths\\n\\nWith unyielding commitment, we are curbing the opioid epidemic -- drug overdose deaths declined for the first time in nearly 30 years. Among the states hardest hit, Ohio is down 22%, Pennsylvania is down 18%, Wisconsin is down 10% -- and we will not quit until we have beaten the opioid epidemic once and for all, Trump said during his speech.\\n\\nFacts First: Trump's claim is correct, but it needs context. Drug overdose deaths declined in 2018 for the first time since 1990, 28 years prior. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that there were 67,367 drug overdose deaths in the United States in 2018, a 4.1% decline from 70,237 deaths in 2017.\\n\\nSeveral states that were hardest hit did see a decrease, but others did not. While Pennsylvania and Ohio saw a decrease in overdose deaths in 2018, they were still among the top five states with the highest drug overdose death rate in the nation.\\n\\nThe CDC found that the drug overdose death rate was lower in 2018 than in 2017 in 14 states and the District of Columbia. But the 2018 overdose death rate was also higher than in 2017 in five states -- California, Delaware, Missouri, New Jersey and South Carolina.\\n\\nAnd while the 2018 death rate due to heroin, methadone, and natural and semisynthetic opioids overdoses was lower or stayed the about the same as 2017, overdose deaths due to synthetic opioids, such as fentanyl, continued to rise in 2018. Cocaine and psychostimulant overdose deaths also increased in 2018.\\n\\n— Maegan Vasquez\\n\\nPrescription drug prices\\n\\nTackling the high cost of prescription drugs was one of Trump's key campaign promises in 2016. And it's been a main focus of his administration, though little has actually been done.\\n\\nRecent statistics show a continued rise in drug prices, so Trump harkened back to a data point he mentioned at last year's State of the Union.\\n\\nAnd I was pleased to announce last year that for the first time in 51 years, the cost of prescription drugs actually went down, Trump said during his State of the Union address.\\n\\nFacts First: That's not quite true. The President was citing the 12-month change in the consumer price index for prescription drugs for December 2018, when it dropped 0.6%. That was the largest (but not the first) decrease since April 1973, not in 51 years. At last year's State of the Union he said drug prices experienced their single largest decline in 46 years.\\n\\nMore importantly, recent data shows that drug prices have continued to rise by several measures.\\n\\nThe list price of brand name drugs rose 3.2%, on average, over the 12 months ending in September 2019, after adjusting for inflation, according to SSR Health, a consulting firm that captures about 90% of these medications sold in the US.\\n\\nThat's similar to the increase for drugs sold at the pharmacy and through mail order. The annual change in the consumer price index for prescription drugs was 3% in December, the third straight positive reading and its highest rate since June 2018, according to Altarum, a nonprofit research and consulting firm. The CPI, however, varies widely month to month.\\n\\nThough the Trump administration rolled out a 44-page blueprint on how to lower drug prices in 2018, few of the President's proposals have gone into effect. A district court judge last year blocked the administration's effort to require drug companies to include list prices in TV ads.\\n\\nAdministration officials last year dropped plans to effectively ban drug makers from providing rebates to pharmacy benefit managers and insurers because it would have increased Medicare premiums.\\n\\nAnd the administration's idea to set the Medicare reimbursement level for certain drugs based on their cost in other countries has yet to be rolled out formally.\\n\\nOne effort that is moving forward -- amid much controversy -- is allowing states to import certain drugs from Canada. Several states, led by Florida, have expressed interest in doing this. Canada, however, hasn't been so eager to participate, and experts question whether it would be effective since Canada's prescription drug supply is small compared to the US market.\\n\\nDrug companies, however, do appear to have slowed the rate of price increases, perhaps in part because of Trump's Twitter bully pulpit. Pfizer temporarily walked back hikes in mid-2018 after Trump tweeted that it should be ashamed for raising prices and taking advantage of the poor. Pfizer ended up raising them the following January.\\n\\nEveryone has pulled in their horns. It's not worth getting into a Twitter war with the President, said Richard Evans, founder of SSR Health.\\n\\n— Tami Luhby\\n\\nTrade\\n\\nUSMCA\\n\\nTrump claimed that the new US-Mexico-Canada Agreement, which replaces the North American Free Trade Agreement, will create nearly 100,000 new high-paying American auto jobs.\\n\\nFacts First: Trump is inflating his administration's own estimate of job creation under the new trade deal -- which is even higher than an estimate from an independent agency.\\n\\nIt's difficult to predict what will happen in the future. But a report from the Trump Administration's own Office of US Trade Representative put the number at 76,000 jobs over five years.\\n\\nThe US International Trade Commission, an agency that is part of the federal government but conducts its analysis independently of the administration, estimated an increase of 29,700 jobs in auto parts production because of the USMCA, but a decline of 1,600 jobs in vehicle production.\\n\\n— Katie Lobosco\\n\\nCourts\\n\\nJudicial appointments\\n\\nTouting his record of appointing conservative judges, Trump said, We have confirmed a record number of 187 new federal judges to uphold our constitution as written.\\n\\nFacts First: Trump does not have the overall record for judges confirmed at this point in a presidential term. But he does hold the record for appeals court judges confirmed, according to Russell Wheeler, a visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution who tracks judicial appointments.\\n\\nThe 187 judges Trump has appointed falls short of the 197 President Jimmy Carter appointed at the same point in his term.\\n\\nThe 50 appeals court judges appointed by Trump thus far beats the 48 Carter had appointed, though Carter was operating with a smaller judiciary.\\n\\nTrump has confirmed 21% of judgeships. For Carter, it was 29%, and for President Richard Nixon it was 32%.\\n\\n— Curt Devine\\n\\nDemocratic response\\n\\nMichigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer said in the Democratic response to Trump's State of the Union that American workers are hurting and wages have stagnated. In my own state. Our neighbors in Wisconsin. And Ohio. And Pennsylvania. All over the country. Wages have stagnated, while CEO pay has skyrocketed.\\n\\nFacts First: It is unclear what numbers Whitmer is citing, but the Bureau of Labor Statistics' It is unclear what numbers Whitmer is citing, but the Bureau of Labor Statistics' latest jobs report doesn't support her claim.\\n\\nAverage hourly earnings rose 2.9% in 2019, the report says. Consumer price inflation meanwhile stood at 2.3% over the 12 months ending in December, leaving average hourly earnings slightly higher for the year.\\n\\nAccording to the same wage measure, paychecks also rose in the states Whitmer cited -- Ohio, Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania.\\n\\n— Anneken Tappe\\n\\nThis story is being updated"}

{"original": "Washington (CNN) The increasingly chaotic aftermath of the US strike against Iran has left President Donald Trump's team scrambling to keep up with his unpredictable decisions and inflammatory pronouncements, and suggests dysfunction at the heart of the nation's critical national security process.\\n\\nTop Trump aides are making frantic efforts to justify the killing of Qasem Soleimani , one of Iran's top leaders, and are bracing for a possible reprisal attack as the Islamic Republic moves around military hardware . But they are still refusing to publicly offer Americans details of the imminent attacks that they said the top general was planning.\\n\\nA farcical episode on Monday when at one point it seemed the military had announced it was pulling back troops from Iraq -- then said it made a mistake -- painted an unflattering picture of the administration's decision-making process. And t op officials have twice had to rule out Trump's warning that he could strike at cultural targets in Iran if it tries to avenge Soleimani's killing. Such action could amount to war crimes.\\n\\nThe churn in Washington and growing questions over the rationale for an escalation that some fear could lead the US and Iran closer to war is complicating Trump's hopes of presenting a clean narrative that he acted decisively to eliminate a terrorist mastermind and to save the lives of hundreds of Americans.\\n\\nThe controversy is mounting at the same time as a fierce dispute over impeachment intensifies, making for a combustible mood on Capitol Hill.\\n\\nBoth dramas -- Trump's hardline policy against Iran and his alleged coaxing of Ukraine for political favors that led to impeachment -- highlight his propensity to resist curbs on his power. It also reveals how the credibility of the administration -- a priceless commodity at a time of national emergency -- has been eroded by the President's documented record of repeated lying. At the moment when Trump needs Americans to believe him, it is not surprising there is reticence among his critics in Congress to take his thin explanations for the Soleimani attack at face value.\\n\\nConfusion may also have something to do with the relative lack of experience in Trump's national security cabinet -- which the President has hollowed out by removing more substantial figures, such as former Defense Secretary James Mattis, who pushed back against his impulses or were more wedded to traditional national security policies.\\n\\nTrump's press secretary Stephanie Grisham, who has noticeably not given any briefings from the White House briefing room, did venture into the friendlier surroundings of Fox News. During an interview there, she insisted that the President was on top of the fallout from the killing of Soleimani. She rebuked Democrats for not celebrating Soleimani's demise. Asked about possible counter-strikes from Iran, Grisham replied: That's not something that we would know about, but we're definitely ready for it.\\n\\nThe country should feel good that this President is not going to let anything happen to anybody, Grisham said.\\n\\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo, due to brief members of Congress on the strikes in the next few days, again refused on Tuesday to provide public evidence of the imminence of the attacks that the administration has said Soleimani was planning before he was killed in a drone strike at a Baghdad airport.\\n\\nWe could see clearly everything Soleimani has done, Pompeo said, pointing to Iran's influence in Lebanon and other countries in the region where he said Tehran has denied people sovereignty and freedom.\\n\\nTrump: 'We're safer'\\n\\nThe President insisted on Monday that the drone strike at the Baghdad airport that killed Soleimani, the head of the elite Quds force of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps, should have been carried out years ago by previous administrations.\\n\\nWe're a lot safer because of it, Trump told conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh. As Americans brace for a reprisal strikes from its enemy of 40 years, the President seemed unperturbed.\\n\\nWe'll see what the response is, if any, he said.\\n\\nThe White House says that the killing Soleimani may have saved hundreds of US lives and point to his role masterminding Iran's network of radical proxy groups and developing weaponry that helped militias kill hundreds of US troops in the Iraq war.\\n\\nBut Democrats complained that the administration has provided only classified material about the attack, which critics fear could spark a war with Iran. They want Trump to give a full public accounting.\\n\\nI've become increasingly alarmed about the strike, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-New York, said. A strike that was carried out with insufficient transparency, without consultation of Congress and without a clear plan for what comes next.\\n\\nEven one of Trump's sometime golf partners -- Republican Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, who is often troubled by US military action abroad -- raised concerns about what happens next.\\n\\nThe death of Soleimani, I think, is the death of diplomacy, Paul said. I see only military escalation from here. I see no way out.\\n\\nBut Gen. Mark Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said there was no reason to doubt Soleimani's intent.\\n\\nI've seen words like, 'Oh, the intelligence is razor thin,'  Miller told reporters. I will stand by the intelligence I saw, that it was compelling, it was imminent, and it was very, very clear in scale, scope.\\n\\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi has announced a vote this week on a War Powers Resolution designed to limit Trump's power to conduct military operations against Iran for more than 30 days.\\n\\nAs massive crowds gathered in Iran at Soleimani's funeral rites, the Supreme Leader's military adviser told CNN that Iran would hit back at US military sites.\\n\\nThousands of US troops are vulnerable in the Middle East. In a sign of readiness, the US planned to deploy six B-52 bombers for Iran operations to the British territory of Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean.\\n\\nBut a mix-up over the status of US troops in Iraq, after the country's Parliament voted to expel them, sparked questions about the administration's strategic coherence.\\n\\nIn a letter, the Defense Department told the Iraqi Defense Ministry that it was repositioning some troops and said, We respect your sovereign decision to order our departure.\\n\\nBut Milley called the letter a mistake and said was poorly worded because it implied a withdrawal that was not happening.\\n\\nIn another sign of disarray, Defense Secretary Mark Esper contradicted Trump's two assertions that the US could bomb cultural sites in Iran.\\n\\nWe will follow the laws of armed conflict, Esper told CNN, when asked about attacks that could amount to war crimes if they were conducted.\\n\\nHeat rises over impeachment\\n\\nIt is a sign of the turmoil that habitually rages in Washington during the Trump administration that lawmakers are wrapped up in an impeachment controversy even as war drums beat.\\n\\nBolton's announcement that he was now ready to appear at a Senate trial was greeted as a triumph by Democrats after Pelosi delayed sending over voted-on articles of impeachment against Trump to challenge the GOP reluctance to call witnesses.\\n\\nI have concluded that, if the Senate issues a subpoena for my testimony, I am prepared to testify. Bolton said in a statement.\\n\\nThe development was a political boost for Democrats because it allowed them to argue that a GOP refusal to allow witness testimony would be tantamount to suppressing the truth.\\n\\nIf any Senate Republican opposes issuing subpoenas to the four witnesses and documents we've requested they would make it absolutely clear they are participating in a cover up in one of the most sacred duties we have in this Congress, in this Senate, and that is to keep a president in check, Schumer said.\\n\\nRepublican sources however suggested that the Bolton breakthrough would not cause McConnell to budge from his position that the trial must start before a decision is made on witnesses.\\n\\nTrump allies in the Senate are still staunchly opposed to continuing to investigate his pressure on Ukraine for dirt on Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, arguing it is not their chamber's job to improve the House's case.\\n\\nIf the House wants to start a new impeachment inquiry or pull it back and add additional elements to it, that's their choice to make, Florida Republican Sen.

{"original": "The following is an excerpt from Latino in America by Soledad O'Brien with Rose Marie Arce. Published by arrangement with Celebra, a member of Penguin Group (USA), Inc. Copyright (c) Soledad O'Brien, 2009.\\n\\nWhen you have a name like María de la Soledad Teresa O'Brien, you have a lot of explaining to do. My mother is black and also Latina, more specifically Cuban. She is a devout Catholic who credits the Virgin Mary with any success she's had in this country. But it was my father, a man who spoke no Spanish, who chose the name María de la Soledad to honor the Blessed Virgin Mary of Solitude (solitude in Spanish is soledad).\\n\\nMy name is altogether too long for Americans, who've always struggled with it. It's even too long for a driver's license. African-Americans assume I'm named after the notorious Soledad prison or Mount Soledad in California. Latinos want to know if I'm lonely. That doesn't fit because I grew up with five siblings and I have four kids of my own, so I'm not lonely at all, though I do often seek solitude, the actual meaning of my name.\\n\\nMy father was Irish and Scottish, but from Australia, and my parents added Teresa when I was confirmed. My parents named all their children after people they loved and admired, and when it got to me, it was the Virgin Mary's turn. When I married, I thought about taking my husband's name (Raymond), but I realized that, odd as it is, the name I have works. I have a mass of kinky hair, light brown skin and lots of freckles. I'm black and Cuban, Australian and Irish, and like most people in America, I'm someone whose roots come from somewhere else. I'm a mixed race, first-generation American.\\n\\nMy ethnic roots are relevant when you look at the broader picture of who brings us the news. Who you are matters oh so very much when, according to the National Association of Hispanic Journalists (NAHJ), just 6 percent of the people working in TV news and 4 percent of the newspaper reporters in this country are Latinos. The NAHJ presents a report on media diversity called the Brownout Report, and it determined that less than 1 percent of the stories aired by the networks include Latinos, and that tiny amount is heavily concentrated on immigration, crime and drugs.\\n\\nIt's hard to be the lone ethnic face in the room. People look to me to explain a community that is diverse and ever-changing, a community with which sometimes I don't have a great deal in common. There is so little in-depth reporting on people of color that I set the bar high for myself and the people around me. I see the job I have now as my opportunity to get good reporting about black and brown people on TV, as a chance to bring people together, and to tell a fair and accurate story of communities of color, not just rehash stereotypes for the sake of drama. O'Brien wanted to share her multicultural experience »\\n\\nMore than anything, the stories have to be good, the story lines compelling and the people in them interesting. If no one watches, then I've accomplished nothing. The communities I cover have their own high expectations. People see this as a rare chance for good reporting about their communities to make it to television and they expect a lot. It can be exhausting to be reduced to your race and ethnicity. You can be made to feel bad about where you come from or feel bad about succeeding or feel like you're not a part of a community because your experience is different. My Cuban-born mother is wonderful on this topic. This woman who didn't teach her children Spanish did teach us pride.\\n\\nDon't let them tell you you're not black, she tells me. Don't let them tell you you're not Hispanic or not Cuban. And I don't. The fact that I work for CNN has fostered my commitment to telling great stories about people of color.\\n\\nCNN, a part of the Time Warner company, lives for news about everything and anyone. In the office, the bosses openly discuss the need for a diverse staff and diverse stories, and each time we draw new viewers, the effort intensifies. There is an active diversity council, aggressive diversity training, regular speeches from the highest officers of the company about how our country is changing and CNN has to be a part of that change. They see the demographics of the future and know they have to look at their hiring and reporting practices so that they appeal to the widest possible audience.\\n\\nAs CNN saw our growth in African-American viewership, they affirmed a fundamental truth of news coverage -- people will watch you if they see themselves in what you report. It doesn't hurt if the people doing the reporting look like them, too.\\n\\nIn 2007, CNN's coverage was altered dramatically by the launch of a series called Uncovering America, and the entire staff was asked to find compelling stories about the broadest range of people possible, not just people of color but folks of every race and ethnicity from all walks of life. That series was followed by the launch of a documentary project called Black in America, and I was tapped to be the correspondent.\\n\\nThe yearlong effort of Black in America was exhausting for me. I was one of a handful of black voices on the staff, and each day was a meshing of ideas and backgrounds and cultures. In other words, we argued a lot. I compiled everything. I learned new things about the black community that I'd lived in and covered my entire life. The result was a four-hour documentary that earned terrific reviews, got more viewers than almost any CNN documentary and started a discussion about the community of which I continue to be proud.\\n\\nNot everything was perfect.\\n\\nIt's critical in covering a community well to report both the good and the bad. I learned so much about reporting on race and some unexpected lessons about the stress of being a woman of color in the media. But by the time the project ended, I felt like I had started an important conversation about the struggles and the successes of the African-American community.\\n\\nIt became time to bring the same focus to bear on Latinos. So CNN began reporting Latino in America in the fall of 2008 with the goal of showing a community that was changing the United States even as the United States was changing them. I was tapped to be the correspondent once again.\\n\\nMy first thought was what a terrific opportunity this was for me! After so many years of fighting for fair and accurate coverage of people of color, I finally had a chance to work on a wide-ranging project that could show all Americans a fuller picture of who Latinos are and what they mean to this country. I vowed to give voice to the part of the community I knew, an optimistic, family-centered people who infuse U.S. culture with the warmth of their humanity.\\n\\nMy community embraced this project from the outset with an enthusiasm I'd not expected. Total strangers approached me with advice and assistance. Over and over, I was asked to please report on the people who are so often ignored, the Latinos who do not reflect the illegal alien who crosses the border to steal American jobs.\\n\\nPeople, many of them my own co-workers, asked me to push past the rancor of the immigration debate, which has strayed from being a discussion of policy and law enforcement to one that demonizes and stereotypes and hurts people whether they are illegal immigrants or not.\\n\\nLatinos saw this documentary as a wonderful opportunity to showcase the cultural struggles and contributions of Latinos; to focus on education, community and faith and show the broader public a more complete picture of how we live.\\n\\nIt was clear that the community felt starved for good solid coverage. No one asked me to do a snow job. Just please don't reduce us to crime, immigration and racial conflicts, they asked. Folks just didn't want to see their community hurt anymore and were very blunt about it. One afternoon I had lunch with Lupe Ontiveros in Los Angeles. She is a beloved Latina actor who has been reduced to the role of the maid or the nanny in scores of movies. I asked Lupe to be a major character in our documentary, and she offered an enormous amount of assistance.\\n\\nWhen I left the table she turned to my producer and said bluntly in Spanish, Please, just don't f-- us.\\n\\nIn the end, that wasn't hard because there are so many great untold stories to tell about Latinos that I knew would interest an audience of any racial or ethnic origin. The numbers of Latinos are exploding and spanning out into places where Latinos have never been seen before. Their impact on the United States is awesome.\\n\\nI knew from the outset I had to have as broad a focus as possible to cover such a large story. My team of producers, photographers and editors had to look at the Latino community through many sets of eyes. I urged our team to break new ground, to not end up rehashing the same old story told of any minority community, that there are Anglos unhappy they've arrived. That is not what it means to be Latino in America. We had to step back and watch a more complex human story unfold.\\n\\nAs we did our reporting, I realized quickly how challenging this was going to be. Latinos are an extremely diverse ethnicity that can be of any race and have many different origins, history and traditions. You can't easily group people who come from as far away as Buenos Aires, Argentina, and Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, with people of Mayan, Incan and Taino descent who have mixed with Spaniards, Africans and Jews. We are about so much more than where we came from or how we look.\\n\\nThe essential point is that we don't come together in a real way until we set foot on U.S. soil. That's when our Latino experience begins. Latino is an American identity.\\n\\nIt is a word to describe Americans who are drawn to each other by this intangible cultural link, the similarity of the way we run our families, our devotion to faith, the warmth of our personalities and our connection to a history that recognizes no border to the south.\\n\\nLatinos are a people who celebrate the new culture they've created in the United States while struggling each day with whether we need to assimilate or integrate into this new society. We ask ourselves what good things we want to preserve from our culture and what American values we want or need to adopt. And that question never goes away, not one, two or three generations beyond immigration."}

{"original": "The U.S. dollar started 2018 on the wrong foot, hitting its lowest point since mid-September.\\n\\nIn fact, the greenback lost value for almost all of 2017. It plummeted despite factors that typically drive up the dollar, like the passage of tax cuts and an overall healthy U.S. economy.\\n\\nBut compared to the world's most traded currencies, the dollar fell nearly 10% last year. It's down 2% since December 15, according to the ICE dollar index.\\n\\nPolitical turmoil stemming from the 2016 election, better global growth and uncertainty over whether the tax bill would even happen pushed the dollar south to start last year.\\n\\nBut more recently, experts say dimmed expectations for the tax bill's impact on the U.S. economy, along with international factors, have caused the dollar to continue drifting down.\\n\\nRelated: Workers see fewer chances of promotion and raises\\n\\nPeople are accepting the idea that tax cuts are boosting near-term growth but won't change the long-term growth potential of the U.S. economy, says Marc Chandler, global head of currency strategy at Brown Brothers Harriman, a private bank.\\n\\nThe tax bill cut corporate taxes significantly and lowered taxes for many individuals, especially wealthy Americans. However, CEOs have said they don't plan to go on a hiring or spending spree because of the tax cuts. And economists often point out that rich people tend to save, not spend, the extra cash they get from lower taxes.\\n\\nA broader global trend also hit the dollar in 2017. For years after the financial crisis, the United States was one of the lone bright spots in the global economy with robust job growth and consistent, albeit slow, economic growth.\\n\\nWith the U.S. as the main engine for the global recovery, the dollar strengthened nearly 13% in 2014, 9% in 2015 and another 3.5% in 2016, according to the ICE index.\\n\\nRelated: 2017 was the year of the red-hot job market\\n\\nNow that other regions are picking up the slack, other currencies are gaining steam again, pushing down the dollar after its historic, multi-year rally. China's growth has stabilized. Europe' economy is showing strength. Latin America, particularly Brazil and Argentina, is recovering after hitting rock bottom in prior years.\\n\\nGlobal growth last year was likely at its highest point since 2007 (we still need to see the fourth quarter economic growth figures which come out in about a month).\\n\\nAs a result of better growth, central banks, particularly in the U.K. and Europe are catching up to the U.S.'s Fed by raising rates. For years, the Fed was bringing U.S. interest rates up while others were keep theirs flat or negative. That divergence also pushed up the dollar. Now monetary policy is converging -- an overall healthy sign -- which also hits the dollar's value.\\n\\nRelated: U.S. consumer confidence remains near 17-year high\\n\\nAs for 2018, experts say the dollar could keep going down even though the U.S. economy is in good shape.\\n\\nWhen you look from a broader [perspective] -- global growth, global interest rates -- you can see a little further weakness from the dollar, says Ihab Salib, head of international fixed income at Federated Investors.\\n\\nThe tax bill could have an additional negative impact on the dollar. If middle class Americans decide to spend the money they received from tax savings, they'll almost certainly buy products -- like iPhones -- made overseas. If that trend boosts imports more than exports, the dollar could go down some more.\\n\\nWhere is it going to be spent? It's going to be spent buying things from predominantly outside the United states, adds Salib. You could potentially see a little more weakness in the first six months or so."}

Unprecedented support from central banks and governments remains in place, and the vaccine rollout that will eventually feed an economic recovery is gathering steam.\\n\\nFiscal and monetary policy are highly supportive, and financial conditions are very loose, said Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management. We therefore continue to expect strong global growth in 2021.\\n\\nIn the meantime, however, virus headlines are generating turbulence.\\n\\nOn Monday, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced a third lockdown for England. The nation is grappling with a surge in Covid-19 cases believed to be triggered by a new, more infectious variant. Italy said Tuesday that it's extending most of the coronavirus restrictions imposed during the Christmas holidays until Jan. 15. German leaders are also discussing an extension of the country's lockdown.\\n\\nMeanwhile, hospitalizations continue to surge in the United States, while the vaccination effort is lagging behind targets. Just 4.5 million people have received their first dose, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Monday. That's well behind what officials had hoped for by now.\\n\\nThen there's the political action in Georgia on Tuesday. Two runoff contests there will determine whether Republicans can keep hold of the Senate.\\n\\nIt is impossible to overstate how critical these races are for fiscal, tax and regulatory policy over the next two years, Chris Krueger, policy analyst at Cowen Washington Research, said in a report Monday.\\n\\nA sweep by Democrats would allow for more ambitious spending programs once President-elect Joe Biden enters the White House. But it would also make corporate tax hikes more likely, which could jolt investors.\\n\\nA jittery Wall Street thinks the vote could go either way. That means traders, and not just political junkies, will be glued to their TVs tonight.\\n\\nThe race looks close to a toss-up, albeit with a slight Republican lean, Goldman Sachs chief US political economist Alec Phillips told clients.\\n\\nWall Street reverses plan to kick out China telcos\\n\\nThe New York Stock Exchange has abruptly reversed its decision to kick out three of China's largest state-owned telecom companies, my CNN Business colleague Laura He reports.\\n\\nIn a bizarre turn of events, the exchange said late Monday that it no longer intends to delist the firms after further consultation with relevant regulatory authorities, and that they will continue to be listed and traded on the NYSE at this time.\\n\\nThe sudden about-face comes just days after the NYSE announced that it would end trading in the shares of China Mobile, China Telecom and China Unicom — a move it said was needed to comply with an order President Donald Trump signed late last year banning Americans from investing in firms that the US government suspects are either owned or controlled by the Chinese military.\\n\\nThe action was poised to increase tensions between the world's two biggest economies. The Chinese government has criticized the United States for wantonly suppressing foreign companies listed in the country and previously said it would take necessary measures to safeguard the interests of Chinese firms.\\n\\nThe reasons behind the NYSE's reversal were not immediately clear — though investors are certainly getting whiplash.\\n\\nInvestor insight: Shares of all three affected firms, which also trade in Hong Kong, dropped Monday before rallying Tuesday. China Unicom advanced 8.5%, while China Mobile jumped 5% and China Telecom rose more than 3%.\\n\\nThe company that tried to fix US health care is shutting down\\n\\nThere was palpable excitement when Amazon's Jeff Bezos, JPMorgan Chase's Jamie Dimon and Berkshire Hathaway's Warren Buffett announced that they were forming a company to reimagine health care.\\n\\nBut three years later, the partnership — known as Haven — is shutting down, my CNN Business colleague Paul R. La Monica reports.\\n\\nThe ambitious venture was created in 2018 to provide better health care services and insurance at a lower cost to workers and families at the three companies. The hope was their learnings could be applied at other firms, too.\\n\\nBut Haven struggled to usher in large-scale changes to a notoriously thorny and complex system. CEO Atul Gawande, who was given significant bandwidth and funding to make his vision a reality, stepped down last May.\\n\\nIn a letter to employees, Dimon lauded the effort.\\n\\nHaven worked best as an incubator of ideas, a place to pilot, test and learn — and a way to share best practices across our companies, he said. Our learnings have been invaluable.\\n\\nThat may be true.

{"original": "(CNN Business) After four years of using social media platforms to bypass traditional media and spread his message directly to millions of people, President Donald Trump is now losing his digital bully pulpit.\\n\\nOn Friday, Twitter banned Trump's account for violating the company's policy against glorification of violence. The move effectively strips Trump of his preferred social network, which he'd used throughout his presidency to bypass traditional media and direct his message to his tens of millions of followers.\\n\\nA day earlier,and Instagram banned Trump's account from posting for at least the remainder of his term in office and perhaps indefinitely in the wake of the riot on the US Capitol . Other large platforms, including Twitch and Snapchat, also blocked the president's account. And e-commerce platform Shopify shut down shops run by the Trump campaign and the Trump Organization.\\n\\nSome advocacy groups cheered the potential immediate impact of these moves on a president known for spreading misinformation on social media, especially as it comes at a volatile moment for the nation.\\n\\nJonathan Greenblatt, CEO of the Anti-Defamation League, called the ban an excellent step by Twitter and a fitting end to a legacy of spewing hate and vitriol. Greenblatt previously told CNN Business that a ban on Trump's accounts would have the immediate effect of preventing him from spreading misinformation, from sharing conspiracy theories, and as such, disable him from inciting further damage to our democracy.\\n\\nBut in the long term, it remains unclear to what extent these steps will reduce Trump's ability to attack, threaten and spread misinformation given the massive following he could direct elsewhere.\\n\\nTrump had nearly 89 million followers on Twitter and has 35 million on Facebook. He also has prominent allies, digital media outlets and TV networks willing to disseminate his statements and falsehoods on the same platforms currently taking action against his accounts.\\n\\nIn recent months, Trump and his allies have leveraged social media to share baseless claims of election fraud to sow doubt in the legitimacy of the election.\\n\\nBanning Trump is not a magic bullet to erase that kind of disinformation from the platforms, but it is a place to start, said Jared Holt, a visiting research fellow at the Atlantic Council's Digital Forensic Research Lab who focuses on domestic extremism. [Social media platforms] tiptoed around the issue for years. I guess we found out what the breaking point was, which was insurrection.\\n\\nWhile the tech companies have taken action to kick off well-known figures in the past, no sitting or former US president has ever been banned. Put simply, there is no clear playbook from the various platforms on what to expect in the coming days, or in Facebook's case, after Trump is out of office.\\n\\nThere are exceptions for world leaders built into the content policies of many social media platforms that have made it more difficult to take action on Trump's posts. But this special treatment might not disappear once he is no longer president, as there are potential loopholes that might protect Trump on Facebook, for example.\\n\\nFacebook has a newsworthiness exemption , allowing some content to stay up that breaks community standards if it believes there is a public interest that does not outweigh the risk of harm. It also allows elected officials and political candidates to lie in advertisements, if Trump were to declare he was running for president again, as some have reported he might. Facebook did not immediately respond to a request for comment about its newsworthiness policy and how it might apply to Trump in the future.\\n\\nTrump is certainly not the first public figure to be deplatformed, or face the risk of it. Some of the clearest examples are Alex Jones , the right-wing conspiracy theorist, as well as other figures like far-right activist and self-described proud Islamophobe Laura Loomer and fringe right-wing media personality Milo Yiannopoulos . These figures frequently made headlines through outlandish comments before having their access to major social media revoked. They later faded significantly from mainstream conversation.\\n\\ncensoring their views.

Even before the latest round of enforcement actions, Trump's campaign had reportedly considered focusing on some of these alternative social networks. But these services have nowhere near the reach of mainstream platforms like Twitter, which has hundreds of millions of monthly users, and Facebook, which has more than 3 billion monthlyusers across its various applications.\\n\\nThere are other places to go, said Danielle Citron, a law professor at the University of Virginia and unpaid advisor to Facebook and Twitter who has long been vocal about how speech on social media platform can lead to real-world violence. At the same time, Twitter has such a reach. There are serious costs, like [with] any groups, when they have to reassemble.\\n\\nTrump could direct his millions of followers to these alternative social apps or even back a new service if he wanted. He's also floated the idea of starting his own TV network. And Trump could amplify his message on right-wing broadcasters like OAN or Newsmax, which have peddled conspiracy theories about the 2020 election.\\n\\nHowever, Holt said that Trump, thrives on creating conflict and controversy through social media. If he's taken out of communities popular with the general public, he's not going to be as effective or as disruptive as he may wish, Holt said."}

I'm just ready for it to end.\\n\\nThe investigation lasted throughout the offseason, even after he met with league officials in July. Meanwhile, Elliott earned more negative headlines for his off-field antics.\\n\\nAlthough Jones had ensured people there was no case, the NFL found enough wrongdoing to deliver the suspension.\\n\\nWhile Elliott is going into just his second year in the league, he has already become a true star for the Cowboys. He led the NFL with 1,631 rushing yards as a rookie while earning a first-team All-Pro selection.\\n\\nDarren McFadden, Ronnie Hillman and Alfred Morris should all battle for playing time with Elliott out, providing more than enough depth to keep the offense running smoothly.

{"original": "Background: Time For A New Approach? Franklin D. Roosevelt signed the first federal poverty assistance law in 1935, called the Aid to Dependent Children Act, a little-noticed add-on to the Social Security law designed to aid poor Depression-era widows and their children. The act established what for the next sixty years became the core of federal welfare -- open-ended payments from the federal government to single mothers with dependent children. As the Depression lifted, caseloads remained low during the post-war years. Then in 1962, at John F. Kennedy's urging, Congress raised welfare payments, and renamed the program Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC). Under the new law, states were permitted to require beneficiaries to do community work and attend training programs. Kennedy articulated what has since been a central goal of federal welfare policy: to end poverty, not just alleviate it. Welfare should be a hand up, not a hand out, in Kennedy's words. It wasn't until Lyndon B. Johnson's War On Poverty, beginning in 1965, that welfare spending began to take off. Eligibility requirements were broadened and benefits increased for AFDC and a bevy of federal programs designed to lower the 14 percent poverty rate. But some 27 years and $6 trillion later, the official poverty rate had notched up to 15.2 percent. More ominously, perhaps, out-of-wedlock births jumped from 5 percent (2 percent of white children, 19 percent of black children) in 1965 to its current level of 32 percent (23 percent of white children, 68 percent of black children). Such numbers fueled arguments that welfare was actually exacerbating America's poverty problems. Citing the emergence of an entrenched urban underclass, welfare critics stepped up their arguments during the 1980s that government poverty assistance was destroying personal initiative and self-responsibility, and breeding a dependent class, virtually trapping generations of families in welfare. And, some analysts warned welfare spending was rising at unsustainable levels. The conservative Heritage Foundation predicted that, left unchecked, combined federal and state welfare spending from 1996-2000 would total $2.38 trillion. Enter Clinton, Stage ... Wherever Democrats had long argued that the poor lacked adequate employment and education opportunities. Candidate Bill Clinton in 1992, however, echoed Republican criticisms, decrying permanent dependence on welfare, and asserting, No one who can work should be able to stay on welfare forever. His own welfare plan, presented in June 1994, proposed limiting welfare recipients to two years of aid, while adding some $9.3 billion in new spending for community service jobs for those who couldn't find private sector work. But Republicans, taking control of Congress in 1994, were not interested in expanding Washington's role. They embraced a more watershed approach: putting state governments in charge of welfare policy, while imposing work requirements coupled with lifetime limits on cash benefits. And, Republicans proposed ending welfare for all immigrants, legal or illegal. That was a bitter remedy for most Democrats, including the president, who vetoed two bills containing GOP-written welfare provisions during 1995 and 1996. Still, the president insisted he wanted to sign welfare reform, challenging Republicans to send him a clean bill, free of other issues such as Medicaid reform. In July 1996, Republicans did just that. After meeting with aides and Cabinet members in frenzied sessions in late July, Clinton announced he would sign the bill despite misgivings about cuts to legal immigrants and savings from food stamps. All Americans, without regard to party, know that our welfare system is broken, that it teaches the wrong values, rewards the wrong choices, hurts those it was meant to help, Clinton said. We also know that no one wants to change the current system in a good way more than people who are trapped in it. back forward"}
{"original": "(CNN) Both opponents and supporters of abortion rights are investing heavily in the Georgia Senate runoff election next week, underscoring in their get-out-the-vote and fundraising efforts the crucial significance that a US Senate majority would offer each side as they look to advance their agenda under a new administration.\\n\\nThat's why many of those activists have spent their holiday season working to draw supporters to the polls, whether for Democrats Rev. Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff, or incumbent Republican Sens. Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue. Early voting wrapped this week and Election Day is Tuesday, January 5.\\n\\nIf Democrats win both seats, they'll control the chamber with a 50-50 split decided by incoming Vice President-elect Kamala Harris.\\n\\nThe Senate majority would determine whether measures expanding abortion access backed by the Democrat-led House and Democratic President-elect Joe Biden would meet a receptive vote or a thorny end. And on a much broader scale, whichever party takes the Senate holds the power to confirm or reject Biden's picks for the federal judiciary, a key part of determining national abortion policy as conservative state legislatures advance restrictions in hopes of overturning Roe v. Wade, the 1973 landmark Supreme Court decision legalizing abortion nationwide.\\n\\nMillions invested\\n\\nAnti-abortion group Susan B. Anthony List's partner Women Speak Out PAC is on track to exceed its projected $4.1 million campaign on the runoff, according to the group's president, Marjorie Dannenfelser. The campaign, which is slated to reach 1 million voters and make 750,000 in-person voter visits, features hand delivered absentee ballot applications as well as digital and mail ads, she said.\\n\\nDannenfelser credits the rise of abortion as a focal issue in the race to the candidates deciding that they're going to communicate (their stances on abortion) as part of their overall leadership, one way or the other.\\n\\nYou've got complete clarity between the two sets of candidates, and when you have complete clarity, that's a gift in politics, and it's something that can be defined -- you can mobilize a base, she said, adding that, I think in Georgia, it's a set up for this to be the same dynamic as in many other type battlegrounds that ... a reasonable abortion position puts you, gives you the edge.\\n\\nThe organization has also issued Spanish-language ads targeting 100,000 Spanish-speaking voters in Georgia, which is 9.9% Latino , according to the US Census Bureau.\\n\\nWe had not planned on that in Georgia, not necessarily foreseeing that we would be interacting with a lot of Spanish-speaking, pro-life voters, but as it turns out, we are, Dannenfelser said, adding that we want to meet people where they are. The group anticipates strong voter turnout for anti-abortion candidates among Hispanic voters and young women between the ages of 18 and 22, she said.\\n\\nOn the other side, Planned Parenthood Votes has a six-figure campaign underway, according to Alicia Stallworth, the super PAC's Georgia state director. The group has sent nearly 400,000 text messages, made hundreds of daily phone calls and is part of a coalition of progressive groups that is over 85% of the way to its goal of knocking on five million doors, Stallworth said.\\n\\nPlanned Parenthood Votes is canvassing in Cobb County, bordering Atlanta -- Georgia's third most populous county, and home to a Planned Parenthood health center -- and targeting demographics that include their supporters: women under the age of 35, people of color, White suburban voters and White college educated women, Stallworth added.\\n\\nOur ground game and our strategy is to organize to turn out voters, to try to repeat the same thing that we did in the general election, she said. She thinks that abortion has stepped into the runoff spotlight because Warnock is a pastor and we are in the South, so it's that outdated belief that he cannot be a minister and support women's reproductive rights.\\n\\nWarnock under scrutiny\\n\\nWhile both Loeffler and Perdue have pressed their opponents on their stances on abortion -- asserting in a co-authored op-ed that Ossoff and Warnock are planning on legalizing late-term abortion, sending your tax dollars to fund abortions -- Warnock has garnered much of the attention on the issue.\\n\\nSome conservative politicians have accused Warnock, who was born and raised in Savannah and has served as the senior pastor of Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta for 15 years, of misleading voters regarding his identity and failing to represent the state's views.\\n\\nYou see this Warnock fella who's coming down here and disguising himself as some moderate pastor from the South who doesn't believe in these radical ideas, North Carolina Rep.-elect Madison Cawthorn told Fox News in mid-December. Cawthorn asserted that Warnock says he's a pastor, yet he's all about abortion. This is somebody who does not represent what real Americans believe.\\n\\nFormer Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin asked a Georgia rally crowd in December, Is this a representation of the Democrats' heart in Georgia, to have a pro-abortion pastor who's running? She said that it's all the more reason why we have those in the Senate, especially those representing Georgia, who understand the sanctity of life.\\n\\nLoeffler highlighted her divisions with Warnock over abortion during the only televised debate in the Senate runoffs, beginning her argument, Look, I'm not going to be lectured by someone who uses the Bible to justify abortion.\\n\\nListen, Warnock said as part of a broader response to the attack. I have a profound reverence for life and an abiding respect for choice. The question is, whose decision is it. And I happen to think that a patient's room is too small a place for a woman, her doctor and the US government -- I think that's too many people in the room.\\n\\nWarnock has stood by his stance on the issue, tweeting , I am a pro-choice pastor and I will always fight for reproductive justice. A former sexual health educator , Warnock sent an email to supporters last month highlighting Loeffler's vote to confirm conservative Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett and accusing Loeffler of attacking me for my unequivocal belief in a woman's right to choose.\\n\\nA divisive issue has a history in the state\\n\\nGeorgia has historically taken a conservative stance on abortion, with Republican Gov. Brian Kemp signing a heartbeat bill in 2019 banning abortion as early as six weeks into a pregnancy that was blocked in court in July 2020.\\n\\nBut Biden won the state in the presidential election by less than 12,000 votes , marking the first time in 28 years that a Democrat won Georgia. The Democratic ticket's historic success was fueled by a grassroots organizing renaissance that rallied a rapidly diversifying electorate and suburbs that are, at once, growing and becoming increasingly inhospitable to Republican candidates.\\n\\nPolling on abortion in Georgia suggests that the issue is narrowly divided. According to CNN exit polling from Election Day, 52% of Georgia voters thought that abortion should be legal, while 43% thought it should be illegal. Those numbers also vary based on race -- among White Georgia voters , 43% thought abortion should be legal while 53% thought it should be illegal, and among Black Georgia voters , 69% thought abortion should be legal while 24% thought it should be illegal.\\n\\nPlanned Parenthood Action Fund President Alexis McGill Johnson, who appeared at a Get Out the Vote event with former Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams , told CNN that Abrams, whose group Fair Fight aims to help Democratic candidates by increasing voter turnout, and other partners in the state have been laying the groundwork for understanding sort of where progressive voters are in Georgia, and that it is a numbers game and a turnout game.\\n\\nParticularly in the middle of a pandemic, the opportunity to talk about health care, to talk about the impact that not having access to basic health care, including access to abortion, or limitations on that, really resonates with people, McGill Johnson said, adding that I definitely feel as though this is a winnable race because of the climate that we're in.\\n\\nOutcome in Georgia has national ramifications\\n\\nThe implications of who wins the challenges and thus the Senate could be swift. Biden backs repealing the Hyde Amendment, a provision in congressional funding bills since 1976 that currently bars federal funds from going toward abortions except in cases of rape, incest or when the mother's life is at risk. Biden's position comes after making a dramatic shift during the Democratic primaries from his long-held support for the provision.\\n\\nAnd despite the current Republican-controlled Senate, Democrats in both chambers have signaled interest on various provisions expanding abortion access. Disagreements over Hyde were one of the sticking points in negotiations over the massive government spending bill for the new fiscal year, and House Democrats hosted a hearing last month, expressing hope of repealing Hyde. In the Senate, a markup of a funding bill was abruptly canceled in late 2019 after Democratic Sen. Patty Murray of Washington requested a vote on her amendment reversing the Title X abortion referral rule that bars participating providers from referring patients for abortions, according to a Democratic aide.\\n\\nNone of this is lost on Kristan Hawkins, the president of Students for Life Action, an anti-abortion group bringing over 200 students to Georgia with the goal of knocking on 70,000 doors and directly texting voters in a campaign costing at least $280,000.\\n\\nTo Hawkins, abortion has emerged as a key issue in the Georgia runoff because the Supreme Court in 1973 handed down Roe v. Wade, which she characterized as hanging by a thread in light of the multiple legal cases in the pipeline for the conservative-majority court to consider.\\n\\nShe pointed to the significance of Supreme Court picks as well as the multiple venues where the battle over abortion access is playing out. We're calling it the 'Save the Senate' campaign because it's literally going to determine whether or not we can hold back taxpayer-funded abortion on demand and all nine months, Hawkins said, referring to efforts to repeal the Hyde Amendment, whether or not we can ensure that, you know, the Democrats do not try to pack the US Supreme court.\\n\\nStallworth sees what's riding on the runoff as similarly critical.\\n\\nHonestly, I think everything is at stake in these two Senate seats, she said. Especially when we're talking about the fact that the two senators who we need to be elected will hold, will basically hold the fate of the nation in their hands when we know that women's reproductive rights are constantly being attacked."}

Elizabeth Warren arrived in Iowa on Friday evening and, through four events over a little more than 24 hours, quickly made clear that even as her presidential campaign evolves, she is poised to rise or fall with the same brand of wonky populism that took her from the classroom to Capitol Hill.\\n\\nIn speeches to packed rooms from the state's western border with Nebraska to its capital in Des Moines, Warren spent the weekend demanding structural change in Washington, where the partial government shutdown is entering its third week. She wants to strengthen our unions, our workers and our consumers while breaking the hold of an army of lobbyists occupying the capital, as she describes it, under the banners of big corporations.\\n\\nRELATED: Elizabeth Warren in Iowa: 'I am not a person of color'\\n\\nEven during her occasional strolls in the policy weeds, Warren, who has set the tone for her remarks so far by opening them with the story of her mother's struggle to find a minimum wage job to help save their house after Warren's father suffered a debilitating heart attack, keeps up a low fury. When her microphone cut out at the opening event in Council Bluffs, Warren didn't yell because, even in a room of 300 (with 200 more outside) she didn't have to.\\n\\nThere are too many people who get their power from turning working people against working people, the Massachusetts Democrat said a day later in Storm Lake during a riff on long-stalled talks over comprehensive immigration revisions. A few hours earlier, in Sioux City, she declared, Washington keeps working great for those with money, but not for anyone else. We need to call this out for what it is: It is corruption, pure and simple.\\n\\nIf Warren has strong feelings about ethanol, an important issue for Iowa voters and favorite means for out-of-state candidates to pander to them, she hasn't yet let on. Warren has also steered clear of some national progressive hits, like Medicare-for-all, which she hasn't mentioned through her first few stops.\\n\\nAsked on Saturday why the Democratic left's signature policy proposal had not gotten a mention through two events, Warren demurred.\\n\\nNo one's raised it, she said. But I have had a chance to talk about Medicaid, partly because I think we've had a national conversation about health care, and I think it's been enormously valuable.\\n\\nThe issue was indeed a winner for Democrats running during the 2018 midterm elections. In her opening foray, Warren has seemed content to continue on that path, advocating for Medicaid not just as a program for the poor but also as one that benefits seniors and Americans suffering from mental illness, while assailing the shameful behavior of insurance companies. On Saturday night, she won hearty applause when she called health care a basic human right.\\n\\nBut if Warren has appeared entirely self-assured in diving into the policy positions that she has been crusading for in Washington for years – All right! she cheered when an audience member in Sioux City began asking about internet regulations – her tone has changed when faced with questions about the 2016 election, a kind of riddle that she and so many other Democrats are still struggling to unwind.\\n\\nAsked how she planned to prevent a repeat of the undemocratic behavior between the DNC and Hillary's campaign in 2016 against Sen. Sanders, Warren told supporters in Des Moines, I'm not relitigating 2016, before pivoting to call all Democrats running for president to disavow super PACs, saying, I think that all of the Democratic candidates, whoever they turn out to be, should link arms and say our primary is not for sale to billionaires.\\n\\nIn a gaggle with reporters at her Council Bluffs rally on Friday, she bypassed a question about the comparisons being drawn between her campaign and Hillary Clinton's four years ago.\\n\\nYou know, look – I'd never run for public office before I got into the Senate race in Massachusetts, Warren responded. I was pulled into this because I have watched how America's middle class has been hollowed out. I am in this fight for working families. I'm going to stay focused on that all the way through.\\n\\nLike her colleague and ideological ally Sen. Bernie Sanders, the Vermont independent whose decision to enter the 2016 presidential campaign was partly a reaction to Warren's decision to sit it out, the Massachusetts senator seems least at ease when political conversation turns personal. But hers is a distinct challenge, and a lonely one during this period when Warren stands as the lone, high-profile female presidential candidate.\\n\\nShe has already been faced with a story focused on whether she risked being viewed as too unlikable, gamely parlaying it into a fundraising tool. Many Democrats seized on the same report, determined to lay down a marker to ensure that Warren and the other women likely to run – so many of them politically and personally distinct from Clinton in so many ways – be spared a very similar treatment.\\n\\nOutside Warren's debut event on Friday night, Natalie Wertz, 29, who was waiting for the candidate with a friend – both of them having purchased pink T-shirts emblazoned with Warren's de facto slogan, Nevertheless, she persisted – spoke confidently of Warren's potential as a candidate.\\n\\nNeither woman had heard about the likability flap, though Wertz smilingly proclaimed Warren a very likable person.\\n\\nBut her decision in 2020, Wertz said, would turn on more concrete questions.\\n\\nAs a lower middle class American, budget and finances sometimes – living paycheck to paycheck is very hard, she said. And it's a toxic world that has set us into this cycle of vicious debt. I think that Warren has great ideas about how to get us out of that.\\n\\nCNN's Carolyn Sung and DJ Judd contributed to this report."}

If no changes are made, the CBO projects that public debt will rise to 96% of GDP by 2028.

According to an analysis by the Bipartisan Policy Center, the Treasury will be able to finance the government's operations until at least mid-summer by moving money around from different pots."}

Black is chairman of Prime Policy Group and a former adviser to several presidential candidates including John McCain in 2008. Together they have co-chaired the Vice Presidential Selection Working Group at the Bipartisan Policy Center. The opinions expressed in this commentary are those of the authors.\\n\\n(CNN) —\\n\\nFor the presidential campaigns, beginning early and devoting adequate time to vetting and selecting a running mate has never been as important as it is this year.\\n\\nTypically, a candidate's campaign begins the vice presidential nominee selection process after mathematically securing their party's nomination, and it requires at least eight weeks to be thorough. However, two factors complicate that time line this year.\\n\\nPHOTO: Courtesy Charles Black Charles Black\\n\\nPHOTO: Robert Bauer Robert Bauer\\n\\nFirst, the national party conventions are being held earlier this cycle than in any other presidential election in the past 20 years. The conventions' early dates significantly shorten the window between the dates when a candidate mathematically clinches the nomination and the start of the party convention.\\n\\nSecond, the active phase of the primary campaign in 2016 may run later than in years past. This may not leave adequate time for the vetting and selection process. And if it is unclear who a party's nominee will be going into the convention, there will be absolutely no time to follow the vetting schedule of previous campaigns.\\n\\nConsequently, all candidates who are still in the race eight weeks before their conventions, or essentially near the end of May this year, should begin this process in earnest.\\n\\nA successful and responsible vice presidential selection requires thoroughness and care, and that means it takes time.\\n\\nA presidential candidate's selection of a running mate is one of the first looks at how he or she will govern. The choice of a vice presidential running mate illuminates those characteristics that are important in a partner to the presidential candidate, and the structure and process used to make the selection is a glimpse into the candidate's management style.\\n\\nThe choice of a running mate obviously involves political considerations, such as its appeal to certain communities, states or wings of the party. But these political considerations are necessarily weighed along with – and sometimes against – the potential vice presidential nominee's readiness and qualification for the second-highest elected office.\\n\\nThe modern vice president is a close adviser and confidante to the president, typically assigned important White House initiatives. The vice president must also, of course, be able to step into the nation's highest office if the president is unable to fulfill his or her term.\\n\\nOver the past five months, we chaired a bipartisan group of 10 advisers to previous presidential campaigns to develop the principles and best practices that would govern an effective vice presidential selection process. Our recommendations are simple and direct, and the time crunch – the need to get started now – is not our only concern.\\n\\nPresidential nominees are well-served by getting to know the potential vice presidential candidates personally. One key approach is for the campaigns to arrange for possible running mates to join the nominee on the campaign trail. The ticket is a short-term political alliance but also a longer-term personal and governing partnership, and of crucial importance is the element of personal compatibility and mutual confidence.\\n\\nPHOTO: Joe Raedle/Getty Images North America/Getty Images Then U.S. Sen. Barack Obama shakes hands with his Vice Presidential pick Sen. Joe Biden in front of the Old State Capitol August 23, 2008, in Springfield, Illinois.\\n\\nOther recommendations concern the running of a well-designed and efficient selection process. Among them are that the campaigns should take steps to assure that the sensitive task of vetting candidates should be tightly structured to assure confidentiality. This requires limiting the circle of those provided with the information and requiring all involved to sign nondisclosure agreements.\\n\\nThese measures encourage qualified candidates to put themselves forward for consideration and to engage candidly with the vetting process. It also guards against the risk that the wider circulation of vetting material could adversely affect trust and working relationships within the nominees' senior ranks and reduces the chance that, after the campaign, sensitive data could be put to inappropriate use.\\n\\nOur group also concluded that the process must be conducted by professionals with the appropriate skills. In the past, it has often been led and conducted by lawyers, typically with the capacity to draw on the resources of their law firms, to review public records and conduct interviews.\\n\\nNot all lawyers are experienced in this kind of background research, however, and campaigns should identify those whose practices and experience have given them some knowledge of the effective use of available resources to conduct sensitive research. Increasingly important is sophistication in tracking information found on social media and elsewhere on the web.\\n\\nIt is an extraordinary feature of our political system that the selection of a vice president, a decision of great magnitude, is left almost entirely in the hands and to the personal judgment of the presidential candidates. A thorough and successful vetting requires the campaigns to invest significant time, effort and resources. The decision made will have a lasting impact not just on the campaign, but on the country as well.\\n\\nJoin us on Facebook.com/CNNOpinion.\\n\\nRead CNNOpinion's Flipboard magazine.\\n\\nRobert F.

Sign up here to receive it every weekday morning.\\n\\n(CNN) As Donald Trump sees it, America lucked out with a good President —  even though they're trying to impeach the son of a b***h .\\n\\nWith his impeachment trial pending, critics see a train wreck. Yet Trump's moment of historic shame comes at a high point for fans -- and explains why Republican senators are in no mood to convict him.\\n\\nBorder crossings by undocumented migrants are way down . Trump stood up to China Mexico and Canada and got new trade deals. Freeloading allies are spending more on defense. Unemployment is at half century lows . Stocks are up and who doesn't like rising wages ? Those liberal media hacks and Washington snowflakes had it coming. And so what if Trump leaned on Ukraine for dirt on his political rivals?\\n\\nTake the killing of Qasem Soleimani : Foreign policy sages fret about long-term reprisals from Iran, the administration's unsubstantiated casus belli and an impulsive commander-in-chief. Yet supporters see a decisive President zapping an enemy who had helped kill hundreds of US soldiers, and rocking a regime that preaches death to America.\\n\\nYou can choose your truth about the Trump presidency. The big trade deals, for example, are effectively climb downs. Mexico never did pay for the wall, and Trump's separation of children from undocumented parents will stain America's conscience. And beyond impeachment, he's knee-deep in financial investigations and accusations of self-dealing.\\n\\nTrump's historically grim approval ratings should spell 2020 disaster. Much of the rest of the world is rooting against him, and millions of Americans are just exhausted. But a good chunk of the nation thinks Trump is doing a great job, and others may be open to persuasion.\\n\\nMeanwhile, the President has a potent reelection narrative: Trump the outsider never went native in Washington, and he didn't forget who sent him there. That's his best hope for November's election.\\n\\n'History will find you'\\n\\nThat's Illinois Democratic Senator Dick Durbin, warning his Republican colleagues that they will pay a price in posterity if they do not allow the admission of witnesses that he believes are key to a fair impeachment trial in the Senate.  I hope at the end of the day enough Republican senators will understand history will find you. Make certain that you can make a decision that you live with in terms of our constitution and your own professional career, he said on NBC's Meet the Press.\\n\\n1868 vs. 1998\\n\\nAfter the White House announced that Harvard professor emeritus Alan Dershowitz would join Trump's impeachment defense team, the man known as a lawyer of last resort began previewing his arguments on television.\\n\\nBut back in 1998, Dershowitz had a slightly different stance on what it took to get impeached, telling Larry King that it certainly doesn't have to be a crime if you have somebody who completely corrupts the office of president and who abuses trust and who poses great danger to our liberty, you don't need a technical crime.\\n\\nWe look at their acts of state, he added. We look at how they conduct the foreign policy. We look at whether they try to subvert the Constitution the way Iran-Contra did by going behind the back of Congress.\\n\\nNumber of the day: 2"}

These contracts either ran out in December or are expiring this month. Another 550 contracts are set to lapse in February.\\n\\nThose contracts cover around 130,000 households, who have an average income of $12,000 a year. Many tenants are elderly or disabled.\\n\\nWith no sign of the shutdown ending soon, HUD has asked landlords to draw on their reserves to cover any shortfalls. The Washington Post first reported the development earlier this week.\\n\\nThe Trump administration is taking steps to shield some low-income Americans from the impact of the partial government shutdown, which started in late December. The Department of Agriculture on Tuesday extended the time it can provide food stamps and other nutritional assistance programs to the end of February, a month later that the agency originally announced.\\n\\nHUD officials suggested that the expiration of the rental contracts likely won't prompt landlords to begin eviction proceedings immediately.\\n\\nIt's never been our experience that people were evicted by virtue of a government shutdown, a HUD official told CNN. It would run counter to the best interests of the landlords.\\n\\nBut the building owners may have to delay repairs or suspend services they provide, such as transportation, after-school care or social programs, experts said. Eventually, they may have to raise the rent on those living in the apartments, they said.\\n\\nUnder the program, tenants pay 30% of their household income, while the federal government makes up the rest of the rent, which is based on the local market.\\n\\nWithout getting that rental assistance, owners will be forced to make very difficult choices, Ellen Lurie Hoffman, federal policy director of the National Housing Trust, told CNN's Brianna Keilar.\\n\\nLandlords will likely turn to the money they've set aside, if they have any, but they are also looking at other options to continue meeting their operating needs. These include reaching out to their lenders about getting a break on their mortgages if the shutdown continues, said Andrea Ponser, executive vice president for policy at Stewards of Affordable Housing for the Future, a collaborative of non-profit affordable housing owners.\\n\\nA longer-term concern is that the uncertainty may prompt landlords to wash their hands of the program, especially in neighborhoods with fewer low-income residents.\\n\\nSome owners, because of experiences like this, will choose not to renew their contracts, said Doug Rice, senior policy analyst at the Center on Budget & Policy Priorities. In that case, there's a permanent loss of affordable housing in those communities.\\n\\nOverall, the agency's project-based rental assistance program serves 1.2 million households. HUD has said that it has funding to make payments on active contracts through February, but the payments are set to stop after that.\\n\\nTwo other agency programs for low-income Americans are more secure – at least for the next few weeks, Rice said. The department said last week that it can continue making payments to state and local housing authorities for public housing maintenance and upkeep and for housing vouchers given to low-income residents through February. These two programs serve about 3.2 million households.\\n\\nStill, some authorities may be hesitant to issue vouchers to new applicants until Congress sets the appropriation because they won't know how much funding they'll receive, Rice said.\\n\\nCNN's Athena Jones contributed to this report."}
{"original": "The internet doesn't have an off switch. While it's interesting to imagine pressing a big red button and -- poof! -- the internet goes out around the world, it's actually much more complicated than that.\\n\\nIt is possible, however, for people, companies and governments to turn off certain parts of the internet. There are countrywide blocks in places like Egypt and Gabon during political unrest, and temporary outages in India when the government turns off the internet while students take exams.\\n\\nFacebook (FB) tracks these kinds of outages. Both internal monitoring and people on the ground contribute to this effort.\\n\\nMatt Perault, global head of policy development at Facebook, started there in January 2011 -- around the time Egypt conducted widespread internet outages to quell protests. Over the next few years, he noticed that internet blocks were still happening with some frequency, just on a smaller scale.\\n\\nWe felt they weren't getting the attention they deserved, Perault said during a panel at the SXSW Interactive festival on Friday. So we work with a bunch of organizations to try and bring attention to this issue.\\n\\nRelated: This African country is taking an unprecedented step in internet censorship\\n\\nIt's not just about losing access to Facebook. For instance, he referenced a recent Brookings report that found that temporary internet shutdowns cost $2.4 billion in 2015.\\n\\nYou can think about the internet in three different layers: There's the actual infrastructure that powers the internet -- think cables and satellites. There's the protocol, which includes things like web hosts and providers, and then there are applications, like Facebook.\\n\\nEach of these layers have different responsibilities, as Perault and his fellow panelists explained, and countries or governments can target them differently. An internet service provider could stop serving a country, or a government could block specific services like Facebook or WhatsApp.\\n\\nIn China, the great firewall blocks all kinds of content, including Facebook, Twitter, and the New York Times. In Gabon last year, nightly outages prevented people from connecting to any website.\\n\\nThe problem is not the technology from a 'turn off the entire internet perspective,' Perault said. But the technology has gotten more advanced in creating methods to impose a less costly block.\\n\\nFacebook's internal group works with organizations like the Global Network Initiative to track these outages, and communicate them to a wider audience. Four out of five Facebook users are outside of the U.S., so many of them could be impacted by these blocks. For Facebook, figuring out where blocks happen is just good for business.\\n\\nFacebook said it is aware of at least 48 times in 2016 when access to Facebook, WhatsApp or Instagram was disrupted. This includes both targeted disruptions, as well those impacting the entire Internet.\\n\\nThe company said one of the most significant outages that it's tracking right now is in certain regions of Cameroon, where it said internet connectivity has been down for 50 days.\\n\\nMy main concern right now is moving to a world where there's increasingly sophisticated small-scale blocks, Perault said."}

View more opinion articles on CNN.\\n\\n(CNN) The lived effects of racism and inequality constitute America's biggest public health and safety crisis , and it demands bold, courageous action in 2021. The Biden-Harris administration's first 100 days should be devoted to developing, unveiling and implementing a National Racial Truth, Justice and Healing Commission, with executive authority charged with three broad missions. The commission could be run out of the Oval Office, perhaps overseen by senior domestic adviser Susan Rice, and have a staff that included a congressional liaison to help pursue legislative programs while simultaneously using executive authority wherever possible to achieve its objective.\\n\\nFirst, the new administration should organize a diverse group of scholars who will be charged with offering a comprehensive and holistic portrait of America's racial history. The Pulitzer Prize-winning 1619 Project by Nikole Hannah-Jones offers an important template in this regard, but one that -- even as it has been debated among historians -- has also been attacked on ideological grounds by conservatives and neo-Confederates for being overly critical of the nation's long political and cultural embrace of White supremacy.\\n\\nA major lesson of 2020 is that the past is not past. Relics and artifacts of White supremacy -- from Confederate monuments and flags to statues of generals who wanted racial slavery to continue forever -- still help shape the present, including policies that disenfranchise Black voters that were first promoted during the Reconstruction era.\\n\\nAmerica's racial history remains, now more than ever, deeply contested. President Donald Trump's appointment of a 1776 Commission to teach patriotic education in our school systems attests to this. It is past time for national leadership that helps us clearly establish our past in all of its complexity. Understanding, for instance, racial slavery's expansive reach -- North and South -- into the creation of American capitalism gives students, citizens and leaders a more holistic appreciation of the stubborn afterlife of structural racism . The stickiness of America's current racial divide is rooted in a history that we continue to distort, gloss over or ignore at our very nation's peril.\\n\\nSecond, 2021 must see a coordinated effort at the local, state and national levels to eradicate the thousands of racist policies that keep too many Black Americans at the bottom of the well of this society. Criminal justice reform is the tip of the iceberg on this score. Eliminating the cash bail system and disparate sentencing for crack versus powdered cocaine, releasing non-violent drug offenders and transforming a juvenile justice system that disproportionately harms Black children should be at the top of the policy agenda.\\n\\nAnd we mustn't stop there. The national racial healing that many long for cannot be purchased on the cheap. This commission must endorse and devise strategies to pursue policies for a living wage, housing reform, mental health and education programs and a universal basic income.\\n\\nThey must look to provide affordable health care for every American. While some major Democratic candidates for president in 2020 favored a Medicare for All plan , President-elect Joe Biden has vowed instead to add the public option to Obamacare -- reviving a measure that failed to pass in 2010. But we are long past the time for policy tinkering with the health of Americans. Of those who insist that Medicare For All is unaffordable we should ask another question: How can we afford not to? Medicare For All would increase jobs, employment and tax revenue through massive public investments that could increase worker productivity, economic mobility and ensure that families and children's health care would not be tied to a single job or eliminated amidst a pandemic.\\n\\nThis commission would work closely with governors and mayors at the state and local level to establish priorities, design implantation strategies, and innovate solutions that are based on the challenges, wants, and needs of grassroots communities across the nation.\\n\\nBut there's more.\\n\\nThe commission must explore targeted programs to repair the purposeful injury to Black Americans caused by racial slavery, Jim Crow bigotry, inequality in federal housing policies and the GI Bill and predatory lending during the Great Recession.\\n\\nThird, racial healing requires more than anti-racist hashtags from corporations, sports teams, philanthropists and public officials. Leaders in tech, philanthropy and higher education, along with elected officials, must pledge concrete action toward racial justice and equity, with measurable indicators of progress and accountability. The technology, finance capital and entrepreneurship sectors, in conjunction with local, state and federal government could invest in eco-systems that prioritize wealth creation, talent development and access to capital in Black communities on an unprecedented scale.\\n\\n2020 will exist in American and world history as a watershed: the shared trauma of a global pandemic unfolded alongside Black Lives Matter demonstrations and a political reckoning with racism's grip on American life. This year served as an inflection point that illuminates the challenges ahead for a new presidential administration in Washington and the collective hopes and will of the nation.\\n\\nJUST WATCHED Black doctor dies of Covid-19 after accusing hospital of racial bias Replay More Videos ...

The coronavirus has upended the very fabric of American life by amplifying the breadth and depth of inequality in our nation.\\n\\n2021 must be an opportunity to rectify our national failures. President-elect Joe Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris must do their part but so should ordinary citizens. Every city, town and hamlet in the nation should look inward at their histories of racial inequality, acts of truth-telling that can form the basis for local, state, and regional policy solutions that can pave the way toward healing and reconciliation across the nation.\\n\\nGet our free weekly newsletter Sign up for CNN Opinion's new newsletter.

(religions) as well here, she added.\\n\\nSeveral shops selling the customary red and gold new year decorations in Kuala Lumpur's Chinatown have kept those featuring dogs inside rather than on display out front.\\n\\nLast month, Reuters reported that Pavillion Mall, a shopping mall in the heart of Kuala Lumpur which gets about 3 million monthly visitors, also chose not to depict dogs in its decorations, citing religious and cultural sensitivities as a factor in their decision.\\n\\nEarlier this year, a hypermarket chain around the country was embroiled in controversy when it emerged that Lunar New Year t-shirts being sold there depicted 10 animals in the Chinese zodiac, but not the dog or the pig.\\n\\nIn Year of the Dog, Malaysian businesses play down dog decorations https://t.co/GoST5uZLGu\\n\\n\\n\\nMulticultural Malaysia has seen an increasing intolerance towards things considered insulting to Islam, & Muslim leaders have previously been vocal against dogs. pic.twitter.com/yHDfnOdKGl — Zurairi A.R.

There were outcries when Malaysia in 2016 ordered eateries and fast food chains such as Auntie Anne's and A&W to change the name of dishes such as 'Pretzel Dog' and 'Coney Dog' to 'Pretzel Sausage' and 'Beef Coney' or 'Chicken Coney'.\\n\\nThe reason? The country's Islamic department said 'dog' would confuse Muslims.\\n\\nMalaysia's 30-million population is estimated to be 60% Malay Muslim, with prominent Chinese, Indian and other minorities.\\n\\nThough Islam is Malaysia's official religion and the country has Sharia courts for civil cases for Muslims, it is constitutionally secular.\\n\\nSecularism disappearing\\n\\nMaria Chin Abdullah, a prominent pro-democracy activist, says what's happening with the Lunar New Year decorations are just small signs of growing Islamic conservatism.\\n\\nThe secularism in our system that we enjoyed seems to be disappearing.\\n\\nAs evidence, Chin pointed to the increasing frequency with which Malay women now wear the tudung, (headscarf), the Arabisation of Malay vocabulary -- for example the word Eid being used for the Islamic religious holiday instead of the Malay Hari Raya Puasa, and books being banned for espousing moderate forms of Islam.\\n\\nAs the Year of the Dog approaches, some shops run by ethnic Chinese in Malaysia are keeping canine models inside instead of displaying them prominently to avoid causing offence in the Muslim-majority country.\\n\\nSchools have become less multi-racial and things are becoming scary, said Chin.\\n\\nMy own son will come back from school and tell me we can't touch dogs and ask why I'm not wearing a headscarf.\\n\\nOther critics have pointed to the presence in Malaysia of hardline Indian Muslim televangelist Zakir Naik. He is banned in the UK and his views have sparked a criminal investigation in his native India.\\n\\nLast year, Prime Minister Najib Razak's government confirmed it had given Naik permanent residency , a decision to which activists have mounted a legal challenge.\\n\\nIndian protesters hold placards as they shout slogans during a protest denouncing Islamic scholar Zakir Naik in New Delhi on July 18, 2016.\\n\\nNajib's support for more Islamist policies has grown since his ruling coalition lost the popular vote in the 2013 general election - its worst ever electoral performance - as he seeks to strengthen his hold on the ethnic Malay Muslim vote.\\n\\nMalaysia's evolution has raised alarm bells at the UN, which has urged the country to protect its tradition of tolerance from the rise of fundamentalism.\\n\\nI have heard worrying reports of attempts at Islamization spreading in many areas of society which could lead to cultural engineering, said UN human rights expert Karima Bennoune last year following a 10-day fact-finding mission to the country.\\n\\n'Conservatism is becoming worse'\\n\\nThe government, which is widely expected to win elections due before August, drew criticism last year for allowing the opposition Pan Malaysian Islamic Party to put forward a parliamentary bill calling for harsher punishments -- including more flogging - for moral crimes.\\n\\nMalaysia's nine sultans, the official guardians of Islam in Malaysia, last year issued a call f or religious harmony after what they described as excessive actions.\\n\\nAhmad Farouk Musa, founder of a moderate think-tank, Islamic Renaissance Front, is yet another who says Islamic conservatism is worsening.\\n\\nOne of the reasons is that Malaysia sends thousands of students to Saudi Arabia, where they are indoctrinated with hardline intolerant forms of Islam like Salafism and Wahhabism.\\n\\nThey bring back intolerant ideas, for example, a hatred of Shias. That never existed in Malaysia before, he added.\\n\\nBut there's another fundamental problem that dates back to the birth of the country - its race-based political system.\\n\\nParties set up on ethnic lines originated under the country's former colonial rulers, the British, who imported Chinese and Indian labor to Malaysia, largely keeping Malays in impoverished rural areas.\\n\\nDecorative dog figurines are seen for sale ahead of the Lunar New Year celebrations in Kuala Lumpur's Chinatown on January 26, 2018.\\n\\nAfter Malaysia won independence in 1957, its new leaders granted privileges to Malays, including cheaper land, easier access to tertiary education and preference for civil service jobs, to try to help them reach economic parity with the Chinese community.\\n\\nThis policy was strengthened in 1969 after Malay animosity over increasing Chinese economic and political power boiled over into a race riot in Kuala Lumpur in which scores of people, mostly Chinese, were killed.\\n\\nReformists argue the system has made Malays dependent on handouts and has bred demagoguery that thrives on religious and ethnic tension."}

The deficit – or the difference between what the government spends and what it takes in over any one year – jumped to 3.8% of GDP in 2018, up from 3.5% in 2017.\\n\\nThat's particularly unusual in such a strong economy without major new expenditures. If no changes are made, the CBO projects that public debt will rise to 96% of GDP by 2028. A big chunk of that – $1.9 trillion between 2018 and 2028 – will be due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the CBO reported last April.\\n\\nAsked about the rising debt on Thursday morning, Council of Economic Advisers chairman Kevin Hassett said Trump is absolutely concerned about it, which is why he demanded a 5% budget cut from each Cabinet agency for the coming budget cycle.\\n\\nWe can disagree about a lot of things but we can agree maybe now is the time to get serious about the deficit, Hassett said.\\n\\nA congressionally-imposed cap on national debt kicks back in on March 2.

{"original": "(CNN) President Donald Trump's history of offering a wink and a nod, if not outright support, to his far-right base is well-documented.\\n\\nSince he descended from a Trump Tower escalator in New York in 2015 to begin his presidential campaign, Trump has made little effort to hide his affection for increased violence against his perceived enemies. When Trump condemned violent acts, he repeatedly couched the language in a both-sides, tit-for-tat style.\\n\\nAfter rioters stormed the Capitol building Wednesday -- as Congress began its formal recognition of President-elect Joe Biden's Electoral College victory -- Trump released a short video calling for the rioters to leave. His statement was peppered with sympathy, telling the rioters , We love you, you're very special.\\n\\nTrump mentioned in the video the false conspiracy theory that he actually won the 2020 election, saying, I know your pain, I know you're hurt. We had an election that was stolen from us. It was a landslide election and everyone knows it. Especially the other side. But you have to go home now. We have to have peace.\\n\\nOn social media posts, Trump said, These are the things and events that happen when a sacred landslide election victory is so unceremoniously & viciously stripped away.\\n\\nTwitter and Facebook later removed some of his statements and suspended his accounts for a period of time, citing policy violations.\\n\\nBefore his presidency\\n\\nTrump has often avoided full-blown condemnations after moments of violence.\\n\\nAfter a 2015 beating of a homeless man by two men making anti-immigrant statements saying, according to police, Donald Trump was right, Trump said he had not heard about the incident and added, it would be a shame. He quickly pivoted to highlighting those who adhere to his views.\\n\\nI will say, the people that are following me are very passionate, Trump said. They love this country, they want this country to be great again.\\n\\nTrump later tweeted that the incident was terrible and he would never condone violence.\\n\\nAt a 2016 rally after a protester was punched by a Trump supporter, Trump said days later that he thought it was very, very appropriate, and also that's what we need a little bit more of.\\n\\n'Very fine people'\\n\\nAfter a 2017 White nationalist protest in Charlottesville, Virginia, led to violence against counter-protesters and one woman killed, Trump initially blamed many sides for the attacks over the course of that Saturday. Remaining silent on Sunday, Trump on Monday condemned the White supremacists and neo-Nazis that took part in the rampage.\\n\\nIn a press conference that Tuesday, Trump changed course again and cast equal blame on neo-Nazi and alt-left groups, adding, You had a group on one side that was bad and you had a group on the other side that was also very violent. Nobody wants to say it, but I will say it right now.\\n\\nWhen asked about the neo-Nazis at the rally, Trump said, You had some very bad people in that group, but you also had people that were very fine people, on both sides, stating some on the far-right side were supporting the keeping of a Confederate statue.\\n\\nTrump supporters have consistently said this quote has been misinterpreted and skewed by political opponents, with any criticism of his remarks lacking the full context of the situation. However, the purpose of that weekend was clear from the onset for anyone who wished to attend: The event was organized by a White nationalist for others to rally behind their cause.\\n\\nIn 2019, defending those comments , Trump said, I have answered that question, and if you look at what I said, you will see that question was answered perfectly.\\n\\nFanning the flames in 2020\\n\\nProtests following the death of George Floyd in May led to demonstrations in Minneapolis.\\n\\nAfter buildings and stores were damaged, Trump took to Twitter to declare when the looting starts, the shooting starts.\\n\\nTwitter flagged the tweet as a glorification of violence based on the historical context of the line, which was used in the 1960s by a Miami police chief in the wake of riots.\\n\\nTrump later said he referred to shootings in general, not shootings by supporters or authorities.\\n\\nLooting leads to shooting, and that's why a man was shot and killed in Minneapolis on Wednesday night - or look at what just happened in Louisville with 7 people shot.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 29, 2020\\n\\nDuring the first 2020 presidential debate in September, Trump was asked by moderator Chris Wallace if he would condemn White supremacists and militia groups.\\n\\nI'm willing to do that, the President said, without condemning anyone. I'm willing to do anything. I want to see peace. Trump deflected and dodged a follow-up question, saying almost everything of the violence he's seen has been from Antifa and the left.\\n\\nWhat do you want to call them, the President said. Give me a name. Give me a name. Who would you like me to condemn?\\n\\nBiden then mentioned the Proud Boys, a far-right group known for its anti-Muslim and misogynistic rhetoric, which Trump seized on.\\n\\nProud Boys, stand back and stand by, he said. Somebody has to do something about Antifa and the left because this is not a right-wing problem, this is a left-wing.\\n\\nThe immediate reaction following his comments was bipartisan condemnation, fearing the stand back and stand by remark was a future call to arms. Members of the Proud Boys reveled in the moment.\\n\\nWhen asked for clarification the next day if he condemned White supremacists, Trump said , I've always denounced any form, any form of any of that, you have to denounce, before repeating his call for Biden to denounce Antifa groups.\\n\\nThe problem is on the left and Biden refuses to talk about it, he refuses to issue the words law and order, Trump said"}

The techniques used by governments to shut down the internet vary, from total blackouts to targeted throttling or blocking of specific applications.\\n\\nAfrica and Asia are the worst affected regions, with the longest recent shutdown happening in Cameroon when Anglophone regions of the country spent 230 days without internet access between January 2017 and March 2018.\\n\\nIn the past three months, partial or full internet and social media shutdowns have been reported in the DRC, Sudan, and Cameroon, according to civil society organization NetBlocks.\\n\\nThe effects of an internet shutdown go beyond simply cutting off people's access to information.\\n\\nA tool developed by NetBlocks and the Internet Society for measuring the financial costs of a shutdown estimates a day's outage in Congo alone can cause losses of more than $3 million.\\n\\nShutdowns are a blunt instrument for interrupting the spread of disinformation online, Washington-based Freedom House said in a report last year. By cutting off service during such incidents, governments often deny entire cities and provinces access to communication tools at a time when they may need them the most, whether to dispel rumors, check in with family members, or avoid dangerous areas.\\n\\n02:31 - Source: CNN China exports its model of internet sovereignty\\n\\nProtecting 'national security'\\n\\nThe methods behind an internet shutdown, particularly a complete one, are fairly simple. The government simply orders internet service providers (ISPs) to stop their connections – it's like turning off a home modem, but for the entire country.\\n\\nShutdowns can even happen accidentally, such as when one of the undersea fiber-optic cables which connect much of the world is damaged. This happened in 2008, cutting off a large swath of the Middle East from the global web.\\n\\nOne of the first major political shutdowns occurred in Xinjiang, a region in far-west China long used by Beijing as a testing ground for its censorship and surveillance policies.\\n\\nAfter protests and riots broke out in the regional capital Urumqi in July 2009, internet access to all of Xinjiang – along with international phone and text messaging services – was cut off for almost a year.\\n\\nThis was justified on the grounds of security, with the military newspaper China National Defense Daily warning the riots once again demonstrates that it is becoming urgent to strengthen internet control. This is to avoid the internet becoming a new poisoned arrow for hostile forces.\\n\\nSimilar justifications have been made by other countries following China's lead. According to Access Now, the top three reasons given for internet shutdowns are public safety, stopping the spreading of illegal content and national security.\\n\\nIn Uganda, President Yoweri Museveni defended a 2016 shutdown as a security measure to avert lies … intended to incite violence and illegal declaration of election results.\\n\\nLast year, Museveni's government passed a new tax on social media, under which users must pay 200 Ugandan shillings ($0.05) a day to use popular platforms like Twitter, Facebook and WhatsApp. Ugandan officials previously traveled to Beijing to learn from Chinese censors how to control social media, with government minister Evelyn Anite saying the country was helpless in the face of criminals using the web to commit crimes with impunity.\\n\\nChinese influence\\n\\nChina is heavily involved in Africa's internet, with state-backed firms like Huawei and ZTE building internet backbones and other infrastructure for countries across the continent. This assistance often goes hand-in-hand with filtering technologies and advice on how to control online dissent.\\n\\nIn its report last year, Freedom House warned a cohort of countries is moving toward digital authoritarianism by embracing the Chinese model of extensive censorship and automated surveillance systems.\\n\\nIt pointed to trainings run by Beijing for foreign officials on internet policy and controls. While it is not always clear what transpires during such seminars, a training for Vietnamese officials in April 2017 was followed in 2018 by the introduction of a cybersecurity law that closely mimics China's own law, the report said.\\n\\nIncreased activity by Chinese companies and officials in Africa similarly preceded the passage of restrictive cybercrime and media laws in Uganda and Tanzania over the past year.\\n\\nPatry, the Access Now expert, said that China has been pushing for a controlled internet in international debates. The most recent example of this was at the annual World Internet Conference in Wuzhen, southern China.\\n\\nLong a roadshow for China's internet control policies, attendees at the latest conference – including hundreds of government officials from African, Asian and Middle Eastern countries – agreed to work towards new global rules and norms for cyberspace while respecting nations' sovereignty in cyberspace.\\n\\nAs citizens of the DRC are discovering, however, with more and more leaders hostile towards internet freedom and keen to follow China's model, new global rules crafted by Beijing are likely to benefit censors – not users."}

The virus outbreak coincided with the Lunar New Year -- the most important holiday in the Chinese calendar, when many students go home to see their family.\\n\\nA city on lockdown\\n\\nAt first, it was just a normal holiday period for Xu, catching up with friends in Wuhan and eating food. The coronavirus outbreak didn't seem like a huge issue.\\n\\nTimeline\\n\\nHow events unfolded December 8: The first patient of Wuhan coronavirus developed symptoms December 31: The first cases reported to the World Health Organization January 1: The market in Wuhan where the outbreak is believed to have started shuts down for disinfection January 8: Chinese scientists identify the pathogen as a new strain of coronavirus January 23: Authorities put Wuhan into partial lockdown January 31: US announces it will deny entry to foreign nationals who have traveled in China in the last 14 days February 1: Australia bans all travellers entering from mainland China\\n\\n\\n\\nSource: CNN reporting\\n\\n\\n\\nXu wore a mask and avoided the area around the seafood market linked to the outbreak, which is only a few kilometers from his house.\\n\\nThen on January 23, the night before he was set to fly back to New York, Wuhan authorities announced they were locking down the city . There was still time to leave, but Xu decided not to go -- he thought he would be safer inside Wuhan, and that the lockdown wouldn't last long.\\n\\nOn January 27, his graduate program in interactive telecommunications at New York University (NYU) restarted. On January 31, the US government announced it wouldn't let any foreign nationals flying from mainland China into the country.\\n\\nXu was told he could take classes remotely, but to him it wasn't worth paying $62,000 per year in course fees for distance learning. He decided to take a break this semester. That will delay his graduation by six months.\\n\\nThe situation in Australia\\n\\nThe University of Sydney , where Alex studies, is making allowances for Chinese students.\\n\\nThose affected by coronavirus travel bans can study remotely, start their semester a few weeks late, or defer their degree. Alex will defer this semester if she hasn't been able to fly back by mid-March.\\n\\nShe pays about $45,000 Australian dollars ($30,280) each year -- more than local students, who are eligible for reduced fees.\\n\\nhas When Australia imposed its travel ban on February 1, it was effective immediately. While the WHOhas advised against such measures , Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said: Our medical advice is it's in the interest of Australians to do so.\\n\\nAt the time, there were 80 Chinese people in transit -- including 47 students.\\n\\nAustralian Border Force commissioner Michael Outram told the ABC that 18 decided to go back to China, while the others were put into self-isolation for 14 days. This was a very difficult situation for the students, of course, we recognize that, Outram said. They were caught between, you know, an epidemic in China and coming to Australia and having issues raised with their visas.\\n\\nA man walks on an empty street in Wuhan, China, on February 13, 2020.\\n\\nDavid, a 24-year-old studying engineering at the University of Sydney, who has been in self-imposed quarantine at his home in southern Guangdong province for weeks, said the Australian government's actions made him feel completely neglected.\\n\\nI'm a taxpayer, I do my part in society, I've donated blood, said David, who asked not to use his real name for fear that his comments could hurt his chance of getting an Australian visa. After all the things I've done, you still consider me not part of your society.\\n\\nThe logistical problems created by the virus are not short-term issues.\\n\\nUniversities will need to work out how to accommodate the backlog of students like Xu and Alex who have been delayed, as well as students who would have taken those courses anyway -- and some universities just won't have capacity, Norton said.\\n\\nProtesters hold placards during a rally against an inbound travel ban on foreign travellers from China in Sydney on February 7, 2020.\\n\\nWhat this means for the universities\\n\\nIf thousands of students are forced to forgo this semester, universities in Australia and the United States stand to lose billions of dollars.\\n\\nIn Australia, 23.3% of universities' total revenue came from international students in 2017 -- and Chinese students made up over 38% of all international enrollments in 2018. In total, international education contributed 37.6 billion Australian dollars ($25 billion) to the Australian economy in the 2018-2019 financial year.\\n\\nIn the US, Chinese students contributed $14.9 billion to the US economy in 2018, according to government data.\\n\\nNorton, the professor of higher education policy at the Australian National University, believes that most Chinese students in Australia will need to delay their study by at least a trimester or semester. That means that, in the short term, universities in Australia face an estimated 2 to 3 billion Australian dollar cash flow hit from students who can't make it to class, he said.\\n\\nThe government realizes this will have huge economic costs that effect them as well as the universities and tourism providers, he said.\\n\\nIn the US, there had already been weakening demand from Chinese students partly due to tensions on American campuses amid the ongoing trade war , said Rahul Choudaha, a US-based analyst of international student trends and a visiting scholar at the Center for Studies in Higher Education at UC Berkeley.\\n\\nIt's kind of a very unexpected, unwanted, undesirable speed bump, he said.\\n\\nIt's also an issue facing universities outside of the United States and Australia. South Korea, for instance, has around 70,000 Chinese students at its universities. The new semester kicks off in March, but already many universities have opted to delay the start of semester by two weeks, to accommodate students living in cities on lockdown.\\n\\nA man wears a protective mask as he walks in Wuhan on February 13, 2020.\\n\\nAnger at Chinese people\\n\\nThe coronavirus crisis struck at a time when hostile debates over Chinese Communist Party influence on Australian and US campuses were already complicating life for Chinese students overseas.\\n\\nChinese students have been accused of stealing American secrets to diminish US influence, especially as the trade war between China and American rages. In Australia, politicians have raised concern over whether the Chinese influence on campus is limiting free speech\\n\\nFor Chinese people in Australia and the US, that public debate has sometimes been alienating\\n\\nNow, the coronavirus outbreak has prompted more anti-Chinese sentiment\\n\\nWhile stuck at home, Alex has been taken by the different reactions to the outbreak on China's heavily controlled internet and the internet beyond the so-called Great Firewall. In China, there are messages of support for Wuhan, but internationally she's seen anger directed at Chinese people.\\n\\nIt's waves and waves of hate, she said, pointing to online commentators who argued that Chinese people deserved the outbreak because they eat bat -- something that has not been linked to the outbreak. I felt misunderstood, I felt abandoned. I felt I don't matter.\\n\\nAlex says that on her social media feeds the situation has been turned into a Chinese versus Australian dichotomy, when really, it's about the virus versus people.\\n\\nShe's afraid that when she gets back to Australia, she could be the target of racial abuse. People who look Chinese are paying the price just because other people are scared, she said.\\n\\nEconomic hit\\n\\nAlready, experts are predicting that the economic hit of the coronavirus could be much more significant than the SARS epidemic in 2003.\\n\\nIf China's economy is struggling, Chinese parents may have less money to spend on educating their children overseas.\\n\\nDavid believes that the perceived animosity toward Chinese students in Australia may result in students opting to go elsewhere. When parents are looking at which country to send their children, they don't just look at the quality of education -- but also at how welcoming and stable a society is, he says.\\n\\nAs the quality of China's own universities continues to improve, staying at home could also become a more attractive proposition, said Choudah, the higher education analyst.\\n\\nA few days ago, a fellow Chinese national asked Alex whether she would recommend studying law in Australia. Alex answered honestly: she's torn.\\n\\nStudying abroad can be a positive experience, she said, but it also carries the risk of racial abuse, especially now that people of Asian origin are viewed with suspicion as the virus spreads."}
{"original": "Under the new federal tax law, the number of tax filers hit by the Alternative Minimum Tax will drop by 96%.\\n\\nOnly about 200,000 tax filers are expected to owe the AMT in 2018, dramatically fewer than the 5.25 million who likely would have under the old tax law, according to estimates from the Tax Policy Center.\\n\\nThe AMT is a parallel tax system that requires many filers to calculate their tax bill twice -- once under the rules of the regular income tax code and once under the rules of the AMT. Filers must pay whichever is higher.\\n\\nThe original intent of the AMT was to ensure that the wealthy few back in 1969 didn't take so many tax breaks that they ended up owing no federal income tax.\\n\\nBut today, those who've typically gotten snagged by the AMT include two-earner married couples with kids in high-tax states, and more generally, households making between $200,000 and $1 million.\\n\\nSo why the huge drop in those affected?\\n\\nThe new tax law made three big changes that drastically reduce who ends up owing the AMT. But the changes expire after 2025, at which point the Tax Policy Center estimates 6 million filers will be subject to it once again.\\n\\n1. Higher exemption levels\\n\\nThe amount of income automatically exempt from the AMT calculation has been increased to $109,400 for joint filers, up from $84,500; and to $70,300 for individual filers, up from $54,300.\\n\\nRelated: New estate tax law gives an enormous gift to rich families\\n\\nNormally the very highest income households don't get to take advantage of the exemption levels, at least not in full. But the new law greatly expands how many of them can.\\n\\n2. Higher exemption phaseout levels\\n\\nThe tax overhaul increases the exemption phaseout level -- which is the income level above which you gradually lose your income exemption, until it disappears completely. The phaseout levels were raised to $1 million for joint filers, up from $160,900; and to $500,000 for individuals, up from $120,700.\\n\\nSo a lot of households making between $200,000 and $1 million will now get to take full advantage of the exemption levels, whereas before they could not.\\n\\n3. Fewer tax breaks under the regular tax code\\n\\nThe AMT is usually triggered for filers when they claim a lot of exemptions, credits and deductions that are aren't allowed under AMT rules.\\n\\nBut the new tax law eliminates a lot of those breaks, such as personal exemptions, and it has limited the value of others, such as the state and local tax deduction, said Joe Rosenberg, a senior research associate at The Tax Policy Center.\\n\\nThe estimated 200,000 filers who will remain in the AMT's crosshairs are likely to be very high-income households that claim large, less-than-typical tax breaks such as tax-exempt interest on private activity bonds, Rosenberg said.\\n\\nEven though most filers who have been subject to the AMT in the past will not be subject to it again over the next eight years, the mere fact that it remains on the books means millions of filers will still need to calculate their tax liability twice.\\n\\nSo much for the oft-promised simplification that the new tax law would provide."}

Just 4.5 million people have received their first dose, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Monday.

The Chinese government has criticized the United States for wantonly suppressing foreign companies listed in the country and previously said it would take necessary measures to safeguard the interests of Chinese firms.\\n\\nThe reasons behind the NYSE's reversal were not immediately clear — though investors are certainly getting whiplash.\\n\\nInvestor insight: Shares of all three affected firms, which also trade in Hong Kong, dropped Monday before rallying Tuesday. China Unicom advanced 8.5%, while China Mobile jumped 5% and China Telecom rose more than 3%.\\n\\nThe company that tried to fix US health care is shutting down\\n\\nThere was palpable excitement when Amazon's Jeff Bezos, JPMorgan Chase's Jamie Dimon and Berkshire Hathaway's Warren Buffett announced that they were forming a company to reimagine health care.\\n\\nBut three years later, the partnership — known as Haven — is shutting down, my CNN Business colleague Paul R.

Bluntly, Brexit has shone a light on the fact that the foundations holding up the UK had been crumbling for some time.\\n\\nThe current deadlock in Westminster – and what it might mean for the union between England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland – is spooking politicians from all over the political divide.\\n\\nJacob Rees-Mogg, a longstanding Conservative Euroskeptic, told me earlier this week: The two greatest risks to the union are splitting Northern Ireland from Great Britain, as the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement with the EU proposes, and a second referendum, which would legitimize the calls for a second independence vote in Scotland.\\n\\nThe movement in the UK's politics and resulting divisions is nicely illustrated by the last eight years of its voting history.\\n\\nThe two greatest risks to the union are splitting Northern Ireland from Great Britain, as the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement with the EU proposes, and a second referendum, which would legitimize the calls for a second independence vote in Scotland. Jacob Rees-Mogg\\n\\nLet's take the 2010 general election as a starting point, in which voters opted for a coalition between David Cameron's Conservative Party and Nick Clegg's Liberal Democrats. These two centrists looked like a safe pair of hands at a time of turmoil in the immediate aftermath of the 2008 global financial crisis.\\n\\nOver the five years of the coalition, austerity measures were introduced that made most politics junkies certain that Labour would win back power under its then leader, Ed Miliband.\\n\\nBut a shock result in 2015 saw Cameron win a majority in Parliament. Scotland voted for the pro-independence Scottish Nationalist Party in huge numbers. After the failed Scottish independence referendum a year earlier, the general election result was a clear sign of just how wide the gap between England and Scotland had become.\\n\\nFast forward past the Brexit referendum and Cameron's own exit to Theresa May's 2017 snap election for more clues. Many voters in pro-Brexit areas of England snubbed her in favor of Labour's Jeremy Corbyn – who at the time had an unclear position on Brexit, though much of his party is pro-Europe. She lost her majority, but strangely picked up votes in Remain-supporting Scotland, despite her party backing the very definition of a so-called hard Brexit.\\n\\nPHOTO: TOLGA AKMEN/AFP/Getty Images Britain's Prime Minister Theresa May leaves from 10 Downing Street on December 17, 2018.\\n\\nClearly, the British public is divided – and that division is especially acute in the politics of the four nations.\\n\\nIn England, the UK's wealthiest and most populous city, London, stands in contrast to the rest of the country.\\n\\nIt is from London that the campaign for a second vote that could ultimately stop Brexit is being driven. But it was English votes that carried the victory for Leave. This creates tension not just in England, but in the union at large – the politics of the English are the most influential in the union and can often dictate policy that affects everyone.\\n\\nIn the case of Brexit, that means Scottish remainers feeling as though the English are dragging them out of the EU against their will. Alarmingly for unionists, recent polling showed that English Conservative voters (officially called the Conservative and Unionist Party) would be happy with the union breaking up in exchange for a good Brexit.\\n\\nThe division is more obvious in Scotland. The SNP would clearly like to push for a second independence referendum and rejoin the EU as an independent nation. Meanwhile, Scottish Conservatives would clearly prefer a softer form of Brexit to protect Scotland's economy while keeping the union together – something about which they disagree with their English counterparts.\\n\\nIn Northern Ireland, the devolved National Assembly has not sat in nearly two years after the power-sharing agreement that allows both unionists and republicans to be involved in government collapsed.\\n\\nDespite this, the Democratic Unionist Party holds the balance of power in Westminster and is currently one of the biggest obstacles to May getting her Brexit deal through Parliament.\\n\\nThey believe the deal ignores their most important demand: no friction between Northern Ireland and Great Britain. We do not want a hard border, we believe there are many ways of resolving it, the DUP's Emma Little-Pengelly said to me of the Irish border issue. Instead, she believes that May and the EU's solution aims to ensure no checks at all on the Irish border between two sovereign states by creating 68 new checks between Great Britain and Northern Ireland.\\n\\nIt must be worrying for the DUP that both those wanting May's deal to pass and hardline Brexit voters are so happy to see their red lines rubbed out for the sake of getting the job done.\\n\\nPHOTO: PAUL FAITH/AFP/AFP/Getty Images Traffic crosses the border into Northern Ireland from the Irish Republic.\\n\\nOne thing seems to have been forgotten by politicians in all this: some people in Brussels speak English. The UK's chaos has been watched with astonishment by EU officials.\\n\\nIt's still not clear what the UK wants, Guy Verhofstadt, Brexit coordinator for the EU Parliament, told CNN. I hope the deal agreed finds a majority. If not, then MPs have to work together to find a compromise solution on a future relationship. Whatever the choice, we need a withdrawal agreement to be agreed to avoid a disastrous no-deal outcome.\\n\\nLoathe as many in Westminster will be to take advice from a former Prime Minister of Belgium, he makes a solid point. Wild politics is not a good enough reason for a nation as important as the UK to fall into a black hole of its own creation.\\n\\nIt's still not clear what the UK wants. Guy Verhofstadt\\n\\nThe good news is that as things stand, both main parties believe the union should be preserved. It shouldn't be beyond the wit of our elected officials to forge some cross-party unity on a matter they claim to care so much about.\\n\\nAs Brexit reaches its apex, perhaps the minds of the political elite will sharpen and we will all start to see a way out of this hellscape. They need to make the public care about the union, or frankly, it's only going to crumble further.\\n\\nIf that doesn't happen, then the UK as we know it will have to continue to exist on life support.\\n\\nAnd if we don't take this moment to fix the union between the four nations, then distressingly few will be in mourning, should the switch get flipped."}

Authorities said Tuesday, Oct. 31, 2017, that three Dartmouth psychology professors are under criminal investigation for allegations of sexual misconduct. The previous week the college said the professors were put on paid leave and had their access to campus restricted due to allegations of serious misconduct. The college later told authorities it had received allegations of sexual misconduct. (AP Photo/Jim Cole, File)\\n\\n(CNN) —\\n\\nDartmouth College says it is launching a new initiative to combat sexual harassment and abuses of power on campus. But a lawyer for seven women who are suing the university over its handling of sexual harassment allegations say the efforts miss the mark.\\n\\nThe announcement comes nearly two months after a federal complaint was filed against the Ivy League school by seven current and former graduate students who allege three professors created a toxic environment where female subjects were routinely subjected to sexual harassment and even rape.\\n\\nA school inquiry led to the resignations of the three professors in 2018 and the school pledged to take steps to improve the campus culture. The new Campus Climate and Culture Initiative is the latest step in that direction, school officials said in a press release.\\n\\nThe new program will include the following components:\\n\\n- A single policy to address sexual misconduct for faculty, staff, and students, with appropriate processes for adjudicating potential violations;\\n\\n- A mandatory online sexual violence prevention training program for all faculty, staff, professional and graduate students, and postdoctoral scholars;\\n\\n- Research advisory committees for all graduate programs to ensure that all graduate students have access to multiple advisors.\\n\\nThe announcement comes as American universities grapple with how to handle allegations of campus sexual misconduct and their obligations under Title IX, the federal law that bars discrimination based on sex, including harassment, in federally funded education programs and activities.\\n\\nThe Department of Education in November proposed new rules for dealing with sexual harassment and assault on college campuses that would bolster the rights of those accused of wrongdoing.\\n\\nThe lawsuit accuses the New Hampshire school of failing to create an environment free from gender-based discrimination, in violation of Title IX.\\n\\nDartmouth says the new program will expand the school's Title IX office, which is responsible for reviewing reports of sexual misconduct and conducting investigations. The school also pledged to increase mental health resources at Dartmouth and said that an outside expert who specializes in creating inclusive communities will review academic departments.\\n\\nThe lawsuit claims that the prominent researchers, who no longer are allowed on campus, coerced female students into drinking and made the women feel as if their success depended on their willingness to participate in their alcohol-saturated culture the men created.\\n\\nThe complaint claims that Dartmouth knew about the professors' behavior for more than 16 years and did nothing until 2017, when several female graduate students reported the allegations to the college's Title IX office. During the Title IX investigation, the lawsuit claims that Dartmouth failed to provide the plaintiffs with support, accommodations or guidance, then unilaterally terminated the disciplinary process without seeking their input.\\n\\nPreviously, school officials said they applauded the courage of the women who came forward. However, we respectfully, but strongly, disagree with the characterizations of Dartmouth's actions in the complaint and will respond through our own court filings, they said.\\n\\nDeborah Marcuse, an attorney representing seven women plaintiffs in the sexual harassment lawsuit, said the initiatives miss the mark and simply bring the school into compliance with federal law.\\n\\nTo the extent that Dartmouth is now seeking to conform its policies to what federal law requires, we certainly support that though we think it's long overdue, Marcuse said. What's striking about this is that Dartmouth continues to fail to acknowledge or accept responsibility for the damage that its long history of inaction has caused.\\n\\nMarcuse faulted the school for not reaching out to her clients for their input. Dartmouth's formal response to their complaint is due in a little over a week on January 15.\\n\\nIt appears to us that for all of the lip service to their courage, there has been no interest from Dartmouth in materially responding to or really listening to these women despite a lot of vague call outs to 'we want to include everyone and everything', she said.\\n\\nIf you just look at the nature of the various responses there really just isn't any acknowledgment that what these women experienced is something that has had any impact on Dartmouth at all."}
{"original": "(CNN) Trump administration officials admit Operation Warp Speed fell well short of its target to get coronavirus shots to 20 million Americans in 2020, but there's no sign of an aggressive federal push to address the problem.\\n\\nOfficials tell CNN they are sticking with their policy to leave it up to states to carry out vaccination campaigns. They are encouraging states to open up vaccines to a wider population -- beyond frontline health care workers and long-term care residents -- and urging them to more swiftly move vaccines to pharmacy settings in the hopes of speeding up vaccination rates.\\n\\nStates, meanwhile, say the federal government has been slow to realize the problem and should have given states more money earlier to develop specific plans. The presidential transition has made things more complicated as well, some officials said.\\n\\nMore than 17 million vaccine doses have been distributed to states but just 4.8 million Americans have received their first dose of the vaccine, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\\n\\nWe'll work with the states, said Moncef Slaoui, the head of Operation Warp Speed on Monday. But, we need specific requests for help.\\n\\nAdministration officials believe that the vaccine rollout coinciding with the holidays has contributed to delays in both vaccine administration and reporting, and officials insist they expect vaccination rates to jump in the coming days and weeks.\\n\\nI think we should wait until the first and second week in January to see if we can catch up with the pace, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said at a Newsday event Tuesday.\\n\\nIn the meantime, administration officials are also urging states to widen the groups that are eligible for vaccinations and ramp up shots at local pharmacies.\\n\\nYour headline today really should be: 'Surgeon General tells states and governors to move quickly to other priority groups,' Surgeon General Dr. Jerome Adams told NBC News Tuesday.\\n\\nJUST WATCHED Surgeon General defends Trump vaccine rollout Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Surgeon General defends Trump vaccine rollout 04:34\\n\\nAdams said states felt beholden to guidelines from a CDC advisory committee recommending that states vaccinate all health care workers and long-term care residents before moving on to other populations. If, for example, health care workers don't want the vaccine, he said states should move on to the next group.\\n\\nGet those vaccines where they're going to be taken up, Adams said. We don't need to re-create the wheel, we just need to get it rolling.\\n\\nBut even within the administration, officials are struggling to get a clear picture of which states have actually been slow to vaccinate residents and which have simply been slow to report their numbers. That has made it more challenging for the federal officials to determine if they should be offering targeted assistance to certain areas.\\n\\nWe are looking at what's working currently, and we will be helping states course correct, a senior administration official said.\\n\\nThe official noted that lines of Americans waiting to get vaccinated is preferable to doses languishing on shelves or being tossed. We'd rather see demand meeting supply than worrying whether doses are sitting on a hospital shelf, the official said.\\n\\nOne state official said it appears to finally be dawning on federal officials that states needed additional resources to ramp up hiring in public health departments, organize vaccine sites and upgrade tech systems to track who is getting vaccinated. The Covid relief package Congress passed in December included $8 billion for vaccine distribution, funds state official said would have been even more useful six months ago.\\n\\nIt's frustrating that they spent so long not appreciating and not understanding the deep, very real resource needs that states had, the official said.\\n\\nStill, there's no indication the federal government plans to take on a bigger role, aside from some discussion about whether the National Guard should be more involved, said Dr. Marcus Plescia, chief medical officer for the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials.\\n\\nThere was a lot of effort put into developing the vaccine. There hasn't really been the same amount of effort of putting things into place to be able to administer it, Plescia said.\\n\\nThe senior administration official noted that states are welcome to request additional support from both the National Guard and the Federal Emergency Management Agency.\\n\\nTrump's checked out and the transition is hampering efforts\\n\\nThe slow vaccine effort coinciding with the presidential transition has made the situation more precarious, leaving state and local officials straddling conversations with the Trump administration and the incoming Biden administration.\\n\\nTrump has largely checked out on the vaccination effort, distracted by his attempts to cling to the presidency that he has lost. While Vice President Mike Pence is slightly more dialed in -- and is still convening coronavirus task force meetings -- he, too, is primarily focused on the political fight, said a source familiar with the situation.\\n\\nJUST WATCHED Biden says Trump administration far behind on vaccinations Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Biden says Trump administration far behind on vaccinations 02:16\\n\\nIn a late December tweet, the President blamed states for the slow vaccine rollout, saying, The Federal Government has distributed the vaccines to the states. Now it is up to the states to administer. Get moving!\\n\\nAs for President-elect Joe Biden, he has already set an aggressive goal of 100 million shots in arms in his first 100 days in office.\\n\\nBut Biden has offered only limited details on how he plans to hit that target that would vaccinate 50 million people. He has said he will more aggressively use the Defense Production Act to churn out more vaccine supplies and personal protective equipment. And he has also suggested the federal government will take a more prominent role in organizing vaccination sites and mobile vaccination units for hard-to-reach communities.\\n\\nIn an Atlanta radio interview with the Kenny Burns Show Tuesday, Biden said he would establish thousands of federally run and federal supported community vaccination centers of various sizes across the country, located in high school gyms or NFL football stadiums, with the help of FEMA, the CDC, the US military and the National Guard.\\n\\nThis is going to be a coordinated, hand-in-hand effort, all the way through to make sure we're getting those vaccines into the arms of people in every pocket, in the rural communities, in the hard-to-reach areas, in the Latinx and Black populations and tribal nations, Rick Bright, a member of Biden's coronavirus advisory board, told CNN Monday.\\n\\nWhile the Biden team has been reaching out to governors and health officials across the country, people involved in the calls described them primarily as listening sessions that shed little light on how Biden plans to turnaround the thorny problem of slow vaccination rates.\\n\\nIt starts with them absolutely understanding what's going on in reality and what has to be adjusted, said Lori Tremmel Freeman, chief executive officer at the National Association of County and City Health Officials, who has been talking to members of Biden's team in recent weeks. But it's a weird place to be at this moment in time and between administrations when you're dealing with the biggest health threat of our lives. You cannot put anything on hold.

Carey Institute for Government Reform at Wagner College in New York. He blogs at The Recall Elections Blog. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely his.\\n\\n(CNN) —\\n\\nThe early days of the Trump administration have already seen reports of internal skirmishes among his team of advisers. Cabinet members have been left in the dark on major policy changes, and the early stories suggest that his former campaign CEO, Steve Bannon, has established a dominant position, with the inaugural address and many other actions aligning with Bannon's previous statements.\\n\\nJoshua Spivak\\n\\nWhile Bannon's success in the campaign has earned him a key role in the White House, Trump is well-known for quickly switching advisers, looking for the hot hand – he went through three campaign managers last year. With that in mind, it may be that anyone who has Trump's ear may only keep it for a short time before they are ignored or cast aside.\\n\\nTherefore, it pays to consider a key fact about his team when looking at which adviser may have the longest and impact: Save one, he can fire every of them, at any time. And that one unfireable official is Vice President Mike Pence.\\n\\nThe power of a VP is not just in his or her permanent role. A split with the VP would be politically embarrassing for any president, as it would show a significant divide in the party and the leadership. For Donald Trump, who has not established himself as a party unifier, it would especially be damaging. Pence is a well-liked former member of the House Republican leadership team, as well as a former governor. Any separation between Trump and Pence could reverberate against Trump in Congress.\\n\\nVice presidents also have an independent role, even if it is frequently maligned – they preside over the Senate, which may seem to be a formality, but in the right hands it could be more than that. The VP also breaks tie votes in the Senate, and with the chamber closely divided, Pence is likely to have to use that power.\\n\\nHis decisive vote in favor of Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, the first time that a VP has ever provided the key vote for a cabinet nominee, will likely be repeated on critical legislation down the line.\\n\\nMost reports on Trump's team have focused on the core team credited with getting him to the White House, like Bannon, Kellyanne Conway and Reince Preibus. All three, and hundreds of others, can be fired at a moment's notice. Even if they stay in his good graces, past precedent suggests that most of these advisers will burn out and leave the White House within two years.\\n\\nTrump's Cabinet picks get a lot of press, but not only can they be fired at will, as we've repeatedly seen from other presidents and seen in the early goings of the Trump term, they are likely to be ignored while in office. Presidents have long treated cabinet members as gloried administrators rather than critical members of the policy team. To think that a cabinet member will have great influence on a president's overarching strategy is to ignore recent history.\\n\\nFamily is of course a different story, and Trump is portrayed as a big family man. Early reports cited his son-in-law Jared Kushner as having a special place in terms of advisers. But children and spouse (and especially children-in-law) can easily fall from grace and be ignored, divorced or disowned.\\n\\nAll of these people show how unique the vice president is. The president cannot remove the vice president. Barring death, resignation or impeachment, Trump must live with Pence. Throughout much of US history, the VP was seen as a nearly worthless position – his superfluous excellence, in the words of John Adams – serving as a political death sentence, unless the president happened to die.\\n\\nBut those days are long over. Seven of the last 12 vice presidents have gone on to win their party's nomination for the presidency – Pence almost certainly wants to be on that list himself. The vice president is now considered a major figure, and the last three, Al Gore, Dick Cheney and Joe Biden, were each viewed as among the most important people in the White House.\\n\\nFor Trump, there is a warning from the past about the price of failing to stay on good terms with his VP. The last New York native to be elected president also liked having a team of diverse advisers who jostled for their place. That was Franklin Roosevelt.\\n\\nRoosevelt's first vice president was John Nance Garner, who famously said the VP was not worth a bucket of warm spit – well, he actually said something a bit more salty. Garner, a former speaker of the House, retained influence on Congress. And in 1937, Garner split with FDR over the second New Deal and the Supreme Court packing plans. The result was no end of trouble for Roosevelt: the death of one of his big initiative, and a big electoral setback in 1938 and a significant opponent in his quest for a third term.\\n\\nGet our free weekly newsletter Sign up for CNN Opinion's new newsletter.\\n\\nJoin us on Twitter and Facebook\\n\\nAs he adjusts to the presidency, Trump is likely to continue his pattern of working with and discarding advisers. But throughout his term, it pays to watch the one adviser who he can't get rid of, the one who has the most to gain from Trump's success and the one who can cause the most damage with a split.\\n\\nMike Pence is not just the vice president – he is likely to be the most important person outside of the President in the Trump White House."}
{"original": "(CNN) The Trump administration will implement a new policy Friday to make it more difficult for foreign nationals to travel to give birth on US soil to ensure their children become American citizens, a practice commonly known as birth tourism.\\n\\nThe new rules will be effective January 24, according to a State Department cable obtained by CNN, which was sent on Wednesday to embassies around the world.\\n\\nThe White House announced Thursday that the State Department will no longer issue temporary visitor (B-1/B-2) visas to aliens seeking to enter the United States for 'birth tourism.'\\n\\nVisitors to the US will be denied temporary visas if it's found that the primary purpose of travel is for obtaining US citizenship for a child by giving birth in the United States, according to an amended State Department regulation to be published Friday. The rule does not apply to the 39 countries -- most of which are in Europe -- that are part of the Visa Waiver Program, a State Department official confirmed in a briefing call with reporters Thursday.\\n\\nFiguring out which travelers are coming to the US to give birth\\n\\nDuring that call, the official struggled to explain the specific ways that the new rule would be enforced and its actual effectiveness.\\n\\nAccording to the official on the call and the diplomatic cable, consular officers were told they can't directly ask a woman if they are pregnant.\\n\\nYou must not ask a visa applicant whether they are pregnant unless you have a specific articulable reason to believe they may be pregnant and planning to give birth in the United States. You should document any such reason in your case notes, reads the cable. You must not, as a matter of course, ask all female applicants (or any specific sub-sets of applicants) whether they are pregnant or intend to become pregnant.\\n\\nThe State Department official said that the specific articulable reason for bringing the topic up could be if the applicant says they will be traveling for a medical procedure -- which is one of the options already on the application.\\n\\nThat would be the trigger for much of this questioning of applicants, they said.\\n\\nThe official did not deny that the officers could use visual cues as part of that reasoning and would not directly say, despite repeated questions, if a consular official could ask a woman if she was pregnant if she looked pregnant. They said officers are not allowed to require a pregnancy test.\\n\\nAlthough the White House statement said the rule change was necessary to enhance public safety, national security, and the integrity of our immigration system, the official could not describe a specific example of a past national security threat that arose as a result of birth tourism. Instead, they emphasized that the change was closing a loophole that creates a vulnerability.\\n\\nCNN reported earlier this week that this policy was expected to be announced soon. A State Department official told CNN that the rule change is intended to address the national security and law enforcement risks.\\n\\nAccording to the rule, the State Department does not believe that visiting the US for the primary purpose of obtaining U.S. citizenship for a child is a legitimate activity.\\n\\nThe rule is specific to B nonimmigrant visas, which are obtained for temporary visitors for business or tourism.\\n\\nAdditionally, the regulation requires that visa applicants who seek medical treatment in the US must demonstrate their arrangements for treatment and establish their ability to pay all associated costs.\\n\\nThis is the first recognition that it's not OK to use a visitor visa for the purposes of 'birth tourism,' so it has a symbolic strength in that respect, at the same time it's not a very effective way at going after the 'birth tourism' industry, said Sarah Pierce, a policy analyst at the Migration Policy Institute.\\n\\nA 'very awkward position'\\n\\nThe regulation presents multiple challenges, according to Pierce. It puts consular officers in a very awkward position of having to decide whether or not they believe someone is imminently going to give birth, she said.\\n\\nPierce also pointed out that most people don't admit that they are intending to use a visa for the purposes of gaining citizenship for a child, she said.\\n\\nIn addition, these types of visas are granted for up to 10 years, so someone could apply to come to the US long before becoming or intending to become pregnant, said Pierce.\\n\\nA much more effective way to go after this would be to go after the industry itself, she said.\\n\\nWhile the US government does not specifically track 'birth tourism,' the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention publishes annually the number of births in the US to foreign women who reside overseas.\\n\\nThere have been around 10,000 such births every year for the past few years, according to CDC data.\\n\\nThe State Department estimates thousands of children are born in the US to these types of business and tourist visa holders annually, however the department acknowledged it is challenging to come up with precise estimates. The State Department official did not have an estimate on how much so-called birth tourism cost US taxpayers.\\n\\nThe US has also sought legal action against people thought to be capitalizing on the 'birth tourism' industry.\\n\\nLast year, the Department of Justice charged three people with running birth tourism companies that catered to Chinese clients in Southern California -- the first time that criminal charges had been filed in a US federal court over the practice.\\n\\nThe charges stemmed from a 2015 raid of dozens of maternity hotels, often upscale apartments, where mothers-to-be paid between $15,000 and $50,000 to give birth in the US, according to a US Immigration and Customs Enforcement statement at the time.\\n\\nOn Thursday, acting ICE Director Matt Albence said his agency would continue to prosecute and investigate birth tourism cases, as they've previously done, but didn't comment on any future plans.\\n\\nThe investigations that we conduct now are the same ones we conducted under the Obama administration, Bush administration, I was hired under the Clinton administration. The laws generally haven't changed with what we do, he said, reiterating that State Department handles issuing visas.\\n\\nIf we have information on groups or intel with regard to people that might be coming, trying to exploit those regulations, we certainly share that information and work closely, he said.\\n\\nThe White House said Thursday the new rule will close a glaring immigration loophole and protect the US from the national security risks created by this practice.\\n\\nBy obtaining a child's US citizenship through birth tourism, foreign nationals are able to help that child avoid the scrutiny, standards, and procedures would normally be undergone, if someone seeks to become a US citizen through the naturalization process, according to the State Department.\\n\\nIn 2018, President Donald Trump vowed to end birthright citizenship by executive order, though lawmakers immediately pushed back against his comments.\\n\\nTom Jawetz, vice president of Immigration Policy at the Center for American Progress said, the rule encourages officials to use their authority to discriminate on the basis of gender and age by denying a visa based on the possibility that a person might give birth in the United States.\\n\\nBy creating a 'rebuttable presumption' for people deemed by a single consular officer to potentially give birth while in the United States, the rule would almost certainly make it far harder for women, especially women of color, to come to the United States on tourist or business visas. The bill is only the latest effort by this White House to reshape immigration policy to harm women, he added in a statement.\\n\\nCORRECTION: This story has been updated to reflect that the new rules will be effective January 24, 2020."}
{"original": "(CNN) —\\n\\nXi Jinping called on Taiwan to reject independence and embrace peaceful reunification with China, in a conciliatory speech that nevertheless took a hard line on the self-governing island's political sovereignty and freedoms.\\n\\nThe Chinese President's Wednesday address was a far cry from one he gave in March last year, in which he said not a single inch of our land could be ceded from China, adding the country was prepared to fight the bloody battle against our enemies.\\n\\nBy contrast, the latest speech – marking 40 years since a key policy document opened the door for rapprochement between Beijing and Taipei – was largely procedural, even outlining how a future system would respect Taiwanese people's private assets, religions, beliefs and legitimate rights, as Xi attempted to portray the future unification of China and Taiwan as an inevitability.\\n\\nReunification is the historical trend and the right path, Taiwan independence is … a dead end, he said.\\n\\nTaiwan has been de facto independent from mainland China since the end of the country's civil war in 1949 when the losing nationalist government fled to Taipei. China's Communist Party has always maintained that Taiwan is part of its territory and vowed to pursue reunification, vacillating between building economic and social ties with the island and threatening it militarily.\\n\\nPHOTO: SAM YEH/AFP/AFP/Getty Images Taiwan's President Tsai Ing-wen arrives for a press conference at the Presidential Palace after the national flag raising ceremony in Taipei on January 1, 2019.\\n\\nXi's speech comes a day after Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen gave her own New Year's address, in which she called on Beijing to face the reality of the existence of the Republic of China, referring to the island by its official name. She also urged that Beijing to respect the commitment of the 23 million people of Taiwan to freedom and democracy.\\n\\nCross-strait tensions\\n\\nTsai resigned as head of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) in November after the historically pro-independence party suffered a crushing defeat in local government elections, which also saw voters reject a proposal for the island to compete in international sporting events as Taiwan rather than Chinese Taipei, a moniker adopted after pressure from Beijing.\\n\\nWhile she acknowledged the elections were a serious test for the current government, Tsai said the results absolutely do not mean that grassroots public opinion in Taiwan favors abandoning our sovereignty, nor do they mean that the people want to make concessions regarding Taiwanese identity.\\n\\nShe also pointed to allegations of Chinese influence over those elections, saying Beijing's attempts to use the openness and freedom of our democratic system to interfere in Taiwan's internal politics and social development (have) now become Taiwan's greatest challenge.\\n\\nDuring his speech, Xi said China had achieved a great victory in frustrating the Taiwan independence movement and other separatist activities.\\n\\nLev Nachman, a Taiwan specialist and PhD student in Political Science at the University of California Irvine, said this appeared to be an oblique acknowledgment of interference in the island's politics.\\n\\nI am not sure we are going to get a more clear direct admittance from Xi himself that the (Chinese Communist Party) interferes with Taiwan's democratic elections, he said. This is something we have always known was a phenomenon, but never really had any 'hard proof'.\\n\\nNachman said Xi's speech showed Beijing now more than ever anticipates that Taiwan will naturally head towards a unification path.\\n\\nIf the CCP is confident it can stop the DPP from maintaining its status as the governing party and can even actively help restore the KMT to power, it has no need to use force, he added, referring to the pro-unification Kuomintang, which governed Taiwan for decades following the Chinese civil war.\\n\\nPHOTO: PHILIP FONG/AFP/AFP/Getty Images A group of Hong Kong independence supporters display flags during the annual New Year's Day pro-democracy rally in Hong Kong on January 1, 2019.\\n\\nHong Kong model\\n\\nThroughout his speech – and those of other Chinese officials introducing him – Xi pointed to One Country, Two Systems as the model for Taiwanese reunification.\\n\\nThat is the principle by which Hong Kong transferred from British to Chinese sovereignty in 1997, maintaining the city's limited democracy, economic system and political freedoms under Chinese rule. For many years, Hong Kong was seen as a model for Taiwan, an advertisement for future reunification, and Xi's speech harkened back to this.\\n\\nOne Country, Two Systems was raised to accommodate Taiwan's reality and safeguard the interests and benefits of Taiwan compatriots … under the precondition of ensuring national sovereignty and national security, Xi said.\\n\\nHow attractive a model Hong Kong is to many in Taiwan is debatable, however, as recent years have seen Beijing renege on promises to expand democratic rights, and multiple prominent pro-democracy figures have been jailed, harassed and banned from standing for election. Political and press freedoms have also declined in the city.\\n\\nXi's call to Hong Kong as the One Country, Two Systems experiment I think shows what an ideal 'unification' looks like from Beijing's perspective: put Taiwan in a position that allows some autonomy still, but slowly erode it until it is retaken completely, Nachman said.\\n\\nXi would like Taiwanese people to see themselves as in the same position as Hong Kongers, which they do not.\\n\\nSpeaking in Taipei Wednesday following Xi's speech, Tsai said the island would not accept a Hong Kong-style arrangement, and called on Beijing to respect Taiwan's political sovereignty.\\n\\n'No promise to renounce force'\\n\\nWhile Xi's speech was conciliatory, emphasizing the need for peaceful reunification above all else, he did not rule out military force if Taiwan were to pursue de jure as well as its longtime de facto independence.\\n\\nWe are willing to create broad space for peaceful reunification, but will leave no room for any form of separatist activities, he said.\\n\\nWe make no promise to renounce the use of force and reserve the option of taking all necessary means, he said, adding that the issue of Taiwan is part of China's domestic politics (and) foreign interference is intolerable.\\n\\nWhile it does not formally recognize Taiwan, the US maintains strong ties with Taipei, which have been bolstered under US President Donald Trump.\\n\\nIn November, the US Navy sailed two ships through the Taiwan Strait, and Washington recently upgraded its de facto embassy in Taipei, the American Institute in Taiwan, to the tune of $255 million."}

She has written about Wall Street, securities regulation and gender discrimination for The New York Times, Bloomberg, and TheStreet. The views expressed here are her own.\\n\\n(CNN) —\\n\\nAn innocent mistake. That's what management of Uber Technologies Inc. reportedly told engineer Susan J. Fowler when she complained in 2015 that her manager was sexually harassing her.\\n\\nPHOTO: Steve Friedman Susan Antilla\\n\\nThe boss had sent her a string of suggestive messages. It was clear that he was trying to get me to have sex with him, Fowler wrote Sunday in a stunning 3,000-word essay on her blog that quickly went viral.\\n\\nFowler took screenshots of the chat session and reported him to human resources. Yessiree, that's sexual harassment all right, HR said. But it was his first offense and he was a high performer, so a warning would suffice, they told her. Just an innocent mistake by a corporate star.\\n\\nNot to quibble here, but even an HR rookie would know that harassers are not inclined to one-offs. Indeed, Fowler said she later came across other women who'd had similar experiences with the man, who no longer works at Uber.\\n\\nCEO Travis Kalanick said Monday that he'd hired no less than former US Attorney General Eric Holder to conduct an independent review into the issues Fowler raised. Kalanick had said in a Tweet on Sunday that the behavior Fowler described was abhorrent & against everything we believe in.\\n\\nIt was an encouraging reaction, but also a head-scratcher. In its dealings with Fowler and the other women she described in her post, did Uber HR go rogue in the face of everything the company's CEO says it believes in? Did the CEO fail to communicate his laudable position to those charged with managing personnel and shaping company culture?\\n\\nOr, more likely, was this perhaps not the stated priority the CEO says it was? We can only hope that an honest investigation carried out by someone with Holder's experience will produce detailed answers to these questions.\\n\\nSpokeswoman MoMo Zhou declined to answer specific questions that I sent by email, citing the ongoing investigation.\\n\\nInvestigating what happened with Fowler and others at Uber is a good thing, but it doesn't change the fact that with the standout exception of employees who the bosses wanted to get rid of anyway, sexual harassers have long enjoyed protection by corporate managements. It isn't just that they often get to keep their jobs. They additionally benefit when, as is common,\\n\\ncompany policy requires employees to use private arbitration in lieu of suing in court. The tidy arrangement keeps the bad boys from suffering a public record of accusations against them and gives them the opportunity to label their acts of misconduct as first offenses in perpetuity.\\n\\nAdd to that the standard policy that women who settle their cases agree to remain silent about their experiences and you've got a system that conspires to keep harassers' names securely under wraps.\\n\\nBy some measures, we're enjoying a welcome stretch where courageous women are upending the corporate cone of silence. Former Fox News anchor Gretchen Carlson made headlines for months last year after she sued Fox News founder Roger Ailes for sexual harassment. Her case was bolstered by recordings she'd made of Ailes' come-ons and she settled in September for $20 million. Inspired by Carlson's suit, other women came forward with similar accusations against Ailes, including one who spoke in defiance of her confidentiality pact.\\n\\nCarlson and now Fowler took big chances going public. Lots of women, though, keep their complaints quiet, fearful they'll be blacklisted by future employers. Even for harassment victims willing to endure a public legal battle, though, the ubiquity of mandatory arbitration means many ugly stories go untold.\\n\\nWhen women assume the risk of going public, it can lead to policy changes. Twenty years ago, a group of female brokers and sales assistants in the Garden City, New York, branch of Smith Barney sued that firm in a sexual harassment and gender discrimination case that became known as the Boom-Boom Room suit, named for a party room in the branch's basement. After initially labeling it an isolated incident – sound familiar? – Smith Barney faced a cascade of similar harassment allegations from branches all over the United States.\\n\\nSmith Barney paid $150 million in arbitrations and settlements in that case amid rousing talk of real change for women on Wall Street.\\n\\nBut the policy changes too often lack real staying power. Once the Boom-Boom Room story was no longer making headlines, the old discriminatory policies began to seep back in. By 2005, another lawsuit against Smith Barney was citing discrimination against female brokers. That one settled for $33 million in 2008. And through it all, some harassers held on to their jobs. A male broker who'd attacked a female colleague in Smith Barney's Walnut Creek, California, office in 1990 was at the firm for another 24 years, according to regulatory records.\\n\\nAt the same time, scholars at the Institute for Women's Policy Research in Washington found that in 2015, women in the securities industry were earning 52 cents for every dollar men made. So much for lasting change, or progress toward equality.\\n\\nGet our free weekly newsletter Sign up for CNN Opinion's new newsletter.\\n\\nJoin us on Twitter and Facebook\\n\\nIs there any solution given a system that favors the employer and the harasser? Yes – and Fowler is Exhibit A. She said on Twitter Sunday night that her revelations led to such a flood of reactions that it shut down her Twitter and Gmail apps. Many of the supporters who stampeded her accounts with attagirls took to social media to say they'd deleted their Uber accounts and suggested others do the same. It took no time for the hashtag #deleteuber – which also swelled in response to Uber's decision to turn off surge pricing during the Taxi Worker's alliance participation in an anti-travel ban protest at JFK – to begin trending on Twitter.\\n\\nIn other words, money talks and the Internet helps to amplify its voice. Employers have stripped us of many of our rights. But not even an Ivy League band of big-ticket lawyers can figure out a way to stop us taking our business elsewhere when we're sickened by a company's behavior."}

This is about whether we fulfill our sacred duty to the American citizens we serve.\\n\\nHe castigated politicians who have deemed his proposed wall immoral, painting them as hypocrites.\\n\\nThe only thing that is immoral is the politicians to do nothing and to continue to allow more innocent people to be so horribly victimized, he said.\\n\\nAfter weeks of a partial government shutdown, Trump and his negotiators have made little headway in convincing Democrats a barrier is needed before agencies can reopen and federal workers can begin receiving paychecks again.\\n\\nThe administration has steadfastly refused to take steps that would restore funding to some agencies, believing the shutdown is its best leverage to secure the wall funds. Fearing he could lose a messaging battle as more Americans feel the pain of a shuttered government, Trump escalated his warnings that the country is unsafe without the border wall he promised as a candidate.\\n\\nIn making his case, Trump turned for the first time to one of the most recognizable symbols of the American presidency – an eight-minute direct-to-camera evening address from the Oval Office.\\n\\nThe idea for the shift in strategy was raised over the past week by top aides, who believed the administration's messaging was not resonating with Americans. The idea had been championed by, among others, the acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, and was a topic of discussion at a weekend senior staff retreat at Camp David.\\n\\n04:48 - Source: CNN Democratic leaders respond to Trump's address\\n\\nInside the White House, some viewed the quiet week between Christmas and New Year's Day as a lost opportunity that could have been used to drive home an urgent message about the necessity of a border wall while Congress was out of town.\\n\\nTrump was initially resistant, but was convinced by aides to adopt a new approach as it became clear his entreaties about securing funding for a wall were not gaining traction.\\n\\nTrump will continue the push in the following days, paying a visit to the Texas border town of McAllen on Thursday to highlight the situation.\\n\\nOn Wednesday, he'll join Republican senators during their weekly lunch. Later he'll return to the White House to resume talks with Democratic and Republican congressional leaders, though it wasn't yet clear whether either side would come offering new elements of a compromise.\\n\\nThis situation could be resolved in a 45-minute meeting, Trump said in his remarks.\\n\\nWhether the authoritative setting of Tuesday's remarks will convince more Americans there truly is a security crisis at the southern border remains an open question. Trump spoke to Americans while he suffers from a credibility lapse after he and his aides have repeated multiple false claims about immigration.\\n\\nFacts undercut the administration's portrait of a nation under siege by terrorists and criminals crossing the southern border; in July 2017, the State Department said there was no credible information that any member of a terrorist group has traveled through Mexico to gain access to the United States.\\n\\nThe administration's own figures show vastly more known or suspected terrorists were apprehended at airports.\\n\\nTrump and top White House officials have in recent days begun speaking more about the humanitarian crisis at the border, which Democrats say is real but of the administration's own making. A surge of families seeking asylum has strained health and child care facilities, and two children have died in US custody.\\n\\nNational emergency?\\n\\n02:42 - Source: CNN Avlon lays out the facts on border security\\n\\nIn the lead-up to the address, the President and his advisers made a public show of considering a national emergency declaration to secure funding for the border wall, a drastic step that would surely be challenged in court. Vice President Mike Pence refused in a string of morning television appearances to say whether a declaration would come during the evening speech.\\n\\nThe White House counsel's office continues to deliberate on the legality of the step. Trump has been under pressure from informal advisers and allies to take the step, which officials was still possible in the coming days.\\n\\nA source close to Trump told CNN's Jim Acosta on Tuesday that the President has been working the phones seeking advice from friends and aides in recent days about whether he should declare an emergency at the border in order to secure funding for the wall. The source said Trump has been told by several of his allies and advisers that a declaration probably won't work from a legal standpoint, though hasn't ruled one out entirely.\\n\\nAnother adviser to Trump said the President has been receiving advice telling him he should declare the state of emergency so he has something to sell to his base – and that if the step is held up in the courts, Trump can still say he tried.\\n\\nWork in progress\\n\\n02:53 - Source: CNN Brianna Keilar: Trump is pushing lies\\n\\nMidday on Tuesday, Trump was working closely with top aides, including policy adviser Stephen Miller, on drafts of the speech.\\n\\nDemocrats had a chance to rebut the President in a subsequent address on Tuesday; all the television networks that agreed to air Trump's remarks also agreed to air Democrats' response, delivered jointly by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer. The pair stood somewhat awkwardly side-by-side in a Capitol hallway for their five-minute long rebuttal.\\n\\nPresident Trump must stop holding the American people hostage, must stop manufacturing a crisis and must reopen the government, Pelosi said.\\n\\nTrump chose to deliver the address after weekend talks between administration officials and Democrats failed to generate a deal that could reopen the parts of government closed by the shutdown.\\n\\nThe closures have become more apparent this week, as more Americans return from holiday vacations to find some federal services unavailable. Most federal workers affected by the shutdown were due to receive paychecks on Friday; without an agreement, they won't be paid.\\n\\nTrump has insisted in public that unpaid workers are understanding in their plight, and that he feels their pain.\\n\\nBut in private, the President has worried an extended shutdown could erode his political support as more Americans feel the effects. Yet he's also fretted that failing to deliver on the border wall – his chief campaign vow – would hurt him with his conservative base.\\n\\nCNN's Jim Acosta and Phil Mattingly contributed to this report.\\n\\nThis story has been updated."}

Authorities said Tuesday, Oct. 31, 2017, that three Dartmouth psychology professors are under criminal investigation for allegations of sexual misconduct. The previous week the college said the professors were put on paid leave and had their access to campus restricted due to allegations of serious misconduct. The college later told authorities it had received allegations of sexual misconduct. (AP Photo/Jim Cole, File)\\n\\n(CNN) —\\n\\nDartmouth College says it is launching a new initiative to combat sexual harassment and abuses of power on campus. But a lawyer for seven women who are suing the university over its handling of sexual harassment allegations say the efforts miss the mark.\\n\\nThe announcement comes nearly two months after a federal complaint was filed against the Ivy League school by seven current and former graduate students who allege three professors created a toxic environment where female subjects were routinely subjected to sexual harassment and even rape.\\n\\nA school inquiry led to the resignations of the three professors in 2018 and the school pledged to take steps to improve the campus culture. The new Campus Climate and Culture Initiative is the latest step in that direction, school officials said in a press release.\\n\\nThe new program will include the following components:\\n\\n- A single policy to address sexual misconduct for faculty, staff, and students, with appropriate processes for adjudicating potential violations;\\n\\n- A mandatory online sexual violence prevention training program for all faculty, staff, professional and graduate students, and postdoctoral scholars;\\n\\n- Research advisory committees for all graduate programs to ensure that all graduate students have access to multiple advisors.\\n\\nThe announcement comes as American universities grapple with how to handle allegations of campus sexual misconduct and their obligations under Title IX, the federal law that bars discrimination based on sex, including harassment, in federally funded education programs and activities.\\n\\nThe Department of Education in November proposed new rules for dealing with sexual harassment and assault on college campuses that would bolster the rights of those accused of wrongdoing.\\n\\nThe lawsuit accuses the New Hampshire school of failing to create an environment free from gender-based discrimination, in violation of Title IX.\\n\\nDartmouth says the new program will expand the school's Title IX office, which is responsible for reviewing reports of sexual misconduct and conducting investigations. The school also pledged to increase mental health resources at Dartmouth and said that an outside expert who specializes in creating inclusive communities will review academic departments.\\n\\nThe lawsuit claims that the prominent researchers, who no longer are allowed on campus, coerced female students into drinking and made the women feel as if their success depended on their willingness to participate in their alcohol-saturated culture the men created.\\n\\nThe complaint claims that Dartmouth knew about the professors' behavior for more than 16 years and did nothing until 2017, when several female graduate students reported the allegations to the college's Title IX office. During the Title IX investigation, the lawsuit claims that Dartmouth failed to provide the plaintiffs with support, accommodations or guidance, then unilaterally terminated the disciplinary process without seeking their input.\\n\\nPreviously, school officials said they applauded the courage of the women who came forward. However, we respectfully, but strongly, disagree with the characterizations of Dartmouth's actions in the complaint and will respond through our own court filings, they said.\\n\\nDeborah Marcuse, an attorney representing seven women plaintiffs in the sexual harassment lawsuit, said the initiatives miss the mark and simply bring the school into compliance with federal law.\\n\\nTo the extent that Dartmouth is now seeking to conform its policies to what federal law requires, we certainly support that though we think it's long overdue, Marcuse said. What's striking about this is that Dartmouth continues to fail to acknowledge or accept responsibility for the damage that its long history of inaction has caused.\\n\\nMarcuse faulted the school for not reaching out to her clients for their input. Dartmouth's formal response to their complaint is due in a little over a week on January 15.\\n\\nIt appears to us that for all of the lip service to their courage, there has been no interest from Dartmouth in materially responding to or really listening to these women despite a lot of vague call outs to 'we want to include everyone and everything', she said.\\n\\nIf you just look at the nature of the various responses there really just isn't any acknowledgment that what these women experienced is something that has had any impact on Dartmouth at all."}

Since then it's gained a global profile thanks to endorsement from celebrity diners such as Bob Geldof, Bono and Brad and Angelina.\\n\\nBut, high-profile praise aside, it's the food that makes Castelli's worth a visit before setting off from Addis into the Ethiopian wilds.\\n\\nRistorante Castelli, Mahatma Gandhi Street, Addis Ababa. Tel: +251 1 563 580, +251 1 571 757\\n\\n2. Italian-style coffee\\n\\nCome on, stir it up. jose cendon/afp/getty images\\n\\nLike great Italian food, coffee is one of the legacies of the Italian occupation of Ethiopia during WWII.\\n\\nWhile Mussolini's men proved inept colonists (the Allies defeated them in 1943), their tenure in the country did at least ensure that an Italian-style espresso machine was installed in most cafes, restaurants and -- weary travelers will be pleased to know -- even dilapidated roadside shacks.\\n\\nEthiopians love their coffee and take pride in the fact that the plant's invigorating effects were first discovered in the Oromia region of the country (see the 2006 documentary Black Gold ).\\n\\n3. Chinese roads\\n\\nChina has invested billions of dollars in Ethiopia's infrastructure. simon maina/afp/getty images\\n\\nMade in China. Actually made by China. The country is investing hundreds of millions of dollars in Ethiopia's infrastructure.\\n\\nAside from coffee and pasta, Ethiopia excels in roads.\\n\\nOther African nations have roads -- it's just that few are a patch on those in Ethiopia.\\n\\nThe quality tarmac comes courtesy of huge Chinese investment -- in the ten years to 2016, it was estimated that China had poured $21.52 billion into Ethiopia's infrastructure.\\n\\nAnyone who's driven into Ethiopia from Kenya, via the perilous Marsabit route (fraught with bumps, brigands and bandits) will attest to the difference a nice road makes.\\n\\nEthiopia's incredible mountain-top highway vistas don't hurt, either.\\n\\n4. Tanks ... lots of them\\n\\nA barrel of fun. alexander joe/afp/getty images\\n\\nSwords into ploughshares ... or tanks into unusual climbing frames for kids, in the case of Ethiopia.\\n\\nDon't worry: unless you get horribly lost and venture into Somalia, the tanks you'll see along the roadside are burned-out remnants of the Eritrean-Ethiopian War (1998-2000).\\n\\nSeen throughout the country, these defunct war machines stand as forbidding reminders of Ethiopia's troubled past -- and double as fun climbing frames for local children.\\n\\n5. Underground churches\\n\\nHewn out of solid rock. sean gallup/getty images\\n\\nLalibela's monolithic churches still impress nine centuries later.\\n\\nEthiopia sags under the weight of its cultural treasures, such as those at the UNESCO World Heritage site Lalibela.\\n\\nIn the late 12th century, Gebre Mesqel Lalibela had 13 churches -- Ethiopia is one of the oldest Christian nations -- carved out of solid rock.\\n\\nHis achievement (meaning that of his stonemasons and slaves) is still incredibly impressive nine centuries on.\\n\\nLalibela -- the first major point of interest on the Northern Circuit -- is a 10-hour journey from Addis Ababa.\\n\\nHead north up Route 1, passing through Debre Birhan, Kombolcha and Dessie. At Weldiya, leave the highway and follow the road west to Gashena.\\n\\nAt Gashena, take the road north to Lalibela.\\n\\n6. Martian landscapes\\n\\nThe stark beauty of the Danakil Depression. carl court/getty images\\n\\nThe cruelest place on Earth? Pretty, though.\\n\\nLocated in the tumultuous Afar region on the Eritrean border, the Danakil Depression is strewn with volcanoes and salt lakes and is one of the hottest places on the planet.\\n\\nSo why visit what National Geographic calls the cruelest place on Earth?\\n\\nWell, this also happens to be one of the most arresting natural sights you'll see in Africa -- or anywhere else.\\n\\nWith an unforgiving landscape that's difficult to navigate, it's also one of the few places in Ethiopia where you shouldn't travel alone: most people go with an escort or in a convoy.\\n\\n7. Men-only monasteries\\n\\nWatch your step on the way up to Debre Damo. achilli family/flickr/cnn\\n\\nDebre Damo houses some of the most ancient Christian scripture in Africa. Gentlemen: you'll have to describe it to the ladies.\\n\\nJust off the main road between Lalibela and Aksum lies Debre Damo, a monastery that can be reached only by scrambling up a 15-meter-high cliff face.\\n\\nThere is, however, a discriminatory door policy: only men are permitted to make the perilous ascent to the monastery.\\n\\nThat rule doesn't apply just to female humans -- even livestock of the fairer sex apparently risk distracting the monks from holy contemplation.\\n\\nGents who brave the climb can enjoy stunning vistas, as well as a chance to eye some of the most ancient Christian scripture in Africa.\\n\\nBe warned that unofficial guides will try to extort inflated fees for their services before letting you back down the cliff -- negotiate the charge beforehand.\\n\\nIt's practical to visit Debre Damo en route to Aksum.\\n\\nThe monastery lies just outside the small town of Bizet, 12 hours' drive north of Addis and about 50 kilometers west of Adigrat, the last stop on Route 1 before turning west on to Route 15.\\n\\nFollow the road to Bizet and keep a keen eye out for the turn to Debre Damo on the right.\\n\\n8. The Ark of the Covenant\\n\\nIs Ethiopia the final resting place of the Ark of the Covenant? carl de souza/afp/getty images\\n\\nThe Lost Ark? In Ethiopia?\\n\\nSomeone should have told Indiana Jones that before he set off for Cairo.\\n\\nAccording to enthusiastic local sources, the historic town of Aksum -- focal point of the Aksumite Empire (AD 100-940) -- is the resting place of the Ark of the Covenant.\\n\\nThe catch? No one's actually allowed to see it.\\n\\nThe closest you can get is by paying a few dollars to one of the tracksuit-clad men posturing as guards outside the temple where the ark is purportedly kept.\\n\\nLuckily, Aksum is home to plenty of ancient tombs and other monuments, which makes the drive to one of Ethiopia's northernmost towns worthwhile -- ark or not.\\n\\nThough Aksum can be reached by a small road west of Mek'ele, people wanting to visit Debre Damo monastery as well should take Route 1, turning west on to Route 15 at Adigrat, and join Route 3 at Adwa.\\n\\n9. Roadside Rastafarians\\n\\nA child of Jah. gianluigi guercia/afp/getty images\\n\\nThe Rastafari movement is most often associated with Jamaica, but it was Ethiopian emperor Haile Selassie who inspired the religion.\\n\\nEthiopians are proud of their former ruler's supposed status as Jesus incarnate and some have adopted the dress and lifestyle habits of their Jamaican counterparts -- which makes meeting them in the Simien Mountains all the more bizarre.\\n\\nThe roadside Rastas you're likely to meet are a friendly bunch, who'll happily talk you through points of interest in the area (often relating to high cliffs off which Italian soldiers were thrown), as well as hawking red, green and yellow hats and accessories.\\n\\n10. A fairy tale kingdom\\n\\nFairy tale fasilides. carl de souza/afp/getty images\\n\\nBritish and Dutch colonial buildings attract the most architectural attention in east Africa, but Ethiopia again stands out as the only country on the continent with its own fairy tale castles.\\n\\nAside from a few eye-catching art deco buildings left over from the Italian occupation, the castles of Fasilides, Iyasu and Mentwab, in the former imperial capital of Gondar, are the structures that stay in the mind.\\n\\nGondar is a five-hour drive southwest of Aksum.

{"original": "(CNN) Control of the Senate majority will be decided on Tuesday night -- or maybe Wednesday morning! -- in Georgia, as Republican Sens. Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue try to hold onto their seats .\\n\\nLose both and Democrats retake the chamber. Win either one and Republicans retain the narrowest of majorities heading into the 117th Congress. The stakes are impossibly high.\\n\\nSo, what's going to happen? For answers about that -- and how the two runoffs have played out -- I reached out to star Atlanta Journal-Constitution political reporter Greg Bluestein , who has covered every inch of these races.\\n\\nOur conversation, conducted via email and lightly edited for flow, is below.\\n\\nCillizza: Describe the scene in Georgia over these past two months. Trump contesting the 2020 election AND two runoffs!\\n\\nBluestein: Overwhelming. Extraordinary. Insane.\\n\\nI've struggled throughout the races over how to best to describe these dramatic cliffhangers, with four candidates competing in high-stakes runoffs that will shape President-elect Joe Biden's agenda.\\n\\nMaybe the best way to capture it is: Dramatic.\\n\\nAs Vice President-elect Kamala Harris put it in Columbus last month: Everything that's at stake in November is at stake in January.\\n\\nNo pressure, Georgia!\\n\\nCillizza: There's a tendency to lump both races together. Have they been distinct from each other? And if so, how?\\n\\nBluestein: Each of the candidates are running their own distinct operations -- but they are also effectively running as dueling tickets.\\n\\nIt's a bit confusing, but there's a reason for that. Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock need to sweep both Senate seats for Democrats to flip control of the Senate, while Republicans decided to pool resources early to defend their majority.\\n\\nBoth Republicans have assailed their opponents as  radical liberals  who would lead the nation down a path toward socialism, but with different lines of attack. Loeffler has focused on sermons and stances Warnock staked from the pulpit of Atlanta's famed Ebenezer Baptist Church, while Perdue has charged that Ossoff is a feckless liberal who is too inexperienced to hold the job.\\n\\nThe Democrats have swung right back, accusing their rivals of being stooges of Trump and profiting off the pandemic. They've also been more willing to embrace party leaders, including liberal figures like Sen. Bernie Sanders and Speaker Nancy Pelosi, that past candidates would have run screaming from.\\n\\nCillizza: Trump. How big a factor is he in today's vote? And is it positive or negative? Or both?\\n\\nBluestein: Like just about everything else in American politics now, Trump has shaped this contest. Both parties recognized immediately this would be a : Like just about everything else in American politics now, Trump has shaped this contest. Both parties recognized immediately this would be a race for their bases -- a pool of 2.5 million or so voters for each side in Georgia -- rather than a contest to win over the undecideds.\\n\\nDemocrats have tried to paint a picture of a post-Trump era in American politics, complete with more funding to fight the coronavirus, expanded health care access and a sweeping new voting-rights law. But they've also hammered the Republicans for tying themselves so closely with a President they say is undermining democracy.\\n\\nAnd of course, the race was further rocked over the weekend by Trump's extraordinary demand to Raffensperger to find enough votes to reverse his election defeat. Democrats framed the recording as a brazen attempt to undermine democracy, while the GOP campaigns sought to minimize it.\\n\\nCillizza: The Democratic candidates have been somewhat overshadowed in all of this. Is one a better candidate than the other? Or running a better (or worse) campaign?\\n\\nBluestein: That's a great point. As one Democratic operative called to remind me today, the run-up to Tuesday's vote was dominated by talk about the Republicans: Trump's fuming about his election defeat, the push to contest Biden's victory in Congress, the bombshell tape. Even Biden's visit to Georgia was somewhat overshadowed by Trump's rally.\\n\\nThe Democrats, by the way, are OK with that. They aren't struggling to project a sense of unity like the Georgia GOP now is. And they feel that Ossoff and Warnock work in tandem together to help counter the party's traditional struggles in statewide runoffs, when younger and more diverse voters typically show up in lower numbers.\\n\\nOssoff, 33, has been appealing to millennials, African Americans and others who might usually ignore these overtime contests. And Warnock, who leads the church where Martin Luther King Jr. once preached, has tried to re-engage Black voters.\\n\\nCillizza: Finish this sentence: The chances of one party sweeping BOTH seats today is _________. Now, explain.\\n\\nBluestein: It's hard to predict a race like this, particularly with so little solid polling, but I'll wager the answer is: Very likely.\\n\\nThe Democrats have basically run as a package deal, as have the Republicans. Voters here have been bombarded by an onslaught of ads , teams of canvassers, text messages, digital messaging and other breathless appeals [casting] one side as good and the other as the face of evil. It's hard to see this ending in a split decision -- and of course that does Democrats no good, since they need a clean sweep to flip Senate control.\\n\\nBut I can't rule it out, either, especially if the margins are as tight as they were in November, when Biden defeated Trump by fewer than 12,000 votes. Many Republican analysts expect Perdue, who has a longer track record in GOP politics than Loeffler, to outdo her in the runoffs."}

The parts are imported from China, but 97 percent of its employees are local workers.\\n\\nProducing cars locally allows Lifan to avoid paying the 35 percent import tax that applies to foreign vehicles, and offer consumers a cheaper product. Lifan vehicles are available for $15,000, similar to the price of used imports, which could be a strong competitive advantage.\\n\\nLifan is a new car, says factory supervisor Figo Wang. Nissan and Toyota may be second hand because (they are) too expensive.\\n\\nLifan may also benefit from a wider appetite to see more new cars in operation on the road.\\n\\nThese old cars pollute the country, and they cost a lot of money to import spare parts, says Constantinos Berhuetesfa Constantinos, professor of public policy at Addis Ababa University. New cars…will reduce the transportation problems here.\\n\\nOther Chinese manufacturers such as Geely are also basing operations in Ethiopia, and the new field looks set to grow.\\n\\nRead: First ever 'Made in Ghana' cars are built to survive anything\\n\\nWe are very confident to develop in this country, says Ma Qun, deputy general manager of Lifan Motors Ethiopia.

To be honest with you, I'm very afraid in situations where we do have increased terrorist attacks, we may be vulnerable in not arming the aviation police.\\n\\nTaliaferro, an attorney and former veteran Chicago police officer, said it made no sense for trained law enforcement officers not to carry a gun while on duty.\\n\\nWe are leaving our officers at a risk of harm. It leaves the city wide open to liability, he said.\\n\\nA CNN investigation in December revealed that the nearly 300 aviation police officers are not only unarmed, but they are instructed to run and hide in the event of an active shooter. Officers told CNN that the policy puts them in danger.\\n\\nThe aviation police officers are all certified law enforcement officers in the state of Illinois. Many work in suburban police departments or are military veterans.\\n\\nBecause (aviation police officers) are unarmed, when they encounter an armed individual, they must request assistance from a Chicago police officer. Furthermore, there is a standing order that in the event of an active shooter, (aviation police officers) are to 'run and hide,' which is contrary to what police are trained to do, the proposed ordinance said.\\n\\nThe Chicago Police Department is the primary law enforcement agency at the two airports, and those officers are armed.\\n\\nArmed (aviation police officers) could do a better job of ensuring public safety and allow some police officers currently at the airports to be reassigned to provide much-needed assistance in crime-torn neighborhoods in Chicago, the proposed ordinance said.\\n\\nCNN Investigations Email your story ideas and tips to CNNtips@cnn.com.\\n\\nWhile airports throughout the country handle security differently, Chicago's airports are the only ones in which aviation police officers do not carry guns.\\n\\nThe proposal follows last week's resignation of Richard Edgeworth, the aviation police chief who received a vote of no confidence from officers last year, claiming morale had plummeted under his command. Edgeworth returned to the city's fire department.\\n\\nMatt Brandon, secretary-treasurer of Local 73 of the Service Employees International Union, which represents the aviation police officers, said he's optimistic the proposal will be approved.\\n\\nArming the aviation police officers is a matter of public safety and it needs to happen quick, Brandon said Friday.\\n\\nThe proposal will now be reviewed by the city council's public safety committee.\\n\\nThe Chicago Aviation Department has maintained the existing security policy works and there is no need to arm the aviation officers.\\n\\nThe multilevel security approach used at O'Hare and Midway Airports has proven effective in stopping and preventing crime while creating a structure that allows for all our law enforcement officials to collaborate easily and effectively, department spokesman Owen Kilmer said in a statement."}

Even with the HOV-only roads, Jakarta still had some of the world's worst traffic. The policy was at times controversial.\\n\\nDrivers in the Indonesian capital began paying jockeys to ride along with them in HOV lanes. Some jockeys were children.

We convened a task force of experts, in pediatric medicine, in immunology, he told CNN, adding that one of the experts is Dr. Vivek Murthy, whom President-elect Joe Biden has nominated for US Surgeon General.\\n\\nMiami-Dade schools superintendent Alberto Carvalho says he took advice from medical experts on how to open safely.\\n\\nWe've been in good hands ... and that has translated into a set of protocols that has left very little room for doubting ourselves.\\n\\nThose protocols listed in the county website include: daily health checks before students leave home, the wearing of masks and more space around children on school buses and in classrooms and cafeteria.\\n\\nCarvalho's lack of doubt has helped win over many parents of the more than 350,000 students enrolled in his schools.\\n\\nWhen you communicate that to the parents, then there's a sense of calm and trust that parents need prior to sending their students to school, he said.\\n\\n'No substitute'\\n\\nMiami-Dade is the fourth largest school district in the country and the largest to reopen fully in the fall.\\n\\nCarvalho's determination stems from his belief that there is no good replacement for in-person instruction.\\n\\nThere is no substitute, regardless of how great the technology may be, he said bluntly. You cannot Zoom effectively into a full understanding, a full level of engagement for students.\\n\\nCarvalho also sees schools as an indispensable safe harbor for children -- academically, physically and emotionally -- even or perhaps especially in the middle of a pandemic.\\n\\nI am a staunch believer that if we want to keep schools open ... if we want that normalcy and regularity to continue, if we want that protective umbrella for students, pedagogically speaking, academically speaking, in terms of their cognitive and emotional development -- if we will want that to happen, then the schools can do all they can in terms of preventative measures in terms of mitigating strategies in terms of protocols.\\n\\nCarvalho says protocols to stop the spread of Covid are being followed more closely in schools than in the community at large.\\n\\nHe said the cases of coronavirus in his schools are lower than in the community at large. Miami-Dade alone has reported more than a fifth of all Covid-19 cases in Florida , according to Johns Hopkins University data. But Carvalho said schools had an advantage.\\n\\nHere in Miami-Dade, we see a greater adherence to protocols in schools -- because it is a controlled, safe environment -- than we see those same protocols being followed in their community in general, whether we're talking about the bars and restaurants at the beach or social gatherings, he said.\\n\\nA mixed picture of openings and closings\\n\\nNew York City is seeing a similar outcome after it reopened its public elementary schools last month, despite an increasing coronavirus test positivity rate in the city as a whole.\\n\\nThe city has conducted about 100,000 Covid tests in schools, and found a positivity rate of 0.68%, far below the citywide rate of just under 9%, according to New York City data.\\n\\nThe evidence that schools are not hotbeds of virus spread led New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo to reverse a policy requiring schools to close if the community positivity rate hit 9% or higher.\\n\\nIf their schools are below the level of positivity in the community then they can keep the schools open, he said last week, returning more control to local school districts.\\n\\nWhile there is no official national database tracking the spread of Covid within schools, independent analysis suggests that schools can safely reopen if proper mitigation strategies are followed.\\n\\nIt's an issue on which even governors from political opposites can share similar views.\\n\\nLast week Cuomo, a Democrat and frequent critic of President Donald Trump, said: The safest place in New York City is, of course, our public schools.\\n\\nAnd last October, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican ally of the President, said: Closing schools due to coronavirus is probably the biggest public health blunder in modern American history.\\n\\nBut many school districts are not ready to reopen. Los Angeles, the second largest district behind New York City, remains fully online, as do San Francisco and Washington, DC.\\n\\nOn Monday, some Chicago students in pre-K and special education got to return to school for the first time since March. But the push to reopen schools was met with heavy resistance from the city's teachers' union, which argued that the city had not invested enough in measures to make in-person learning safe for staff and children.\\n\\nThat also appears to be the feeling among many Chicago parents. Students in kindergarten through 8th grade may go back to in-person learning next month, but so far less than one-third have signed up.\\n\\nCarvalho greets students wearing masks in one of this elementary schools.\\n\\nWith Miami-Dade already having met that bar, Carvalho has his own next priority in mind: make sure teachers are among the first to be vaccinated.\\n\\nIf our teachers are essential professionals, indispensable to our society, to our economy, then we ought to prioritize their status in terms of access to the vaccine, the superintendent said."}

Many voters in pro-Brexit areas of England snubbed her in favor of Labour's Jeremy Corbyn – who at the time had an unclear position on Brexit, though much of his party is pro-Europe. She lost her majority, but strangely picked up votes in Remain-supporting Scotland, despite her party backing the very definition of a so-called hard Brexit.\\n\\nPHOTO: TOLGA AKMEN/AFP/Getty Images Britain's Prime Minister Theresa May leaves from 10 Downing Street on December 17, 2018.\\n\\nClearly, the British public is divided – and that division is especially acute in the politics of the four nations.\\n\\nIn England, the UK's wealthiest and most populous city, London, stands in contrast to the rest of the country.\\n\\nIt is from London that the campaign for a second vote that could ultimately stop Brexit is being driven. But it was English votes that carried the victory for Leave. This creates tension not just in England, but in the union at large – the politics of the English are the most influential in the union and can often dictate policy that affects everyone.\\n\\nIn the case of Brexit, that means Scottish remainers feeling as though the English are dragging them out of the EU against their will. Alarmingly for unionists, recent polling showed that English Conservative voters (officially called the Conservative and Unionist Party) would be happy with the union breaking up in exchange for a good Brexit.\\n\\nThe division is more obvious in Scotland. The SNP would clearly like to push for a second independence referendum and rejoin the EU as an independent nation. Meanwhile, Scottish Conservatives would clearly prefer a softer form of Brexit to protect Scotland's economy while keeping the union together – something about which they disagree with their English counterparts.\\n\\nIn Northern Ireland, the devolved National Assembly has not sat in nearly two years after the power-sharing agreement that allows both unionists and republicans to be involved in government collapsed.\\n\\nDespite this, the Democratic Unionist Party holds the balance of power in Westminster and is currently one of the biggest obstacles to May getting her Brexit deal through Parliament.\\n\\nThey believe the deal ignores their most important demand: no friction between Northern Ireland and Great Britain. We do not want a hard border, we believe there are many ways of resolving it, the DUP's Emma Little-Pengelly said to me of the Irish border issue. Instead, she believes that May and the EU's solution aims to ensure no checks at all on the Irish border between two sovereign states by creating 68 new checks between Great Britain and Northern Ireland.\\n\\nIt must be worrying for the DUP that both those wanting May's deal to pass and hardline Brexit voters are so happy to see their red lines rubbed out for the sake of getting the job done.\\n\\nPHOTO: PAUL FAITH/AFP/AFP/Getty Images Traffic crosses the border into Northern Ireland from the Irish Republic.\\n\\nOne thing seems to have been forgotten by politicians in all this: some people in Brussels speak English. The UK's chaos has been watched with astonishment by EU officials.\\n\\nIt's still not clear what the UK wants, Guy Verhofstadt, Brexit coordinator for the EU Parliament, told CNN. I hope the deal agreed finds a majority. If not, then MPs have to work together to find a compromise solution on a future relationship. Whatever the choice, we need a withdrawal agreement to be agreed to avoid a disastrous no-deal outcome.\\n\\nLoathe as many in Westminster will be to take advice from a former Prime Minister of Belgium, he makes a solid point. Wild politics is not a good enough reason for a nation as important as the UK to fall into a black hole of its own creation.\\n\\nIt's still not clear what the UK wants. Guy Verhofstadt\\n\\nThe good news is that as things stand, both main parties believe the union should be preserved. It shouldn't be beyond the wit of our elected officials to forge some cross-party unity on a matter they claim to care so much about.\\n\\nAs Brexit reaches its apex, perhaps the minds of the political elite will sharpen and we will all start to see a way out of this hellscape. They need to make the public care about the union, or frankly, it's only going to crumble further.\\n\\nIf that doesn't happen, then the UK as we know it will have to continue to exist on life support.\\n\\nAnd if we don't take this moment to fix the union between the four nations, then distressingly few will be in mourning, should the switch get flipped."}
{"original": "(CNN) Almost four weeks after the first American was vaccinated against the coronavirus , around 6 million people have received one of the shots -- far below the US target, set last year, of 20 million by the end of 2020, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\\n\\nAs of Thursday, 5.9 million people had received a vaccination, up from 5.3 the day before, the CDC said. The US surgeon general said this week the United States is averaging about half a million vaccinations a day.\\n\\nWhile the target of 20 million may have been too high to begin with, the holidays may have caused delays, some health experts said, and there may be a time lag in reporting vaccinations.\\n\\nIt got off to a slow start and we need to do better at every level, but I believe that we will pick up momentum as we get beyond the holiday season into the first couple of weeks in January, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told Newsday's Randi Marshall this week in a virtual event.\\n\\nFauci warned against jumping to conclusions about the pace of the vaccine rollout in such a short time period, saying we just started.\\n\\nStill, though a lot of money and effort has been put into developing vaccines and into distributing it to the states, less seems to have been put into how to actually get them administered, public health experts said.\\n\\nThere seems to have been the notion in Washington that, gee, you have all these public health people out there. All you have to do is send the vaccine out, said William Schaffner, professor of infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University.\\n\\nI'm having flashbacks to what happened with testing, said Dr. Leana Wen, a visiting professor of health policy and management at the George Washington University's Milken School of Public Health and a CNN medical analyst.\\n\\nIt's the same thing, that initially there were promises made that were based on rosy projections. Everybody assumed that there was a national strategy when, as it turns out, there was not.\\n\\nState and local health departments are already overstretched and have not had the resources they need to plan and roll out the most ambitious vaccination program that our country has ever undertaken, Wen said.\\n\\nThose departments have been running all the other aspects of pandemic operations like testing, contact tracing, public education, data tracking, and now you're adding to this responsibility this huge responsibility, and so they've been saying for months that they need additional support.\\n\\nAdded to that is the fact that the public health infrastructure in the United States has been shrinking for about 15-20 years, Schaffner said.\\n\\nHow to ramp up vaccinations\\n\\nThe federal government can do several things to speed up the vaccination process, Wen said, including instilling a sense of urgency and (making) it clear that this is a wartime mobilization. That requires a national effort that's 24/7, no excuses there.\\n\\nSchaffner agreed.\\n\\nYou can vaccinate on Saturdays, you can vaccinate on Sundays, you can start at 6 o'clock in the morning, Schaffner said. You can go until 8 or 9 o'clock at night. So, the more you can vaccinate, the better.\\n\\nSecond, Wen said, the government could set targets, determine what state and local officials need to meet the targets, and help them get what they need.\\n\\nAnd the government could help with streamlining the process, staffing vaccination centers and setting up mass vaccination sites.\\n\\nEverything that can be done by the federal government they should do, specifically staffing, Wen said. Why should 50 states be trying to figure out how they should all recruit vaccinators?\\n\\nMass immunization clinics -- in parking lots, for example -- would be one way to eventually pick up the speed in getting everyone inoculated, said L.J Tan, the chief strategy officer at the Immunization Action Coalition, which works to increase immunization rates.\\n\\nWith flu, we know if you do a really well-done mass immunization clinic, you can easily clear 20,000 vaccines a day, Tan said. The rate for the coronavirus vaccine wouldn't be as high because of the wait time required after giving the vaccine to make sure there's no allergic reaction, he said.\\n\\nHesitancy among health care workers\\n\\nSome states have been grappling with the reluctance of even health care workers to get vaccinated. In Texas, the Houston Methodist hospital system is offering a $500 bonus to workers if they get the coronavirus vaccine.\\n\\nBut the real key to solving the problem, Schaffner said, is communication.\\n\\n'There has been an underappreciation of how much work in communication it's going to take to bring people who are hesitant into the fold and get them vaccinated, Schaffner said. Even my good friends and dear friends at the CDC have profoundly underestimated the degree of vaccine hesitancy among people who work in the health care environment.\\n\\nSensing that that would be a problem, the Vanderbilt University Medical Center started an educational program four to six weeks before the vaccine was delivered, Schaffner said, including videos, social media and Q&A sessions.\\n\\nWe could see the proverbial needle move in the direction of acceptance, Schaffner said.\\n\\nIn Kentucky, more than 30% of people eligible decline to receive the vaccine when offered in some cases, the state's health commissioner said Thursday.\\n\\nIn nursing homes, there are reports that nursing aides -- not the residents -- are hesitant to be vaccinated, Tan said.\\n\\nWe need to figure out ways to go in and help them and help educate the nursing aides, Tan said. This is a safe and efficacious vaccine.\\n\\nPart of the reason the rollout has been slow has to do with the population recommended to be the first to receive the vaccine: the elderly in long-term care facilities and health care workers, Tan said.\\n\\nIn places like California, for example, where virus cases are soaring and hospitalization rates are overwhelming, facilities are judicious in giving the shots to heath care workers who may then develop a fever -- one of the possible side effects of the vaccine, but also a Covid-19 symptom -- which would keep them from work, if even for a short time, when hospitals need all the help they can get.\\n\\nYou can imagine that health care systems, with the surge of patients and needing full availability of their staff, are going to be a lot more deliberate with the way they vaccinate their staff, Tan said. You're not going to vaccinate all of them at the same time, or even half of them at the same time.\\n\\n'Just need to get it rolling,' surgeon general says\\n\\nUS Surgeon General Dr. Jerome Adams has been telling states to move on to the next priority group in line for vaccinations if their supply exceeds the demand among the people in the first phase, saying in a tweet Thursday that the CDC's guidance is recommendations -- not mandates.\\n\\nGet those vaccines where they're going to be taken up, Adams told NBC's Today on Tuesday. We don't need to re-create the wheel, we just need to get it rolling.\\n\\nSome states have begun moving even faster to expand the pool of those eligible for a vaccine, but that has created its own problems. In Florida, after those 65 and older were allowed to get the shot, people lined up for hours and the supply was quickly used up.\\n\\nPresident-elect Joe Biden has set an aggressive goal of 100 million shots in his first 100 days in office. That would vaccinate 50 million people, because immunization requires two separate doses for each person.\\n\\nBiden will aim to release nearly every available dose of vaccine when he takes office, according to TJ Ducklo, a spokesman for Biden's transition.\\n\\nThat's a break with the Trump administration's strategy of holding back half of US vaccine production to ensure second doses are available.\\n\\nThough that's a risky strategy, given that both vaccines now approved in the US require two doses, administered at specific intervals, a transition official said the Biden team believes that vaccine manufacturers will be able to produce enough second doses in time; Biden's team plans to use the Defense Production Act to produce vaccine and other materials.\\n\\nBiden has said he would set up federally run and supported vaccination centers around the country with the help of the Federal Emergency Management Administration, the CDC, the military and the National Guard."}

His case illustrates the drive of the #MeToo movement to call out serial predatory behavior and the forces that enable it.\\n\\nThis experience 'does not define me'\\n\\nMore than 140 female athletes said they were abused by the once-respected doctor, including Aly Raisman Gabby Douglas and McKayla Maroney , members of the Fierce Five US Olympic gymnastics team that won the gold in 2012. Many said they were pressured into silence by powerful institutions, including USA Gymnastics, the sport's governing body in the United States.\\n\\nIn response to Biles' statement, the organization pledged unwavering support for Biles and others who have courageously come forward.\\n\\nUSA Gymnastics is absolutely heartbroken, sorry and angry that Simone Biles or any of our athletes have been harmed by the horrific acts of Larry Nassar, the group said. We are our athletes' advocates. USA Gymnastics will continue to listen to our athletes and our members in our efforts of creating a culture of empowerment with a relentless focus on athlete safety every single day.\\n\\nBiles, now 20, joined the US Olympic gymnastics team in 2016, winning the individual all-around. Though her statement did not include specific allegations against Nassar, she described experiencing abuse under the guise of special treatment, a recurring claim from Nassar's victims.\\n\\nThis behavior is completely unacceptable, disgusting, and abusive, especially coming from someone I was TOLD to trust, she said Monday.\\n\\nShe, too, called out USA Gymnastics for its alleged role in allowing Nassar to prey on young girls for decades.\\n\\nFor far too long I've asked myself 'Was I too naive? Was it my fault?' I now know the answer to those questions. No. No. It was not my fault. No, I will not and should not carry the guilt that belongs to Larry Nassar, USAG, and others.\\n\\nAfter hearing the brave stories of my friends and other survivors, I know that this horrific experience does not define me.\\n\\nDozens of victims expected to speak\\n\\nNassar faces sentencing on Tuesday in Michigan state court after pleading guilty in November to seven counts of criminal sexual conduct. He faces additional sentencing later this month on three counts of criminal sexual assault involving victims in a neighboring county.\\n\\nHe worked at Michigan State University from 1997 to 2016 as an associate professor, and he served as the gymnastics and women's crew team physician. In his plea , Nassar admitted to sexually abusing patients under the guise of providing medically necessary treatment in instances as far back as 1998, some of which involved girls under 13.\\n\\nSeveral days have been set aside in Nassar's sentencing for victim impact statements. At least 88 people are expected to speak, according to the Michigan Attorney General's Office.\\n\\nAt his plea hearing, Nassar apologized and compared his crimes to a match that turned into a forest fire.\\n\\nAllegations of a culture of complicity\\n\\nBiles' teammates and others have repeatedly accused USA Gymnastics of complicity in Nassar's abuse. In 2017, the organization said it would implement 70 policy change recommendations from an independent investigator.\\n\\nIn a lawsuit , Maroney said USA Gymnastics paid her to be quiet about the abuse, which she said began when she was 13.\\n\\nUniversity of Oklahoma gymnast Maggie Nichols said she and a coach reported abuse by Nassar to USA Gymnastics in 2015, a few years after Nassar began treating Nichols for a back injury. USA Gymnastics said it hired an independent investigator to look into her allegations.\\n\\nRaisman said she was first treated by Nassar when she was 15. She called for a thorough investigation of a system that she said enabled a monster to thrive for decades by silencing victims.\\n\\nOn Monday, Raisman praised Biles for coming forward and vowed to stand with her.\\n\\nI know we will all get through this together, Raisman said on Twitter\\n\\nIn her statement Monday, Biles said she hoped for the kind of reckoning that would prevent serial predators from striking again.\\n\\nWe need to know why this was able to take place for so long and to so many of us. We need to make sure something like this never happens again.\\n\\nCorrection: Earlier versions of this story incorrectly indicated that Biles was a member of the 2012 Olympic team. She was a member of the 2016 team."}

{"original": "High school students in New Mexico will have to already have their post-graduation plans locked down if a new bill in the state becomes law.\\n\\nStory highlights If measure passes, state would be first in nation to make such a requirement Education policy analyst says while it may get more kids in college, there are pitfalls\\n\\n(CNN) —\\n\\nStudents in New Mexico would have to apply to a college or commit to some other post-graduation plan in order to graduate from high school, under a bill working its way through the state's legislature.\\n\\nIf it became law, New Mexico would be the first state in the nation to require its students to spell out what they're doing after high school.\\n\\nRequiring students to do that would be unique in the nation; no other state in the nation has done that, said Jennifer Zinth, director of high school and STEM for the Education Commission of the States, an education policy think tank based in Colorado.\\n\\nThe bill states that high school juniors would have to file a plan showing they're applying for admission to a college, taking steps to enter the military or preparing for an internship or apprenticeship.\\n\\nThe plan would be filed with the high school principal and the student's parents and guidance counselor would have to sign off on it.\\n\\nNew Mexico, at 71%, has the second-worst high school graduation rate in the country, the Albuquerque Journal reported, citing data from the US Department of Education. The bill's sponsors hope the bill will spur an uptick in that number.\\n\\nBut does requiring students to file such plans really push them to the graduation finish line? Zinth told CNN it may make a positive difference in how many students graduate, but she cautions states need to be aware of unintended consequences and the hurdles it may produce for students and their families.\\n\\nGuidance, matches, financial aid\\n\\nIt's one of those wait and see moments, said Zinth, who wrote about the pros and cons of requiring students to fill out college applications in a report for the Education Commission of the States in 2014. It may work for some students, but there's some things New Mexico would have to think about.\\n\\nZinth said schools in New Mexico and other states considering such a move would need to beef up their guidance counselor staffs and offer students more help in filling out applications, because the applications would probably not be of very high quality without proper guidance.\\n\\nIt would really be beneficial for students to get some assistance on that to make sure the essays are high quality, she said.\\n\\nSchools would also need to make sure that students are properly matched with the college that best suits them. When schools don't pay attention to that, Zinth said, a lot of lower-income students end up in community colleges when they actually are good candidates for competitive, four-year institutions.\\n\\nAnd finally, Zinth said states need to think about financial aid if students are accepted to college.\\n\\nApplications are but one challenge. Completing financial aid applications is the other. Without assistance with financial aid forms, even middle-income students under application-for-all policies may apply and be accepted to institutions they are unable to afford, she wrote in her 2014 report.\\n\\nStarting in 2020, Chicago will require high school students to provide evidence that they have a plan after graduation: either acceptance to college or a gap-year program, a trade apprenticeship, military enlistment or a job offer."}

{"original": "Woodward: Tenet told Bush WMD case a 'slam dunk'\\n\\nSays Bush didn't solicit Rumsfeld, Powell on going to war\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWASHINGTON (CNN) -- About two weeks before deciding to invade Iraq, President Bush was told by CIA Director George Tenet there was a slam dunk case that dictator Saddam Hussein had unconventional weapons, according to a new book by Washington Post journalist Bob Woodward.\\n\\nThat declaration was very important in his decision making, according to Plan of Attack, which is being excerpted this week in The Post.\\n\\nBush also made his decision to go to war without consulting Vice President Dick Cheney, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld or Secretary of State Colin Powell, Woodward's book says.\\n\\nPowell was not even told until after the Saudi ambassador was allowed to review top-secret war plans in an effort to enlist his country's support for the invasion, according to Woodward, who has written or co-written several best-selling books on Washington politics, including All the President's Men with Carl Bernstein.\\n\\nThe book also reports that in the summer of 2002, $700 million was diverted from a congressional appropriation for the war in Afghanistan to develop a war plan for Iraq.\\n\\nWoodward suggests the diversion may have been illegal, and that Congress was deliberately kept in the dark about what had been done.\\n\\nWoodward talked about his book Sunday on CBS's 60 Minutes.\\n\\nThe book is based on interviews with 75 people involved in planning for the war, including Bush, the only source who spoke for attribution.\\n\\nWoodward quotes Bush as saying he did not feel the need to ask his principal advisers, including Cheney, Rumsfeld and Powell, whether they thought he ought to go to war because I could tell what they thought.\\n\\nBut he said he did discuss his thinking with Condoleezza Rice, his national security adviser.\\n\\nI didn't need to ask them their opinion about Saddam Hussein. If you were sitting where I sit, you could be pretty clear. I think we've got an environment where people feel free to express themselves, Bush is quoted as saying.\\n\\nIn the book, Woodward reports that on November 21, 2001 -- about three months after the September 11 attacks and shortly after the Taliban regime crumbled in Afghanistan -- Bush took Rumsfeld aside, ordered him to develop a war plan for Iraq and told him to keep it secret.\\n\\n'The best we've got?'\\n\\nAs the war planning progressed, on December 21, 2002, Tenet and his top deputy, John McLaughlin, went to the White House to brief Bush and Cheney on Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, Woodward reports.\\n\\nThe president, unimpressed by the presentation of satellite photographs and intercepts, pressed Tenet and McLaughlin, saying their information would not convince Joe Public and asking Tenet, This is the best we've got? Woodward reports.\\n\\nAccording to Woodward, Tenet reassured the president that it's a slam dunk case that Saddam had weapons of mass destruction.\\n\\nIn his CBS interview, Woodward said he asked the president about this, and he said it was very important to have the CIA director, 'slam-dunk' is as I interpreted it, a sure thing, guaranteed.\\n\\nAbout two weeks later, shortly after New Year's Day 2003, Bush -- frustrated with unfruitful U.N. weapons inspections -- made up his mind to go to war after consulting with Rice, according to Woodward.\\n\\nShe urged him to act on his stated threat to take military action if Saddam did not provide a full accounting of his weapons of mass destruction, Woodward reports.\\n\\nIf you're going to carry out coercive diplomacy, you have to live with that decision, Rice is quoted as telling Bush.\\n\\nOn Face The Nation Sunday, Rice insisted that Bush's conversation with her in January did not amount to a decision to go to war, which she said wasn't made until March when military strikes were ordered.\\n\\nPart of the relationship between a national security adviser and a president is that the president, in a sense, kind of thinks out loud, if I could put it that way, she said.\\n\\nQuestions about Hans Blix\\n\\nWoodward also reports that U.S. officials were skeptical about the weapons inspections because they were receiving intelligence information indicating that chief U.N. weapons inspector Hans Blix was not reporting everything he had uncovered and was not doing everything he said he was doing.\\n\\nSome of the president's top advisers thought Blix was a liar, according to the book.\\n\\nShortly after the meeting with Rice, Bush told Rumsfeld, Look, we're going to have to do this, I'm afraid, according to the book.\\n\\nSubsequently, on January 11, Rumsfeld, Cheney and Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Richard Myers met in Cheney's office with Prince Bandar, the Saudi ambassador to the United States.\\n\\nAt that meeting, Myers showed Prince Bandar, the Saudi ambassador, a map labeled top secret noforn, meaning that it was not to be seen by any foreign national, Woodward told CBS.\\n\\nThe map outlined the U.S. battle plan for Iraq, which was to begin with an air attack, followed by land invasions moving north from Kuwait and south from Turkey, according to the book.\\n\\nMyers said Sunday on CNN's Late Edition that though he had not read Woodward's book, he was familiar with the account of the meeting, and it was basically correct.\\n\\nAt that time, we were looking for support of our allies and partners in the region. Saudi Arabia's been a strategic partner in the region over a very long time, he said.\\n\\nPowell's skepticism\\n\\nTwo days after the meeting with Bandar, on January 13, Bush met with Powell in the Oval Office to inform his chief diplomat that he had decided to go to war.\\n\\nYou know you're going to be owning this place? Powell is reported as telling Bush, cautioning him that the United States would be assuming the responsibility for the postwar situation.\\n\\nBush told Powell that he understood the ramifications, Woodward said.\\n\\nDespite his reservations about the policy, Powell told the president he would support him, deciding that it would be an unthinkable act of disloyalty to both Bush and U.S. troops to walk away at that point, according to Woodward.\\n\\nIn her interview with Face The Nation, Rice disputed the suggestion that Powell was kept less in the loop than the Saudi ambassador.\\n\\nShe said again that the decision to go to war did not take place until March, well after Bush had informed Powell of his intentions and after his U.N. presentation.\\n\\nThe secretary of state was privy to all of the conversations with the president, all of the briefings for the president, she said.\\n\\nIt's just not the proper impression that somehow Prince Bandar was in the know in a way that Secretary Powell was not."}
{"original": "(CNN) Experienced prosecutors, election lawyers and some public officials have piled on calling for criminal investigations into whether President Donald Trump broke election fraud laws when he pressured Georgia officials on a phone call Saturday to find 11,870 votes that would reverse his loss in the state.\\n\\nWhile the path to a federal criminal case against the outgoing President isn't an easy one to make, Georgia officials said the state could be considering a serious inquiry and the matter has already been referred to the FBI.\\n\\nIf you look at the statutes, both the federal statutes and the Georgia state statutes, if you engage in some effort to solicit or procure election fraud, and you knowingly do that, that's potentially a federal or state crime, Preet Bharara, the former US attorney in Manhattan, said on CNN on Sunday.\\n\\nElie Honig, a former federal prosecutor and CNN contributor, was urging criminal investigation into Trump on Monday, arguing that at some point, prosecutors couldn't keep looking past such shocking statements. The prominent elections law expert Rick Hasen also wrote on Monday that Trump should be prosecuted or at least investigated.\\n\\nProving the President intended to commit a crime is another matter. Trump would likely face a jury if he were charged, and prosecutors would need to prove what he meant on the call.\\n\\nProsecutions of former presidents in the US are unheard of in modern times, and the presidency has immense power that lends protection to Trump. The Justice Department previously shied away from coming close to charging Trump for obstruction in the Mueller investigation and after his call asking Ukraine for political help, which led to the President's impeachment.\\n\\nPresident-elect Joe Biden, who defeated Trump with 306 electoral votes, has indicated he would want the country to move on rather than dwell on scandals from the Trump presidency and would leave decisions up to the Justice Department.\\n\\nCNN has previously reported Trump has explored the possibility of granting himself a self-pardon , though that could only provide him immunity from federal crimes. The Justice Department previously reasoned a president couldn't pardon himself, but could temporarily give power to his vice president to do so -- but there has been no indication that would happen.\\n\\nThe case itself over Trump's pressure to force a fraudulent election result in Georgia, if pursued, would take time, and might depend on the parameters of conspiracy laws.\\n\\nIf Trump actually won the election and was cheated, then proving his intentions to find phantom votes would be a harder task for prosecutors in court, Bharara said, though not impossible.\\n\\nHe was smart enough to get elected, he's smart enough to try to figure out ways to try to undo the election, even if they're not going to amount to anything, Bharara said. And the fact that he is very specific about the number of votes that he needs ... That's a pretty powerful argument that he knows what he's doing.\\n\\nThe President cannot pardon himself from state crimes. New York state has already made public that it's investigating Trump for business-related crimes, making a state charge after Trump leaves the presidency still a possibility on other matters. Trump has not been charged with any crime.\\n\\nJUST WATCHED Keilar fact-checks Trump's phone call on Georgia election results Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Keilar fact-checks Trump's phone call on Georgia election results 10:17\\n\\nCriminal referrals to the FBI\\n\\nTwo Democratic members of the US House, Ted Lieu and Kathleen Rice, wrote to the FBI Director Chris Wray on Monday, asking the agency to open a criminal investigation into the President immediately.\\n\\nThey pointed out federal criminal code that prohibits election fraud or refusing to count valid votes, and Georgia state law that outlines a felony in the state when a person encourages another person into election fraud. That state crime is punishable by imprisonment for not less than one nor more than three years, according to Georgia code.\\n\\nThe FBI confirmed it received the request from the lawmakers and didn't comment further. Criminal referrals about political incendiary moments are relatively common and infrequently result in law enforcement consequences.\\n\\nYet the FBI and Justice Department have been down this road before, following Trump's call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. After Trump asked Ukraine to investigate his then-opponent Biden, the FBI and Justice Department received several criminal referrals from lawmakers and even other parts of the executive branch. But the Justice Department, then led by Attorney General William Barr, quickly shot down opening an investigation into the President, after having departmental staff analyzing the possibility of a campaign finance violation. Congress, instead, picked up the issue, impeaching Trump for abuse of power.\\n\\nA Justice Department spokesman declined to comment on the Georgia call on Monday.\\n\\nSome Republicans on Capitol Hill downplayed Trump's remarks on the call or defended him, though others, like Liz Cheney, who is in the House Republican leadership, said it was deeply troubling.\\n\\nWith 16 days left in his presidential term and the joint session of Congress set for Wednesday to confirm Biden's electoral victory, a quick impeachment is unlikely. However, Democratic Rep. Hank Johnson of Georgia, said he plans to introduce a resolution to censure Trump, a largely symbolic move.\\n\\nGeorgia's response\\n\\nGeorgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger said on Monday that local prosecutors may launch an investigation.\\n\\nI believe that because I had a conversation with the President, also had a conversation with our chief investigator, after we did the signature match audit of Cobb County last week, there may be a conflict of interest, Raffensperger said in an interview with ABC's Good Morning America. I understand that the Fulton County District Attorney wants to look at [it], maybe that's the appropriate venue for it to go.\\n\\nThe Fulton County District Attorney Fani T. Willis said in a statement on Monday that she found the phone call with Trump and Raffensperger disturbing and had a received a request to investigate Trump's actions already.\\n\\nIt is my understanding from news reports that a member of the State Election Board has requested that the Secretary's Elections Division investigate the call, after which the Board can refer the case to my office and the state Attorney General, Willis said. I will enforce the law without fear or favor ... Once the investigation is complete, this matter, like all matters, will be handled by our office based on the facts and the law.\\n\\nRaffensperger also said during the interview that he did not feel pressured by Trump when he asked him to recalculate the votes that put Biden as the winner in Georgia.\\n\\nJUST WATCHED Lawmaker's message to fellow Republicans after Trump call Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Lawmaker's message to fellow Republicans after Trump call 02:53\\n\\nWhen asked what he was thinking and feeling during the call, Raffensperger said for the last two months we've been fighting a rumor Whac-a-Mole ... We believe that truth matters.\\n\\nIn the election law realm, some experts say if there is criminal fallout for Trump, it will take time. Political fallout, however, is immediate -- and, unusually, can be gauged by the upcoming runoff election for two Senate seats from Georgia. Those elections will decide the majority party in the US Senate.\\n\\nOur advice is always don't try to make up or steal votes, Ben Ginsberg, a longtime election lawyer for Republicans and CNN contributor, said on Monday.\\n\\nPolitically, what Trump said is beyond the pale, beyond norms, beyond common decency, if not beyond the law.\\n\\nBecause Raffensperger, an elected Republican, clearly refused what Trump was suggesting he do, Ginsberg said, that may set the situation up for Trump to face heavier political fallout.\\n\\nThe political damage will be far greater than any legal damage since he's leaving office in 16 days, and investigations take time. You'll know the answer Tuesday night in Georgia and Wednesday in the votes on the Electoral College, Ginsberg added.\\n\\nAnd while Trump may not face legal jeopardy, lawyer Cleta Mitchell, who participated on the President's behalf on the call, already is under scrutiny for her role in the call.\\n\\nThe large national law firm affiliated with Mitchell distanced itself from her -- an indication that Trump's request was abhorrent even in the usually reticent and politically tolerant legal industry.\\n\\nOur policy did allow our attorneys to participate in observing election recounts and similar actions on a voluntary basis in their individual capacity as private citizens so long as they did not act as legal advisers. We are aware of, and are concerned by, Ms. Mitchell's participation in the January 2 conference call and are working to understand her involvement more thoroughly, Dan Farrell, a spokesman for the law firm Foley & Lardner where Mitchell, who's long pushed unsubstantiated allegations of fraud in elections, is a partner.\\n\\nMitchell did not respond to an inquiry from CNN.\\n\\nCORRECTION: An earlier version of this story misidentified the chamber of Congress Rep. Liz Cheney serves in. She is the House Republican Conference Chair, a member of the House Republican leadership."}

{"original": "Story highlights Obama pushed for European unity in a speech Monday You see increasing intolerance in our politics, Obama said\\n\\n(CNN) —\\n\\nPresident Barack Obama made a lengthy, personal plea for European unity Monday as the continent faces an uncertain future, casting a fractured union as catastrophic to global markets and stability.\\n\\nBook-ending his landmark speech here eight years ago, which then-candidate Obama used to promote a reset in transatlantic ties, the President Monday said the same political forces he's attempted to combat in the United States threatened Europe. He said that in the years since he addressed Berliners in 2008, economic woes had worsened.\\n\\nIn the vacuum, if we do not solve these problems, you start seeing those who would try to exploit these fears and frustrations and channel them in a destructive way, Obama said, describing a creeping emergence of the kind of politics that the European project was founded to reject, an 'us' versus 'them' mentality that tries to blame our problems on the other.\\n\\nREAD: Obama announces an additional 250 special operations forces in Syria\\n\\nDescribing political trends, Obama cast what's happening in European countries in markedly similar terms to his analysis of his own country's political debate.\\n\\nYou see increasing intolerance in our politics, Obama said. And loud voices get the most attention.\\n\\nObama was visiting Europe as a series of global threats cause major strains in the bonds between the continent's nations. Terrorists have struck capitals in Belgium and France, leading to fears that further attacks are coming. Economic instability has led to slow growth and widespread unemployment. And aggression from Russia has spurred anxiety that traditional defense alliances are proving ineffective.\\n\\nThose challenges are prompting some in the European Union to question its purpose, causing anxiety among U.S. officials who rely on the bloc in global negotiations. Before his stop in Germany, Obama made a stop in London to actively urge residents there to reject an exit from the EU.\\n\\nIn Hannover, where he's met for talks with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and toured an industrial trade fair, Obama broadened his message, saying that countries within Europe are better off together than apart.\\n\\nThis is a defining moment. What happens here has consequences for people around the globe, Obama said. I've come here today, to the heart of Europe, to say the United States, and the entire world, needs a strong and prosperous and democratic and united Europe.\\n\\nObama later sat for talks with the leaders of Europe's largest countries to reiterate his calls for greater unity among their nations. In his speech, he said that European nations must commit more to going after ISIS, and to ramp up their defenses against attacks at home.\\n\\nThis remains a difficult fight and none of us can solve this problem by ourselves. Even as European countries make contributions to ISIL, Europe and NATO can still do more, he said, using a different acronym for ISIS.\\n\\nLater, urging European countries to increase their defense spending to meet NATO requirements, Obama chided leaders for becoming over reliant on the United States for their own security.\\n\\nI'll be honest, sometimes Europe has been complacent about its own defense, he said.\\n\\nObama's speech in Germany came eight years after his 2008 speech to a 200,000-strong crowd in Berlin that greeted him rapturously. But the Europe Obama addresses now is starkly different. Eight years ago, amid descriptions of old-versus-new Europe, many on the continent were wondering about their relevance. Today, Europe is questioning its very survival.\\n\\nIt's a very different Europe, one that's facing truly existential crises, with the future of the EU hanging in the balance, Russia's resurgence and a threat from within from jihadis as well as an economic crisis, said Derek Chollet, a senior adviser for security and defense policy at the German Marshall Fund.\\n\\nIt's a Europe that's wondering about its own future and is looking to the United States for help and support, Chollet said.\\n\\nIn that light, Obama's choice to visit both the United Kingdom and Germany reflects an effort to support Europe and its unity – perhaps a much more weighty mission than the official agenda of discussions on ISIS, counterterrorism, trade and other challenges, analysts said.\\n\\nA UK departure would be a blow to the EU and Obama made clear before he even arrived in London that the U.S. would prefer Britain to stay within the Union. As the closest U.S. ally, the UK inside the EU can influence debates on economic and foreign policy and has added value to Washington in that position.\\n\\nThe U.S. has a stake in the Brexit debate and vote because we want our No. 1 ally at the table, in the club, said Evelyn Farkas, a former deputy assistant secretary of defense who is now a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council.\\n\\nGermany, said Karen Donfried, president of the German Marshall Fund, is the most consequential country in the union, while Merkel, with whom Obama is very close, is weaker than she's ever been politically.\\n\\nIf President Obama wanted to do something to support the European project, which every U.S. administration has supported since the end of World War II, there are no more critical stops that he could make than in Britain and Germany, Donfried said.\\n\\nEven Obama's trade-focused events in Germany have a subtext that's related to the debate over Europe's future, says Daniella Schwarzer, director of the Europe program at the German Marshall Fund's Berlin office.\\n\\nThere's a very politicized debate about TTIP going on right now, Schwarzer said, referring to Obama's proposed transatlantic trade deals. While Germany is traditionally very supportive of trade agreements, at this time we have a very strong and politicized debate that is as much about trade as it is about the legitimacy of the European Union."}
{"original": "(CNN) Welcome to CNN's fact check coverage of the tenth Democratic presidential debate from Charleston, South Carolina, ahead of the state's primary on Saturday.\\n\\nVermont Sen. Bernie Sanders , the current front-runner after winning the Nevada caucus, faced attacks over his recent defense of some of the actions of Fidel Castro following the 1959 Cuban Revolution. Sanders also had to defend his recently released plan to pay for his legislative proposals such as Medicare for All, free college, and various debt forgiveness ideas.\\n\\nThe debate was also a chance for former New York Mayor Mike Bloomberg to bounce back from a rough performance in last week's debate, when he faced criticism over sexist comments he allegedly made in the early 1990s.\\n\\nBloomberg hits Sanders over Russian meddling\\n\\nIn an early exchange during Tuesday night's Democratic presidential debate, Bloomberg told Sanders that (Russian President) Vladimir Putin thinks that Donald Trump should be President of the United States, and that's why Russia is helping you get elected.\\n\\nSanders tried to fend off the attacks by condemning Russian meddling in the 2016 election and warning Putin that he wouldn't be a Russia-friendly president.\\n\\nFacts First: Bloomberg accurately pointed to a US intelligence community belief that Russia is trying to help Sanders' campaign. Russia also backed Sanders in the 2016 primary, but Sanders has publicly denounced Russian interference in US politics.\\n\\nSanders acknowledged last week that US intelligence officials had informed his team that Russia was trying to help his campaign. It's not clear what Russians are doing to help Sanders, and there haven't yet been any sweeping hack-and-leak operations like the cyberattacks that hit the Democratic National Committee during the 2016 presidential campaign.\\n\\nUS intelligence leaders have said that Russia routinely tries to sow discord among the American public and amplify voices on the extremes of the political spectrum, to inflame divisions and undermine the stability of American democracy. Their past support for Sanders and Trump, who have both antagonized their own parties, fits into this big-picture strategy.\\n\\nSeparately, a senior US intelligence official, Shelby Pierson, told lawmakers earlier this month in a classified briefing that Russia was taking steps to help Trump win reelection. CNN later reported that Pierson appears to have overstated the formal assessments from the US intelligence community, and senior White House officials rebutted her comments.\\n\\nThe Russian government, at Putin's direction, undertook an extensive campaign in 2016 to boost Sanders' primary campaign against former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, and to help Trump defeat Clinton in the general election. The Kremlin operation included well-funded troll farms, propaganda on social media, cyberattacks and leaks of private emails.\\n\\n-- Marshall Cohen\\n\\nBloomberg on stop and frisk\\n\\nAddressing his history with the controversial stop and frisk policy, Mike Bloomberg claimed the number of incidents decreased by 95% while he was mayor of New York.\\n\\nBloomberg said, We let it get out of control and when I realized that, I cut it back by 95%. And I've apologized and asked for forgiveness. I've met with black leaders to try to get an understanding of how I can better position myself and what I should have done and what I should do next time.\\n\\nFacts First: Bloomberg was misleading by omission, as he has been Bloomberg was misleading by omission, as he has been before , when he cited a 95% decline in stop and frisk. While there was such a reduction , it happened only during the last two years of his 12-year mayoralty, from the first quarter of 2012 to the last quarter of 2013, following a 605% increase in his first 10 years. Looking at his entire mayoralty, from 2002 through 2013, there was a 97% increase , not a decrease.\\n\\nBloomberg also claimed the 95% was prompted by his realization that the situation was out of control. He does not mention that the decline began right around the time a federal judge signaled she would rule against stop and frisk, nor that he continued to be a vocal defender of stop and frisk for years after his professed realization about the harms of the policy.\\n\\nYou can read more about Bloomberg's history with stop and frisk here\\n\\n-- Tara Subramaniam and Daniel Dale\\n\\nBloomberg's previous support of Republicans\\n\\nMassachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren said former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg previously supported Republican candidates.\\n\\nWe're here in Charleston, and you know who is going to be in Charleston later this week? It's Donald Trump, Warren said. He's going to be here to raise money for his buddy, Senator Lindsey Graham. Who funded Lindsey Graham's campaign for reelection last time? It was Mayor Bloomberg. And that's not the only right-wing senator that mayor Bloomberg has funded.\\n\\nIn 2016, he dumped $12 million into the Pennsylvania senate race to help reelect an anti-choice, right-wing Republican senator, Warren added. And I just want to say, the woman challenger was terrific. She lost by a single point. In 2012, he scooped in to try to defend another Republican senator against a woman challenger. That was me. It didn't work, but he tried hard.\\n\\nFacts First: This is true. Bloomberg supported Republican Pennsylvania Sen. Pat Toomey's re-election in 2016. He supported Scott Brown in his losing effort against Warren in 2012. In 2014, Bloomberg gave money to a super-PAC supporting Lindsey Graham.\\n\\nBloomberg spent nearly $12 million in 2016 to support the reelection of Republican Sen. Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania, an ally of his on the issue of background checks on gun purchases. The New York Times also reported in November he supported Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina in 2014.\\n\\nIn 2012, Bloomberg supported Brown over Warren, saying on his radio program as mayor he supported Brown because of Brown's stance against requiring states to recognize concealed carry laws from other states.\\n\\nTonight, Bloomberg called such attacks a side show and not relevant to his record as mayor.\\n\\n--Andrew Kaczynski\\n\\nSanders encouraged a primary challenge to Obama\\n\\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden said Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders encouraged a primary challenge to President Barack Obama in 2012.\\n\\nHe said we should primary Barack Obama, Biden said. Someone should.\\n\\nFacts First: This is true. Sanders said on a radio show in July 2011 that a primary challenge to Obama would do a good deal of service to the country.\\n\\nSo my suggestion is, I think one of the reasons the president has been able to move so far to the right is that there is no primary opposition to him, and I think it would do this country a good deal of service if people started thinking about candidates out there to begin contrasting what is a progressive agenda as opposed to what Obama is doing, Sanders said on the Thom Hartmann Show in July 2011.\\n\\nI think one of the reasons that President Obama has moved as far to the right as he has is he thinks he can go all the way and no one will stand up to him, Sanders added.\\n\\nOn WNYC in March 2011, Sanders said a primary challenge to Obama would enliven the debate.\\n\\nI'm not a Democrat, he said. I'm the longest-serving Independent. I think if a progressive Democrat wants to run, I think it would enliven the debate, raise some issues and people have a right to do that.\\n\\nSanders went on to endorse Obama in 2012.\\n\\n--Andrew Kaczynski\\n\\nKlobuchar criticizes Sanders' 'Medicare for All' plan\\n\\nKlobuchar claimed on Tuesday that Sanders'  'Medicare For All' plan alone, on page 8, clearly says that it will kick 149 million Americans off their current health insurance in four years.\\n\\nFacts First: While Page 8 of Sanders' While Page 8 of Sanders' bill does not specifically mention the figure cited by Klobuchar, it states that it shall be unlawful for ... a private health insurer to sell health insurance coverage that duplicates the benefits provided under this Act. And the Klobuchar's figure is close to the latest number provided by one study. Some 153 million people are covered by private plans sponsored by their employers, according to the latest report from the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation.\\n\\nThere are also tens of millions more who are covered by private plans through Medicare Advantage, Medicaid managed care plans and on the Obamacare individual market.\\n\\nAll these people would have to change their health care under Sanders' Medicare for All plan — but they would be covered by the federal plan instead.\\n\\n-- Tami Luhby and Caroline Kelly\\n\\nSanders on Medicare for All health spending\\n\\nSanders defended his sweeping plan to overhaul America's health insurance system, saying Medicare for All will reduce the nation's health care price tag.\\n\\nWhat every study out there, conservative or progressive says, Medicare For All will save money, said Sanders, who came under fire for the cost of his proposal, which has been pegged at more than $30 trillion over a decade.\\n\\nFacts First: Although Sanders is correct that several studies have found Medicare for All would reduce health care spending, at least one study published last year found the opposite.\\n\\nreport from the left-leaning Urban Institute Health Policy Center showed that the nation's overall health care spending would rise by roughly $7 trillion to $59 trillion over a decade if Medicare for All goes into effect. The increase would be $720 billion for 2020 alone if the policy were enacted.\\n\\nThat's because more people would be insured, more benefits would be covered and more medical services would be used since there'd be no cost for care.\\n\\nYou will in total spend more as a nation on health care from adding all the bells and whistles that are associated with these kinds of proposals, Linda Blumberg, institute fellow, said when the study was published last October.\\n\\n-- Tami Luhby\\n\\nKlobuchar on the ineffectiveness of Warren and Sanders\\n\\nKlobuchar claimed during Tuesday's Democratic debate that a Vanderbilt University study ranked her as the most effective Democrat in the Senate and that two of her competitors for the Democratic nomination, Sens. Warren and Sanders, ranked among the bottom half of the list.\\n\\nFacts First: Klobuchar is right about herself. She did rank among the most effective members of the Senate and first among Democrats, according to that study. She's also right that Warren ranked among the bottom half of Democrats. Her characterization of Sanders' ineffectiveness within the Democratic Party, though, requires clarification.\\n\\nKlobuchar said during the debate in South Carolina that according to Vanderbilt University in Tennessee, last Congress, I was the most effective Democrat in the US Senate on 15 metrics. Bernie and Elizabeth were in the bottom half. It matters -- it matters if you can actually get things done.\\n\\nThe Center for Effective Lawmaking at Vanderbilt evaluates the effectiveness of members of Congress and according to their evaluation of the 115th Congress (2017-2019), Klobuchar ranked as the most effective Democrat in the Senate.\\n\\nWhat Vanderbilt calls the Legislative Effectiveness Score is based on 15 metrics that take into account the number of bills a legislator sponsors, how far each of those bills advances through the legislative process from introduction to (possibly) becoming law and its relative substantive significance. The average Legislative Effectiveness Score is 1.0.\\n\\nKlobuchar has a score of 2.815, ranking first among the 48 Democrats in the Senate during that time. And Warren has a score of .548 and ranks 32nd out of 48 Democrats in the Senate.\\n\\nSanders caucuses with Democrats, but since he is elected as an independent in Congress, he was not ranked among those within the party as Klobuchar suggested. Sanders has a score of .159.\\n\\nSanders' and Warren's rankings are below 1.0, the average among all members of Congress.\\n\\n-- Maegan Vazquez\\n\\nSanders on the wealth of billionaires\\n\\nEarly in the debate, Sanders used an inaccurate figure that had been provided to his campaign by a progressive think tank that, among other things, keeps track of the fortunes of billionaires.\\n\\nIn the last three years, last three years, billionaires in this country saw an $850 billion increase in their wealth, Sanders said.\\n\\nFacts First: The think tank that provided the figure says it is wrong, and says it takes responsibility for the error.\\n\\nSanders was relying on a figure from the Institute for Policy Studies, according to the think tank senior scholar Chuck Collins but the number was inflated. We informed Senator Sanders that US billionaires increased their wealth since Trump's election by $850 billion. Our updated number is $710 billion, an increase of 30 percent, Collins told CNN during the debate.\\n\\nSenator Sanders was accurately using information that we provided, so we at Institute for Policy Studies are responsible for the error, Collins added.\\n\\nHe said that in 2016, there were 541 US billionaires with wealth totaling about $2.4 trillion. In 2019, he said, there were 607 US billionaires with wealth totaling about $3.1 trillion.\\n\\nCollins said he informed the Sanders campaign on Tuesday morning that there had been an error, after CNN contacted the campaign to ask for the source for the $850 billion number. It is not clear, though, whether Sanders himself was informed of the error prior to the debate.\\n\\nThere is no doubt that the wealthiest Americans have gotten wealthier under Trump, though others have also gained.\\n\\nAccording to the Federal Reserve , the combined wealth of the top 1% of American households increased 18% from the fourth quarter of 2016 to the third quarter of 2019 -- from $29.18 to $34.53 trillion. The combined wealth of the bottom 50% of households increased 55%, but from a much smaller starting point -- from $1.08 trillion to $1.67 trillion -- and spread out across many more households.\\n\\n-- Daniel Dale\\n\\nBloomberg takes on Trump's coronavirus response\\n\\nBloomberg on Tuesday took a swing at President Donald Trump when the debate turned to the deadly coronavirus, which is spreading around the world and sparked a massive selloff this week in the stock market.\\n\\nThe President fired the pandemic specialist in this country two years ago, Bloomberg said. So, there's nobody here to figure out what the hell we should be doing. And he's defunded (the) Centers for Disease Control (and Prevention), CDC, so we don't have the organization we need.\\n\\nFacts First: Bloomberg's statement is mostly accurate. The Trump administration eliminated key White House positions that handled global health issues, and, while it didn't fully defund the CDC, the administration did cut funding to the federal agency.\\n\\nCNN reported last month that the Trump administration's response to coronavirus was being coordinated by the White House's National Security Council. But the NSC does not currently have a person dedicated to overseeing global health issues. That position was restructured in 2018, and a current official with a similar purview has less authority than the former official.\\n\\nA Foreign Policy report late last month stated that the United States has never been less prepared for a pandemic, primarily because the Trump White House fired the entire chain-of-command that handled responses to pandemics.\\n\\nThe Trump administration did make cuts to the CDC, which specifically hit epidemic prevention activities when they were imposed in 2018. Because of those reductions, the CDC dramatically reduced the number of countries where its staff works to prevent, detect and respond to infectious disease threats.\\n\\nDuring the debate, Trump tweeted that the CDC and my Administration are doing a GREAT job of handling Coronavirus, and attacked Democrats for criticizing his response to the virus.\\n\\n-- Marshall Cohen\\n\\nBiden's attacks Sanders over gun control votes\\n\\nBiden said that Sanders voted against the so-called Brady Bill, a key piece of gun control legislation which ultimately passed in 1993 after a long debate that included whether to extend waiting periods for gun purchases.\\n\\nAccording to Biden, longer waiting periods would have prevented mass shooter Dylann Roof from obtaining the weapon he used to murder nine people at Charleston's historically black Mother Emanuel AME Church in 2015.\\n\\nBernie voted five times against the Brady Bill, Biden said.\\n\\nI'm not saying he's responsible for the nine deaths, but that man would not have been able to get that weapon, Biden said.\\n\\nFacts First: It's true that Sanders It's true that Sanders voted against the Brady Bill five times , but it's unclear how a longer waiting period would have prevented Roof from purchasing the firearm.\\n\\nSanders voted against versions of the Brady Bill that included seven - and five -day waiting periods for purchasing firearms.\\n\\nRoof, who was not legally allowed to purchase a firearm due to a pending illegal drug possession case, was able to buy a handgun because the database that was supposed to flag Roof's pending case, the National Instant Criminal Background Check System managed by the FBI, didn't include the pending case details. Due to a clerical error, the information was never submitted to that database.\\n\\nRoof's background check took longer than three days to complete and so the gun shop owner was allowed to sell him the gun after the three days passed. Because this error wasn't discovered until after the shooting, when the FBI began investigating Roof, it's unclear how a longer waiting period would have prevented Roof from passing the background check.\\n\\n-- Holmes Lybrand\\n\\nBiden and Klobuchar on who wrote the bill\\n\\nDuring the debate, Biden and Klobuchar argued over who authored gun control legislation aimed at protecting women.\\n\\nI am the author of the bill to close the boyfriend loophole that says that domestic abusers can't go out and get an ak-47, Klobuchar said.\\n\\nI wrote that law, Biden replied.\\n\\nYou didn't write that bill, Klobuchar said.\\n\\nI did, Biden reiterated.\\n\\nFacts First: Klobuchar and Biden are talking about two different pieces of legislation.\\n\\nKlobuchar has introduced legislation that would make it legally clear that dating or more casual partners who were convicted of a misdemeanor for domestic violence (as well as convicted stalkers) would not be allowed to own a firearm.\\n\\nAs a senator, Biden sponsored the Violence Against Women Act, legislation that aimed, in part, at improving how prosecutors and police worked to combat domestic violence. As a White House memo in 2014 describes, The bill established new federal crimes of interstate domestic violence and stalking, doubled penalties for repeat sex offenders, and sparked the passage of laws at the state level to protect victims.\\n\\n-- Holmes Lybrand\\n\\nBiden on gun deaths claim\\n\\nIn a back-and-forth with Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders about gun control, Biden said, 150 million people have been killed since 2007 when Bernie voted to exempt the gun manufacturers from liability.\\n\\nHe added, More than all the wars, including Vietnam, from that point on. Carnage on our streets.\\n\\nFacts First: Biden's number is incorrect. When CNN asked about it, his campaign said he misspoke. He's also wrong about when the vote occurred. It was 2005, not 2007. Fewer than half a million people in the US have died by gun violence since 2005 -- but he's correct that it's more than the number of military casualties since the Vietnam conflict.\\n\\nData from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows that 474,993 people died because of a firearm injury between 2005 and 2018, the latest data available. That it includes intentional and unintentional deaths.\\n\\nA spokesperson for the campaign said that Biden meant to say 150,000 -- and was referring to the number of homicides. That number checks out, if you're counting from 2007 . But the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says there were 173,325 homicides committed with firearms between 2005 and 2018.\\n\\nWhether you count homicides only, or all deaths, more people have died from gun violence since 2007 than military deaths in US wars since the Vietnam Conflict began in 1964. A Congressional Research Service report said 67,000 military members were killed in wars since then.\\n\\n-- Katie Lobosco\\n\\nSanders on his past comments about Cuba\\n\\nOn Tuesday night, Sanders had to defend his numerous comments praising elements of the Cuban communist regime, which have recently gained attention following a 60 Minutes interview and a CNN townhall. Sanders said that while he has admired aspects of the Cuban revolution, he has also condemned authoritarianism in the country.\\n\\nI have opposed authoritarianism all over the world, Sanders said, likening his comments on Cuba to comments made by then-President Barack Obama.\\n\\nOf course you have a dictatorship in Cuba, he added. What I said is what Barack Obama said in terms of Cuba, that Cuba made progress on education. What Barack Obama said was they made great progress on education and healthcare. That was Barack Obama.\\n\\nBiden shot back at Sanders, saying that Obama did not praise the Cuban government. Biden then accused Sanders of not condemning the Cuban government.\\n\\nThis man said that, in fact, he thought it was -- he did not condemn what they did, Biden said.\\n\\nThat is untrue, categorically untrue, Sanders responded.\\n\\nFacts First: Sanders is correct that he has condemned authoritarianism in Cuba, but over nearly four decades, he has also repeatedly praised aspects of Cuban society. President Obama did as well as part of his effort to open relations between the US and the communist island.\\n\\nFirst, here's what President Obama said about Cuba in March 2016.\\n\\nAnd I said this to President (Raul) Castro in Cuba. I said, look, you've made great progress in educating young people. Every child in Cuba gets a basic education-- that's a huge improvement from where it was. Medical care -- the life expectancy of Cubans is equivalent to the United States, despite it being a very poor country, because they have access to health care. That's a huge achievement. They should be congratulated.\\n\\nIn an interview from the 1980s, Sanders argued that the longevity of the Castro regime was not solely due to its repressive tactics, but a genuine base of support in Cuba.\\n\\nYou may recall way back in, when was it,1961 they invaded Cuba and the, everybody was totally convinced the Castro was the worst guy in the world. All the Cuban people were going to rise up in rebellion against Fidel Castro, Sanders said, discussing the logic behind the Kennedy administration's failed Bay of Pigs coup. They had forgotten that he educated the kids, gave them health care, totally transformed the society.\\n\\nIn 1989, according to the Burlington Free Press, Sanders criticized the one-party regime and censorship of the press in the country, but also praised other aspects of the country.\\n\\nUnder (Cuban leader Fidel) Castro, enormous progress has been made in improving the lives of the poor people (and) of the working people, Sanders said. On the other hand, in terms of democratic rights, there are enormous deficiencies.\\n\\nAs a third-party candidate for Vermont governor in 1976, Sanders scoffed at the idea the type of socialism he supported was similar to authoritarianism in China, Cuba, and Russia.\\n\\nWe live in Vermont, not in Cuba, China or Russia, Sanders said . We have to do what we can to meet the needs of the people here. Anyone who says I'm following Mao's method, or Cuba's or Russia's is a lunatic.\\n\\n-- Andrew Kaczynski"}

More than 30 million primary and secondary school age students will be encouraged to play regularly.\\n\\nAnd at the other end of the scale, two to three professional clubs should be dominating Asian competitions in the next four years, according to the National Development and Reform Commission's vision, with the Chinese Super League (CSL) expanding its appeal worldwide.\\n\\nIn recent months, several top Chinese clubs have invested tens of millions of dollars on importing top foreign talent, including Guangzhou Evergrande, who recently paid $45.8 million to sign Atletico Madrid striker Jackson Martinez – a record transfer price for the burgeoning league.\\n\\nLong-term ambitions\\n\\nThe recent spending lies in part with a policy led by Chinese President Xi Jinping of putting cash to work in the league, with an eye to winning a World Cup bid and one day winning the tournament.\\n\\nSo far, China's brief spotlight on the international stage stood at the 2002 World Cup, where the team failed to score a single goal. The tournament was hosted by regional neighbors South Korea and Japan – countries that have advanced far ahead of China in soccer terms.\\n\\nExclusive: Inside China's $185M football factory\\n\\nThe next phase of the development plan involves creating one pitch for every 10,000 people by 2030, with the men's national team becoming a super power in Asia, and their female counterparts turned into one of the leading teams in the world.\\n\\nChina's women are currently ranked the 12th best team in the world by soccer's governing body FIFA, with the men's team languishing in 81st place.\\n\\nBy 2050, the plan envisions a complete turnaround in fortunes, with China transformed into a world soccer powerhouse, while contributing greatly to the game's international growth and realizing the 'soccer dream' for the entire nation.\\n\\nRepairing reputation\\n\\nDogged by poor performances on the pitch and corruption scandals off it, the professional Chinese game has been far from beautiful.

{"original": "Washington (CNN) Republican Sen. Josh Hawley threw a political grenade into Washington last week when he announced his intentions to object when Congress counts the Electoral College votes on Wednesday -- a move that pits the youngest senator against Senate GOP leadership as well as some rank-and-file members who will now have to cast a highly consequential vote as a result of his decision.\\n\\nHawley, 41, who was elected to represent Missouri in 2018 and is widely believed to have higher political ambitions, became the first senator to announce plans to object to the election results -- a significant development since both a House member and a senator are required to mount an objection when Congress counts the electoral votes.\\n\\nThough his objection won't change the outcome of the election and will only delay the inevitable affirmation of President-elect Joe Biden's victory over President Donald Trump, his commitment to Trump's baseless crusade to challenge the election represents perhaps his most significant political maneuvering since coming to the Senate two years ago.\\n\\nHe was one of just seven GOP senators who voted against overriding Trump's veto of a defense policy bill last week. He was also the rare GOP senator to initially join with Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders in calling for higher stimulus check payments to Americans -- a caused vocally championed by Trump, but scorned by GOP leadership, who killed Democratic efforts to bring legislation for $2,000 checks to the floor before the clock ran out on the 116th Congress.\\n\\nOn the election issue, though, Hawley is ensuring that one of the first votes his GOP colleagues will take in the 117th Congress will be one that follows them for their political careers. They'll have to choose between siding with Trump and his base or with the popular will of the voters, which could come back to haunt them in future elections no matter how they vote.\\n\\nAlready, Hawley's decision has provoked the ire of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell , who pressed the Missouri Republican to explain his rationale on a Senate GOP conference call last week, though the junior senator wasn't dialed in. And by Sunday, a number of Republican senators had publicly opposed it, including several moderate Republicans and Sen. John Cornyn, a Texas Republican in Senate GOP leadership.\\n\\nBut none of the pushback seems to have changed Hawley's mind: on Sunday he was still reviewing how many states he might object to and whether he will object to more than just Pennsylvania, according to a source familiar with his thinking.\\n\\nA play for 2024?\\n\\nAsked by CNN in November if a 2024 presidential run was in the cards, Hawley said flatly: It's not.\\n\\nBut his early commitment to object to Biden's Electoral College win represents a clear bet from Hawley that the President will continue to hold considerable influence over the Republican electorate in the coming years.\\n\\nTrump, even after he leaves office, will retain his Twitter account -- and with it, the potential to become a GOP kingmaker.\\n\\nAnd Hawley's political ambitions were already tied to Trump before the 2020 election. In 2018, when he defeated Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill, he ran his Senate campaign as a self-proclaimed champion of the President's agenda who could help deliver conservative Supreme Court picks.\\n\\nVice President Mike Pence was among the Republicans who in 2017 pushed Hawley, a former Supreme Court clerk, to leave his post as Missouri attorney general, to which he had just been elected the year before, to run for Senate.\\n\\nBut while Hawley's efforts to challenge the 2020 presidential election results are sure to cement him in Trump's good graces for the time-being, he's helped unleash a public rift in the Republican party that also risks alienating him from congressional allies and harming any future presidential ambitions.\\n\\nGOP lawmakers have openly criticized their colleagues in recent days, as a divide emerges in the GOP over whether to follow Hawley or stand against what even Trump supporters have acknowledged is a futile effort.\\n\\nI'm concerned about the division in America, that's the biggest issue, but obviously this is not healthy for the Republican Party either, said Sen. Ben Sasse of Nebraska, who has been critical of Trump's false election claims. What's good for America is the main question here, but this is bad for the country and bad for the party.\\n\\nRepublican Liz Cheney, the No. 3 House Republican , has also pushed back. She sent a 21-page memo to Republicans Sunday outlining why she believes objecting to the Electoral College count is unconstitutional and an exceptionally dangerous precedent.\\n\\nHawley, though, has only leaned further into his stance, tweeting Saturday: It's time to STAND UP.\\n\\nSo true, Trump tweeted in return. Thanks Josh!\\n\\nAnd on Sunday, Hawley sent out a fundraising email saying he will not bow down to career politicians in Washington and asking for Americans to join him and donate.\\n\\nMissouri attorney general\\n\\nBefore entering the national political arena, Hawley was Missouri's attorney general from 2017 to 2019, a role that served as a spring board for his larger ambitions even as it brought some controversy.\\n\\nHawley touts on his Senate website that he used his role as attorney general to fight the Washington overreach threatening farms and family businesses.\\n\\nHe had garnered wide-spread attention in 2018 when he accused then-Missouri Gov. Eric Greitens, a Republican, of obtaining a charity donor list without permission . If proven, these acts could amount to the unauthorized taking and use of property -- in this case electronic property. Under Missouri law, this is known as computer tampering and given the value of the list in question, it is a felony, Hawley said at the time.\\n\\nGreitens ultimately resigned as governor -- something Hawley called the right thing to do at the time.\\n\\nIn another high-profile case, Hawley sued the owners and operators of a duck boat that sank on a lake near Branson, Missouri, and killed 17 people, saying they had been aware of safety hazards but their own profits were their priority. A National Transportation Safety Board probe ultimately found a systemic problem with the company as a whole.\\n\\nBut his tenure as attorney general also brought scrutiny. He faced fierce criticism for a December 2017 speech in which he blamed the sexual revolution for human trafficking. The sexual revolution has led to exploitation of women on a scale that we would never have imagined, he said in a speech to Christian pastors at an event hosted by the Missouri Renewal Project.\\n\\nYou know what I'm talking about, the 1960s, 1970s, it became commonplace in our culture among our cultural elites, Hollywood, and the media to talk about -- to denigrate the biblical truth about husband and wife, man and woman, Hawley said.\\n\\nHe argued that there's a human trafficking crisis because our culture has completely lost its way.\\n\\nWe must also deliver a message to our culture that the false gospel of 'anything goes' ends in this road of slavery, Hawley added.\\n\\nA spokeswoman for Hawley's campaign stood by the candidate's remarks when asked for comment at the time, adding that he had aggressively cracked down on sex trafficking since he took office as attorney general.\\n\\nVocal tech critic\\n\\nHawley's tenure in Congress has been defined by his role as a vocal tech critic eager to impose consequences on Silicon Valley over its dominance in the global economy.\\n\\nHe's railed against Section 230, a law that shields internet companies from being liable for what is posted on their websites by them or third parties, which is a grievance Trump shares. The President delivered on his promise to veto the National Defense Authorization Act because it did not repeal Section 230, and in a bipartisan rebuke, the Senate overrode that veto last week -- the first successful override of Trump's presidency.\\n\\nBut Hawley joined with six other GOP senators in voting to let Trump's veto of the defense bill stand.\\n\\nIn October, Hawley sent letters to Facebook and Twitter characterizing some of the companies' content moderation decisions as an illegal campaign contribution benefiting Biden. And in November, he targeted Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg with a misleading line of questioning during a Senate Judiciary Committee session.\\n\\nHawley repeatedly asked Zuckerberg if Facebook coordinates with YouTube and Twitter for censorship and to control information, citing information he had obtained from a whistleblower.\\n\\nIt is well-known that social media companies do communicate with each other on issues related to foreign meddling, terrorism and other topics. But Hawley tried to deceptively characterize the practice of Facebook communicating with its peers as nefarious and implied that the coordination was a major revelation\\n\\nDuring his first year in the Senate, Hawley even introduced a bill aimed at fighting social media addiction.\\n\\nBig tech has embraced a business model of addiction. Too much of the 'innovation' in this space is designed not to create better products, but to capture more attention by using psychological tricks that make it difficult to look away, Hawley said in a news release at the time.\\n\\nThis legislation will put an end to that and encourage true innovation by tech companies."}

But it's not something lawmakers are going to green-light easily.\\n\\nOn Tuesday, state legislators discussed who would be eligible, how much it would cost taxpayers, and if it a tuition-free policy is the best way to make college more affordable for New York families.\\n\\nCuomo put the proposal in this year's budget, which means it must be reviewed and voted on by the legislature before April 1.\\n\\nAs proposed, New York could be the first state to make tuition free at both community colleges and four-year degree programs statewide. (Rhode Island is considering a similar proposal during the state's budget negotiations, and both Tennessee and Oregon have made two-year community college programs tuiton-free.)\\n\\nStudents at New York's public colleges -- SUNY and CUNY schools -- would pay nothing for tuition as long as they fell below an income cap, which would be phased in over the first three years of the program. It would first apply to families who earn $100,000 this year, then to those who earn $110,000 or less next year, and eventually reaching $120,000 or less in 2019.\\n\\nThere's still a couple of months to hammer out the details -- and for lawmakers to decide whether or not the program, called the Excelsior Scholarship, should be in the state budget at all.\\n\\nHere are some parts of the plan that drew the most concern from lawmakers on Tuesday:\\n\\nExcluding part-time students\\n\\nAs proposed, only those students who enroll in at least 15 credits a semester would be eligible. It's designed to encourage students to complete their degrees on time.\\n\\nBut this would work against students who go part time so that they can also work, because they have a family, or because they have a disability.\\n\\n'Free-tuition' doesn't mean it's a free ride\\n\\nFor those who do qualify for the free-tuition plan, they're still on the hook to pay for room and board, fees, books or other living expenses -- which can cost more than tuition itself.\\n\\nAverage tuition at SUNY costs $6,470 a year, but fees and room and board cost an additional $14,000.\\n\\nAssemblyman Victor Pichardo suggested it might make sense to change the formula so that award money could cover some living costs for the neediest students.\\n\\nHow much will it cost the state?\\n\\nThe cost of the program is still unclear. The governor's office estimates it will start at $163 million in the first year, but some lawmakers say that's low-balling it.\\n\\nIf it was that inexpensive to do, we would have done it a long time ago, Assemblyman James Skoufis told CNNMoney. He proposed a bill three years ago that would have made tuition free.\\n\\nThe state already spends $1 billion on need-based financial aid for student scholarships alone.\\n\\nRelated: Average college degree pays off by age 34\\n\\nThe chancellors at both the SUNY and CUNY systems testified Tuesday that they had teams crunching the numbers, but cannot yet estimate how many of their students would be eligible.\\n\\nSUNY Chancellor Nancy Zimpher said that 80,000 of the system's students last year were from families who would meet the income criteria and are enrolled in 15 credit hours.\\n\\nBut that number does not factor in that half of SUNY students already pay nothing for tuition because they get federal Pell grants and/or the state's need-based Tuition Assistance Program (TAP) award. Those students would not get any more money under the free-tuition proposal because it's structured to cover the remaining cost to the student after accounting for other types of financial aid.\\n\\nWill increased enrollment jeopardize quality?\\n\\nBoth Zimpher and CUNY Chancellor James Milliken agreed that enrollment would increase if the tuition-free plan was enacted, but neither could estimate by how much.\\n\\nZimpher expects it to increase applications from low-income students who may have gotten significant financial aid under the current system, but weren't aware of those aid programs and didn't think college was an option for them.\\n\\nJust putting the term 'tuition-free' out there will move the dial on access, she said.\\n\\nA handful of lawmakers expressed concern about jeopardizing the quality of the SUNY and CUNY systems by bringing more students in.\\n\\nBoth school systems are working to determine what max capacity would be. And Milliken said CUNY plans to offer more online courses in the future, which could help with an increase in enrollment.\\n\\nCorrection: An earlier version of this story incorrectly said students would be required to take 15 credits a year. In fact it's 15 credits per semester."}
{"original": "(CNN) He was never called upon to break a tie or influence how the Senate impeachment trial might end, but Chief Justice John Roberts' legacy will be forever entwined with President Donald Trump's.\\n\\nIt's not just that Roberts was in the chair presiding over the two-week hearing and historic vote on Wednesday to acquit Trump, just as Chief Justice Salmon Chase oversaw the acquittal of President Andrew Johnson in 1868 and Chief Justice William Rehnquist that of President Bill Clinton in 1999.\\n\\nRoberts now faces unprecedented litigation at the Supreme Court involving the President's personal business dealings. The justices will hear three cases in March testing Trump's efforts to block subpoenas from the US House and a Manhattan district attorney for his tax returns and other financial records.\\n\\nThe disputes challenge the respective powers among the branches of government and could ultimately determine whether Trump makes his tax returns public, as his recent predecessors chose to do.\\n\\nOther cases involving the President and top officials, such as former White House counsel Don McGahn , are wending their way through federal courts, as are multiple challenges to Trump administration policies.\\n\\nIf Trump wins another four-year term, Roberts could be in the position of ruling on a Trump-dominated docket until 2025.\\n\\nIrrespective of whether this President serves one term or two, America's 17th chief justice is already bound for an unusual union with the 45th President, arising from the combination of Trump's impeachment trial, Supreme Court litigation and their dueling notions of an impartial federal judiciary.\\n\\nWhen Roberts heard the first major challenge to a Trump administration policy, the travel ban directed at majority-Muslim countries, he wrote that Trump should be treated like any other US president.\\n\\nThe travel ban, Roberts wrote in a June 2018 opinion , is an act that ... could have been taken by any other President. Roberts rejected evidence of Trump's anti-Muslim remarks, saying that we must consider not only the statements of a particular President, but the authority of the Presidency itself.\\n\\nWhether Roberts' time presiding over the impeachment trial has altered his view of Trump might be seen over time. Roberts is in his 15th year as chief justice and, at only age 65, he could easily serve five more years, or twice that.\\n\\nAt the impeachment trial\\n\\nThe Constitution specifically dictates that the chief justice presides over the impeachment trial of a president. The role is distinct from the real authority of the chief justice at the Supreme Court.\\n\\nThe Senate has the sole power, according to the Constitution, to decide whether a president is convicted or acquitted. A two-thirds vote is required, and on Wednesday afternoon the Senate failed to reach that 67-vote threshold or even a simple majority. The vote was 48-52 to convict Trump on an abuse of power charge and 47-53 on an obstruction of Congress charge.\\n\\nThe US House in December had passed two articles of impeachment related to Trump's alleged conditioning of US security aid to Ukraine on Ukrainian investigations of Democrats. Last Friday the Senate voted against hearing from witnesses who might have direct knowledge of Trump's dealings on Ukraine.\\n\\nAfter that vote, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, queried Roberts as to whether he would become involved in other matters . Is the chief justice aware that in the impeachment trial of President Johnson, Chief Justice Chase, as presiding officer, cast tie-breaking votes on both March 31 and April 2, 1868?\\n\\nAppearing to speak from a prepared text, Roberts responded, I am, Mr. Leader. The one concerned a motion to adjourn; the other concerned a motion to close deliberations. I do not regard those isolated episodes 150 years ago as sufficient to support a general authority to break ties.\\n\\nRoberts continued, drawing a line between the legislative and judicial branches, If the members of this body elected by the people and accountable to them divide equally on a motion, the normal rule is that the motion fails. I think it would be inappropriate for me, an unelected official from a different branch of government, to assert the power to change that result so that the motion would succeed.\\n\\nAs Roberts sidestepped the controversy over witnesses, he also showed little emotion as he read senators' often awkward, leading questions for the House impeachment managers and Trump's lawyers (per the customary process). Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, said a total of 180 questions were delivered to Roberts to read.\\n\\nOne of the most dramatic moments came when Roberts rejected an attempt by Republican Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky to induce him to say aloud the name of the alleged whistleblower who first brought Trump's Ukrainian dealings to public light.\\n\\nPerhaps most striking was the many hours Roberts endured on the dais hearing piercing criticism of the President, who is becoming a regular litigant at the Supreme Court. US House managers characterized Trump as a liar and cheat, a man who put his own interests above those of the country.\\n\\nTrump's lawyers rejected those assertions but seemed to accept some transgressions, saying that no matter what the President had done, his conduct did not warrant a Senate conviction.\\n\\nIn the courtroom\\n\\nNeither Johnson nor Clinton faced voters for another term after their impeachments, and Chief Justices Chase and Rehnquist did not hear protracted court disputes in the vein of what Roberts already has on the docket related to Trump.\\n\\nThe cases tied most directly to Trump, centered on whether his personal business records are subject to subpoena, will be heard on March 31.\\n\\nUnlike his role in the Senate, at the high court Roberts will cast votes and, in fact, could steer the outcomes of the cases, Trump v. Mazars, Trump v. Deutsche Bank and Trump v. Vance. Roberts not only sits at the center of the elevated mahogany bench but also resides at the ideological middle of the nine-member court.\\n\\nTrump's veracity, which was attacked by the House managers during the impeachment trial, is also at issue in the subpoena cases. As lawyers for the House noted in one of their filings to the justices, A common thread in each of these inquiries is the accuracy of statements made by President Trump on various financial disclosures.\\n\\nHouse lawyers say the disclosures are needed for committees in the House of Representatives that are exploring the possibility of new legislation on conflicts of interest and other ethical concerns.\\n\\nTrump's lawyers say the House lacks the constitutional or statutory authority to subpoena the documents, held by Trump's longtime accountants and banks: To call these subpoenas unprecedented would be an understatement. This is the first time that Congress has subpoenaed private records of a sitting President.\\n\\nThey quarrel with the House's assertion that the Trump financial information is needed for a legislative purpose. Trump lawyers noted that a request to the Mazars USA accounting firm said the House wanted to investigate the accuracy of the President's financial statements to see if he had broken the law. Such an investigative focus, Trump's lawyers say, reveals that House committees are not engaged in a legislative effort.\\n\\nIn Trump v. Vance -- testing a subpoena sought by Manhattan District Attorney Cy Vance, who is looking into hush money paid to women who claimed affairs with Trump -- the President's lawyers have asserted that he is immune from criminal investigation -- not only from indictment, which had been common understanding -- while he holds office.\\n\\nOn how judges should rule\\n\\nBeyond the Senate trial and Supreme Court litigation, Trump and Roberts have collided over regard for the impartiality of the judiciary. Trump has suggested in remarks on Twitter and elsewhere that he believes his judicial appointees would side with him, while Democratic appointees would automatically rule against him.\\n\\nWhen Trump denigrated a California US district judge who had ruled against the administration as an Obama judge, Roberts issued a statement in November 2018 that said, We do not have Obama judges or Trump judges, Bush judges or Clinton judges. What we have is an extraordinary group of dedicated judges doing their level best to do equal right to those appearing before them.\\n\\nIn Roberts' most recent year-end report , issued on December 31, he might have had the Twitter-addicted President in mind when he said that social media can instantly spread rumor and false information on a grand scale. The chief justice urged people to celebrate our strong and independent judiciary.\\n\\nAt his State of the Union speech on Tuesday night, Trump shook hands with Roberts, as he did with other justices in attendance. Roberts looked somber, betraying none of what he was thinking, as was his way during the Senate trial.\\n\\nAs the Trump trial closed less than 24 hours later, Roberts expressed appreciation to Senate leaders for their support as he attempted to carry out ill-defined responsibilities in an unfamiliar setting. He offered senators good wishes as we carry out our common commitment to the Constitution.\\n\\nAnd Roberts closed by saying he looked forward to seeing them again under happier circumstances."}

Unprecedented support from central banks and governments remains in place, and the vaccine rollout that will eventually feed an economic recovery is gathering steam.\\n\\nFiscal and monetary policy are highly supportive, and financial conditions are very loose, said Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management. We therefore continue to expect strong global growth in 2021.\\n\\nIn the meantime, however, virus headlines are generating turbulence.\\n\\nOn Monday, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced a third lockdown for England. The nation is grappling with a surge in Covid-19 cases believed to be triggered by a new, more infectious variant. Italy said Tuesday that it's extending most of the coronavirus restrictions imposed during the Christmas holidays until Jan. 15. German leaders are also discussing an extension of the country's lockdown.\\n\\nMeanwhile, hospitalizations continue to surge in the United States, while the vaccination effort is lagging behind targets. Just 4.5 million people have received their first dose, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Monday. That's well behind what officials had hoped for by now.\\n\\nThen there's the political action in Georgia on Tuesday. Two runoff contests there will determine whether Republicans can keep hold of the Senate.\\n\\nIt is impossible to overstate how critical these races are for fiscal, tax and regulatory policy over the next two years, Chris Krueger, policy analyst at Cowen Washington Research, said in a report Monday.\\n\\nA sweep by Democrats would allow for more ambitious spending programs once President-elect Joe Biden enters the White House. But it would also make corporate tax hikes more likely, which could jolt investors.\\n\\nA jittery Wall Street thinks the vote could go either way.

The Chinese government has criticized the United States for wantonly suppressing foreign companies listed in the country and previously said it would take necessary measures to safeguard the interests of Chinese firms.\\n\\nThe reasons behind the NYSE's reversal were not immediately clear — though investors are certainly getting whiplash.\\n\\nInvestor insight: Shares of all three affected firms, which also trade in Hong Kong, dropped Monday before rallying Tuesday. China Unicom advanced 8.5%, while China Mobile jumped 5% and China Telecom rose more than 3%.\\n\\nThe company that tried to fix US health care is shutting down\\n\\nThere was palpable excitement when Amazon's Jeff Bezos, JPMorgan Chase's Jamie Dimon and Berkshire Hathaway's Warren Buffett announced that they were forming a company to reimagine health care.\\n\\nBut three years later, the partnership — known as Haven — is shutting down, my CNN Business colleague Paul R. La Monica reports.\\n\\nThe ambitious venture was created in 2018 to provide better health care services and insurance at a lower cost to workers and families at the three companies. The hope was their learnings could be applied at other firms, too.\\n\\nBut Haven struggled to usher in large-scale changes to a notoriously thorny and complex system. CEO Atul Gawande, who was given significant bandwidth and funding to make his vision a reality, stepped down last May.\\n\\nIn a letter to employees, Dimon lauded the effort.\\n\\nHaven worked best as an incubator of ideas, a place to pilot, test and learn — and a way to share best practices across our companies, he said.

(Photo by Alexandra Beier/Bongarts/Getty Images)\\n\\nWhat you need to know about public pools\\n\\nStory highlights The controversial facilities provide a safe space where people can consume drugs There are over 120 similar sites worldwide, but this would be the first in the US Over 63,000 people in the US died from drug overdose in 2016\\n\\n(CNN) —\\n\\nThe San Francisco Department of Public Health has unanimously endorsed a task force's recommendation to open what could become the nation's first legal safe injection sites aimed at curbing the opioid epidemic.\\n\\nThe facilities provide a safe space where people can consume previously obtained drugs, such as heroin and fentanyl, under the supervision of staff trained to respond in the event of an overdose or other medical emergency. They also provide counseling and referrals to other social and health services.\\n\\nAlthough the often-controversial facilities are not an ideal solution, they are a necessity in light of the skyrocketing number of deaths caused by opioid overdose in the United States, according to San Francisco Mayor Mark Farrell.\\n\\nI understand the misgivings around it and some of the rhetoric from people who don't support it, Farrell said last week. But we absolutely need to give it a try.\\n\\nMore than 63,000 people in the US died from drug overdose in 2016, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention – more than the number of Americans killed in the Vietnam War. At this rate, over half a million people will die from overdose in the US in the next 10 years, exceeding the number of Americans killed in World War II, the deadliest conflict in human history.\\n\\nThe city plans to open the first two facilities in July, the beginning of its fiscal year.\\n\\nI'm really excited, said Laura Thomas, the California state director for the nonprofit Drug Policy Alliance. I've been working on this particular issue for over a decade.\\n\\nThere are an estimated 22,000 intravenous drug users in San Francisco, many of whom openly inject in public areas across the city. Last year, over 100 people died in San Francisco of drug overdose, according to a report published by the city's Safe Injection Services Task Force.\\n\\nMore than 100 peer-reviewed studies on safe injection sites – otherwise known as supervised consumption facilities – have consistently shown them to be effective at reducing overdose deaths, preventing transmission of HIV and viral hepatitis, reducing street-based drug use and linking people to drug treatment and other services.\\n\\nIn addition to saving lives, the facilities are projected to save the city approximately $3.5 million a year in overdose related medical costs, according to Rachel Kagan, director of communications at the San Francisco Department of Public Health.\\n\\nOther cities in the US, such as Seattle and Baltimore, are taking steps toward opening safe injection sites. Last week, Philadelphia announced that it will welcome private organizations interested in setting up such facilities.\\n\\nBut San Francisco will probably be the first to open one.\\n\\nThe operators of the first two facilities will be chosen from a list of six to eight nonprofit organizations that currently operate needle exchanges and other drug addiction services in the city, Kagan said.\\n\\nFunding for the facilities will initially come from the private sector. According to Kagan, this helps the city avoid liability issues, since intravenous drug use is against state and federal law.\\n\\nThere are over 120 of these around the world at this point, and they all operate on the same basic idea, Thomas said, referring to locations in Canada, Europe and Australia. You show up; you check in; you use your drugs; you hang out for a while, interact with the staff and then go on your way.\\n\\nIn Australia, a safe injection site in Sydney managed 3,426 overdose-related events without a single fatality over a period of nine years, according to a 2010 government report. The report also found that residents were half as likely to observe people injecting drugs in public at the end of the nine-year period.\\n\\nOne of the biggest supervised injection facilities in the world – certainly in North America – is Insite in Vancouver, British Columbia, Thomas said. There's a nurse's station in the middle of the room that has all of the syringes, sterile supplies that they may need, and then they go through the usual process of preparing their drugs and injecting them, all under the supervision of trained staff.\\n\\nSupervised injection sites have faced opposition. Some believe that they implicitly condone drug use and lead to increased use. Opponents argue that there is no safe way to inject or otherwise use illicit drugs.\\n\\nThough the sites in San Francisco would be at odds with California and federal laws, state legislators are trying to pass a bill that will protect anyone associated with the injection sites – including property owners, employees and drug users – from arrest. A version of the bill passed in the State Assembly last year but is two votes short in the state Senate, according to Thomas.\\n\\nBut the San Francisco sites will probably open this summer, regardless of changes to state law, she said.\\n\\nFollow CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\\n\\nIt certainly wouldn't be the first time that San Francisco has prioritized the health, safety and well-being of its residents over state or federal law, Thomas added. Times have changed. The biggest threats we're seeing aren't crack houses in urban neighborhoods but overdose deaths and people injecting on the streets.\\n\\nSan Francisco residents are also generally supportive of the idea. A poll conducted by David Binder Research in January among 500 registered voters found that 67% of respondents backed the idea, while 27% opposed it and 6% didn't know.\\n\\nAccording to the poll, more than half of all self-described progressives, liberals and moderates supported the idea, compared with 42% of self-described conservatives."}

Elizabeth Warren arrived in Iowa on Friday evening and, through four events over a little more than 24 hours, quickly made clear that even as her presidential campaign evolves, she is poised to rise or fall with the same brand of wonky populism that took her from the classroom to Capitol Hill.\\n\\nIn speeches to packed rooms from the state's western border with Nebraska to its capital in Des Moines, Warren spent the weekend demanding structural change in Washington, where the partial government shutdown is entering its third week. She wants to strengthen our unions, our workers and our consumers while breaking the hold of an army of lobbyists occupying the capital, as she describes it, under the banners of big corporations.\\n\\nRELATED: Elizabeth Warren in Iowa: 'I am not a person of color'\\n\\nEven during her occasional strolls in the policy weeds, Warren, who has set the tone for her remarks so far by opening them with the story of her mother's struggle to find a minimum wage job to help save their house after Warren's father suffered a debilitating heart attack, keeps up a low fury. When her microphone cut out at the opening event in Council Bluffs, Warren didn't yell because, even in a room of 300 (with 200 more outside) she didn't have to.\\n\\nThere are too many people who get their power from turning working people against working people, the Massachusetts Democrat said a day later in Storm Lake during a riff on long-stalled talks over comprehensive immigration revisions. A few hours earlier, in Sioux City, she declared, Washington keeps working great for those with money, but not for anyone else. We need to call this out for what it is: It is corruption, pure and simple.\\n\\nIf Warren has strong feelings about ethanol, an important issue for Iowa voters and favorite means for out-of-state candidates to pander to them, she hasn't yet let on. Warren has also steered clear of some national progressive hits, like Medicare-for-all, which she hasn't mentioned through her first few stops.\\n\\nAsked on Saturday why the Democratic left's signature policy proposal had not gotten a mention through two events, Warren demurred.\\n\\nNo one's raised it, she said. But I have had a chance to talk about Medicaid, partly because I think we've had a national conversation about health care, and I think it's been enormously valuable.\\n\\nThe issue was indeed a winner for Democrats running during the 2018 midterm elections. In her opening foray, Warren has seemed content to continue on that path, advocating for Medicaid not just as a program for the poor but also as one that benefits seniors and Americans suffering from mental illness, while assailing the shameful behavior of insurance companies. On Saturday night, she won hearty applause when she called health care a basic human right.\\n\\nBut if Warren has appeared entirely self-assured in diving into the policy positions that she has been crusading for in Washington for years – All right! she cheered when an audience member in Sioux City began asking about internet regulations – her tone has changed when faced with questions about the 2016 election, a kind of riddle that she and so many other Democrats are still struggling to unwind.\\n\\nAsked how she planned to prevent a repeat of the undemocratic behavior between the DNC and Hillary's campaign in 2016 against Sen. Sanders, Warren told supporters in Des Moines, I'm not relitigating 2016, before pivoting to call all Democrats running for president to disavow super PACs, saying, I think that all of the Democratic candidates, whoever they turn out to be, should link arms and say our primary is not for sale to billionaires.\\n\\nIn a gaggle with reporters at her Council Bluffs rally on Friday, she bypassed a question about the comparisons being drawn between her campaign and Hillary Clinton's four years ago.\\n\\nYou know, look – I'd never run for public office before I got into the Senate race in Massachusetts, Warren responded. I was pulled into this because I have watched how America's middle class has been hollowed out. I am in this fight for working families. I'm going to stay focused on that all the way through.\\n\\nLike her colleague and ideological ally Sen. Bernie Sanders, the Vermont independent whose decision to enter the 2016 presidential campaign was partly a reaction to Warren's decision to sit it out, the Massachusetts senator seems least at ease when political conversation turns personal. But hers is a distinct challenge, and a lonely one during this period when Warren stands as the lone, high-profile female presidential candidate.\\n\\nShe has already been faced with a story focused on whether she risked being viewed as too unlikable, gamely parlaying it into a fundraising tool. Many Democrats seized on the same report, determined to lay down a marker to ensure that Warren and the other women likely to run – so many of them politically and personally distinct from Clinton in so many ways – be spared a very similar treatment.\\n\\nOutside Warren's debut event on Friday night, Natalie Wertz, 29, who was waiting for the candidate with a friend – both of them having purchased pink T-shirts emblazoned with Warren's de facto slogan, Nevertheless, she persisted – spoke confidently of Warren's potential as a candidate.\\n\\nNeither woman had heard about the likability flap, though Wertz smilingly proclaimed Warren a very likable person.\\n\\nBut her decision in 2020, Wertz said, would turn on more concrete questions.\\n\\nAs a lower middle class American, budget and finances sometimes – living paycheck to paycheck is very hard, she said. And it's a toxic world that has set us into this cycle of vicious debt. I think that Warren has great ideas about how to get us out of that.\\n\\nCNN's Carolyn Sung and DJ Judd contributed to this report."}

As tourism arrivals slowed, the Goldie was forced to take stock of its offerings.\\n\\nA zero-tolerance police policy for public drunkenness during the annual migration of fresh high-school graduates has certainly helped shift the tone, as has an influx of sophisticated bars, restaurants and hotels.\\n\\nBut the real game-changer was the 2010 announcement that the Gold Coast would host the 2018 Commonwealth Games (April 4-15).\\n\\nBasically the Olympics for Commonwealth nations, the Games is a major international sporting event that occurs every four years.\\n\\nBuild it and they will come\\n\\nThe technicolored Athletes' Village for the 2018 Commonwealth Games. Natasha Dragun\\n\\nWith a budget of $1.6 billion in the lead-up to the event, the Gold Coast 2018 Commonwealth Games Corporation has planned 24 Games venues across the city, including three new builds.\\n\\nThe games are driving the momentum, but the city's multi-billion-dollar makeover extends beyond the colorful Athletes' Village and upgraded Carrara Stadium, which will host the opening and closing ceremonies.\\n\\nThe Games has fast-tracked a lot of construction projects, says Gould. But we realized early on that success is not just a highrise. It's about making things accessible, usable and available.\\n\\nOne way to make the city more usable was by installing a light rail system.\\n\\nRunning parallel to the area's main beach, it connects most of the major Games venues, as well as Goldie's main attractions.\\n\\nTravelers can jump on and off as they please, strolling down to the sand in just a few minutes. By April, the line will link to a train station with direct access to Brisbane and, in coming years, an extension will connect the Glitter Strip with the airport.\\n\\nAnd then there's the cultural precinct, under development on the council's former headquarters in the suburb of Evandale.\\n\\nOpening in phases, beginning this year, the carbon-neutral building will house a 5,000-person theater. For easy access, it will also be linked to Surfers Paradise via an art-filled green bridge lined with plants.\\n\\nBrand new beds\\n\\nThe QT hotel is light-filled and full of surfer whimsy. From QT Gold Coast\\n\\nBetween the suburbs of Surfers Paradise and neighboring Broadbeach to the south, cranes are busily erecting new hotels and cloud-scraping towers.\\n\\nComing up quickly is the $712 million Jewel -- a three-tower mammoth that's set to become Australia's largest beachfront mixed-use development. Also in the works are the 89-story Spirit tower, 103-story Orion and 108-story Azzura.\\n\\n219 apartment-style hotel rooms. Meanwhile, the Avani brand debuted its first Australia property last December, with the opening of Avani Broadbeach and its219 apartment-style hotel rooms.\\n\\nAnd not to be outdone, The Star -- formerly Jupiters Casino -- has equally ambitious expansion plans. The hotel has spent $275 million to revamp rooms and introduce new dining facilities before the Games.\\n\\nRelated content Hot new hotels to check into in 2018\\n\\nThe company has also pledged another $400 million to remodel the city's Sheraton Mirage Resort and construct a 50-suite hotel with a pool cantilevered 16 feet above the street.\\n\\nBut if you prefer more low-key accommodations, there's always the design-oriented Peppers group, with two fully equipped apartment-style properties on the Coast.\\n\\nPeppers Soul Surfers Paradise has one- to four-bedroom accommodations with private balconies, while Peppers Broadbeach stretches across two towers opposite the beach in a precinct packed with restaurants and cafes.\\n\\nA fresh face nearby, the QT hotel is light-filled and full of surfer whimsy. The 297-room property features sleek bathrooms and pops of color that channel the waterside location in Surfers Paradise.\\n\\nAlso in the neighborhood is The Island . After a multi-million-dollar makeover, the hotel re-opened mid-2017 with a downstairs dining room draped in greenery and seriously stylish rooms kitted out with paneled blonde-wood walls, designer lighting and open-plan bathrooms.\\n\\nJewel , 34 Old Burleigh Road, Surfers Paradise; 1800 799 899\\n\\nAvani Broadbeach , 2663 Gold Coast Highway, Broadbeach; +61 7 5634 8600\\n\\nThe Star , 1 Casino Drive, Broadbeach Island, Broadbeach; +61 7 5592 8100\\n\\nSheraton Mirage Resort , 71 Sea World Drive, Main Beach, Gold Coast; +61 5577 0000\\n\\nPeppers Soul Surfers Paradise , 8 The Esplanade, Surfers Paradise; +61 7 5665 4426\\n\\nPeppers Broadbeach , 21 Elizabeth Ave, Broadbeach; +61 7 5665 4426\\n\\nQT hotel , 7 Staghorn Avenue, Surfers Paradise; +61 7 5584 1200\\n\\nThe Island , 3128 Surfers Paradise Blvd., Surfers Paradise; +61 7 5538 8000\\n\\nNew grub hubs\\n\\nSeafood lovers flock to Rick Shores.

Luxury super yacht Crystal Blue is the ultimate way to explore the canals of the coast, with space for up to 60 people on charters.\\n\\nJellurgal Walkabout Tours celebrates Australia's indigenous communities. Natasha Dragun\\n\\nThe incredible thing about the Gold Coast is that 30 minutes after leaving your board behind on the sand you can be standing amid ancient subtropical rainforest.\\n\\nJust west of the city, the hinterland is home to 247,105 acres (100,000 hectares) of World Heritage-listed Gondwana rainforest, studded with attractions ranging from vineyards to boutique distilleries and wellness retreats.\\n\\nAnother adventure on dry land, Jellurgal Walkabout Tours offer fascinating insights into local indigenous communities.\\n\\nThe 2.5-hour experience begins at Burleigh Cove before ascending the Dreaming Mountain, with a smoking ceremony and ochre anointment to show a connection to the earth along the way."}

He is also a professor of economics and international affairs at the Elliott School of International Affairs at The George Washington University. The opinions expressed belong to them.\\n\\nWhere should I go to college? Where should I work?\\n\\nInstinctively, these questions are answered with the name of a dream college or well-liked company. But the geographic dimension — the where? — often depends on a person's financial situation and ability to relocate.\\n\\nThe overwhelming majority of public four-year college students currently attend a school within 100 miles of home — and more than half stay within 50 miles, according to our research at The Hamilton Project.\\n\\nIn other words, for most students, the decision of where to go to college is determined largely by where they live.\\n\\nBut for many others, attending college nearby is simply not an option: There are no two- or four-year degree-granting institutions in as many as 58% of US counties, our research found. Limited college access is an issue that impacts students from a wide variety of backgrounds, including those from both rural and urban communities.\\n\\nRelated: This college tax credit saved the typical American family $2,277\\n\\nAmerica's financial aid system is designed to help students pay for the direct costs of college, including commuting costs. But the costs of a long distance move often exceed the direct moving and travel expenses that aid helps cover. For students in counties without local college access, this may mean the difference between attending college or not.\\n\\nAnother potential barrier arises when students prepare to graduate from college and ask, Where should I work?\\n\\nUnfortunately, the financial burden of both relocation and student loan debt can interfere with a graduate's ability to start their careers off right. Graduates need to begin paying off student loans immediately, and thus may feel pressured to take the first job that comes along.\\n\\nThey may settle for easy-to-get jobs near their university or in a well-known big city, rather than seek their best career match somewhere else.\\n\\nPrevious generations of young adults were much more likely to move for career opportunities. Among 20- to 24- year-olds, moves across state or county lines declined from 16% in 1965 to about 8% in 2016, according to our research.\\n\\nMeanwhile, employment and earnings opportunities continue to diverge across US localities. For example, labor force participation in rural counties has fallen sharply since the recession, while it has been flat or modestly falling in metropolitan counties.\\n\\nRelated: College tuition is still getting more expensive\\n\\nBut cities with more educated workers have been growing faster and paying higher wages for decades. This has contributed to a rising concentration of skilled workers in larger cities.\\n\\nCombined, these factors mean that recent college graduates face a more difficult path to finding a first job that is best for them.\\n\\nIn order to level the playing field for all students, we need to remove geographic barriers to college access and careers.\\n\\nOne solution is to create large supplements to the Pell Grant to help students without local college access.\\n\\nAn annual supplement of up to $5,000 for students from counties without a degree-granting college within their borders could help these students afford the high cost of relocating, according to our policy research.\\n\\nAnother strategy is to offer an automatic, full-year student loan grace period for graduating college students if they are working or seeking work in a job market outside of their commuting zone or county.\\n\\nRelated: When does it make financial sense to get a graduate degree?\\n\\nDeferring loan repayment for students who choose to start their post-college careers after relocating would allow them to seek opportunities in distant job markets, alleviating the pressure to start quickly earning income to meet their repayment obligations.\\n\\nGiven that greater mobility when graduating from college can help workers improve their early career job matches, this is critical for achieving higher lifetime earnings.\\n\\nCollege attendance plays an incredibly important role in increasing lifetime earnings, and early career conditions can have persistent effects on those earnings.\\n\\nBy helping workers find the best possible job matches for their skills, these proposals would strengthen the labor market and provide opportunities for those in areas where there are few options."}

{"original": "(CNN) -- In a blistering speech before the United Nations General Assembly, Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad blamed a few bullying powers for creating the world's problems and said the American empire in the world is reaching the end of its road.\\n\\nAnd while he insisted Iran's nuclear activities are peaceful, Ahmadinejad blamed the same powers for seeking to hinder it by exerting political and economic pressures on Iran, and threatening and pressuring the International Atomic Energy Agency.\\n\\nThose powers, meanwhile, are building or maintaining nuclear stockpiles themselves, unchecked by anyone, he said.\\n\\nAs Ahmadinejad spoke, the only person at the United States table was a note-taker; no U.S. diplomat was present. When President Bush spoke earlier Tuesday, however, Ahmadinejad was in the room.\\n\\nAs long as the aggressors, because of their financial, political and propaganda powers, not only escape punishment, but even claim righteousness, and as long as wars are started and nations are enslaved in order to win votes in elections, not only will the problems of the global community remain unsolved, but they will be increasingly exacerbated, the Iranian leader said.\\n\\nHe accused the United States of oppressing Iraqis with six years of occupation, saying Americans were still seeking to solidify their position in the political geography of the region and to dominate oil resources. Watch Ahmadinejad say the American empire is nearing the end of its road »\\n\\nMeanwhile, he said, Palestinians have undergone 60 years of carnage and invasion ... at the hands of some criminal and occupying Zionists. Watch Ahmadinejad blast U.S., Israel, bullying powers »\\n\\nHe said Zionists in Israel have forged a regime through collecting people from various parts of the world and bringing them to other people's land, by displacing, detaining and killing the true owners of that land.\\n\\nThe Security Council, he said, cannot do anything, and sometimes under pressure from a few bullying powers, even paves the way for supporting these Zionist murders.\\n\\nHe stopped short of calling for Israel to be politically wiped off the map as he has in the past. He called for a free referendum in Palestine for determining and establishing the type of state in the entire Palestinian lands.\\n\\nAhmadinejad pointed to what he said are signs of hope, saying an increasing number of nations are turning their backs on the bullying powers and seeking to establish new relations.\\n\\nToday the Zionist regime is on a definite slope to collapse, he said.\\n\\nThe Anti-Defamation League released a statement saying the Iranian leader showed he is deeply infected with anti-Semitism and displayed the true threat the Iranian regime poses to Israel, the United States and the West.\\n\\nHours before Ahmadinejad's speech, Bush told the General Assembly that Iran was among the nations that continue to sponsor terror.\\n\\nYet their numbers are growing fewer, and they're growing more isolated from the world, Bush said.\\n\\nBush also said U.N. members needed to enforce sanctions against Iran for failing to suspend its nuclear program, which the United States and other Western nations believe is intended to develop nuclear weapons.\\n\\nBefore Ahmadinejad spoke to the U.N., he told CNN's Larry King that he is willing to meet with presidential candidates Sens. John McCain and Barack Obama -- even in front of the media -- to discuss world issues and debate.\\n\\nBut he has no preference between the two, he said in the interview that aired Tuesday night on Larry King Live. Watch Ahmadinejad discuss the role of the next U.S. president »\\n\\nWe believe that these are issues relating to the domestic affairs of the United States, Ahmadinejad told Larry King of the presidential race, according to a transcript of the interview.\\n\\nAnd decisions pertaining to that must be made by the American people. And it's not important to us either, Ahmadinejad said. What matters essentially is that the president that is chosen by the American people should adopt a path and a policy approach and for us to observe the policy approach.\\n\\nThis is the campaign period, anyone can say anything. So we disregard that. What matters is that once someone is in office, we have to watch and see if that person will bring about some changes in policy or continue the same old path.\\n\\nAhmadinejad was in New York City for the United Nations General Assembly meeting, which began Tuesday.\\n\\nI have said that, in fact, on this very trip, currently in New York, that I am ready to speak with the presidential candidates before the press, he told Larry King. I believe that we've really done whatever we could do in this respect. Watch Ahmadinejad say he'd debate U.S. presidential candidates »\\n\\nAsked whether he fears a U.S. attack, Ahmadinejad told King that attacking Iran would be the worst thing the U.S. government can do ... I think that in the United States, there are enough reasonable people, smart people, who would not allow the U.S. government to make such a big mistake.\\n\\nWithdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq, meanwhile, would be the best scenario, Ahmadinejad said. But I think that it needs a timetable ... the presence of the United States there has not reduced tension and it has not limited terrorism either. In fact, it has increased terrorism.\\n\\nOn hostility between the United States and Iran, Ahmadinejad told King: The hostility has not been from our end. Up to this day, we have always been interested in having friendly relations.\\n\\nIran, he said later, throughout history ... has demonstrated that it is a nation that is for peace and friendly with others.\\n\\nAnd he insisted Iran's nuclear program is for peaceful purposes, despite Western nations' concern to the contrary.\\n\\nTheir concerns about us are not new, he told King of the West. They've always been concerned. They were the ones who inspired Saddam [Hussein] to attack Iran and get us involved in an eight-year war. The terrorist groups that killed our president, our prime minister, our officials, are now freely asked to live in the Western countries.\\n\\nThe nuclear issue, he said, has been politicized and is not a legal struggle at all, noting the International Atomic Energy Agency, the U.N.'s nuclear watchdog group, has not detected any noncompliance or deviation on the part of Tehran. Watch Ahmadinejad talk about nuclear weapons »\\n\\nAhmadinejad spoke extensively of Iran's support for Palestinians. The Iranian leader previously has made statements suggesting that Israel be politically wiped off the map, though he insists that can be accomplished without violence. He has questioned the existence of the Holocaust, the genocidal Nazi campaign against European Jews, and warned Europeans that they may pay a heavy price for its support of Israel.\\n\\nHe insisted, however, that he and his country wish no harm to Jews.\\n\\nWe have no problems with Jewish people, he said. There are many Jews who live in Iran today ... but please pay attention to the fact that the Zionists are not Jews. They have no religion ... they just have -- wear masks of religiosity. How can you possibly be religious and occupy the land of other people? Watch Ahmadinejad say he has no problems with Jews\\n\\nOn the Holocaust, he said an impartial group should research whether it happened as has been claimed.\\n\\nThere is a claim that the extent of the calamity was what it was, Ahmadinejad said. There are people who agree with it. There are people who disagree.\\n\\nAhmadinejad has also caused controversy by previously suggesting there were no homosexuals in Iran. Regarding that statement, he told King: I said it is not the way it is here. In Iran this is considered a very -- obviously, most people dislike it. And we have, actually, a law regarding it and the law is enforced.\\n\\nHowever, he said, we do pay attention that in Iran nobody interferes in the private lives of individuals. We have nothing to do with the private realm of people. This is at the -- non-private, public morality. In their own house, nobody ever interferes.\\n\\nAll About Mahmoud Ahmadinejad • Iran • United Nations"}

{"original": "Too many Americans underestimate the value of their employer-sponsored retirement savings accounts, particularly if the employer is willing to match some, or all, employee contributions.\\n\\nWhile the majority of workers with 401(k) plans contribute more than enough to take full advantage of their employer's matching program, there are still about 20% of people who don't.\\n\\nSure, it doesn't seem like a ton of money to be missing out on now, but you might be surprised at how much of a difference it can make when you eventually retire.\\n\\nAbout 75% of companies offering 401(k) retirement plans offer some type of a matching program, generally based on an employee's contributions capped at a percentage of their salary.\\n\\nFor example, a 401(k) matching policy may be 50% of employee contributions, up to 6% of total compensation. In other words, if you earn $50,000 per year and contribute $3,000 to your 401(k) -- 6% of your salary -- your employer will contribute an additional $1,500 on your behalf.\\n\\nHowever, about one in five participants don't contribute enough to take full advantage of their employer match, according to several different surveys. Besides cashing out your 401(k) and spending the money, this is perhaps the worst retirement savings mistake you can make.\\n\\nWhy the employer match is so important\\n\\nHere's a simplified example that shows why this is so important. Let's say that you earn $100,000 per year and that your employer will match 50% of your contributions, up to 5% of your salary. So, you choose to contribute $5,000 into your 401(k) each year and your employer matches 50% of your contributions for a total of $7,500 flowing into your account annually. Over a 30-year period, your account could be expected to grow to approximately $708,000, assuming 7% annualized investment returns.\\n\\nOn the other hand, let's say that you choose to contribute just 3% of your salary, which is a common automatic contribution level set by many employers. Including the employer match, this means that just $4,500 will go into your account per year. Each year, you're missing out on $1,000 in employer contributions that you could have received for contributing the 5% matching limit. What's more, a move like this can really add up over time -- assuming the same 7% annualized returns, your account would only grow to about $425,000. That $283,000 difference could have a big impact on your financial security after retirement.\\n\\nFor this reason, the maximum contribution level your employer is willing to match should be the bare minimum you choose to put into your 401(k). Not doing so is literally turning down free money. Would you turn down a raise? Of course not. Not taking advantage of your employer match is just as silly.\\n\\nThis is an especially common mistake among younger people just starting out in their careers. Understandably, if you're starting your first job with an employer-sponsored retirement account, choosing to effectively reduce each of your paychecks to contribute to a retirement account may seem like a lot of money.\\n\\nPlus, many employers' 401(k) plans have automatic enrollment for new hires, often with a low contribution rate such as 2% or 3%. Many workers simply don't think to change it.\\n\\nRelated links:\\n\\n• Motley Fool Issues Rare Triple-Buy Alert\\n\\n• This Stock Could Be Like Buying Amazon in 1997\\n\\n• 7 of 8 People Are Clueless About This Trillion-Dollar Market\\n\\nHowever, it's important to think about your employer's matching contributions as what they really are -- a part of your compensation that you miss out on if you don't put enough into your retirement account."}

{"original": "Financial turbulence and misgivings with the newspaper's parent company have brought the Los Angeles Times to the cusp of forming a union for the first time in its 136-year history.\\n\\nOn Thursday, newsroom employees will cast votes in an election held by the National Labor Relations Board, the culmination of a tense months-long organizing effort. In October, Times employees went public with their efforts, announcing in an unsigned letter that a majority of the newsroom had signed cards in support of representation by the NewsGuild-Communications Workers of America\\n\\nIt set the stage for yet more tension with the newspaper's owner, Tronc, formerly known as The Tribune Company, which has been vigorously opposed to the union. Times employees have grown anxious with major changes brought by the parent company.\\n\\nIn a statement, a Tronc spokesperson said the company urges every individual in the LA Times newsroom to get out and vote.\\n\\nWe believe that by working together, rather than through a third party, we can build on the LA Times' heritage and trust with readers, the spokesperson said. We remain committed to providing a productive and safe working environment for all employees, and will continue to act with the best interest of all of our employees in mind.\\n\\nRelated: Los Angeles Times names Forbes executive its top editor\\n\\nStanding up to Tronc are Times employees like Carolina Miranda, a culture writer at the paper and a member of the union's organizing committee.\\n\\nMiranda said conversations about forming a union began in late 2016 -- months after Tribune changed its name to Tronc and unveiled a buzzword-laden plan of action that was ridiculed throughout the industry.\\n\\nThe same year saw Tronc eliminate the newspaper's accrued vacation policy for many employees, including Miranda.\\n\\nYou see your benefits and pay eroded over time, and you feel powerless to do anything about it, Miranda told CNN in a phone interview.\\n\\nIn the letter released in October, the union's organizing committee called for better pay and protections from unilateral change by Tronc, among other things.\\n\\nFor months, Tronc's leaders have waged their own campaign to thwart the effort. That continued on the eve of the vote, with a Wednesday morning email sent by Lewis D'Vorkin, the newly appointed editor-in-chief, and Jim Kirk, a Tronc executive who since August has served as interim executive editor.\\n\\nIn the email, D'Vorkin and Kirk warned employees that the union will likely request dues every month, and said that it will offer no guarantee of better pay nor protection against layoffs.\\n\\nNow it is really a choice of every individual in this newsroom, they said in the email, which was provided to CNN. At stake is the culture of an institution that has served this community so well for more than 135 years. Take all the history into account when you make your decision on whether or not you want someone other than yourself representing you with our company.\\n\\nWe urge you to vote NO and keep the spirit of independence, the two said in closing.\\n\\nWhen reached by email, D'Vorkin and Kirk referred CNN to the Tronc spokesperson.\\n\\nBernie Lunzer, the president of the NewsGuild-CWA, said there was nothing new to Tronc's anti-union messaging.\\n\\nIt's pretty routine, Lunzer said. I don't see anything new or inspirational there.\\n\\nThe Times, the largest newspaper on the West Coast, has a stormy history with labor. In 1910, the newspaper's building was bombed by union organizers, killing 21 employees. The Otis-Chandler family, which owned the Times until it was acquired by Tribune in 2000, was staunchly anti-union.\\n\\nBut the paper's current owners spurred employees to take action. Tronc's change to the vacation policy was just one factor that motivated employees to organize. Another, Miranda said, was the managerial turnover at the paper. In August, the Times tapped Ross Levinsohn as its eighth publisher since 2000. Miranda herself has worked under four different publishers in three-and-a-half years at the paper.\\n\\nRelated: Los Angeles Times fires top editor, shakes up management team\\n\\nThere has also been the type of economic instability familiar to most newspapers, which have seen plunging print revenues give way to painful cutbacks. In 2015, the Times bid farewell to more than 80 reporters and editors who accepted buyouts. There was an additional round of buyouts last summer.\\n\\nWe're riding out this giant tsunami on a paddle board. That's what it feels like to be a journalist these days, Miranda said. Everyone goes to work with the specter of a layoff over their shoulders. A union offers a modicum of protections when and if they do come.\\n\\nSuch anxiety is felt in newsrooms across the country, not just the Times, but Miranda and her colleagues have also been driven by specific frustrations with Tronc.\\n\\nLast month, Times journalists bristled when financial disclosures showed Tronc chairman Michael Ferro paid himself a $5 million a year consulting agreement, and that the company had been paying for his private jet.\\n\\nThere has also been apparent friction brought on by personnel changes. Levinsohn replaced Davan Maharaj, the Times' publisher and editor in chief since 2016 who had clashed with Ferro and Tronc CEO Justin Dearborn.\\n\\nAnd D'Vorkin, who was hired in October from Forbes, has had a rocky start to his tenure as editor-in-chief. Earlier this week, NPR published audio recordings of a staff meeting held by D'Vorkin in November, where he was pressed by journalists over a dispute between the Times and Disney.\\n\\nThe studio had barred Times critics and other journalists from receiving advance screenings of movies, retaliation for the newspaper's investigation into financial breaks afforded to Disney by the city of Anaheim, the home of Disneyland.\\n\\nDisney eventually ended the ban after what it characterized as productive discussions with the newly installed leadership at The Los Angeles Times regarding our specific concerns.\\n\\nD'Vorkin can be heard in one of the recordings responding to employees who wanted to know what those productive discussions entailed. In another recording published by NPR, D'Vorkin used harsh terms to criticize the person who had leaked audio of that November meeting to the New York Times. That person, D'Vorkin said, was both unethical and morally bankrupt.\\n\\nD'Vorkin may be dealt more disappointing news on January 19, when the votes for the Times union are tallied.\\n\\nWe feel very good about it, Miranda said."}

Nicole Mason C. Nicole Mason\\n\\nGains in the stock market and the robust economy obscure the reality that many of the most marginalized workers, those with limited skills and education, are still struggling. Under Trump, the wealthy are doing extremely well, while the middle-class is hanging on.\\n\\nOn Friday, more than 800,000 federal workers across the country will go without a paycheck if the government fails to reopen. Trump says these workers will make adjustments as the shutdown could last months, even years. This, no doubt, will have a trickle-down effect on small businesses and others who rely on these workers to purchase goods and products.\\n\\nThe wall between Mexico and the United States, cheered by Trump's most ardent supporters as a metaphorical and political symbol of America First, has lost its appeal to some as the government shutdown has dragged on. Furloughed workers and those who sympathize with them have begun to realize the wall will not feed their families, keep their lights on or make sure their mortgage is paid.\\n\\nBut there are other reasons American workers may be disenchanted with the President. Trump campaigned on a promise to bring back coal mining jobs. Yet, as Bloomberg reported, analysts say that Trump's plan for the coal industry is not likely to have a large effect on its fortunes.\\n\\nAt campaign rallies and in interviews, Trump likes to say that he turned the West Virginia economy around by cutting energy regulations, but over the last decade, middle-class West Virginia households have seen no overall income gains from the state's modest economic growth, and there has been no sustained surge in the state's economy under Trump. These kinds of results will continue unless we are able to turn away from the divisive politics and rhetoric, and focus on building an economy that works for the majority of Americans – not just the few.\\n\\nWorking-class black and Latino Americans are also losing under Trump. In his address to the nation Tuesday night, President Trump asserted that illegal migration hurts all Americans by driving down jobs and wages, specifically impacting African-Americans and Hispanics. This is a bid to whip up support among both groups for the wall and his nativist immigration policies.\\n\\nWhile it is true that African-Americans and Hispanics tend to be employed in lower wage jobs than white and Asian workers, and compete in the labor market with undocumented immigrants for those jobs, it cannot be ignored that some US employers and corporations often exploit immigrant labor for their gain, by paying them less, forcing them to work in deplorable conditions, or threatening to deport them if they complain.\\n\\nThese habits not only harm undocumented immigrants, but American middle-class workers as well by suppressing wages and making it nearly impossible to demand safer working conditions or benefits without the fear of being fired. If Trump is concerned about the well-being of these black and Hispanic American workers, he should do more than suggest a wall to address the income disparity.\\n\\nCome March, if the government fails to reopen, tens of millions of Americans could lose their Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits, putting their families at risk of food insecurity. According to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, in 2017, 42 million Americans participated in the SNAP program – and more than 44% of them were in working families. It is hard to accept that this protracted and partisan skirmish over a wall could soon bring real hardship to the lives of the most vulnerable Americans.\\n\\nGet our free weekly newsletter Sign up for CNN Opinion's new newsletter.\\n\\nJoin us on Twitter and Facebook\\n\\nIn 2016, the white working class was cautiously optimistic, while others of us held our breath for the deal-maker and mega-businessman Donald Trump to work his magic to bring back jobs and revive struggling industries. It hasn't happened.\\n\\nIt is time to admit there is no sensible agenda, policy or plan for the working or middle class to thrive in Trump's America.

{"original": "As the rest of the world continues to grapple with the coronavirus pandemic, China -- where infections have been minimal for months now -- is pressing on ahead, reviving its economy and pursuing long-held geopolitical goals.\\n\\nOne thing that has enabled the latter is the ongoing chaos of the United States presidential transition. While the long delay between the election and the inauguration always creates a degree of confusion over policy and potential for disorder, the angry refusal of President Donald Trump and other Republicans to accept the results has exacerbated this no end.\\n\\nThis was exemplified Wednesday night, as protesters stormed the US Capitol , while lawmakers sheltered and were briefly evacuated. With talk of an attempted coup and terrorism now dominating conversation, it's unlikely that many in Washington will be paying much attention to actions beyond America's borders.\\n\\nIn recent days, Beijing has struck a major investment agreement with the European Union, one that potentially undermines Washington's ability to take on China , and launched a major crackdown in Hong Kong , with dozens of activists and lawmakers arrested in a purge that threatens to wipe out the city's democratic opposition.\\n\\nBiden's team has criticized both, though he still has two weeks until he is in office, while Trump has been focused on fighting his election loss. His secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, did however release a statement late Wednesday threatening sanctions over the Hong Kong arrests.\\n\\nBoth recent actions by Beijing were symbolic of a China that is both emboldened by its relative strength compared to the rest of the world right now, and keen to take advantage of the current chaos in Washington -- one of President-elect Joe Biden's top advisers had urged Brussels to wait before striking a trade deal, only to see Beijing offer concessions to get it secured sooner.\\n\\nWhile the US may not have been able to stop either development even in the best of times, that a superpower has been seemingly outmaneuvered will delight many of Washington's critics in Beijing and elsewhere, who have always felt the US throws its weight around too much internationally.\\n\\nAfter veering between criticism and embrace of Beijing for much of his term, Trump took a hard line against China in his last year in office, with his secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, pushing sanctions and other action against Beijing in Washington, while attempting to rally an anti-China coalition around the world\\n\\nThat attempt has been less than successful, however, with only a handful of countries, notably Australia, eager to jump on board -- a decision that Canberra may now be ruing as it deals with major blowback from Beijing\\n\\nChina's leaders claim that unlike Washington, they do not interfere in the internal matters of other states, and only seek win-win cooperation. This is not true, and Beijing wields its influence much like any superpower, from the Belt and Road mega infrastructure initiative, to attempting to shape politics in Australia Taiwan , and countries across Asia and the rest of the world. Yet the posture of non-interference is nevertheless persuasive to many observers.\\n\\nThis influence has grown as China has emerged as the world's second superpower, and been accelerated by political chaos and division in Washington, as well as the failure of the US to respond effectively to the coronavirus\\n\\nThat China is preparing to roll out its own homegrown vaccine, with promises to export hundreds of millions of doses overseas -- including throughout the developing world -- only serves to underscore this apparent shift.\\n\\nBoth Washington and Beijing tend to hold up the US system as the be all and end all of democracy, despite its many flaws and the fact that the majority of democratic countries do not resemble the US in the way they run their governments. As the US model has begun to show cracks under Trump, this has benefited China's propagandists, who can use it to argue for the validity of their own authoritarian system of governance.\\n\\nThe violence seen in Washington on Wednesday will likely feed neatly into this narrative. On Wednesday evening, the Global Times, an ultra-nationalist state-run tabloid, ran the headline Chinese netizens jeer riot in US Capitol as 'Karma,' say bubbles of 'democracy and freedom' have burst.\\n\\nThe report, which summarized highly selective reactions to Wednesday's events on Chinese social media, appeared to revel in what it termed US double standards.\\n\\nThis is the first political coup to happen in the American continent without the involvement of US embassies, read one mocking quote in the article.\\n\\nOther, more prosaic state media reports compared the storming of the Capitol and 2019 anti-government protests in Hong Kong, taunting Democratic leaders like Nancy Pelosi who spoke out on behalf of the city about whether they would do the same for the pro-Trump rioters.\\n\\nIn a regular press conference Thursday afternoon, China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokeswoman Hua Chunying echoed these comparisons, saying a lot of people are thinking about the fact that this is a déjà vu scenario.\\n\\nI think some people on the US side have very different reactions and wording to what happened in Hong Kong in 2019 and what is happening in the US today, and this stark contrast and the reasons behind it are thought-provoking and deserve serious and profound reflection by all of us, she added.\\n\\nWe believe that the American people want security and peace, especially in the current critical situation of the pandemic, and we hope that the American people will enjoy peace, stability and security as soon as possible.\\n\\nBut such comparisons are facile, given that protesters in Hong Kong were fighting for greater democracy -- and Pelosi praised peaceful demonstrations, not the more violent ones that followed -- while those in Washington Wednesday were seeking to overturn the results of an election.\\n\\nThe Hong Kong protests also provided the pretense for Beijing's ongoing crackdown in the city, that Washington, for all its outrage, posturing and even sanctions, has proved powerless to stop.\\n\\nBringing China's most obstreperous territory to heel has been a longtime goal of Beijing's, but one that was made easier by a weakened US, less influential and forceful on the world stage and less able to rally its allies, for all Trump and Pence's talk of building an anti-China front.\\n\\nThis year marks the centennial of the founding of the Chinese Communist Party, an anniversary Beijing has already promised to celebrate by achieving a moderately prosperous society, something which appears in sight after the country wiped out what it terms absolute poverty last year.\\n\\nChinese President Xi Jinping may now feel that he is in a position to achieve international objectives too, such as redoubling Beijing's control over the South China Sea, or forcing a showdown over the democratic island of Taiwan.\\n\\nIn the election campaign, Biden matched Trump for tough-on-China rhetoric, but will likely be hoping for a relative reset in relations with Beijing once he takes office, enabling the US to compete with China from a position of strength going forward.\\n\\nBut with two weeks left until Biden takes office, it remains to be seen if the chaos in Washington will enable Beijing to pursue other long-sought goals."}

Authorities said Tuesday, Oct. 31, 2017, that three Dartmouth psychology professors are under criminal investigation for allegations of sexual misconduct. The previous week the college said the professors were put on paid leave and had their access to campus restricted due to allegations of serious misconduct. The college later told authorities it had received allegations of sexual misconduct. (AP Photo/Jim Cole, File)\\n\\n(CNN) —\\n\\nDartmouth College says it is launching a new initiative to combat sexual harassment and abuses of power on campus. But a lawyer for seven women who are suing the university over its handling of sexual harassment allegations say the efforts miss the mark.\\n\\nThe announcement comes nearly two months after a federal complaint was filed against the Ivy League school by seven current and former graduate students who allege three professors created a toxic environment where female subjects were routinely subjected to sexual harassment and even rape.\\n\\nA school inquiry led to the resignations of the three professors in 2018 and the school pledged to take steps to improve the campus culture. The new Campus Climate and Culture Initiative is the latest step in that direction, school officials said in a press release.\\n\\nThe new program will include the following components:\\n\\n- A single policy to address sexual misconduct for faculty, staff, and students, with appropriate processes for adjudicating potential violations;\\n\\n- A mandatory online sexual violence prevention training program for all faculty, staff, professional and graduate students, and postdoctoral scholars;\\n\\n- Research advisory committees for all graduate programs to ensure that all graduate students have access to multiple advisors.\\n\\nThe announcement comes as American universities grapple with how to handle allegations of campus sexual misconduct and their obligations under Title IX, the federal law that bars discrimination based on sex, including harassment, in federally funded education programs and activities.\\n\\nThe Department of Education in November proposed new rules for dealing with sexual harassment and assault on college campuses that would bolster the rights of those accused of wrongdoing.\\n\\nThe lawsuit accuses the New Hampshire school of failing to create an environment free from gender-based discrimination, in violation of Title IX.\\n\\nDartmouth says the new program will expand the school's Title IX office, which is responsible for reviewing reports of sexual misconduct and conducting investigations. The school also pledged to increase mental health resources at Dartmouth and said that an outside expert who specializes in creating inclusive communities will review academic departments.\\n\\nThe lawsuit claims that the prominent researchers, who no longer are allowed on campus, coerced female students into drinking and made the women feel as if their success depended on their willingness to participate in their alcohol-saturated culture the men created.\\n\\nThe complaint claims that Dartmouth knew about the professors' behavior for more than 16 years and did nothing until 2017, when several female graduate students reported the allegations to the college's Title IX office. During the Title IX investigation, the lawsuit claims that Dartmouth failed to provide the plaintiffs with support, accommodations or guidance, then unilaterally terminated the disciplinary process without seeking their input.\\n\\nPreviously, school officials said they applauded the courage of the women who came forward. However, we respectfully, but strongly, disagree with the characterizations of Dartmouth's actions in the complaint and will respond through our own court filings, they said.\\n\\nDeborah Marcuse, an attorney representing seven women plaintiffs in the sexual harassment lawsuit, said the initiatives miss the mark and simply bring the school into compliance with federal law.\\n\\nTo the extent that Dartmouth is now seeking to conform its policies to what federal law requires, we certainly support that though we think it's long overdue, Marcuse said. What's striking about this is that Dartmouth continues to fail to acknowledge or accept responsibility for the damage that its long history of inaction has caused.\\n\\nMarcuse faulted the school for not reaching out to her clients for their input. Dartmouth's formal response to their complaint is due in a little over a week on January 15.\\n\\nIt appears to us that for all of the lip service to their courage, there has been no interest from Dartmouth in materially responding to or really listening to these women despite a lot of vague call outs to 'we want to include everyone and everything', she said.\\n\\nIf you just look at the nature of the various responses there really just isn't any acknowledgment that what these women experienced is something that has had any impact on Dartmouth at all."}
{"original": "(CNN) Twenty-four hours after the first contest among the Democrats seeking to replace him in November and 24 before he will be formally acquitted in the Senate impeachment trial, President Donald Trump delivered his third State of the Union address to a bicameral session of Congress on Tuesday night.\\n\\nIt was a decided departure from Trump's freewheeling campaign speeches and Twitter talk , a more measured recitation of his accomplishments in his first three years in office as he looks to run for and win a second term this fall.\\n\\nIn each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe!\\n\\nBelow, my initial takeaways from the speech.\\n\\n: On the same day a new Gallup poll came out showing an 84-point gap between Republican and Democratic approval of Trump, the bitter divide in Congress -- and the country -- was visible everywhere during the President's speech.\\n\\nTrump snubbed Speaker Nancy Pelosi's attempt to shake his hand before beginning his address. (The two reportedly haven't spoken in months.) Pelosi could be seen shaking her head -- albeit only slightly -- at several points during Trump's speech, including when he said his health care plan would protect all people with preexisting conditions.\\n\\nGiven that the House had impeached Trump just more than a month ago, it's not terribly surprising that partisanship pervaded the night. But wow was it thick -- all the way to the conclusion of the speech, when Pelosi took her revenge by very visibly ripping up her copy of Trump's prepared remarks.\\n\\n*Economy, economy, economy: Previewing his planned reelection message, Trump began his speech with an extended riff on the success of his economic policy -- declaring a great American comeback and proudly asserting: The state of our union is stronger than ever before.\\n\\nMany of the stats Trump used to back up that argument -- a 70% increase in the stock market since he entered the White House, record low unemployment for black and Hispanic people -- are familiar to anyone who has listened to or read the President's standard stump speech. As CNN's Daniel Dale notes, many of Trump's economic claims are heavily exaggerated\\n\\nTrump's economic focus is a savvy one from a political perspective. Poll after poll shows that a majority of Americans approve of how he has handled the economy -- a stark contrast with how his handling of issues like immigration and foreign policy is viewed.\\n\\nIf there was any doubt about the goal of all of this economic messaging, the chants of Four more years! from Republican House members and senators cleared that up quickly.\\n\\n* The greatest showman: State of the Union speeches are always heavy on theatrics -- ever since President Ronald Reagan brought Lenny Skutnik to sit in the gallery for : State of the Union speeches are always heavy on theatrics -- ever since President Ronald Reagan brought Lenny Skutnik to sit in the gallery for his 1982 State of the Union address . But Trump relishes the dramatic and the provocative, and man, did he ever lean into both of those elements in this speech.\\n\\nLimbaugh, the father of conservative talk radio, was on hand just days after announcing he was suffering from advanced lung cancer. Not only did Trump inform Limbaugh that he would be receiving the presidential Medal of Freedom -- the highest honor for a civilian in this country -- but the President had first lady Melania Trump, who was sitting next to Limbaugh, actually pin the medal around his neck while the assembled members of Congress looked on.\\n\\nIn the closing moments of the speech, Trump was at it again -- surprising a military wife and her two young children with the return of her long-deployed husband. It was the stuff of daytime talk shows -- but played out in this most formal of settings.\\n\\n* Trump, defiant: Gone were any attempts at bipartisan outreach or proposals inspired by his political opponents. In their place were harsh and direct attacks on Democrats in the chamber who had previously voted for some version of the Medicare For All legislation that would eliminate the private insurance market. We will never let socialism take over health care, Trump roared in a direct challenge to the Democrats sitting before him.\\n\\nAt another point, Trump savaged those who support what he described as free health care for illegal aliens. In his words:\\n\\nIf forcing American taxpayers to provide unlimited free health care to illegal aliens sounds fair to you, then stand with the radical left. But if you believe that we should defend American patients and American seniors, then stand with me and pass legislation to prohibit free government health care for illegal aliens!\\n\\nThere was no attempt at conciliation in either Trump's proposals or his rhetoric. He was utterly defiant. And deeply dismissive of the Democrats standing -- or, more accurately, sitting -- against him.\\n\\n* Infrastructure Week!!! In a speech with very few nods to common-ground issues, it was notable that when Trump mentioned the need to rebuild America's infrastructure, both sides of the House stood for a bit of prolonged applause."}

It is two thirds of the world's population, half of its economy -- and those shares will only grow.\\n\\nThe kingdom is the world's largest oil exporter, so it's little surprise that energy is top billing as Salman travels with 1,500 people in tow. He's already been to Malaysia and Indonesia, with economic giants Japan and China up next.\\n\\nRelated: Here's how the Saudi king travels\\n\\nGoing where the growth is\\n\\nThe big focus for major oil producers is on markets where demand is growing. Right now, that means Asia.\\n\\nGrowth in global demand for crude is forecast to accelerate to 1.4 million barrels a day this year, according to FACTS Global Energy. One million of that is expected to come from Asia.\\n\\nOther oil producing heavyweights haven't overlooked that fact. Saudi Arabia is vying with other Arab states as well as Iran and Russia for a bigger slice of the Asian market.\\n\\nRelated: Saudi economy will barely grow this year, IMF says\\n\\nPreparing for a mega IPO\\n\\nIt's not just the region's fast growing emerging markets that are important. Japan's mature economy has overtaken China as Saudi Arabia's largest oil customer, according to Fereidun Fesharaki, chairman of FACTS Global Energy.\\n\\nThis is why the king is going to Japan, he said. It is very important for them that they keep the Japanese market warm.\\n\\nJapan holds other interests, too. Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund is teaming up with Japanese firm SoftBank (SFTBF) to launch a massive $100 billion tech investment fund.\\n\\nThe kingdom may also want to court Japanese investors as it prepares to sell shares in state oil giant Aramco next year in what's expected to be the world's biggest ever IPO.\\n\\nIn Malaysia and Indonesia, Saudi Arabia signed refining deals worth $13 billion -- major investments in fast-growing markets that could help bolster Aramco's IPO plans, and secure new outlets for its crude oil.\\n\\nRelated: Trump is banking on a big tech investment (from the Middle East)\\n\\nLooking beyond oil\\n\\nAfter Tokyo comes Beijing, where Aramco has its Asian headquarters. Saudi Arabia and China already have refineries in each other's territory.\\n\\nBut there is plenty to consider beyond energy. Saudi Arabia is eager for China to help its drive to diversify and break free of its oil addiction, a top priority of King Salman's young but powerful son, Deputy Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman.\\n\\nHis big plan, Saudi Vision 2030, aims to boost the role of the private sector and make the kingdom a competitive hub for manufacturing and services. The need for change has been highlighted by the pain inflicted on the Saudi economy by the drop in oil prices in recent years.\\n\\nWhen you have to start thinking of your non-oil future... then all of a sudden geography matters, Simpfendorfer said.\\n\\nSaudi Arabia's renewed interest in Asia dovetails nicely with Chinese President Xi Jinping's One Belt, One Road plan. The initiative is aimed at connecting China with over 60 countries -- from Asia to the Middle East and Europe -- through the rebuilding of roads, railways and ports to speed up trade.\\n\\nRelated: Chinese President Xi Jinping defends globalization\\n\\n'The Chinese provide the options'\\n\\nChina's ruling Communist Party has a history of delivering on long-term strategic projects. That's an approach the Saudis would like to emulate after failing to think beyond oil for a long time.\\n\\nYou have somebody in China who has technology, money, people and the market, and somebody in Saudi Arabia who wants to look at future options, Fesharaki said. The Chinese provide the options.\\n\\nThose options, strategists say, take on added importance after the inauguration of President Trump, whose policy towards the complex and volatile Middle East remains unclear.\\n\\nSaudi [Arabia] rediscovered Asia over the last 10 years, yet momentum was fading, Simpfendorfer said. Now, rising political uncertainty elsewhere has reinvigorated that push."}
{"original": "The British pound is on a scorching rally, making it the best performing major currency of the year so far.\\n\\nBadly battered in the aftermath of Britain's 2016 vote to leave the European Union, the currency has staged a major comeback, and has climbed 6% against the dollar and 3% against the euro this year alone.\\n\\nThe pound is gaining ground despite the fact that Brexit remains full of uncertainties. A trade deal between the United Kingdom and the European Union, its biggest trading partner, is far from certain, meaning the country might still crash out of the bloc without one. That would be disastrous for British companies and the wider economy.\\n\\nSo why the boom in the pound?\\n\\nKallum Pickering, senior economist at Berenberg, said that while the United Kingdom is missing out on the current global growth upswing because of Brexit, the economy is still doing much better than investors anticipated after the referendum.\\n\\nThe economy grew by 1.7% in 2017. That was weaker than 2016, but way better than the 1.1% predicted by the International Monetary Fund in the wake of the referendum. (Before the vote in June 2016, the IMF had forecast the United Kingdom to grow by 2.2% in 2017.)\\n\\nAt the same time, the Bank of England has started slowly tightening monetary policy. It hiked interest rates in November for the first time in a decade. Analysts have penciled in two hikes this year, and two more in 2019.\\n\\nStronger than expected growth and rate hike expectations have combined to push the pound higher.\\n\\nThe deep lows from which the pound recovered make the gains even more impressive. The currency lost as much as 20% of its value against the dollar in the first year after the referendum. At one point, it dropped to a 31-year low of $1.20. Now it buys $1.42, just 3% below where it was trading the day before the Brexit referendum.\\n\\nRelated: Brexit is 1 year away. Here's what could still go wrong\\n\\nThe rally against the dollar hit a brief pause, however, on Tuesday, as the pound dropped 0.2%.\\n\\nData published on Tuesday showed British unemployment dropped to 4.2% in the three months to February, the lowest since 1975. Wages grew faster than inflation for the first time in a year, but at a weaker rate than expected by economists."}
{"original": "(CNN) —\\n\\nNew York Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and allied progressive groups are ramping up their push for a Green New Deal.\\n\\nThe initiative came to national prominence after Ocasio-Cortez joined young activists from the Sunrise Movement at a protest in then-Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi's office during orientation for incoming House freshman last year.\\n\\nOcasio-Cortez, the Justice Democrats, a progressive group that recruited the Bronx-born New Yorker to run, and Sunrise are now poised to throw their organizing muscle behind the ambitious suite of policy proposals, which would move the country toward 100% renewable energy through a series of economic reforms, including a jobs guarantee and heavy public investment in low or no-carbon infrastructure like light rail for commuters.\\n\\nMovement leaders do not agree on a price tag. Estimates run in the hundreds of billions of dollars, or more. But they argue a combination of tax hikes on the super wealthy – Ocasio-Cortez has floated a 70% rate on income over $10 million – and cuts to fossil fuel industry subsidies and military spending, in addition to the stimulative effects of the new public spending would offset any cost.\\n\\nAs part of the new outreach, organizers will train volunteers – online and in-person at a series of events this spring – to more effectively confront elected officials and ask for their support. The Road to a GND Tour was drawn up as a traveling pressure campaign designed to secure the support of political leaders, from mayors and city council members to federal lawmakers, around the country.\\n\\nThe idea of a Green New Deal has, in just a few months, become a central piece of Ocasio-Cortez's agenda and attracted the attention of ambitious national Democrats.\\n\\nI am thrilled to see so many of the potential 2020 presidential candidates embracing the idea of a Green New Deal, Ocasio-Cortez told CNN. The oil and gas lobbyists won't back down without a fight and that's why we need to support groups like Sunrise Movement in their efforts to keep the pressure up. When the scientific consensus says that you have 12 years to avoid climate catastrophe, it's time to get to work.\\n\\nThose efforts are also now slated to include a large scale demonstration outside one of the first Democratic presidential primary debates, where Sunrise organizers are hoping that thousands of young activists will gather to demand the candidates onstage back the program. So far, Sens. Bernie Sanders, Jeff Merkley, Kamala Harris, Elizabeth Warren and Cory Booker have – to varying degrees – offered their support.\\n\\nOcasio-Cortez's efforts on Capitol Hill have so far met with mixed reactions from even liberal lawmakers. Her request to establish a committee specifically focused on developing and advancing a Green New Deal mostly fell flat with Democratic leadership, which has instead empaneled a Select Committee on the Climate Crisis to be chaired by Florida Rep. Kathy Castor.\\n\\nCastor came under fire from climate activists and some progressive Democrats after telling E&E News in December that she would not deny seats on the panel to members who had accepted donations from the fossil fuel industry, calling it a First Amendment issue. She has since backed off that position and pledged, in a subsequent interview with Sludge, to forswear those contributions herself. But the committee is not expected to have subpoena power, a sticking point with progressives who want the authority to compel energy executives to appear under oath.\\n\\nDemocratic leaders had an opportunity to embrace young people's energy and back the Green New Deal, but they failed us once again, Sunrise co-founder Varshini Prakash said in a statement. In 2019, we're going to talk to the millions of young people scared about climate change and get them organizing to demand that every congressional and presidential candidate back the Green New Deal.\\n\\nSunrise, along with Ocasio-Cortez and the Justice Democrats, are concerned that the committee itself is not committed to addressing climate change issues over the 12-year timeline addressed in the detailed and dire October report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.\\n\\nI don't want to see my own district under water and I know that Leader Pelosi doesn't either and I know that what we need to show her is we're here to back her up in pushing for 100% renewable energy, Ocasio-Cortez told CNN during the November sit-in at Pelosi's office. This is to show that we are here to back up bold action and that, you know she will be supported in that.\\n\\nIn response, they are also threatening to launch or back more aggressive primary challenges in 2020 to Democratic members who oppose or stay silent on the Green New Deal.\\n\\nWe're going to recruit Democratic primary challengers for House races in 2020 who will fight with us, said Alexandra Rojas, executive director of the Justice Democrats, and we'll keep putting pressure on Democrats in Congress and those running for President in 2020 to support the Green New Deal."}
{"original": "Anyone looking for clues as to what President Trump might include in his much-promised revamp of his tax reform proposal may have gotten a clue over the weekend.\\n\\nOr not.\\n\\nIn an interview with Jesse Watters of Fox News, Trump reiterated his oft-stated desire to cut taxes for everyone -- both businesses and individuals. He also noted that the number of tax brackets would be reduced from seven to three or four.\\n\\nThat might signal a change from his latest proposal in which he called for just three brackets -- a 12% bracket, a 25% bracket and a 33% bracket -- just as the House Republican's tax reform blueprint does.\\n\\nRelated: How Paul Ryan and Donald Trump differ on tax reform\\n\\nTrump then went on to say, I'd like to see 0[%] if you don't make much, like 0. That's what it's going to be, it's going to be 0 up to a level.\\n\\nIn other words, the first $X you earn would be taxed at 0%. And that 0% is possibly the fourth bracket to which Trump alluded.\\n\\nBut here's the thing: Under today's code, the standard deduction effectively serves as a 0% rate, said Len Burman, a former deputy assistant secretary for tax analysis at Treasury.\\n\\nThat is, your adjusted gross income is automatically reduced by $6,300 if you're single, or by $12,600 if you're married filing jointly. So it removes that amount from your federal taxable income.\\n\\nBoth Trump and the House GOP blueprint have already proposed greatly increasing the standard deduction. House Republicans would nearly double it while Trump would go farther -- raising it to $15,000 for singles and $30,000 for married couples.\\n\\nHaving both (a 0% bracket and a standard deduction) wouldn't make much sense, said Roberton Williams, a senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center.\\n\\nSo perhaps the president was suggesting that the newest iteration of his tax reform proposal would offer a 0% bracket in place of a bigger standard deduction. Or maybe he was merely emphasizing the effect a larger standard deduction would have for those who don't earn much. Or maybe he was just hinting that his next plan will do a better job of not increasing taxes for some low- and moderate income parents, who might be hurt by various other changes he called for, such as a repeal of certain exemptions and the head of household status.\\n\\nTrump also suggested that in his next tax proposal the first rate above 0% might be different than in his latest version. But he wasn't specific on what the final numbers would be.\\n\\nThen it's going to be 12.5%, 15%, it's going to be 10%. We're working on the different numbers.\\n\\nRelated: 6 reasons tax reform may not happen this year\\n\\nIt's not clear when the White House will put forth a new proposal.\\n\\nWhat seems increasingly evident, however, is that tax reform will not be completed this summer as originally promised and possibly not even this year. True tax reform is always harder than it seems. Plus, the process of repealing and replacing Obamacare is taking longer than expected and will push aside tax reform until lawmakers can come to some agreement."}

Although Powell called the December jobs report very strong, he stressed that the Fed is always prepared to shift the stance of policy if needed.\\n\\nWe will be patient as we watch to see how the economy evolves, Powell said.\\n\\nStrong jobs market\\n\\nFriday's jobs report signaled the US economy still has some strength left in it.\\n\\nEmployers added 312,000 jobs in December, well more than economists had forecast. Friday's jobs report was the biggest surprise of the economic cycle, according to Goldman Sachs\\n\\nThe unemployment rate rose to 3.9% because many people reentered the workforce. And paychecks grew a better-than-expected 3.2% from a year ago as employers raised wages to attract new workers. Average hourly pay was up 3.2% compared to a year earlier. The average number of hours people worked also edged up.\\n\\nIt seems to be a pretty good indication that the economy isn't anywhere close to recession, at least for now, said Brian Rose, chief Americas economist at UBS Asset Management.\\n\\nChina stimulus\\n\\nStocks also got a boost after China took steps to encourage bank lending and stimulate the country's flagging economy. The People's Bank of China announced it would slash the amount of money that banks are required to hold in reserve, the latest in a series of policy changes the government has taken to support growth.\\n\\nChina's slowing economy has been a prime factor in the extreme market volatility of the past several months.\\n\\nAnalysts at Macquarie Capital said that the rate cut shows government efforts to support the economy have now moved to the second level and should signal to investors that more stimulus is in the pipeline.\\n\\nRoller coaster ride\\n\\nThe up and down market continues.\\n\\nStocks tumbled Thursday. The Dow plunged 660 points, following Apple's (AAPL) warning that its sales would fall well short of guidance, largely because of China's economic slowdown. They fell even further after a weak manufacturing report suggested the trade war was harming both China and the United States' economy.\\n\\nStocks have been unusually volatile in recent weeks. The S&P 500 was up or down more than 1% nine times in December, compared to only eight times in all of 2017.\\n\\nJapan's Nikkei index dropped 2.3% Friday, that market's first day of trading following the New Year break.\\n\\nCNN's Matt Egan contributed to this report."}
{"original": "(CNN) -- Maybe it was the sound of the wind cutting through the wire. Perhaps he caught a small vibration with his keen eyes. Or it could have been a slight difference in the air's smell.\\n\\nWhatever it was, when Sarge noticed that his Marine Corps handler, Fred Dorr, was creeping down the wrong path in the Vietnam jungle, the German shepherd did something he'd never done out in the field: He looked at Dorr and barked, before taking a seat.\\n\\nWhen he sat down, I knew there was a trip wire. I was one step away from it, remembered Dorr, who with his dog in 1969 was walking point, leading the way for a dozen soldiers. Had the hidden explosive device been tripped, It would have gotten half of us.\\n\\nMore than 40 years later, the gratitude and love Dorr, 59, feels for the dog he served with is as strong as ever. And it's for this reason that Dorr, president of the Vietnam Dog Handler Association, drove from his Yoakum, Texas, home to be in Southern California this week.\\n\\nAbout 200 Vietnam War dog handlers, who were trained to read and communicate with their canine partners, have gathered for a reunion. And on Saturday they'll join an expected several thousand others for the 10th anniversary rededication of the War Dog Memorial at the March Air Reserve Base in Riverside.\\n\\nDuring the Vietnam War, more than 4,000 dogs served in various positions, said Michael Lemish, a military dog historian and author of Forever Forward: K-9 Operations in Vietnam.\\n\\nThe scout dogs, such as Sarge, walked with their handlers ahead of patrols -- making them the first target for ambushes or hidden explosives. There were also sentry dogs who guarded bases, tracker dogs who followed the trail of enemies and mine and booby trap dogs who sniffed out dangers hidden beneath the ground.\\n\\nThe Viet Cong placed a bounty on the dogs because they were so effective, Lemish said. All told, he estimated the K-9 teams averted more than 10,000 casualties. But at the end of the war, only about 200 dogs came home. The rest who had survived were either euthanized or turned over to the South Vietnamese -- left behind, a surplus of war.\\n\\nThey were treated as obsolete equipment. And if you were a handler, you couldn't see them that way, said Jack Kowall, 61, who keeps a framed picture of himself and Eric, the black lab and shepherd mix he worked with, atop his desk in Marietta, Georgia. When that's your dog, that's your dog. He sees you in danger, he's going to respond. Unconditional love -- it's all for you. You can't help but love him.\\n\\nOn patrols, Kowall used hand motions to speak to Eric. In turn, the animal spoke back through his movements. His ears would shoot up and turn in the direction of suspicious noise. The hair on his back would stand up if danger was close. If he wanted Kowall to stop moving, he'd look back at him.\\n\\nOff-duty, Eric was playful. He liked to have his neck scratched and would roll around on the ground. The 110-pound dog would cuddle up to Kowall at night when they were out in the field, and he'd eat out of his handler's helmet. Whenever Kowall could, he'd give his closest friend steak.\\n\\nThe men who'd walk behind the pair on missions were always different. But a scout handler and his dog were a constant, as the duo bounced between different assignments.\\n\\nWhen Jeffrey Bennett, founder and former CEO of Nature's Recipe pet foods, first learned about the dogs who'd served and the fate of so many of them, he set out to teach others. Based on about three years of research, he co-produced the documentary War Dogs: America's Forgotten Heroes, which first aired 11 years ago on the Discovery Channel.\\n\\nDonations earned through this film allowed Bennett, now president of the War Dog Memorial, to commission three monuments, sculptures featuring a German shepherd and his handler.\\n\\nThe first one was unveiled at the March Field Air Museum in Riverside. A second was installed at Fort Benning, Georgia. The third remains in storage, Bennett said. The original goal to place it in Washington beside the Vietnam Veterans Memorial or at Arlington National Cemetery in Virginia remains an elusive dream.\\n\\nDogs have long served with the U.S. military, said Lemish, who also wrote War Dogs: A History of Loyalty and Heroism. During World War I, the dogs borrowed from the French and British worked as messengers and assisted the Red Cross by finding the wounded on battlefields, he said. The American K-9 corps, Lemish said, really began during World War II, when, among other tasks, thousands of dogs donated by civilians patrolled shorelines.\\n\\nBack then, dogs sent abroad were retrained and returned to civilian life, but that practice had changed by the time U.S. forces entered Vietnam, Lemish said. Later, galvanized by the attention earned through the documentary, Vietnam War dog handlers began to call for change.\\n\\nJohnny Mayo, 60, hadn't spoken to another dog handler in 30 years when he showed up in Washington for his first reunion in 2000. But as he talked to the 250 others in attendance, he realized the power of what they shared.\\n\\nYou go through the war, and you always remember the bond you have, the bond with the dog, said Mayo, whose dog Kelly once yanked him up a bank from a rice paddy, out of the way of mortar fire. On that first trip to the [Vietnam Veterans Memorial] wall, it was a reunion with the spirits of our dogs.\\n\\nLater, Mayo, of Lexington, South Carolina, would go on to write his own book and establish a traveling exhibit to pay tribute to the dogs who'd served.\\n\\nWashington also took notice. In November 2000, President Clinton signed into law legislation that established a military working dog adoption program. Now the dogs working in Iraq and Afghanistan will have a chance to find comfortable homes when they return from war.\\n\\nFor Dorr, of the Vietnam Dog Handler Association, this has been a blessing. He said leaving his partner Sarge behind, all those decades ago, haunted him.\\n\\nA lot of us [handlers] suffered PTSD, he said, referring to post-traumatic stress disorder. It's like leaving your kid back there.\\n\\nBut he now has Bluma, the war dog he adopted from Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio, Texas. The German shepherd, who has hip problems, looks uncannily like Sarge, he said, and having him around is a source of comfort.\\n\\nI'm taking care of an old vet, Dorr said, and he's taking care of me."}
{"original": "(CNN) See ball, hit ball, see putt, hole putt, go to the next.\\n\\nThat's how Rory McIlroy described the process going on between golf wizard Dustin Johnson's ears, a very different approach altogether than that of scientist Bryson DeChambeau\\n\\nHe makes the game so simple, or makes it look so simple at times, said McIlroy during Johnson's spellbinding five-shot Masters victory at Augusta in November.\\n\\nThat simplicity may come in Johnson's fast approach, something the 36-year-old identified as both a positive and a negative in his coming-of-age season a decade ago.\\n\\nI was always a fast player [...] there's only two things that can happen, you hit a good shot or a bad shot, so why waste time doing it? Johnson said at the 2010 Tour Championship, the year he twice squandered final-round leads at majors.\\n\\nTiger Woods helps Masters' champion Johnson with his Green Jacket.\\n\\nWhatever he's taken on board in the 10 years since, it's worked. He's gone home with two majors, had more weeks at world No.1 (111) than anyone other than Tiger Woods (683), Greg Norman (331) and McIlroy (106) and won PGA Tour events every season for his first 13 years. Regarding that last achievement, only Jack Nicklaus (17) and Woods (14) have done better.\\n\\nHis success has given the relatively softly-spoken Johnson a platform, with the South Carolinian saying in 2017 he thought an introduction of shot clocks on the PGA Tour would be a good idea.\\n\\nThat would be quite fun, actually. I'd have plenty of time but there's a lot of guys that wouldn't. They would be getting a penalty on every hole.\\n\\nIn 2018, the European Tour introduced the innovative Shot Clock Masters in Austria -- where players had between 40 and 50 seconds to hit their shots -- and experimentation with GolfSixes for another more dynamic format has since followed.\\n\\nHowever, such measures have hardly halted the slow play scourge.\\n\\nAshley Chesters hits his second shot on the eighth hole during day four of the 2018 Shot Clock Masters.\\n\\nRare penalties\\n\\nIn the 1950s, Augusta National co-founder and chairman Clifford Roberts demanded two-ball groups complete a round in three hours -- final round included.\\n\\nYet despite some rounds approaching six hours at the world-famous course, to date the only slow play penalty at the Masters came in 2013, when 14-year-old Chinese debutant Tianlang Guan had to add a shot to his total late in his second round.\\n\\nTianlang Guan walks up the 18th fairway during the second round of the Masters. Guan was given a one-shot penalty following his second shot on the 17th hole when he again exceeded the 40 second time limit.\\n\\nMeanwhile, the PGA Tour went from 1995-2017 without handing out a slow play penalty -- having come into effect in 1994.\\n\\nAt September's KPMG Women's PGA Championship, Czech player Klara Spilkova was docked two shots, costing her a place in the third round. In 2019, there were a number of fines and a further two-stroke penalty on the LPGA Tour and in 2018, six fines were handed out plus four two-stroke penalties, in contrast to 34 fines in 2016.\\n\\nIt's hard to play fast, I feel like, out here just because of all the slopes on the greens and the winds and if you're just a little bit off, you're going to leave yourself in tough spots, two-time major champion Anna Nordqvist said at Aronimink after the Spilkova incident.\\n\\nI think you're kind of in your bubble out there and you just try to speed up as much as you can, but it's hard to do it because you tend to be pretty far away from the hole.\\n\\nFellow double major winner Stacy Lewis spoke more critically -- and praised the European Tour's more aggressive policy -- after winning the Ladies Scottish Open in August, her final round taking five hours and 16 minutes.\\n\\nIt shouldn't take that long to play. I knew it was going to, that's the sad part. I do think an effort needs to be made across the board to play faster, because obviously I wasn't watching it on TV, but I'm sure it couldn't have been fun to watch on TV.\\n\\nI've been an advocate for changing our pace of play, getting people to play faster for a long time, and we're still going the other way unfortunately.\\n\\nStacy Lewis hits her first shot on the third hole during the second round of the Walmart NW Arkansas Championship.\\n\\nOverthinking it\\n\\nProfessionals will argue they are doing their job, like a builder is contracted to construct a house and wouldn't want to rush their work.\\n\\nArguably the longer you take, the worse you play. Not always, but it has precedent on golf's biggest stage.\\n\\nTake Australian Norman's 1996 Masters capitulation. Playing exquisite golf to establish a six-shot, 54-hole lead with a sharp and precise pre-shot routine, he fell away badly under pressure from Nick Faldo to lose by five shots.\\n\\nHis routine is so different, said Faldo's coach David Leadbetter. He's standing over the ball an incredible amount of time. I'd say he's spending six, seven seconds longer per shot, fidgeting, moving around in ways I've never seen him do.\\n\\nFaldo added: Normally with Greg it's shuffle, shuffle, then grip, grip and bang! He doesn't have any hitch.\\n\\nFaldo (left) watches playing partner Greg Norman tee off on the first hole during third round of play in the Masters.\\n\\nBrooks Koepka, the in-form men's player in majors of the last few years, takes very little time over the ball while DeChambeau, criticized before for his deliberate approach, says his pre-shot routine has sped up.\\n\\nAfter the US Open winner was lambasted for taking nearly 150 seconds to hit an eight-foot putt in August 2019, at the Abu Dhabi Championship in January, he voiced views similar to those of Nordqvist but also spoke in favor of quicker rounds.\\n\\nLook, I don't want to be out there for six hours, nor does anybody, right. And there's numerous times out there, more than not, I'm waiting -- our group is waiting for people to go, and so I certainly don't want to be waiting on players. It's going to hurt my momentum. Every time it happens, I feel like I get cold.\\n\\nWillett runs between shots during a round of speed golf.\\n\\nSpeed golf\\n\\nFor some golfers however, it's about playing 18 holes in more like 30 minutes.\\n\\nRunning or jogging is nothing new for golfers off the course. But on it is a whole different game.\\n\\nWhat's needed: a few clubs (a maximum of seven are permitted), a lightweight bag, running shoes, yellow balls (for added visibility) and your running game. Oh, and don't forget a head lamp, as you'll more than likely find yourself at the course at the crack of dawn or when the sun is going down.\\n\\nPGA professional Luke Willett told CNN that when he was doing some preparation for a sub-30 minute round at the 3,705-yard, par-58 Sunningdale Heath Golf Club outside London, the professional at the club told him twice European Tour winner Robert Rock had shot five-over in fine tuning for tournament play.\\n\\nA few weeks later, the in-form Rock posted his best finish on tour for seven years with third at the Scottish Open.\\n\\nWillett meanwhile, on a late October morning, scorched around the course in 26 minutes, carding a score of eight-over (66). Two days earlier, he posted a 68 in a similar time.\\n\\nWillett (right) along with golf course architect Tim Lobb and Tom Pilcher.\\n\\nAnd just a week earlier, the 36-year-old flew around the Springs Golf Club in Oxfordshire -- from tees specially set up to ensure the course played 6,000 yards -- in 37 minutes, needing 83 shots (11-over).\\n\\nIt was a blur, a rollercoaster and a thrill for sure. Running around a golf course makes you feel great and we all need those good vibes right now, dad of three Willett, who thrives on the adventure speed golf brings, said.\\n\\nRichmond Park Golf Course coach Chris Benians, who played a number of European Tour events between 1998-2003 including a 14th-place finish at the 1999 Ivory Coast Open on the Challenge Tour -- won by Ian Poulter -- told CNN it was the reactive element to speed golf he found the most beneficial.\\n\\nEvery tournament golfer knows we overthink. I was a really good chipper and I chip in more as a speed golfer than I ever did as a tournament golfer. I see it and do it.\\n\\nFormer fastest hole world record holder Steve Jeffs , whose 1 minute 50.6 second effort in 2017 on a 500-yard hole was topped by Belgian Thomas Detry in June 2019 with a time of 1:29:62, told CNN that speed golf's inclusivity was also positive.\\n\\nIf I talk to regular golfers they think I'm mad and everybody else who plays speed golf is mad. It's the polar opposite of what golf normally is, said Jeffs, who has renewed confidence he can become a consistent, low handicap player.\\n\\nIt's incredible what it does for your game."}

Nicole Mason C. Nicole Mason\\n\\nGains in the stock market and the robust economy obscure the reality that many of the most marginalized workers, those with limited skills and education, are still struggling. Under Trump, the wealthy are doing extremely well, while the middle-class is hanging on.\\n\\nOn Friday, more than 800,000 federal workers across the country will go without a paycheck if the government fails to reopen. Trump says these workers will make adjustments as the shutdown could last months, even years. This, no doubt, will have a trickle-down effect on small businesses and others who rely on these workers to purchase goods and products.\\n\\nThe wall between Mexico and the United States, cheered by Trump's most ardent supporters as a metaphorical and political symbol of America First, has lost its appeal to some as the government shutdown has dragged on. Furloughed workers and those who sympathize with them have begun to realize the wall will not feed their families, keep their lights on or make sure their mortgage is paid.\\n\\nBut there are other reasons American workers may be disenchanted with the President. Trump campaigned on a promise to bring back coal mining jobs. Yet, as Bloomberg reported, analysts say that Trump's plan for the coal industry is not likely to have a large effect on its fortunes.\\n\\nAt campaign rallies and in interviews, Trump likes to say that he turned the West Virginia economy around by cutting energy regulations, but over the last decade, middle-class West Virginia households have seen no overall income gains from the state's modest economic growth, and there has been no sustained surge in the state's economy under Trump. These kinds of results will continue unless we are able to turn away from the divisive politics and rhetoric, and focus on building an economy that works for the majority of Americans – not just the few.\\n\\nWorking-class black and Latino Americans are also losing under Trump. In his address to the nation Tuesday night, President Trump asserted that illegal migration hurts all Americans by driving down jobs and wages, specifically impacting African-Americans and Hispanics. This is a bid to whip up support among both groups for the wall and his nativist immigration policies.\\n\\nWhile it is true that African-Americans and Hispanics tend to be employed in lower wage jobs than white and Asian workers, and compete in the labor market with undocumented immigrants for those jobs, it cannot be ignored that some US employers and corporations often exploit immigrant labor for their gain, by paying them less, forcing them to work in deplorable conditions, or threatening to deport them if they complain.\\n\\nThese habits not only harm undocumented immigrants, but American middle-class workers as well by suppressing wages and making it nearly impossible to demand safer working conditions or benefits without the fear of being fired. If Trump is concerned about the well-being of these black and Hispanic American workers, he should do more than suggest a wall to address the income disparity.\\n\\nCome March, if the government fails to reopen, tens of millions of Americans could lose their Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits, putting their families at risk of food insecurity. According to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, in 2017, 42 million Americans participated in the SNAP program – and more than 44% of them were in working families. It is hard to accept that this protracted and partisan skirmish over a wall could soon bring real hardship to the lives of the most vulnerable Americans.\\n\\nGet our free weekly newsletter Sign up for CNN Opinion's new newsletter.\\n\\nJoin us on Twitter and Facebook\\n\\nIn 2016, the white working class was cautiously optimistic, while others of us held our breath for the deal-maker and mega-businessman Donald Trump to work his magic to bring back jobs and revive struggling industries.

{"original": "Sylvia Rosas decided to go to the emergency room after getting stung by a bee in her yard in Valrico, Florida. She had experienced allergic reactions in the past, but didn't have an EpiPen on hand.\\n\\nHowever, what really hurt was the $12,000 bill she received for the visit to the ER.\\n\\nThe 53-year-old said she was seen by several doctors, who ordered thousands of dollars in blood tests and an EKG during the 2015 visit that lasted less than two hours. Since the hospital was out of network, her insurer wouldn't cover the visit, and she ended up having to pay the entire bill.\\n\\nNever did I think I'd have this type of a bill, said Rosas, a mortgage loan officer who says she's now hesitant to go to the doctor. I was there for such a short time.\\n\\nRosas isn't the only one getting hit with big bills after a trip to the ER.\\n\\nSpending on an emergency room visit rose to $1,917, on average, in 2016, up more than 31% from four years earlier, according to the Health Care Cost Institute, which analyzes spending and usage of nearly 40 million Americans with employer-sponsored coverage.\\n\\nThe spike in spending was driven almost entirely by an increase in the prices charged by hospitals, even as ER usage remained relatively flat. The spending covers the hospitals' charges for stepping foot in the ER, known as a facility fee, as well as some tests and services. It doesn't include ER evaluations by doctors, who usually send patients a separate bill.\\n\\nOverall, the soaring price of ER visits, along with steep hikes in prescription drugs and outpatient surgery costs, have helped fuel a 15% increase in overall health care spending, the institute found.\\n\\nThere may be several reasons why it's getting costlier to go to the emergency room, experts said.\\n\\nThe price hikes stem in part from the fact that ERs are seeing a greater number of patients with more severe medical problems, said Niall Brennan, the institute's CEO.\\n\\nHospitals base their ER facility fee charge on the severity of the condition they are treating. Folks with simpler issues, such as cuts or fevers, are more often turning to urgent care centers or pharmacy clinics. So emergency rooms are more likely to receive patients with serious problems, such as chest pain or asthma attacks, which are more expensive to treat.\\n\\nRelated: Americans spend more on health care, but have shorter life spans\\n\\nAlso, more emergency rooms now have access to advanced -- and pricey -- technology, such as CT scans and MRIs, said Renee Hsia, professor of emergency medicine and health policy at the University of California, San Francisco. And patients expect to have more testing done in the ER rather than waiting to go to a lab or doctor's office after they are discharged.\\n\\nThe American Hospital Association challenged the institute's study, saying that annual hospital price growth rates are at near record lows. But the industry group did agree that emergency rooms are treating more complex conditions, citing its report from 2013 that showed Medicare patients treated in the ER had more severe illnesses and visited more frequently.\\n\\nStill, many ER patients are stunned by the bills they receive.\\n\\nRick Brown tried to avoid going to the emergency room after he fell into a small hole by his pool in November and hurt his ankle. He tried icing and elevating it, but after a few days the pain was excruciating.\\n\\nHe finally went to the ER near his home in Brick, New Jersey, where he had an X-ray and was seen by a physician assistant. Brown, who arrived at the hospital on his own crutches, learned he had fractured his ankle. The 58-year-old was given a splint, a prescription for painkillers and a recommendation that he follow up with a specialist.\\n\\nA few weeks later, the bills started coming in -- including a $2,600 for the ER and $5,700 from a physicians' office. His insurance paid half the ER fee, but wouldn't cover the doctor charges because the provider was out-of-network.\\n\\nBrown, a bartender, was furious, noting that he was twice asked for his insurance card in the ER. Had he known he'd be on the hook for thousands of dollars, he said he would have hobbled out or waited to go to the doctor's appointment he had made for later in the week.\\n\\nTo have insurance and to be facing these astronomical bills, I get incensed, said Brown. You're in a lot of pain and you have insurance. You are expecting it to be covered.\\n\\nBrown plans to talk to the hospital and the physicians' office to try to reduce the charges.\\n\\nRelated: 4 reasons why US health care is so expensive\\n\\nThat's a good move, said Martin Makary, professor of surgery and health policy at Johns Hopkins University. When patients come to the ER, they don't need to sign any paperwork promising to pay in full, Makary said. Federal law requires emergency rooms to screen and stabilize anyone who comes through the doors.\\n\\nMakary published a study last year that found that hospitals mark up emergency services -- such as suturing a wound or interpreting a CT scan -- by an average of 340% more than what Medicare allows. (The Medicare allowable amount includes what Medicare reimburses, as well as any deductibles or co-pays the patients pay.) So consumers should try to bargain providers down if they get a big bill.\\n\\nPrices are highly fluctuant and often negotiable, he said. As with new cars, people are not expected to pay the sticker price."}

But before it can use the new vehicles, GM will need special approval from the federal government.\\n\\nThe company has filed a petition with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, requesting exemptions from 16 safety standards. It says these aren't relevant because the vehicle doesn't have manual controls.\\n\\nWhen you don't have a steering wheel, it makes no sense to talk about an airbag in a steering wheel, Paul Hemmersbaugh, GM's policy director for autonomous vehicles, told reporters.

That's the maximum number the government will currently allow for each manufacturer. The government views the exemptions as a way to bring the benefits of autonomous vehicles to public roads while regulators are still adapting existing laws for the new technology.\\n\\nCruise also released a safety report Friday detailing the steps it takes to ensure its vehicles are ready to drive on public roads. Cruise accounted for 22 of the 27 autonomous vehicle crashes in California in 2017. It has previously pointed to the challenges of testing in dense urban areas.\\n\\nIn October, Waymo, the self-driving unit of Google's (GOOGL) parent company, released a safety report of its own.

Bluntly, Brexit has shone a light on the fact that the foundations holding up the UK had been crumbling for some time.\\n\\nThe current deadlock in Westminster – and what it might mean for the union between England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland – is spooking politicians from all over the political divide.\\n\\nJacob Rees-Mogg, a longstanding Conservative Euroskeptic, told me earlier this week: The two greatest risks to the union are splitting Northern Ireland from Great Britain, as the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement with the EU proposes, and a second referendum, which would legitimize the calls for a second independence vote in Scotland.\\n\\nThe movement in the UK's politics and resulting divisions is nicely illustrated by the last eight years of its voting history.\\n\\nThe two greatest risks to the union are splitting Northern Ireland from Great Britain, as the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement with the EU proposes, and a second referendum, which would legitimize the calls for a second independence vote in Scotland. Jacob Rees-Mogg\\n\\nLet's take the 2010 general election as a starting point, in which voters opted for a coalition between David Cameron's Conservative Party and Nick Clegg's Liberal Democrats. These two centrists looked like a safe pair of hands at a time of turmoil in the immediate aftermath of the 2008 global financial crisis.\\n\\nOver the five years of the coalition, austerity measures were introduced that made most politics junkies certain that Labour would win back power under its then leader, Ed Miliband.\\n\\nBut a shock result in 2015 saw Cameron win a majority in Parliament. Scotland voted for the pro-independence Scottish Nationalist Party in huge numbers. After the failed Scottish independence referendum a year earlier, the general election result was a clear sign of just how wide the gap between England and Scotland had become.\\n\\nFast forward past the Brexit referendum and Cameron's own exit to Theresa May's 2017 snap election for more clues. Many voters in pro-Brexit areas of England snubbed her in favor of Labour's Jeremy Corbyn – who at the time had an unclear position on Brexit, though much of his party is pro-Europe. She lost her majority, but strangely picked up votes in Remain-supporting Scotland, despite her party backing the very definition of a so-called hard Brexit.\\n\\nPHOTO: TOLGA AKMEN/AFP/Getty Images Britain's Prime Minister Theresa May leaves from 10 Downing Street on December 17, 2018.\\n\\nClearly, the British public is divided – and that division is especially acute in the politics of the four nations.\\n\\nIn England, the UK's wealthiest and most populous city, London, stands in contrast to the rest of the country.\\n\\nIt is from London that the campaign for a second vote that could ultimately stop Brexit is being driven. But it was English votes that carried the victory for Leave. This creates tension not just in England, but in the union at large – the politics of the English are the most influential in the union and can often dictate policy that affects everyone.\\n\\nIn the case of Brexit, that means Scottish remainers feeling as though the English are dragging them out of the EU against their will. Alarmingly for unionists, recent polling showed that English Conservative voters (officially called the Conservative and Unionist Party) would be happy with the union breaking up in exchange for a good Brexit.\\n\\nThe division is more obvious in Scotland. The SNP would clearly like to push for a second independence referendum and rejoin the EU as an independent nation. Meanwhile, Scottish Conservatives would clearly prefer a softer form of Brexit to protect Scotland's economy while keeping the union together – something about which they disagree with their English counterparts.\\n\\nIn Northern Ireland, the devolved National Assembly has not sat in nearly two years after the power-sharing agreement that allows both unionists and republicans to be involved in government collapsed.\\n\\nDespite this, the Democratic Unionist Party holds the balance of power in Westminster and is currently one of the biggest obstacles to May getting her Brexit deal through Parliament.\\n\\nThey believe the deal ignores their most important demand: no friction between Northern Ireland and Great Britain. We do not want a hard border, we believe there are many ways of resolving it, the DUP's Emma Little-Pengelly said to me of the Irish border issue. Instead, she believes that May and the EU's solution aims to ensure no checks at all on the Irish border between two sovereign states by creating 68 new checks between Great Britain and Northern Ireland.\\n\\nIt must be worrying for the DUP that both those wanting May's deal to pass and hardline Brexit voters are so happy to see their red lines rubbed out for the sake of getting the job done.\\n\\nPHOTO: PAUL FAITH/AFP/AFP/Getty Images Traffic crosses the border into Northern Ireland from the Irish Republic.\\n\\nOne thing seems to have been forgotten by politicians in all this: some people in Brussels speak English. The UK's chaos has been watched with astonishment by EU officials.\\n\\nIt's still not clear what the UK wants, Guy Verhofstadt, Brexit coordinator for the EU Parliament, told CNN. I hope the deal agreed finds a majority. If not, then MPs have to work together to find a compromise solution on a future relationship. Whatever the choice, we need a withdrawal agreement to be agreed to avoid a disastrous no-deal outcome.\\n\\nLoathe as many in Westminster will be to take advice from a former Prime Minister of Belgium, he makes a solid point. Wild politics is not a good enough reason for a nation as important as the UK to fall into a black hole of its own creation.\\n\\nIt's still not clear what the UK wants. Guy Verhofstadt\\n\\nThe good news is that as things stand, both main parties believe the union should be preserved. It shouldn't be beyond the wit of our elected officials to forge some cross-party unity on a matter they claim to care so much about.\\n\\nAs Brexit reaches its apex, perhaps the minds of the political elite will sharpen and we will all start to see a way out of this hellscape. They need to make the public care about the union, or frankly, it's only going to crumble further.\\n\\nIf that doesn't happen, then the UK as we know it will have to continue to exist on life support.\\n\\nAnd if we don't take this moment to fix the union between the four nations, then distressingly few will be in mourning, should the switch get flipped."}
{"original": "The budget deal that President Trump signed into law Friday morning has plenty of critics. But it would do one unarguably good thing: avert a debt ceiling crisis for the next year.\\n\\nAnd yet the bipartisan deal accomplishes that in a back-door way -- by suspending the legal cap on U.S. borrowing for a year.\\n\\nThe debt limit is currently set at $20.456 trillion. Rather than raise that limit by a specific dollar amount -- which would require publicly acknowledging the country's costs going forward -- lawmakers chose to suspend the limit through March 1, 2019.\\n\\nA suspension lets the U.S. Treasury borrow as needed to satisfy the country's legal obligations in full and on time. Those obligations include everything from veteran benefits and military paychecks to contractor fees and bills incurred by all federal programs.\\n\\nOnce the suspension ends, the amount borrowed during the suspension period will be added to the legal debt limit.\\n\\nPolitically, it's easier to pass a suspension, said Shai Akabas, director of economic policy at the Bipartisan Policy Center.\\n\\nRelated: Trillion-dollar deficits will hit sooner than expected\\n\\nIn this case, more than a trillion dollars easier.\\n\\nThe Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimates that by March 2019, the new debt limit could be reset as high as $22 trillion, or $1.5 trillion higher than where it is today.\\n\\nThat reflects both the borrowing needs to pay the country's bills during the suspension period plus the costs of the special accounting measures that Treasury has been using since December 8, when the last suspension ended.\\n\\nSince 2013, Congress has passed 5 debt limit suspensions.\\n\\nRelated: Trump signs massive budget deal after Congress votes to reopen government\\n\\nGiven that the country regularly runs deficits, the Treasury must borrow to make up the difference between the revenue it takes in and the money it must pay out.\\n\\nNone of this should surprise anyone on Capitol Hill. After all, every time lawmakers have chosen to increase spending or cut taxes, they effectively require the country to borrow more in future years. And that makes it necessary to raise the debt limit periodically.\\n\\nThat's why fiscal experts stress that increasing the debt ceiling is not giving anyone license to spend more, despite what some politicians claim. It simply authorizes the Treasury to borrow what's needed to pay the country's commitments created by previous legislation.\\n\\nThat the decision is made separately from the actual budget decisions is a bigger problem, Akabas said."}

He was wrong with his words in Charlottesville, and I told him so at the time. He was badly wrong with his words yesterday. And it wasn't just his words.

Trump won't go away after this.\\n\\nDr. Demi Kouzounas, the chairwoman of the Maine Republican Party, said she believed Trump condemned the violence appropriately and said the resignations of some Cabinet members and calls for invoking the 25th Amendment or the impeachment of the President are an overreaction.\\n\\nThey may be concerned about their own political careers. I mean, none of us here feel that should be happening. But politics are politics, Kouzounas said.\\n\\nDespite the events of the last week, Republicans seemed confident about the direction of the party, despite losing two Senate runoffs in Georgia and as a result control of the Senate.\\n\\nOur party has grown. And we got so many more people to join the Republican Party, we got the most numbers ever in this election, nobody feels that the party is downswing, the party has risen, Kouzounas said. We still feel optimistic that the party is going in the right direction.\\n\\nThere was very little mention of Trump during the mostly procedural session on Friday.\\n\\nMcDaniel, in thanking the crowd for re-electing her, reflected back on Trump first nominating her to the role when she served as chair of the Michigan Republican Party, but didn't bring him up when talking about where the party goes from here.\\n\\nI am pissed about losing in critical elections, McDaniel said during her speech, not mentioning the President by name.\\n\\nThere was discussion of election fraud and making sure the RNC is better equipped to deal with the issue in future cycles, but there was no mention of any of the allegations of fraud made by the President about the November election.\\n\\nMcDaniel did take a moment to condemn the violence that occurred at the Capitol on Wednesday in the strongest possible terms.\\n\\nWe need this to stop. The violence needs to stop. And as the leader of the Republican Party, please don't do this. We can do things peacefully and that is the path we need to take, McDaniel said at the start of Friday's session. As the transition of power continues over the next two weeks, I call on individuals to respect law enforcement, law and order, and our great system of governance.\\n\\nRNC members and guests gathered in the hallways to talk about the events of the last week and many of them said that while the violence that occurred in Washington was wrong, they don't support the removal of the President.\\n\\nI'm not condoning it, it's disgraceful, said John Burnett, a co-chair of the New York State Republican Party, of the violence. I'm a business person. I look at risk. We only have two weeks. We can't wait this out for two weeks? Impeaching him is only going to do what, pour gasoline on a fire that we're all trying to make sure that we were putting it out with no more crazy activities locally or nationally."}
{"original": "So what should United Airlines have done?\\n\\nThe airline has admitted it was a mistake for police to forcibly remove a passenger who refused to give up his seat on a crowded plane. Video of the passenger being dragged up the aisle of the plane has been played nonstop for three days.\\n\\nUnited's CEO has apologized and said it won't happen again. But how could it have been prevented in the first place?\\n\\nThe easy answer is that United should have offered a lot more money until it found a volunteer to give up his or her seat.\\n\\nIt's just a financial solution, David Neeleman, the founder of JetBlue (JBLU), said Wednesday on CNN's New Day.\\n\\nOther passengers say the airline offered $800 before choosing people to give up their seats involuntarily, and then sending in law enforcement when one man wouldn't move. United says it increased the offer to $1,000 and didn't get volunteers.\\n\\nIf they had gone to $1,000, $2,000, whatever it would have taken, people would have raised their hands, said Neeleman, now CEO of the Brazilian airline Azul (AZUL). There would have been a stampede to get off the airplane at the right price.\\n\\nUnited (UAL) hasn't provided details of how it makes offers to passengers, but CEO Oscar Munoz said Wednesday that United policy denied the crew the flexibility they needed to find fliers who would voluntarily give up seats.\\n\\nFederal law says airlines don't have to pay more than $1,350 to passengers who are bumped involuntarily. But that doesn't stop the airline from offering more to persuade volunteers.\\n\\nMunoz told ABC's Good Morning America that the airline would review its rules to make sure crews were given the power to use their common sense.\\n\\nOther airline veterans agree the situation should never have gotten to the point of removing a passenger against his will.\\n\\nIt seemed such a crazy escalation for what was essentially a relatively simple issue, Ben Baldanza, the former CEO of Spirit Airlines (SAVE), told CNN.\\n\\nMunoz said the airline would never again use police to remove a paying passenger who is being bumped.\\n\\nTo remove a booked, paid, seated passenger -- we can't do that, he told ABC. The airline has pledged a full review of its procedures by April 30. Munoz said airline employees would be given more flexibility to deal with similar situations.\\n\\nThey all have an incredible amount of common sense, and this issue could have been solved by that, he said.\\n\\nRelated: United CEO - We won't let police drag people off planes anymore\\n\\nWhen airlines have to bump a passenger off a flight involuntarily, it usually happens at the gate, not on the plane. That's what happened to almost all the 40,629 passengers who were involuntarily bumped from U.S. airlines in 2016.\\n\\nI think the key is managing it before you get to the boarding process, Delta (DAL) CEO Ed Bastian told reporters during a conference call Wednesday to discuss the company's earnings.\\n\\nNeeleman agreed that the difficulty in this case was trying to bump passengers after the plane had boarded.\\n\\nIt's always difficult for people working at an airport if you have to go on and get people off an airplane, he said. Neeleman said that on a flight he once took, the airline asked for volunteers, and when no one agreed to leave, the airline simply canceled the flight and ordered everyone off.\\n\\nThey didn't choose to forcibly remove somebody, they just said, 'Everybody has to get off because we're not operating this airplane,' he said.\\n\\nRelated: Know your rights - What to do if your flight is overbooked\\n\\nAn airline could use that approach if it needs to bump passengers who are already seated and are refusing to leave, said Brett Snyder, a former airline executive who runs the blog CrankyFlier.com. It could order everyone off the flight, then reboard all but the bumped passengers.\\n\\nSnyder said airline executives he knows have suggested that option since the United fiasco, even though it would cause delays.\\n\\nMost of the time if you order someone to get off, they'll get off. That's what happened with three of the passengers in this case, Snyder said.\\n\\nFor his part, President Trump said Wednesday that airlines should eliminate their own limits on vouchers to passengers will be more willing to give up seats.\\n\\nYou know, there's a point at which I'm getting off the plane -- seriously, Trump told The Wall Street Journal. They should have gone up higher. But to just randomly say, 'You're getting off the plane,' that was terrible.\\n\\n--CNNMoney's Jill Disis contributed to this report."}

We've just been spoiled.\\n\\n(CNN Business) —\\n\\nStocks roared back Friday after investors received three belated New Year's presents.\\n\\nThe job market is still robust. China took action to stimulate its slowing economy. And Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said the Fed will be flexible in its plan to hike interest rates. All three of those events addressed issues that investors have been particularly concerned about over the past several months.\\n\\nThe Dow soared 747 points, or 3.3% — its fourth-biggest point increase of all time. The Dow has now surged 1,641 points, or 8%, since Christmas Eve.\\n\\nThe S&P 500 rose 3.4% and Nasdaq was up 4.3%.\\n\\nEvery sector of the market was up Friday. Only 16 of the stocks in the S&P 500 index were negative. AMD (AMD), which led all S&P 500 stocks in 2018, was up another 11%.\\n\\nRiskier stocks led the rally, including tech companies that have gotten killed lately: Facebook (FB) rose 5%, Apple (AAPL) was up 4% after its worst day in six years. Amazon (AMZN) rose 5%, Netflix (NFLX) rose 10% and Alphabet (GOOGL) was 4.3% higher.\\n\\nI thought stock market concerns about growth were overblown, said Gus Faucher, chief economist at PNC. This proves I was correct.\\n\\nA sigh of relief\\n\\nAt the American Economic Association conference in Atlanta Friday morning, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell reiterated the strengths of the economy but also signaled the Fed would remain flexible in its management of interest rates. The Fed has worked to gradually increase interest rates over the past couple years, unnerving investors who worried the Fed could bring about a recession by hiking rates too quickly.\\n\\nInvestors are breathing a sigh of relief right now, Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research, told CNN.\\n\\nThe central bank indicated at last month's meeting that the economy likely warranted two rate increases in 2019.\\n\\nBut Powell struck a more cautious stance on Friday about future moves. Although Powell called the December jobs report very strong, he stressed that the Fed is always prepared to shift the stance of policy if needed.\\n\\nWe will be patient as we watch to see how the economy evolves, Powell said.\\n\\nStrong jobs market\\n\\nFriday's jobs report signaled the US economy still has some strength left in it.\\n\\nEmployers added 312,000 jobs in December, well more than economists had forecast. Friday's jobs report was the biggest surprise of the economic cycle, according to Goldman Sachs\\n\\nThe unemployment rate rose to 3.9% because many people reentered the workforce. And paychecks grew a better-than-expected 3.2% from a year ago as employers raised wages to attract new workers. Average hourly pay was up 3.2% compared to a year earlier. The average number of hours people worked also edged up.\\n\\nIt seems to be a pretty good indication that the economy isn't anywhere close to recession, at least for now, said Brian Rose, chief Americas economist at UBS Asset Management.\\n\\nChina stimulus\\n\\nStocks also got a boost after China took steps to encourage bank lending and stimulate the country's flagging economy. The People's Bank of China announced it would slash the amount of money that banks are required to hold in reserve, the latest in a series of policy changes the government has taken to support growth.\\n\\nChina's slowing economy has been a prime factor in the extreme market volatility of the past several months.\\n\\nAnalysts at Macquarie Capital said that the rate cut shows government efforts to support the economy have now moved to the second level and should signal to investors that more stimulus is in the pipeline.\\n\\nRoller coaster ride\\n\\nThe up and down market continues.\\n\\nStocks tumbled Thursday. The Dow plunged 660 points, following Apple's (AAPL) warning that its sales would fall well short of guidance, largely because of China's economic slowdown. They fell even further after a weak manufacturing report suggested the trade war was harming both China and the United States' economy.\\n\\nStocks have been unusually volatile in recent weeks. The S&P 500 was up or down more than 1% nine times in December, compared to only eight times in all of 2017.\\n\\nJapan's Nikkei index dropped 2.3% Friday, that market's first day of trading following the New Year break.\\n\\nCNN's Matt Egan contributed to this report."}

This is NEW DAY. It is Friday, April 12, 6 a.m. here in New York.\\n\\n\\n\\nHappy Friday.\\n\\n\\n\\nJOHN BERMAN, CNN ANCHOR: F is for Friday, I like to say.\\n\\n\\n\\nCAMEROTA: It's gone quickly.\\n\\n\\n\\nBERMAN: Yes. CAMEROTA: I feel, this week.\\n\\n\\n\\nBERMAN: What has? The week?\\n\\n\\n\\nCAMEROTA: Yes.\\n\\n\\n\\nBERMAN: All right. The last ten minutes have gone quickly.\\n\\n\\n\\nCAMEROTA: Well, that is also true.\\n\\n\\n\\nOK. Up first, we have this new report to tell you about. It reveals an extreme idea that the White House was considering to deal with undocumented immigrants at the border.\\n\\n\\n\\nCNN has learned that President Trump personally pushed his ousted homeland security secretary to release undocumented migrants onto the streets of so-called sanctuary cities in order to target his political foes. A source tells CNN that Kirstjen Nielsen resisted that plan.\\n\\n\\n\\nCNN has also learned that top Trump adviser Stephen Miller had a big hand in pushing that plan. The Washington Post, which first reported this story, found that this idea came up more than once in six months.\\n\\n\\n\\nMeanwhile, CNN's Dana Bash gets an exclusive interview with Vice President Mike Pence about the situation at the border and much more.\\n\\n\\n\\nBERMAN: He makes a pledge on family separations, which will be interesting to hear what he says on that.\\n\\n\\n\\nMeanwhile, we're officially in the window where we could see the redacted Mueller report. It could be today, and it would make for a heck of a Friday news dump.\\n\\n\\n\\nAll of it can now be viewed through the new filter of the attorney general's stunning comments. He said he believes the Trump campaign was spied on by U.S. intelligence, though he didn't exactly tell us what he meant or provide evidence. President Trump, though, is rejoicing in that statement.\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd this morning we're hearing from Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who oversaw the Mueller probe. How does he explain William Barr's words and choices?\\n\\n\\n\\nLet's begin our coverage, though, with CNN's Boris Sanchez, live at the White House, Boris, with what appears to be an effort to use law enforcement, not to mention human beings as a form of political retribution.\\n\\n\\n\\nBORIS SANCHEZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yes, good morning, John.\\n\\n\\n\\nFor years, President Trump has railed against the country's immigration laws. But now, according to new reporting, it appears that the White House at least explored the possibility of using those immigration laws to punish the president's political enemies.\\n\\n\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\\n\\n\\n\\nSANCHEZ (voice-over): President Trump is no fan of sanctuary cities.\\n\\n\\n\\nTRUMP: My administration is launching a nationwide crackdown on sanctuary cities.\\n\\n\\n\\nSANCHEZ: And that's exactly where he wanted to send migrants detained at the southern border. A source tells CNN the White House pressured homeland security officials to release detained migrants into so- called sanctuary cities that limit cooperation with federal law enforcement to protect most immigrants from deportation.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe president himself pushed former DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen to follow through on his plan, according to a source. Why? In part to retaliate against Democrats who opposed his border wall.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut Nielsen resisted, and the DHS legal team eventually produced analysis that killed the plan. The Washington Post reports House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's district in San Francisco was among those targeted. Pelosi firing back saying, quote, Using human beings, including little children, as pawns in their warped game to perpetuate fear and demonize immigrants is despicable.\\n\\n\\n\\nMeanwhile, President Trump embracing controversial comments from his attorney general, William Barr.\\n\\n\\n\\nWILLIAM BARR, U.S. ATTORNEY GENERAL: I think spying did occur, yes. I think spying did occur.\\n\\n\\n\\nTRUMP: I think what he said was absolutely true. There was absolutely spying into my campaign. I'll go a step further. In my opinion, it was illegal spying, unprecedented spying.\\n\\n\\n\\nSANCHEZ: A counter-intelligence investigation into a Trump campaign staffer was launched legally through a warrant approved by a foreign intelligence surveillance court.\\n\\n\\n\\nNow, as Washington braces for Barr to release his redacted version of the Mueller report, outgoing Deputy Rod Rosenstein is defending Barr's four-page summary of the nearly 400-page report.\\n\\n\\n\\nRosenstein telling The Wall Street Journal, quote, He's being as forthcoming as he can, and so this notion that he's trying to mislead people, I think is just completely bizarre.\\n\\n\\n\\n(END VIDEOTAPE)\\n\\n\\n\\nSANCHEZ: According to reporting in the New York Times and The Washington Post, this sanctuary cities idea was first brought up last November around the time of the midterm elections in an email from a White House policy adviser to DHS attorneys. It was brought up again in February for ultimately being abandoned, John.\\n\\n\\n\\nBoris Sanchez for us at the White House. Yes, brought up at least to times.\\n\\n\\n\\nWant to bring in CNN senior political analyst John Avlon.\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd John, I want to read the lead from The Washington Post. Rachael Bade, one of the reporters, will be with us a little bit later, which is great to hear from her.\\n\\n\\n\\nCNN has matched the story, but The Post broke it. White House officials have tried to pressure U.S. immigration authorities to release detainees onto the streets of sanctuary cities to retaliate against President Trump's political adversaries, according to Department of Homeland Security officials and e-mail messages reviewed by The Washington Post.\\n\\n\\n\\nA, that's a heck of a lead. B, retaliate against political adversaries with human beings.\\n\\n\\n\\nAVLON: That is the fact of what is being being reported. It is completely insane. Do not accept this as the new normal or just another day in the Trump administration.\\n\\n\\n\\nThis is the latest and, in some ways, the most sinister bit of evidence that this president and his administration do not respect the rule of law. And they are being contained by professionals in agencies who try to tell them that their plans to release detainees on the streets of sanctuary cities, small and mid-sized, by the way, to punish their political enemies cannot be done.\\n\\n\\n\\n[06:05:11] And for that, they come under intense political pressure. This is deeply, deeply troubling if this is the instinct of the president and his political advisers to try to pull off kind of a domestic Mariel boatlift, to disrupt and undercut his perceived political opponents in America's cities and towns.\\n\\n\\n\\nBERMAN: You said they are being contained by other officials there. How does it color the view of what they tried to do, the fact that it didn't happen?\\n\\n\\n\\nAVLON: I think that is the cold comfort we can take is that we're living through a civic stress test. But the president's worst impulses, his most autocratic and, you know, vengeful impulses. And those of his senior aides on some of these issues are being contained by administration officials, some of whom are Trump appointees, some of whom are simply people who've dedicated their life to serving the people of the United States.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut the system is straining. And we've already seen a degree of retaliation or attempted retaliation against some of these people, particularly in the Office of Legal Counsel.\\n\\n\\n\\nSo that is what's troubling. The good news is the system is holding, and the president's worst impulses are being contained, but it is being strained every day by the occupant of the Oval Office.\\n\\n\\n\\nBERMAN: I will note that people are clearly leaking to The Post, to The Times, and to us about this about this, posting email messages about this. None have been sent by Stephen Miller, according to The Post, but his name is associated with this. He is thought to be behind some of these notions. And now, more powerful than ever on the issue of immigration.\\n\\n\\n\\nAVLON: He has been empowered by the president. He is trying to systematically purge, apparently, policy opponents inside the organization. Again, that word purge. Not one noticeably used in American politics for administrations' on staffers, but that's the degree of the ideological divide.\\n\\n\\n\\nThat's the degree of the impulse to say, Break the law on my behalf to punish my political enemies. These are not sentences we say very often in American history. It's happening right now on our watch.\\n\\n\\n\\nBERMAN: All right, John. We're going to talk much more about this coming up. Thank you very much.\\n\\n\\n\\nCAMEROTA: And meanwhile, Vice President Mike Pence getting a first- hand look at the situation at the U.S.-Mexico border. CNN's Dana Bash spoke exclusively with the vice president about the Trump administration's plan for families at the border and much more.\\n\\n\\n\\nWatch this.\\n\\n\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\\n\\n\\n\\nDANA BASH, CNN CHIEF POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT: CPB says that family unit apprehensions have increased nearly 375 percent. The spike is incredible. Can you explain how the administration that ran on making sure that this didn't happen let things get to this point?\\n\\n\\n\\nPENCE: Well, first, I think the president and I appreciate the fact that people around the country and even many people in the media are now beginning to recognize that we have a genuine crisis at our southern border.\\n\\n\\n\\nI heard about it again today here in Nogales. On Tuesday, 4,300 people came across our border illegally along the Southern border in its entirety. The vast majority of those people were families and unaccompanied minors, begin driven by human traffickers and drug cartels that are exploiting these vulnerable families, and they're exploiting loopholes in our laws.\\n\\n\\n\\nBASH: We have information that the president has been talking about reinstating the zero tolerance policy. Can you vow, standing here at the border, that family separation will never be reinstated?\\n\\n\\n\\nPENCE: The president made it very clear this week we're not rethinking bringing back family separation. But it's absolutely essential to end a humanitarian crisis that really threatens the security of the American people and is creating hardship on both sides of our border. Congress needs to act.\\n\\n\\n\\nBASH: The president tweeted last night the following: I think what the Democrats are doing with the border is TREASONOUS, all caps. Their open-border mindset is putting our country at risk. We'll not let that happen.\\n\\n\\n\\nI know you generally say that the president has his own style of talking, but to to use the word treason, which is supposed to be punished by death, how do you get from that rhetoric to the kind of working across the aisle that you're talking about that's needed to fix things here?\\n\\n\\n\\nPENCE: I think what you hear the president expressing is the frustration of the American people. That last month alone, more than 100,000 people came across our southern border illegally.\\n\\n\\n\\nBASH: I just have to ask you about the mayor of South Bend, Pete Buttigieg. He said, I wish the Mike Pences of the world would understand that, if you've got a problem with who I am, your problem is not with me. Your quarrel, sir, is with my creator.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat he's saying is he didn't choose to be gay. His creator did. What's your response to that?\\n\\n\\n\\nPENCE: You know, I've known Mayor Pete for many years. We worked very closely together when I was governor. And I considered him a friend.\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd he knows I don't have a problem with him. I -- I don't believe in discrimination against anybody. I treat everybody the way that I want to be treated.\\n\\n\\n\\n[06:10:13] BASH: Do you agree with him that God made him gay?\\n\\n\\n\\nPENCE: Well, look, the truth of the matter is that all of us have our own religious convictions. Pete has his convictions. I have mine.\\n\\n\\n\\nBASH: Right. Well, he argues that your quarrel is with him as a gay man and that he says, I was born with way, and this is the way God made me. That's just not your belief?\\n\\n\\n\\nPENCE: Well, I think -- I think Pete's quarrel is with the First Amendment.\\n\\n\\n\\nBASH: How so?\\n\\n\\n\\nPENCE: All of us in this country have the -- the right to our religious beliefs. I'm a Bible believing Christian.\\n\\n\\n\\nBASH: Julian Assange. I want to ask you about something that Mike Pompeo, when he was the CIA director, said. He called WikiLeaks a non-state house (ph) intelligence service, often abetted by state actors like Russia. Do you agree with that characterization?\\n\\n\\n\\nPENCE: Yes, we strongly agree with that. That's why the Justice Department is now seeking extradition. And we're going to bring Julian Assange to justice.\\n\\n\\n\\nLook, we're working with Chelsea Manning. Julian Assange was involved in one of the greatest compromises of classified information in American history. It literally put American military personnel at risk, and we'll hold him to account in the American justice system.\\n\\n\\n\\nBASH: What about what he did in 2016? The president, when he was a candidate, welcomed seeing WikiLeaks and the information that they got from Hillary Clinton. Has that changed?\\n\\n\\n\\nPENCE: Well, I think the president always, as you in the media do, always welcomes information. That was in no way an endorsement.\\n\\n\\n\\nBASH: Even though (UNINTELLIGIBLE) said that?\\n\\n\\n\\nPENCE: An organization that we now understand was involved in disseminating classified information by the United States of America.\\n\\n\\n\\n(END VIDEOTAPE)\\n\\n\\n\\nBERMAN: All right. A lot more to discuss about Dana's exclusive interview with the vice president at the border coming up.\\n\\n\\n\\nThis morning, as you heard in that interview, WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange is behind bars in Britain, facing extradition to the United States for allegedly conspiring to hack into government computers to steal U.S. military secrets.\\n\\n\\n\\nWikiLeaks played a key role also, as you heard right there, in the release of DNC and Clinton campaign e-mails in 2016. Back then, President Trump said, I love WikiLeaks. Now he says he knows nothing about WikiLeaks.\\n\\n\\n\\nCNN's Nick Paton Walsh live in London with the very latest -- Nick.\\n\\n\\n\\nNICK PATON WALSH, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: John, behind me, I think, in the Ecuadorian embassy, they're probably breathing a sigh of relief, maybe even cleaning up after their lengthy unwelcome house guest, even reports from Ecuadoran officials of feces on the walls at some point, damage to the building's infrastructure.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut what ahead now for Julian Assange, always a man not to be afraid of the spotlight? Ell, certainly, he has to face a sentencing hearing here in London in probably the next weeks ahead because of the bail he skipped out on here when he hid inside the embassy back in 2012.\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd then on May the 2nd, most likely after he's sentenced, he'll have an extradition hearing. That is to face this indictment in the United States, which specifies that he worked with Chelsea Manning to try and crack part of a password that would have enabled Chelsea Manning to masquerade as an administrator in a U.S. computer system during the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, classified information here, so she could have downloaded that. Well, he at the time, Bradley Manning, could have downloaded that and then released it through WikiLeaks.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut Donald Trump here, President Trump very clear, and we often see this, on how he's very much more ignorant about WikiLeaks than he was simply a matter of years ago. Here's what he said.\\n\\n\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\n\\n\\nTRUMP: WikiLeaks. I love WikiLeaks.\\n\\n\\n\\nThis WikiLeaks stuff is unbelievable. It tells you the inner heart. You've got to read it. It's been amazing what's coming out on WikiLeaks.\\n\\n\\n\\nThis WikiLeaks is fascinating.\\n\\n\\n\\nThis WikiLeaks is like a treasure trove.\\n\\n\\n\\nI know nothing about WikiLeaks. It's not my thing. I know nothing really about them. It's not my deal in life.\\n\\n\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\n\\n\\nWALSH: Now, it is the British court system, though, that will decide whether or not Julian Assange goes to the United States. That process could take months. Frankly, it may even be that whatever sentence he has to serve here in the U.K. for violating that bail is, in fact, expended while he's waiting to learn his extradition fate.\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd then it's possible in the United States he will face further charges. Now, there will be intense political debate here. His pretty substantial defense team already using the open court system to make a very clear case that he's a journalist who published information who's being persecuted. The indictment says he conspired to commit a criminal act. It will be up to U.K. judges to decide his fate -- Alisyn.\\n\\n\\n\\nCAMEROTA: OK, Nick Paton Walsh, thank you very much for all of that reporting.\\n\\n\\n\\nLet's bring in CNN legal analyst Carrie Cordero. She is the former counsel to U.S. assistant attorney general.\\n\\n\\n\\nCarrie, great to see you. So yesterday, as John and I were watching this arrest unfold on our air, I kept wondering why that day, why yesterday, after seven years, you know, of him being holed up in that embassy?\\n\\n\\n\\n[06:15:06] And I think that we've gotten the answer, which is there was this ticking statute of limitations. I was surprised to hear there is an eight-year statute of limitations for at least one of his charges. And so it sounds like -- and correct me if I'm wrong -- is that why they had to move with alacrity?\\n\\n\\n\\nCARRIE CORDERO, CNN LEGAL ANALYST: I think it certainly was a factor. And I think it's important to keep in mind that this case against him and the investigations involving him and the process of extradition, this would have been work that was done behind the scenes by law enforcement and prosecutors and diplomats from the U.S., the U.K. and Ecuador, which was housing him for some time.\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd so I think it was a confluence, perhaps, where you had the statute of limitations. The legal process had been under seal. The indictment had been under seal in the Eastern District of Virginia for some time. And then we needed the other factor -- U.S. Law enforcement needed the other factor in play, which was the government of Ecuador finally making the decision to release him to U.K. authorities. CAMEROTA: Yes, and it sounds like their patience really ran out with him. I mean, certainly, we hear Nick Paton Walsh's reporting about the conditions that he was living in.\\n\\n\\n\\nLet me read to you the indictment, because I think that it's interesting what we found out that he's being accused of. On or about March 8, 2010, Assange agreed to assist Chelsea Manning in cracking a password stored on United States Department of Defense computers connected to the Secret Internet Protocol Network, a United States government network, used for classified documents and communications.\\n\\n\\n\\nSo that is different, right? That's different than just publishing classified documents. That is taking an active role in getting them.\\n\\n\\n\\nCORDERO: Exactly right, Alisyn. So the passage that you just put up, that's really the crux of this particular indictment and charge against him.\\n\\n\\n\\nJulian Assange is not being charged with publishing classified information. I'll say it again. He's not being charged with publishing classified information. What he's being charged with is being an active participant in a conspiracy to commit computer fraud and abuse.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn other words, he did a specific thing to try to assist Chelsea Manning to crack a password to get unauthorized access into Department of Defense procedures. And so what the Justice Department is going to argue is that is not traditional journalist behavior.\\n\\n\\n\\nCAMEROTA: Indeed. Carrie Cordero, thank you very much for all of the legal expertise -- John.\\n\\n\\n\\nCORDERO: Thanks.\\n\\n\\n\\nBERMAN: Just saying, I prefer posters as wall hangings. Just letting that out there.\\n\\n\\n\\nCAMEROTA: That's good. That is more traditional.\\n\\n\\n\\nBERMAN: Posters more traditional, to be sure.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat a swirl of controversy surrounding attorney Michael Avenatti this morning. He is fighting back against a new string of new charges. The former lawyer for Stormy Daniels was indicted on 36 counts, including embezzlement prosecutors claim was part of a scheme to steal tens of millions of dollars from his clients.\\n\\n\\n\\nOur Sara Sidner live in Los Angeles with the details here. And this is a big, big list of indictments.\\n\\n\\n\\nSARA SIDNER, CNN CORRESPONDENT: It is. Thirty-six counts, including embezzlement, wire fraud, tax fraud, bank fraud, bankruptcy fraud here. The U.S. attorney for the Central District of California coming out very strongly, condemning the things that he's accused Michael Avenatti of. And one of the things in this case that was stunning to a lot of\\n\\n\\n\\npeople as they listened to it were the five people that the prosecutors say Michael defrauded. Five of them were clients of his, they say, who were defrauded of millions of dollars, including a paraplegic client, a client who had won a $4 million settlement that prosecutors say Michael Avenatti took, put into a trust account, as you are supposed to do for your clients, but then drained that trust account of more than $3.5 million, only giving the client somewhere around $125,000, telling him that the full settlement hadn't come in when he had already spent the money.\\n\\n\\n\\nHere's a little bit more of what prosecutors had to say.\\n\\n\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\n\\n\\nNICK HANNA, U.S. ATTORNEY: As it turns out, within months after receiving the settlement proceeds in early 2015, Mr. Avenatti had drained the entire $4 million payment from his trust account, using significant portions of the funds to finance his coffee business, his auto racing enterprise and his own personal lifestyle.\\n\\n\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\n\\n\\nSIDNER: Now, Michael has shot back, saying that he's not guilty of any of the charges against him, and he claims that any moneys owed due to his clients are bogus.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut we should mention that, with all of these charges -- and that's just in this case here in California -- that he faces up to 335 -- 335 years in prison. And that does not include the case that the SDNY has against him, which involves Nike, where they have said that he tried to extort Nike.\\n\\n\\n\\n[06:20:05] CAMEROTA: My gosh. Sara Sidner, thank you for explaining all of that and laying it out for us.\\n\\n\\n\\nAll right. He is not officially in the race yet. But Pete Buttigieg is surging in some new polls. We discuss those next.\\n\\n\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\n\\n\\nBERMAN: All right. New this morning, major movement in the Democratic race for president. Truly from nowhere in the polls, South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg appears to be breaking out in two early voting states. Look at these numbers from Iowa and New Hampshire. Pete Buttigieg has launched himself into third place behind Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders, and ahead of some pretty big names.\\n\\n\\n\\nJoining us now to discuss, Howard Dean, former presidential candidate, governor of Vermont; Laura Barron-Lopez, national political reporter for Politico; and Joe Lockhart. He is the former White House press secretary for President Clinton and hosts the Words Matter podcast.\\n\\n\\n\\nCongratulations on that, Mr. Lockhart.\\n\\n\\n\\nGovernor Dean, I want to start with you. And I know it's early. So let's stipulate --\\n\\n\\n\\nHOWARD DEAN, FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: It's early.\\n\\n\\n\\nBERMAN: Polls change.\\n\\n\\n\\nDEAN: Really early.\\n\\n\\n\\nBERMAN: You know that.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut Pete Buttigieg was the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, at zero or minus in the polls to months ago. And now he's ahead of people who have been in the Senate. He's ahead of people who live next door to New Hampshire. There is clearly something happening with this South Bend mayor.\\n\\n\\n\\nDEAN: Our core base is young people, people of color and women. And Pete Buttigieg is incredibly attractive to young people.\\n\\n\\n\\n[06:25:05] I was supporting him for the Democratic National Committee chairmanship, because that's our core base. And he has gotten his message out there, partly on CNN town meetings and things like that. People like him a lot. I'm shocked at the number of people who come up to me and say, What do you think of this guy?\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd I demur, because I have to stay neutral, because I'm running the data project. And they say, Well, I sent him some money.\\n\\n\\n\\nYou did? These are people my age. So this is real. He's basically, I think, assured him, as barring some scandal or something, that he's going to be in the first cut.\\n\\n\\n\\nCAMEROTA: So Joe, strategically, what has Mayor Pete Buttigieg done better than other people? Why has he leapfrogged?\\n\\n\\n\\nJOE LOCKHART, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: Well, I agree that it's early. And I think that you've seen several of these candidates get a little bit of a bump around the time of their announcement. It's always the anticipation. Kamala Harris did, certainly. And then settled back down.\\n\\n\\n\\nCAMEROTA: And is that what you think is happening here?\\n\\n\\n\\nLOCKHART: I actually think it's a little bit more. I think -- I agree with Governor Dean that he touches constituencies he is, in some ways, touches all of the elements.\\n\\n\\n\\nIf you look at Iowa and New Hampshire, the votes he's taking from are from Beto supporters but more than anyone, Bernie Sanders supporters, which was surprising when I looked at the numbers yesterday.\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd I think what that's about is people tend to look at, like, Sanders as Democrats want an ultra-progressive, a Democratic socialist. I don't think that's it at all. I think the Democratic constituency's much more in the middle.\\n\\n\\n\\nI think it's -- I think it's people rebelling against incremental politics, the politics that I think Hillary talked about. We've got to go slow, we've got to make change.\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd what Buttigieg is doing here is tapping into this idea that we can think big, Obama-like; we can change the system. We don't have to do it incrementally. And he's doing it in a language that young people understand, and they feel an affinity.\\n\\n\\n\\nSo I think the bottom line is I don't know who's going to win. But he's now in, you know, the first tier or 1-B tier and will have to be taken seriously.\\n\\n\\n\\nBERMAN: And he's getting some help, maybe, we could put it, from Mike Pence, the vice president of the United States?\\n\\n\\n\\nCAMEROTA: Well, he's getting some help from picking a fight with Mike Pence, I would say.\\n\\n\\n\\nBERMAN: You know, it's interesting. Because Buttigieg's entry into exploring the race did not, you know, circle around Mike Pence. It was not talking about his own sexuality that much. It really wasn't. It was I'm a Midwest governor. I know how to win in a Trump state. That was his main focus.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut day by day, Laura, he does talk more about the fact that he's married, which is something that Mike Pence opposed in his state. And I want to play for you what Pete Buttigieg just told Ellen DeGeneres on a clip that's going to air today.\\n\\n\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\n\\n\\nBUTTIGIEG: I'm not interested in feuding with the vice president. But if he wanted to clear this out, he could come out today and say he's changed his mind, that it shouldn't be legal to discriminate against anybody in this country for who they are. That's all.\\n\\n\\n\\nELLEN DEGENERES, TALK SHOW HOST: Yes.\\n\\n\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\n\\n\\nBERMAN: It's interesting. You heard in the interview with Dana Bash, Laura, that the vice president would not say he believes that people are born gay.\\n\\n\\n\\nLAURA BARRON-LOPEZ, NATIONAL POLITICAL REPORTER, POLITICO: Right. I think that even though Pete Buttigieg hasn't made this debate with Pence a central part of his campaign, it definitely helps him. I mean, any time that a Democratic candidate can be seen at odds with either the president or with the vice president, it boosts them. And that could be, also, part of why he's surging in the polls.\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd again, I think that Buttigieg is really getting attention because of how young he is, because of his policy ideas, as we mentioned earlier.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut it's so early that in a month, we could see this drastically change. We could see Warren or Harris be third. And I think that if anyone -- if we pretend to know what is going to happen nine months out, we'll be shocked when -- when the first contest happens.\\n\\n\\n\\nCAMEROTA: That's for sure. Understood. Today is just a snapshot of where we are today. It's nothing more. It's not predictive.\\n\\n\\n\\nHowever, given that, Governor, where is Beto O'Rourke? After all the excitement and the splash of the Vanity Fair cover, why isn't he in those two states in the top?\\n\\n\\n\\nDEAN: Well, he's doing pretty well. But you know, this is a hard, long process. There's two ways of doing this.\\n\\n\\n\\nOne is to raise a lot of money, and the other is to be on the ground and set up a great network. He's not going to have any trouble setting up a network, and he's raised a lot of money. The problem is the expectations for -- for Beto were much higher than they were for Pete Buttigieg.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut Beto raised $83 million for a Senate race in Texas. Buttigieg, nobody ever heard of. But he's got momentum., and you guys are giving that momentum. I got that ride up, and of course, I got the ride down once I was the frontrunner.\\n\\n\\n\\nCAMEROTA: It's a round trip ride we give you.\\n\\n\\n\\nBERMAN: Exactly.\\n\\n\\n\\nDEAN: Let me say something quickly. Joe is absolutely right, and nobody is talking about this in the media. This party is not moving to the left. All you guys are focusing on, Ocasio and Rashida Tlaib and so forth and so on.\\n\\n\\n\\nWe won 40 seats."}

{"original": "(CNN) —\\n\\nOn Tuesday, in a building along the border between North and South Korea, negotiators will sit down face to face for the first time in more than two years.\\n\\nThat meeting, the latest in a flurry of rapprochement between the two sides, comes after a breakthrough call between Seoul and Pyongyang last week.\\n\\nAt the South Korean end, were two employees of the Unification Ministry, patiently calling North Korea every day at 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., and never once receiving an answer.\\n\\nThe welcome break in tensions that have been building on the peninsula amid North Korean weapons testing and saber-rattling rhetoric from Washington, has thrown a spotlight onto the ministry, normally little noticed outside Korea, giving its mission new purpose and importance within President Moon Jae-in's foreign policy.\\n\\nBut despite its growing prominence, reunification of the two Koreas faces almost insurmountable problems, analysts say, and little support among a younger generation that has never known a unified Korean Peninsula.\\n\\nBased in an imposing, boxy government building on a tree-lined street near Gwanghwamun Square in central Seoul, the Unification Ministry is responsible for all issues pertaining to inter-Korean relations and unification, according to its official website.\\n\\nImportant work\\n\\nThis rather bland mission statement masks a sprawling ministry with hundreds of employees and units dedicated to military analysis, negotiations and dialog with North Korea, economic exchanges, and refugee support.\\n\\nThe Unification Ministry was deeply involved in arranging talks between the two Koreas and joint economic projects like the Kaesong Industrial Park.\\n\\nAccording to the Yonhap news agency, the ministry's budget for 2017 was $1.02 billion, down 20.5% on the year before, a drop ministers put down to worsened ties between the two Koreas in the last year of the conservative President Park Geun-hye administration.\\n\\nSupport for the ministry has fluctuated as political moods have shifted in South Korea. Under Park's equally conservative predecessor, Lee Myung-bak, it was even on the chopping block, according to a leaked 2009 US government cable.\\n\\n(The ministry) survived, largely because progressive forces came to its defense, wrote US diplomat William Stanton, but key liberal officials were fired, staff cut, and it was moved from a standalone building to offices within a larger complex.\\n\\nAvoiding conflict\\n\\nThe ministry was founded in 1969 as the National Unification Board, a government body responsible for all issues pertaining to inter-Korean relations and unification, according to its official website.\\n\\nThis was a period of high tension on the Korean Peninsula. The year before, North Korean commandos had infiltrated Seoul with the intention of assassinating President Park Chung-hee. They came within 100 meters of the Blue House before they were detected and most were killed in a massive gunfight with South Korean guards.\\n\\nIn the year running up to that incident, the US estimated hundreds of North Korean guerillas had crossed the DMZ, and, as South Korean officials told their US counterparts at the time, the feeling in Seoul was North Korean leader Kim Il Sung had shifted from peaceful unification to the use of force to achieve unification.\\n\\nWhile Park's government attempted to reassure its allies it was committed to peaceful reunification, the strongman leader – who had seized power in a military coup in 1961 – was widely viewed as unpredictable and hotheaded, and many in Washington feared he was just as likely to spark a second Korean War as Kim.\\n\\nDespite this, in 1972 both Koreas, after intense negotiations, issued a joint statement laying out their commitment to a peaceful, non-military reunification of the peninsula without depending on foreign powers and without foreign interference.\\n\\nAccording to Shin Jong-dae, a professor at Seoul's University of North Korean Studies, this was the first document agreed on by both Pyongyang and Seoul since the division of the peninsula in 1945.\\n\\nIt also established the hotline between the two countries, which, apart from a brief four year interlude between 1980 and 1984, was in regular use until it was cut off in February 2016.\\n\\nWhile relations between North and South Korea have waxed and waned considerably in the intervening period – declassified cables show North Korea considering unification by force again within years of the joint declaration – the importance of the communication system set up and the work of the Unification Ministry is evidenced by the sudden breakthrough this month.\\n\\nPHOTO: Handout/Getty Images AsiaPac/Getty Images North Korean officials cross the military demarcation line (MLD) for a meeting with their South Korean counterparts on the demilitarized zone in 2013.\\n\\nUnification uncertainty\\n\\nA landmark agreement signed by the leaders of both North and South Korea during a period of improved ties in 2000, hinted towards a possible future federalized state, with little indication how this would be achieved.\\n\\nThe agreement tied both countries to promoting balanced development of the national economy through economic cooperation and by stimulating cooperation and exchanges in civic, cultural, sports, health, environmental and all other fields.\\n\\nAnwita Basu, an analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU), said this could involve staged reunification, whereby the North operates as an autonomous region under the overarching governance of the Southern government, but she warned this was incredibly unlikely at the present time, as North Korea dismisses South Korea as a legitimate state.\\n\\nThe two Koreas fundamental ideological difference make it difficult to conceive a credible reunification strategy, she added. Each want to bring the other under its umbrella and government which frankly is intractable.\\n\\nThere are scant examples of peaceful reunification, particularly of such different countries.\\n\\nIn 1990, the Federal Republic of Germany absorbed East Germany and became one country again. While this was a much welcomed and peaceful process, it followed dramatic upheaval and revolution in East Germany which left the government there on the brink of collapse.\\n\\nThe cost of reunification was massive, estimated at upwards of $100 billion a year in the two decades after 1990, and today GDP, unemployment and other economic indicators show former East German states lagging behind their Western counterparts.\\n\\nAnother possible model is that of Hong Kong, control of which was handed over from the UK to China in 1997, establishing the principle of one country, two systems, by which Hong Kong retained its political and economic models, but sovereignty and ultimate control passed to China.\\n\\nThis was once mooted as a potential model for reuniting Taiwan and China, which split at the end of the Chinese Civil War in 1949, but in recent years, one country, two systems has come under increasing strain, with support for it in Hong Kong falling amid Chinese encroachment and shrinking political freedoms.\\n\\nPHOTO: Handout/Getty Images AsiaPac/Getty Images North and South Korean negotiators shake hands during high-level talks at the demilitarized zone in August 2015.\\n\\nUnlikely scenario\\n\\nEither of the above models would require colossal political change in North Korea, currently one of the world's most autocratic countries, ruled by the third-generation of the Kim family which has been in control since the end of World War II.\\n\\nAt this stage, reunification is a very remote prospect, said Basu, the EIU analyst.\\n\\nIt's difficult to imagine Kim Jong Un giving up control and allowing his country to be absorbed into South Korea, even with a high degree of autonomy. Nor are South Korea's 51 million people likely to vote to become part of a Kim-ruled united Korea.\\n\\nA more likely scenario for unification is political collapse in North Korea, brought on by revolution, a military coup, assassination of Kim, or war with South Korea or the United States.\\n\\nEstimates of the cost of reunification to South Korea range from around $500 billion to several trillion dollars, comparable to the amount spent by Germany since 1990.\\n\\nModeling the economic costs is incredibly difficult however, as this would be a completely unique event, potentially catalyzed by violent upheaval inside North Korea and the creation of hundreds of thousands of refugees.\\n\\nThe differences between the economies of North and South Korea are much greater than were those between East and West Germany, wrote academics Sangmin Bae and Martyn de Bruyn in 2010, pointing to South Korea's far greater population, GDP and quality of life.\\n\\nThis could lead to massive migration (to South Korea), they said. To be sure, the relative costs of unification in Korea would be even higher than the enormous costs in Germany.\\n\\nMoreover, unlike the Germans, the Koreans fought a bloody civil war, leaving deep wounds on both sides of the border that could act as a major barrier towards reunification and integration of North Koreans into a South Korean-led country, Bae and de Bruyn said.\\n\\nA more pressing concern, would be the simple integration of North Koreans into South Korea's highly complex economic system said Basu: The newly created country (would) struggle to find a unified national identity … Even today North Korean defectors find it very difficult to integrate into South Korean society. More often than not they are treated poorly and discriminated against.\\n\\nA Council on Foreign Relations report warned last year a unified Korea could become a constant source of instability or a country preoccupied with internal problems.\\n\\nThese difficulties, as well as years of North Korean aggression, could explain why South Koreans, particularly younger generations, are less supportive of unification than in the past.\\n\\nCNN's Paula Hancocks, Taehoon Lee, Sol Han, Stella Ko and Sophie Jeong contributed reporting."}

The data showed that the decrease was most striking at the postgraduate level.\\n\\nHollie Chandler, a senior policy analyst with the Russell Group, said in a statement that it was fair to assume that uncertainty over Brexit and the UK's future relationship with Europe could be a significant factor.\\n\\nThe drop in postgraduate research courses is especially troubling – these students contribute directly to the UK's research capacity, she said, adding that if the UK leaves the EU without a deal, uncertainty felt by prospective European students will only get worse.\\n\\nIn the letter to lawmakers, university leaders reiterated that 50,000 EU staffers, 130,000 EU students and 15,000 UK students studying in Europe are starting the new year facing significant uncertainty about their futures.\\n\\nProfessor Janet Beer, president of Universities UK, warned in a statement that world-leading academics and researchers may turn their backs on the UK for countries with access to EU funding programs.\\n\\nThe UK is the most successful country for hosting European Research Council grantees, who have won a number of prestigious prizes, including Nobel Prizes.

Katie Hnida, a Colorado placekicker in 1999, has alleged she was raped by a teammate.\\n\\nThere have been three accusations in the past three days. The case revealed Thursday is the first to include DNA samples from the alleged rapist.\\n\\nBarnett told CNN's Larry King that it's too early to judge the university and its football program.\\n\\nI don't know that at this point in time you can say anything has gone wrong, he said. I think there are a lot of allegations. At this date, there has yet to be anything proven, there has yet to be any charges brought.\\n\\nWith the accusations building, Jim Martin, a member of the Board of Regents, said simply, The whole university is shaken.\\n\\nThe university is investigating all the allegations, but Martin suggested it was time for the probe to widen and urged that an independent party handle the investigation.\\n\\nI think now, given the events and now the numbers and the severity, we need a panel that's impartial, that has full subpoena power for not only documents, but for witnesses, he told CNN.\\n\\nNo charges have been filed as a result of any of the allegations.\\n\\nBarnett told King he made a decision to improve academics and recruiting practices at the school when he joined in 1999. He said he implemented a strict discipline policy that was guided by a 124-page conduct manual.\\n\\nThe way that it's coming across national, I don't think that's who I am, Barnett said.\\n\\nEarlier, a half dozen former football players came to the aid of Barnett, saying the story has been blown out of proportion and that the coach is a man of high morals and integrity.\\n\\nScott Nemeth, who played offense from 1999 to 2001, said Barnett was a strict disciplinarian and handed out wristbands bearing the letters DTRT, which stood for Do the right thing, Nemeth explained.\\n\\nGary Barnett is an upright, honest and moral man. I stand by him as my coach, as my leader and as my mentor, Nemeth said.\\n\\nRashidi Barnes, who played defense until 2001, said the media is bombarding the student athletes.\\n\\nThese kids are great kids, positive kids. They are not villains, they are not rapists. These kids want to get an education and go to school. That's it. And play football, basketball or whatever else it is, Barnes said.\\n\\nFormer quarterback Charles Johnson added, He's a guy of high moral integrity, and a guy who I believe in, quite frankly. ... I think it's unfortunate that a balanced story has not been told.\\n\\nThe scandal gained momentum this week when Hnida told Sports Illustrated that she was raped by a teammate and that she was verbally abused, harassed and molested by her fellow players.\\n\\nI think I said the wrong thing, the wrong way at the wrong time I think I said the wrong thing, the wrong way at the wrong time -- Head coach Gary Barnett\\n\\nBarnett was placed on paid administrative leave Wednesday after he called Hnida an awful player who couldn't kick the ball through the uprights on Tuesday. He has since tried to back away from his comments saying they were taken out of context.\\n\\nColorado University President Elizabeth Hoffman said the coach was not apologetic when she spoke to him about the matter.\\n\\nIn the context of a rape allegation, it is inappropriate to make statements about the ability of the player, Hoffman said.\\n\\nBarnett told CNN he made a mistake.\\n\\nI think I said the wrong thing, the wrong way at the wrong time, he said.\\n\\nBarnett explained that he was trying to show support for Hnida but was asked a specific question about the player's talent and ability.\\n\\nI was trying to communicate that we cared about Katie. We were going to go to any extent we could to help her achieve her dream of being a college football kicker, he said. No matter what her ability was, we were trying to find a way to make sure she had a chance to do this.\\n\\nSince Hnida came forward with her story, police have said they are investigating two more alleged rapes. In the most recent case, a woman told police she met two Colorado football players at a bar in August 2002 and was sodomized later that night -- an incident she has little memory of.\\n\\nFormer University of Colorado football player Scott Nemeth spoke to reporters Thursday.\\n\\nShe told police she may have been drugged.\\n\\nDNA tests ruled out one of the men, but not the other, according to police.\\n\\nIn another case, according to police records released Wednesday, a woman in the athletic department claimed she was raped by a player and when she told Barnett about it, she quoted him as saying he would back his player 100 percent if she took this forward in the criminal process.\\n\\nAccording to police records from September 29, 2001, the woman claimed a football player raped her in an apartment despite her telling him at least 10 times that she did not want to have sex with him.\\n\\nThe CU program has been under scrutiny for weeks after depositions surfaced that three women claim they were raped at, or just after, a sex party in Boulder in December 2001. (Full story)\\n\\nNearly two weeks ago, the Broomfield County Sheriff's Department said it was investigating whether the university's athletic department hired an escort service for sex parties at a hotel.\\n\\nJohnson, who in addition to being quarterback served as a recruiter, told CNN's Anderson Cooper that he was not familiar with any recruiting parties.\\n\\nNothing is claimed to have happened at a recruiting party. The 2001 allegation the D.A. investigated wasn't a recruiting party it was a party a young lady had off campus with football players there, Johnson said. I've never been to a recruiting party or a party specifically for recruits.\\n\\nFormer player Ryan Johanningmeier said he never knew of alleged misconduct while he attended school at the same time as Hnida.\\n\\nI personally did not see it, hear about or hear any stories, Johanningmeier said.\\n\\nIn the Sports Illustrated article, Hnida said five teammates surrounded her on the first day of practice under Barnett and verbally abused her. During the season, players exposed themselves to her at least five times, she said.\\n\\nThen, one summer night, when she was at the home of a teammate, she said he began kissing her despite her objections and then raped her. I tried to push him off me, but he outweighed me by 100 pounds, Hnida was quoted as saying.\\n\\nShe said she was scared to go to the police, fearing what he might do to me.\\n\\nIn a written statement Tuesday, Hnida -- who dropped out of CU after her sophomore year and eventually walked on at the University of New Mexico in 2002 -- said she decided to go public now because of the swirling controversy surrounding Boulder's program."}

It's time for Democrats to think about that, and think about it now.\\n\\nDean's campaign manager, Joe Trippi, called the ad the kind of fearmongering attack we've come to expect from Republicans, one that panders to the worst in voters.\\n\\nHe called on Dean's rivals to condemn the ad and demand it be pulled off the air.\\n\\nThis type of ad represents everything that is wrong with our political process today -- polluting our airwaves with smears on other candidates that have nothing to do with legitimate policy differences, Trippi wrote in a letter to his counterparts in other campaigns.\\n\\nAds like this are the reason that less than half of the voting population in America bothers to go to the polls.\\n\\nThe group was founded in November as a nonprofit committee known as a 527 -- named for the section of the tax code that limits its requirement to disclose the source of its funding.\\n\\nIts leadership includes two people with ties to Dean's Democratic rivals -- David Jones, a former aide to Rep. Dick Gephardt, and Robert Gibbs, a former spokesman for Sen. John Kerry's campaign.\\n\\nJones issued a statement Wednesday saying the ad was meant to raise the issue of Dean's national security and foreign policy experience.\\n\\nThat is the ad's intention and that is what it does, he said.\\n\\nIn a Tuesday conference call with reporters, Gephardt denied any knowledge of the ad and called on the group to disclose its donors.\\n\\nI wish they weren't running the ads, he said. I'm sorry they're doing this, but there's nothing I can do about it. But I would call on them and any other 527s to reveal their donors in a timely manner.\\n\\nBut a spokesman for Sen. Joseph Lieberman, who has hammered Dean's opposition to the war since the weekend capture of fugitive Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein, echoed its criticism while denouncing its tone.\\n\\nWe agree with Joe Trippi that this ad is produced and presented in a way that is over the top, said Brian Hardwick, Lieberman's deputy campaign director.\\n\\nBut we also agree that it's exactly the kind of ad that Republicans would run. And that's precisely the problem. Simply put: The Democratic nominee will not win in 2004 if he appears weak on defense.\\n\\nIn August on Larry King Live, Dean deflected criticism of his opposition to the war. I think it's great that Saddam Hussein is not in power, but I would have approached it in a very different way, he said.\\n\\nAfghanistan, he said, deserves more attention, because the alliance between al Qaeda and the Taliban was an issue for the national security of the United States.\\n\\nPresidential hopeful Howard Dean. The ad attacks his anti-war stance.\\n\\nThis past weekend, Dean called the capture of Saddam, a great day of pride in the American military and a great day for the Iraqis and a great day for the American people.\\n\\nThe 527 committee's funding has come in part from labor unions, but a spokesman for one of those unions disavowed the spot Wednesday.\\n\\nIf it was up to me, I'd ask for a refund, said Rick Sloan, communications director for the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, which donated $50,000 to the group.\\n\\nThe union has endorsed Gephardt, the Missouri congressman and former House minority leader. But Sloan said the union did not discuss the commercial with Gephardt, and said it could backfire big time.\\n\\nI think this has done more damage to Gephardt than any of his opponents ever could have done. The day after the primary or caucus, the Democrats have to go back to living with each other and working with each other, Sloan said.\\n\\nThis kind of attack ad just drives them crazy, and rightfully so. It makes the job of pulling back together all that much harder. I don't know what they were using for brains -- lug nuts?"}

{"original": "(CNN) —\\n\\nMassachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren entered the 2020 presidential race this week in a strong financial position as a prodigious fundraiser with lots of available cash.\\n\\nWarren, who announced a presidential exploratory committee on Monday, has $12.5 million left over from her 2018 Senate campaign that she can transfer to her presidential campaign coffers. Only one other Democratic senator considering a presidential bid has come close to Warren's early war chest: New York's Kirsten Gillibrand, who ended the 2018 election season with $10.5 million remaining in her Senate campaign account.\\n\\nWarren, Gillibrand and the other Democrats weighing presidential bids will need every cent they can collect. For starters, President Donald Trump, who took the unprecedented step of filing for re-election on the day he was sworn into office in January 2017, already has raised a whopping $106 million for his reelection.\\n\\nAnd presidential campaigns are notoriously expensive affairs. The price tag of the 2012 general election contest between former President Barack Obama and Republican Mitt Romney – including money from the outside groups backing their campaigns – topped $2.3 billion, according to a tally by the non-partisan Center for Responsive Politics.\\n\\nHere's a look at the early fundraising picture for some of the possible contenders:\\n\\nMassachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren\\n\\nWarren, a former Harvard law school professor turned consumer advocate, is known for her searing criticism of Wall Street banks. So, no, don't expect New York financiers to line up to raise money on her behalf. She's also ruled out help from a super PAC.\\n\\nI don't think we ought to be running campaigns that are funded by billionaires, whether it goes through super PACs or their own money that they're spending, Warren told reporters this week.\\n\\nShe enters the field with a sizable small-donor base: More than $6 of every $10 Warren raised from individual contributors for her 2018 Senate re-election came from donors who contributed in amounts of $200 or less, Federal Election Commission records show.\\n\\nWarren will need to lean on those kinds of donors, who can contribute repeatedly to her campaign before hitting contribution limits, to sustain her in a crowded Democratic field.\\n\\nShe already is racing to collect cash for the presidential exploratory committee she announced on New Year's Eve. A campaign email sent in the waning hours of 2018 urged supporters to make donations as small as $3.\\n\\nA key liberal activist, Adam Green, co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, immediately endorsed Warren's bid. He said her record of building coalitions to achieve policy goals, such as the creation of the watchdog Consumer Financial Protection Bureau following the 2008 financial crisis, gives her credibility with liberal donors.\\n\\nDonations to Elizabeth Warren are not an impulse buy, Green told CNN this week. They are fundamentally built on a track record of her consistently challenging power – whether that's challenging Wall Street and big insurance or challenging systemic racism.\\n\\nNew York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand\\n\\nGillibrand, raised nearly $18 million for her Senate re-election campaign and coasted to victory over a little-known rival. That's left her with a hefty war chest of leftover cash – $10.5 million.\\n\\nAs a senator representing the nation's financial capital, she also has ties to deep-pocketed donors. The securities and investment sector ranks among the top five industries supporting Gillibrand in recent years, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.\\n\\nShe's campaigned for other Democrats in the midterms and invested heavily in digital advertising on Facebook – a move that will help her expand her name recognition and build lists of potential supporters.\\n\\nBut Gillibrand ran afoul of some powerful Democratic donors after leading calls urging Minnesota Democrat Al Franken to resign from the Senate. Franken quit last year following allegations that he touched women inappropriately.\\n\\nLiberal billionaire George Soros told The Washington Post last June that he blamed Gillibrand for pushing out Franken in order to improve her chances.\\n\\nNew Jersey Sen. Cory Booker\\n\\nThe New Jersey senator wasn't on the ballot in 2018, but he crisscrossed the country in an effort to influence the midterm elections – ranging from Georgia, where he stumped for Stacey Abrams, who ran unsuccessfully for governor, to the key presidential caucus state of Iowa.\\n\\nBooker, who has served in the Senate since October 2013, has extensive political and financial networks around the country and counts the people who work in the securities industry as among the top sectors donating to his campaign, according to the Center for Responsive Politics' analysis of donations.\\n\\nAnd Booker drew national attention long before he became a senator as part of a Sundance Channel documentary series, Brick City, which launched in 2009 and centered on his role as then-mayor of Newark, New Jersey. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, one of the planet's richest men, pledged $100 million to the city's schools during Booker's tenure.\\n\\nSteve Phillips, an influential Democratic donor in San Francisco, already has launched a pro-Booker super PAC, Dream United, and said he plans to raise $10 million to support a Booker presidential campaign.\\n\\nVermont Sen. Bernie Sanders\\n\\nSanders' army of grassroots supporters helped propel the Vermont independent senator into the No. 2 spot in the 2016 Democratic presidential primary.\\n\\nHis presidential campaign had raised some $228 million before Sanders conceded to Hillary Clinton in July of that year.\\n\\nSmall-dollar donors turned up again to help fund his re-election to a third Senate term in 2018. More than three-quarters of Sanders' individual contributions came in small amounts, and he ended the 2018 election with solid $8.8 million in the bank.\\n\\nBut with Warren and other progressives likely to enter the race, can Sanders still command small-donor devotion from liberal activists?\\n\\nRufus Gifford, who served as finance director of Obama's re-election campaign in 2012, is skeptical.\\n\\nSanders did almost nothing to raise money in 2016, Gifford wrote on Twitter this week. Because of the overwhelming level of grassroots support, he didn't have to. Question is: Is it still there? Can that strike twice? I am doubtful.\\n\\nSean Bagniewski, head of the Iowa's Polk County Democrats, said the online, small-donor fundraising techniques that Sanders pioneered in the 2016 campaign have grown commonplace among Democrats. And donors and activists are making fresh decisions about whom to support.\\n\\nI don't think the bases are staying with anybody in this next race. I know Bernie people who like Kamala and Cory, Bagniewski said, referring to Sens. Kamala Harris and Cory Booker of California and New Jersey, respectively. I know Hillary Clinton people who like Elizabeth Warren.\\n\\nOutgoing Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke\\n\\nThe Texas Democrat emerged as the breakout fundraising star of the 2018 elections, collecting more than $80 million in his unsuccessful US Senate campaign against Republican incumbent Ted Cruz.\\n\\nBut the campaign drained his resources. O'Rourke ended the election season with just $477,000 remaining in his campaign's bank account.\\n\\nNearly half of O'Rouke's individual contributions came from small donors. And he's already attracting attention from some of the party's biggest fundraisers. Chicago financier and former US ambassador to the UK, Louis Susman, a fundraiser so successful that one of his hometown papers once called him a vacuum cleaner for his ability to suck up campaign dollars, recently told CNN that he would back O'Rourke should the Texan enter the race.\\n\\nA decade ago, that mix of establishment bundlers and small-donor enthusiasm helped Obama, then a freshman U.S. senator, defy the odds and build a fundraising juggernaut that defeated Clinton in the 2008 Democratic primary.\\n\\nO'Rourke's backers aren't waiting for him to announce his candidacy. One Draft Beto group has established an ActBlue escrow account and is working to raise $1 million for his potential campaign. Another staged a day of action on his behalf last month in the early voting state of New Hampshire.\\n\\nWhile O'Rourke has drawn early comparisons to Obama's 2008 candidacy, one member of Obama's cabinet has already taken a formal step toward a 2020 race. Julian Castro, who ran the Housing and Urban Development department in Obama's administration, launched an exploratory committee last month.\\n\\nA formal announcement of his decision is expected Jan. 12 in his hometown of San Antonio, where he once served as mayor.\\n\\nBut Castro has not run for office outside of San Antonio and must work to establish a broader base of financial support. A political action committee he established in 2017 has raised about $490,000.\\n\\nCalifornia Sen. Kamala Harris\\n\\nThe California senator was not on the ballot in 2018, but she has raised big sums just two years into her Senate term.\\n\\nHarris collected nearly $7 million in her Senate campaign account. And about three quarters of her individual contributions came in small amounts, one of the highest proportions among Democratic senators considering running for the presidency in 2020.\\n\\nHarris also has raised more money for her leadership PAC than any other senator, according to a tally by a nonpartisan think tank, Issue One. (Leadership PACs are separate from candidates' principal campaign committees and provide a vehicle for politicians to raise money in larger increments than allowed by their campaigns. Harris' Fearless for the People PAC has collected $2.3 million.)\\n\\nHarris has deployed her campaign dollars to build a national profile and expand her lists of potential supporters.\\n\\nThrough the end of December, for instance, her campaign had spent more than $1.2 million on Facebook ads, according to an online database maintained by the social-media giant. A recent Harris ad on Facebook decried the December decision by a Texas judge to invalidate the Affordable Care Act and asked users to help defend health care by providing their first names, email addresses and ZIP codes.\\n\\nA reshuffled 2020 primary schedule that has pushed California's voting into early March offers a possible strategic advantage to Harris as the home-state senator.\\n\\nBut advertising across the populous state's multiple media markets will be expensive. And Harris could face competition from several other Californians, including Rep. Eric Swalwell who represents parts of the Bay Area, Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti and San Francisco billionaire Tom Steyer\\n\\nOhio Sen. Sherrod Brown\\n\\nThe Ohio Democrat raised a whopping $22.7 million in his Senate campaign, but he spent heavily to beat Republican Jim Renacci in a state Trump won by 8 percentage points in 2016.\\n\\nBrown ended the election with $1.8 million in leftover funds – not an ideal financial base to quickly build the infrastructure needed for a presidential campaign. But Brown's getting credit for waging a successful battle in a red-leaning state.\\n\\nGifford, the Obama fundraiser, put Gillibrand, Brown and another possible contender, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, in the same category.\\n\\nThese senators are unlikely to match the big names in fundraising, Gifford tweeted. But it will be a tortoise/hare thing for them. Need to peak at the right time and totally doable.\\n\\nMinnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar\\n\\nKlobuchar raised far less in her 2018 re-election campaign – about $8 million – than Gillibrand and Brown did in theirs.\\n\\nBut her star turn questioning Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, her victory by a 24-point margin on Election Day and her success in Minnesota's deep-red, rural counties have drawn more attention to the former county prosecutor and her 2020 prospects.\\n\\nKlobuchar ended the midterm election season with nearly $4.4 million banked in her campaign account – just ahead of Booker's $4.1 million cash balance.\\n\\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden\\n\\nThe former vice president – who has toured the country promoting his book, Promise Me, Dad, and stumping for fellow Democrats – would enter the race as the early frontrunner. He led the field of potential contenders in a recent CNN/Des Moines Register/Mediacom poll of likely Iowa caucusgoers.\\n\\nAnd Biden can draw on extensive ties to Democratic fundraisers forged during a Senate career that began in 1973 and as part of an Obama-Biden team that raised a combined $1.5 billion over two presidential elections.\\n\\nSince leaving office in January 2017, Biden also has built a network of nonprofits and academic institutions staffed by former aides and close allies, likely enabling him to quickly assemble a campaign infrastructure.\\n\\nMeanwhile, his political action committee, American Possibilities, raised more than $2.5 million since it was launched in 2017 and doled out more than $500,000 to Democratic candidates and committees during the 2018 midterms.\\n\\nIn recent interviews, a number of Obama's top financial backers told CNN they would help collect campaign contributions for Biden should he enter the race. But Biden, who would be 77 on Election Day 2020, may not be a shoo-in for everyone in the Obama crowd.\\n\\nStonyfield Farm co-founder Gary Hirshberg, a top-tier Obama bundler, said Biden likely would have won had he entered the race in 2016, but he believes Biden now is too old to seek the presidency.\\n\\nHirshberg told CNN he was looking mostly closely at supporting Brown or another possible 2020 contender, outgoing Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper.\\n\\nThe self-funders\\n\\nAnd then there are the candidates who will need no financial help at all should they jump into the race.\\n\\nAt least two billionaires, former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg and Steyer, an environmental activist and former hedge-funder, are weighing their own presidential bids.\\n\\nAnd they each unloaded more than $100 million into the midterms. Steyer focused heavily on driving youth turnout. Bloomberg and his team directed millions of dollars worth of advertising to two dozen House races to help Democrats successfully seize control of the chamber.\\n\\nAnother self-funder, departing Maryland Democratic Rep. John Delaney, already has declared his White House candidacy and has poured $3.5 million of his own money into the long-shot bid."}

This is ManafortÕs first court appearance since his longtime deputy Rick Gates pleaded guilty last week in special counsel Robert MuellerÕs Russia probe. (Photo by Drew Angerer/Getty Images)\\n\\n(CNN) —\\n\\nA prominent Ukrainian tycoon denied Thursday requesting or receiving US polling data from Paul Manafort, following revelations in a court filing Tuesday that pointed to coordination between the former Trump campaign chairman and the Russian government.\\n\\nRinat Akhmetov – one of Ukraine's wealthiest men – said in a statement to CNN Thursday that allegations of contacts with Manafort and Konstantin Kilimnik, a Russian-intelligence-linked associate of Manafort, were false and that Manafort's work for Akhmetov's System Capital Management (SCM) ended over a decade ago.\\n\\nSpecial counsel Robert Mueller believes Manafort was sharing polling data and discussing Russian-Ukrainian policy with Kilimnik while he led the Trump presidential campaign in 2016, according to parts of a court filing that were meant to be redacted by Manafort's legal team Tuesday but were released publicly.\\n\\nCNN reported Wednesday that Manafort intended for Kilimnik to give the polls to Akhmetov and another Ukrainian oligarch. It is still unclear what Kilimnik did with the polling data. But Akhmetov's denial leaves open the possibility that the campaign data made its way to others in Ukraine or Russia.\\n\\nA statement to CNN on behalf of Akmetov said: Mr. Akhmetov never requested nor received any polling data or any other information about the 2016 US elections from Paul Manafort or Konstantin Kilimnik.\\n\\nAny allegations about contacts between them and Mr. Akhmetov in relation to the 2016 US elections is false and will be strongly refuted.\\n\\nAkhmetov bankrolled the Party of Regions, a Ukranian political party aligned with Moscow that Manafort worked to bolster. Akhmetov reportedly introduced Manafort to the party's leader, Viktor Yanukovych, and they embarked on a decade-long partnership that saw Yanukovych win the presidency and major victories at the polls. Manafort earned $60 million for his work in Ukraine, and was convicted last year of financial fraud after hiding the money overseas to avoid paying US taxes.\\n\\nAkhmetov's statement to CNN also said, As has been repeatedly stated in the media, the work between SCM and Mr. Manafort and his consulting firm was completed in 2005. Mr. Manafort has not worked with SCM since then. Any kind of work that he performed in Ukraine after 2005 was political by nature, and was not paid for by SCM or its shareholder Rinat Akhmetov. Therefore, the information about any 'debts' or other existing financial obligations between Mr. Akhmetov and Mr. Manafort is absolutely not true.\\n\\nManafort earned millions from his Ukrainian political work over several years, which included wire transfers from Akhmetov and Lyovochkin through offshore bank accounts, prosecutors said at trial.\\n\\nThat revenue appeared to dry up by 2015. However, Manafort wrote in an email to his accountant in August 2016 that he expected a payment of $2.4 million in November 2016 for work he did in Ukraine, according to trial documents.\\n\\nCNN's Katelyn Polantz, Evan Perez and Marshall Cohen contributed to this report."}
{"original": "Among the chief advantages of trusts, they let you:\\n\\nPut conditions on how and when your assets are distributed after you die;\\n\\nReduce estate and gift taxes;\\n\\nDistribute assets to heirs efficiently without the cost, delay and publicity of probate court. Probate can cost between 5% to 7% of your estate;\\n\\nBetter protect your assets from creditors and lawsuits;\\n\\nName a successor trustee, who not only manages your trust after you die, but is empowered to manage the trust assets if you become unable to do so.\\n\\nTrusts are flexible, varied and complex. Each type has advantages and disadvantages, which you should discuss thoroughly with your estate-planning attorney before setting one up.\\n\\nWhen it comes to cost, a basic trust plan may run anywhere from $1,600 to $3,000, or possibly more depending on the complexity of the trust. Such a plan should include the trust setup, a will, a living will and a health-care proxy. You will also pay fees to amend the trust if it's revocable and to administer the trust after you die.\\n\\nOne caveat: Assets you want protected by the trust must be retitled in the name of the trust. Anything that is not so titled when you die will have to be probated and may not go to the heir you intended but to one the probate court chooses.\\n\\nFor a trust in which you want to put the majority of your assets -- known as a revocable living trust -- you also have to have a pour-over will to cover any of your holdings that might be outside of your trust if you die unexpectedly. A pour-over will essentially directs that any assets outside of the trust at the time of your death be put into it so they can go to the heirs you choose.\\n\\nCredit-shelter trust:\\n\\nWith a credit-shelter trust (also called a bypass or family trust), you write a will bequeathing an amount to the trust up to the estate-tax exemption. Then you pass the rest of your estate to your spouse tax-free. You also specify how you want the trust to be used -- for example, you may stipulate that income from the trust after you die goes to your spouse and that when he or she dies, the principal will be distributed tax-free among your children.\\n\\nSince your spouse is also entitled to an estate-tax exemption, the two of you can effectively double (or more than double) that portion of your kids' inheritance that is shielded from estate taxes by using this strategy.\\n\\nAnd there's an added bonus: Once money is placed in a bypass trust it is forever free of estate tax, even if it grows. So if your surviving spouse invests it wisely, he or she may add to your children's inheritance.\\n\\nOf course, you can pass an amount equal to the estate-tax exemption directly to your kids when you die, but the reason for a bypass trust is to protect your spouse financially in the event he or she has need for income from the trust or in the event you think your children will squander their inheritance before the surviving parent dies.\\n\\nGeneration-skipping trust:\\n\\nA generation-skipping trust (also called a dynasty trust) allows you to transfer a substantial amount of money tax-free to beneficiaries who are at least two generations your junior -- typically your grandchildren.\\n\\nYou may specify that your children may receive income from the trust and even use its principal for almost anything that would benefit your grand kids, including health care, housing or tuition bills.\\n\\nBeware, however. If you leave more than the exemption amount, the bequest will be subject to a generation-skipping transfer tax. This tax is separate from estate taxes, and is designed to stop wealthy seniors from funneling all their money to their grandchildren.\\n\\nQualified personal residence trust:\\n\\nA qualified personal residence trust (QPRT) can remove the value of your home or vacation dwelling from your estate and is particularly useful if your home is likely to appreciate in value.\\n\\nA QPRT lets you give your home as a gift -- most commonly to your children -- while you keep control of it for a period that you stipulate, say 10 years. You may continue to live in the home and maintain full control of it during that time.\\n\\nIn valuing the gift, the IRS assumes your home is worth less than its present-day value since your kids won't take possession of it for several years. (The longer the term of the trust, the less the value of the gift.)\\n\\nHere's the catch: If you don't outlive the trust, the full market value of your house at the time of your death will be counted in your estate. In order for the trust to be valid, you must outlive it, and then either move out of your home or pay your children fair market rent to continue living there, Janko says. While that may not seem ideal, the upside is that the rent you pay will reduce your estate further, Levine notes.\\n\\nIrrevocable life insurance trust:\\n\\nAn irrevocable life insurance trust (ILIT) can remove your life insurance from your taxable estate, help pay estate costs, and provide your heirs with cash for a variety of purposes. To remove the policy from your estate, you surrender ownership rights, which means you may no longer borrow against it or change beneficiaries. In return, the proceeds from the policy may be used to pay any estate costs after you die and provide your beneficiaries with tax-free income.\\n\\nThat can be useful in cases where you leave heirs an illiquid asset such as a business. The business might take a while to sell, and in the meantime your heirs will have to pay operating expenses. If they don't have cash on hand, they might have to have a fire sale just to meet the bills. But proceeds from an ILIT can help tide them over.\\n\\nQualified terminable interest property trust:\\n\\nIf you're part of a family where there have been divorces, remarriages and stepchildren, you may want to direct your assets to particular relatives through a qualified terminable interest property (QTIP) trust.\\n\\nYour surviving spouse will receive income from the trust, and the beneficiaries you specify will get the principal or remainder after your spouse dies. People typically use QTIP trusts to ensure that a fair portion of their wealth ultimately passes to their own children and not someone else's.\\n\\nMoney in a QTIP trust, unlike that in a bypass trust, is treated as part of the surviving spouse's estate and may be subject to estate tax. That's why you should create a bypass trust first, which shelters assets up to the estate-tax exemption, and then if you have assets left over you can put it in a QTIP, Levine says."}

They started 2020 on roughly equal footing, with women holding 50.03% of jobs, but ended it holding 860,000 fewer jobs than their male peers.\\n\\nThat gap is in large part due to steep job losses in three sectors: education — which remains a female-dominated industry — hospitality and retail, particularly clothing and accessories stores. All of these industries have been hammered by the pandemic.\\n\\nWe don't have the pandemic under control.

{"original": "Washington (CNN) The Supreme Court in a 5-4 vote Monday cleared the way for the Trump administration to make it more difficult for low-income immigrants seeking to come to or trying to remain legally in the United States.\\n\\nThe so-called public charge rule, unveiled in August, impacts people who rely on public assistance, including most forms of Medicaid, food stamps and housing vouchers.\\n\\nIt made national headlines last summer when then-acting Director of US Citizenship and Immigration Services Ken Cuccinelli, in his defense of the rule, revised the iconic poem on the Statue of Liberty's pedestal, saying: Give me your tired and your poor who can stand on their own two feet and who will not become a public charge.\\n\\nAdvocates and several states immediately opposed the rule, arguing that the changes would penalize immigrants who rely on temporary assistance from the government and impose costs on the states.\\n\\nMonday's vote split along ideological lines, with the five conservative justices in the majority.\\n\\nThe order was also issued while Chief Justice John Roberts was presiding over the impeachment trial of President Donald Trump in the US Senate across the street from the Supreme Court.\\n\\nThe Trump administration's immigration policies have repeatedly met with legal challenges, resulting, in some cases, in lower courts blocking the policies from taking effect across the country, as happened with the public charge rule.\\n\\nMonday's order means the rule can go into effect in every state, pending appeal, except for Illinois which is covered by a separate injunction.\\n\\nThe rule will affect people who are trying to obtain lawful permanent status, otherwise known as a green card. To that end, the rule has the potential to reshape legal immigration by limiting access to green cards for lower-income immigrants.\\n\\nCriticism of nationwide injunctions\\n\\nWe're happy to see the Supreme Court step in the way they did here, Cuccinelli, who now serves as acting Homeland Security deputy secretary, said Monday. It is very clear the US Supreme Court is fed up with these national injunctions by judges who are trying to impose their policy preferences instead of enforcing the law and we see this again with the Supreme Court stepping in in the way they have here and we very much appreciate it.\\n\\nA New York judge last fall issued a nationwide injunction blocking the rule. Solicitor General Noel Francisco appealed that ruling to the Supreme Court, asking the justices to allow the rule to go into effect while the appeals process played out.\\n\\nJustices Neil Gorsuch and Clarence Thomas wrote separately to criticize nationwide injunctions -- court orders that block a policy across the country -- like the one that had been issued in the case.\\n\\nIt is an issue of deep concern for Francisco and Attorney General William Barr, who have complained that the government has been stymied by injunctions blocking their policies for months until the court process plays out.\\n\\nJUST WATCHED Cuccinelli edits Statue of Liberty poem to defend new rule Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Cuccinelli edits Statue of Liberty poem to defend new rule 00:54\\n\\nIn a speech to the American Law Institute last year, Barr said that nationwide injunctions have frustrated presidential policy for most of the President's term with no clear end in sight. As an example, he noted injunctions that blocked the Trump administration's decision to rescind the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program.\\n\\nAt the time, Barr noted, We are more than halfway through the President's term, and the administration has not been able to rescind the signature immigration initiative of the last administration, even though it rests entirely on executive discretion.\\n\\nThe Court has since taken up the DACA issue and will rule before July.\\n\\nGorsuch and Thomas noted that the issue surrounding the public charge rule had been percolating through several courts within a hodge-podge of jurisdictions but that one judge was able to block the rule nationwide.\\n\\nBy their nature, universal injunctions tend to force judges into making rushed, high-stakes, low-information decisions, Gorsuch, joined by Thomas, wrote. They urged the Supreme Court to step in at an appropriate juncture to take up a case concerning the rise of nationwide injunctions.\\n\\nImpact of 'public charge' rule\\n\\nThe public charge provision dates back at least to the Immigration Act of 1882. Federal lawmakers at the time wanted to make sure that immigrants would be able to take care of themselves and not end up a public burden.\\n\\nUnder current regulations put in place in 1996, the term is defined as someone who is primarily dependent on government assistance, meaning it supplies more than half their income.\\n\\nBut it only counted cash benefits, such as Temporary Assistance for Needy Families or Supplemental Security Income from Social Security. The administration's new rule widens the definition of who is expected to be dependent on the government by including more benefit programs.\\n\\nIt's hard to know exactly how many people would be affected by the regulation because it's largely subject to the discretion of the officer who will take into account whether someone is likely to become a public charge.\\n\\nOpponents of the rule, such as Susan Welber, a staff attorney at the Legal Aid Society, said that the government was trying to exclude as unworthy and unwelcome anyone who is predicted to receive even a small amount of food, health or housing assistance at any point.\\n\\nWe are very disappointed in the Supreme Court's decision, and the irreparable consequences it will have for immigrants and their families across the nation, but we continue to believe that our legal claims are very strong that we will ultimately prevail in stopping this rule permanently, Welber said in a statement Monday.\\n\\nThis story has been updated with details of the rule and the court's order."}

THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.\\n\\n\\n\\n[13:00:00] JORDAN: -- Mr. Eisenberg had told me to take my concerns to him.\\n\\n\\n\\nThen I ask you did -- did Mr. Eisenberg tell you not to report, to go around Mr. Morrison. And you said actually he did say that I shouldn't talk to any other people. Is that right?\\n\\n\\n\\nVINDMAN: Yes, but there's a whole -- there's a period of time in there between when I spoke to him and when he circled back around. It wasn't that long a period of time but it was enough time for me to ...\\n\\n\\n\\nJORDAN: Enough time for you to go talk to someone that you won't tell us who it is right.\\n\\n\\n\\nVINDMAN: I've -- I've -- I've been instructed not to, Representative Jordan.\\n\\n\\n\\nJORDAN: Well, here's what I'm getting. The lawyer told you don't talk to any other people and you interpret that as not talking to your boss but you talk to your brother, you talk to the lawyers, you talk to Secretary (inaudible), you talk to the one guy Adam Schiff won't tell you -- won't let us -- won't let you tell us who he is. Is that right.\\n\\n\\n\\nVINDMAN: Representative Jordan, I did my job.\\n\\n\\n\\nJORDAN: I'm not saying you didn't. All I'm saying is you -- your -- the instructions from the lawyer was you shouldn't talk to anybody and you interpret that as don't talk to my boss but I'm going to go talk to someone that we can't even ask you who that individual is.\\n\\n\\n\\nVINDMAN: That is incorrect.\\n\\n\\n\\nJORDAN: Well, I just read what you said. I shouldn't talk to any other people.\\n\\n\\n\\nSCHIFF: The time of the gentleman has expired.\\n\\n\\n\\nVINDMAN: There's -- I'm sorry, Chairman, but that sequence is not the way it played out.\\n\\n\\n\\n(CROSSTALK)\\n\\n\\n\\nJORDAN: I'm reading through (ph) the transcript Colonel Vindman.\\n\\n\\n\\nSCHIFF: Jordan, please let Colonel Vindman ...\\n\\n\\n\\nVINDMAN: There's -- the sequence played out where immediately afterwards I expressed my concerns. I did my coordination function, Mr. Eisenberg circled back around, told me not to talk to anybody else. In that period of time I did not manage to talk to ...\\n\\n\\n\\nJORDAN: So that's when it happened. That's when you talked to someone.\\n\\n\\n\\n(CROSSTALK)\\n\\n\\n\\nSCHIFF: Mr. Heck, you are recognized. Mr. Heck.\\n\\n\\n\\nVINDMAN: That's right.\\n\\n\\n\\nHECK: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Colonel Vindman, let's go back to that pair of meetings on July 10 in Ambassador Bolton's office and down in the war (ph) room where you witness Ambassador Sondland inform the Ukrainian officials that as a prerequisite to a White House meeting between the two presidents, quote, the Ukrainians would have to deliver an investigation into the Bidens, end quote.\\n\\n\\n\\nYou said that Ambassador Sondland was quote, calling for an investigation that didn't exist into the Bidens in Burisma, is that correct?\\n\\n\\n\\nVINDMAN: That is correct.\\n\\n\\n\\nHECK: It's that same afternoon you went to Mr. Eisenberg, the council, correct?\\n\\n\\n\\nVINDMAN: That meeting occurred in the afternoon and within, you know, a couple -- I'm sure it was within a couple hours I spoke to Mr. Eisenberg.\\n\\n\\n\\nHECK: How did he react?\\n\\n\\n\\nVINDMAN: He was cool, calm, and collected. He took notes and he said he would look into it.\\n\\n\\n\\nHECK: And did he not also tell you to feel free to come back if you had additional concerns.\\n\\n\\n\\nVINDMAN: He did. He did, Congressman.\\n\\n\\n\\nHECK: Ambassador Sondland had told you that his request the Ukrainians had been coordinated with the chief of staff -- acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney. Did you report that to Mr. Eisenberg?\\n\\n\\n\\nVINDMAN: I did.\\n\\n\\n\\nHECK: And what was his reaction?\\n\\n\\n\\nVINDMAN: He -- he took notes and he said he was going to -- he'll follow up or look into it. I don't recall exactly what he said.\\n\\n\\n\\nHECK: Colonel, you've also testified that on the July 25 call now between the two presidents, quote, there was no doubt, end quote, that President Trump asked for investigations into the 2016 election and Vice President Biden's son in return for a White House meeting. Within an hour of that call you reported back to Mr. Eisenberg, did you not?\\n\\n\\n\\nVINDMAN: I did.\\n\\n\\n\\nHECK: Went back to him just to see (inaudible) suggestion would be appropriate.\\n\\n\\n\\nVINDMAN: He's an assistant the president. He -- it was less a suggestion and more than -- more of an instruction.\\n\\n\\n\\nHECK: Did you tell the lawyers that President Trump asked President Zelensky to speak to Mr. Giuliani.\\n\\n\\n\\nVINDMAN: Yes.\\n\\n\\n\\nHECK: And the lawyers -- it was at this point, told you not to talk to anyone else.\\n\\n\\n\\nVINDMAN: That is -- that's -- that is not correct with regards to timing. They didn't fall back -- they didn't circle back around. What ended up happening is in my coordination role I spoke to state (ph) -- I spoke to number (ph) of intelligence community and the general counsel from one of the intelligence bodies notified Mr. Eisenberg that there was -- you know that there was information on the call, on the July 25th call, as that point Mr. Eisenberg told me I shouldn't talk to anybody else about it.\\n\\n\\n\\nHECK: Colonel, I want to go back to 2014 in Iraq. When you were blown up, I presume that given the point in your military career and what else was going on in the world that upon recovery there was the very real prospect or possibility that you might once again find yourself in harms way. Is that correct?\\n\\n\\n\\nVINDMAN: Yes, Congressman, it happened in 2004, but yes.\\n\\n\\n\\nHECK: Four, excuse me, thank you. Did you consider leaving the military service at that point?\\n\\n\\n\\nVINDMAN: No. Frankly, Congressman, I suffered light wounds I was fortunate compared to my counterparts in the same vehicle. And I returned to duty as, I think it may have been that same day.\\n\\n\\n\\n[13:05:00]\\n\\n\\n\\nHECK: But you could have been subjected to additional harm. You chose to continue service in uniform.\\n\\n\\n\\nVINDMAN: I continued to serve in combat for the remaining 10 or 11 months of the tour.\\n\\n\\n\\nHECK: You know, Colonel, I have to say I find it a rich but incredible painful irony that within a week of the President contrary to all advise of the Senior Military Officials he pardons those who were convicted of war crimes, which was widely decried in the military community. Within the week of him doing that he is engaged in an effort and allies on his behalf including some here today to demean your record of service and the sacrifice and contribution you have made. Indeed, sir, less than 20 minutes ago the White House officially quoted out, out of context the comments referred to earlier by Mr. Morrison in (ph) your judgment.\\n\\n\\n\\nI can only conclude, sir, that what we though was just the President is the subject of our deliberations in this inquiry isn't sufficient to capture what's happening here. Indeed what subject to this inquiry and what is apparel is our constitution and the very values upon which it is based. I want to say thank you for your service. But you know thank you doesn't cut it. Please know, however, that it comes from the bottom of my heart and I know on the bottoms of the heart of countless other Americans, thank you for the service, sir. I yield back.\\n\\n\\n\\nSCHIFF: Mr. Jordan.\\n\\n\\n\\nJORDAN: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Sunday the Speaker of United States House of Representatives called the President of the United States an impostor. Speaker of the House called the President an impostor. The guy, 63 million people for, the guy who won an Electoral College landslide, the Speaker calls an impostor. That's what happened to our country, to this Congress. The Speaker statement says it all. The Democrats have never accepted the will of the American people. Democrats don't trust the American people. The American people who wanted to send someone to this town who was willing to shake it up a bit.\\n\\n\\n\\nThey don't trust that and they have tried to do everything they can to undo what the American people decided on November 8, 2016. They've been out to get the President since the day he was elected. The whistleblowers lawyer, the whistleblowers legal team said this January 30, 2017, the President had been in office about a week, coup has starter, first of many steps. Next sentence impeachment will follow ultimately. I guess we're in the final step. It started three and half years ago. Congressman Tlaib started this Congress. First day of Congress said impeach the President.\\n\\n\\n\\nRepresentative Greene said if we don't impeach him the President's going to win reelection. We got to do it. Mot importantly, most importantly five Democrat members of this committee voted to move forward with impeachment before the phone call ever happened. The truth is the attacks actually started before the Inauguration even before the election. Ranking Member talked about this. Hi opening statement July 2016 FBI opens investigation so called Trump-Raja (ph) coordination collusion which was never there. Opened an investigation spied on two American citizens associated with the Presidential campaign. My guess is that's probably never happened in American History, but they did it.\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd for 10 months Jim Comey FBI investigated the President, guess what after 10 months they had nothing. And you know why we know that because when we disposed Mr. Comey last Congress he told us they didn't have a thing. No matter, Special Counsel Mueller gets appointed and they do a two year $40 million, 19 lawyer unbelievable investigation and guess what they come back and they got nothing. But the Democrats don't care. So now we get this, a bunch of depositions in the bunker and the basement of the Capital, witnesses who aren't allowed to answer questions about who they talked to about the phone call. We get this all based on some anonymous whistleblower, no first hand knowledge biased against the President.\\n\\n\\n\\n[13:10:00]\\n\\n\\n\\nThese facts have never changed, we learned these right away. Who worked with Vice President Biden , who wrote a memo the day after somebody talked to him about the call, awaited 18 days to file a complaint, 18 days to file a complaint. What did he do in those 18 days? We all know, ran off and talked with Chairman Schiff's staff. And then hired the legal team that I just talked about, one of those steps in the whole impeachment coup as his legal team has said.\\n\\n\\n\\nThis is scary what these guys are putting our country through. It is sad, it is scary, it is wrong. And the good news is the American people see through it all, they know the facts are on the President's side as Representative Stefanik said, four facts will never change. We've got the transcript which they never thought the President would release. Shows no coordination, not conditionality, no linkage. We got the two guys on the call President Trump, President Zelensky, who have side nothing wrong no pressure no pushing here. We've got the fact that Ukrainians didn't even know aid was held up at the time of the call and most importantly we have yet to have one witness tell us that the any evidence from anyone that President Zelensky did anything on investigations to get the aid released.\\n\\n\\n\\nThose facts will never change. The facts are on the President's side, the process is certainly not. It has been the most unfair process we have ever seen and the American people understand that. Those 63 million Americans they understand it and frankly I think a lot of other do as well. They see what this for what it is. And they know this is wrong, especially wrong just 11 months before the next election. I yield bank.\\n\\n\\n\\nSCHIFF: Mr. Welch.\\n\\n\\n\\nWELCH: Thank you. What this hearing is about, I think was best stated by Colonel Vindman's opening statement. The question before us is this, is it improper for the President of the United States to demand a foreign government investigate the United States citizen and political opponent? It's very well stated.\\n\\n\\n\\nI just listened to Mr. Jordan, as you did as well, and I heard his criticisms in the process, nothing really happened, a lot of people are out to get the president. I didn't hear an answer to the question, as to whether it's proper for the President of the United States to demand a foreign government to investigate a U.S. citizen and political opponent.\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd to date, I haven't heard any one of my Republican colleagues address that question.\\n\\n\\n\\nColonel Vindman and Ms. Williams, thank you. I want to ask some questions that go through the background. What's come out during this process is that we had two Ukraine policies.\\n\\n\\n\\nOne was bipartisan and long-standing, and that was to assist Ukraine, which had freed itself from the domination of Russia, to fight corruption and to resist Russian aggression. Is that a fair statement, Colonel Vindman?\\n\\n\\n\\nVINDMAN: I think that's a fair characterization, Congressman.\\n\\n\\n\\nWELCH: And to give folks a reminder of the extent of corruption, by the way, a legacy of Putin's Russia, is your understanding that when their prior president, Mr. Yanukovych fled to Russia into the arms of Mr. Putin, he took with him $30 to $40 billion of that impoverished country?\\n\\n\\n\\nVINDMAN: Those -- there are different estimates, but it's on that scale, yes.\\n\\n\\n\\nWELCH: Vast scale for a poor country. And is it your understanding that powerless, but motivated Ukrainians rose up in protest to this incredible graft in theft and abuse by their president?\\n\\n\\n\\nVINDMAN: That is correct.\\n\\n\\n\\nWELCH: And that was in the Maidan -- it was called the Maidan Revolution, the Revolution of Dignity, correct?\\n\\n\\n\\nVINDMAN: Correct.\\n\\n\\n\\nWELCH: And young people went into that square in downtown Kiev, and demonstrated for months, correct?\\n\\n\\n\\nVINDMAN: Correct. And 100 died.\\n\\n\\n\\nWELCH: One hundred and six young people died, and older people died, correct? That is in -- in -- in -- between February 18, 2014 and February 22, is that correct?\\n\\n\\n\\nVINDMAN: Correct.\\n\\n\\n\\n[13:15:00]\\n\\n\\n\\nWELCH: One hundred and six died, including people who were shot by snipers, kids, and Yanukovych had put snipers on the rooftops of buildings to shoot into that square and kill, murder, slaughter, those young people. Is that your understanding?\\n\\n\\n\\nVINDMAN: That is correct.\\n\\n\\n\\nWELCH: In our bipartisan support, and by the way, I want to say to my Republican colleagues, a lot of leadership to have this bipartisan support came from your side, thank you. But our whole commitment was to get rid of corruption and to stop that Russian aggression, is that correct?\\n\\n\\n\\nVINDMAN: That amounts to some of the key pillars. WELCH: That's right. And the Giuliani, Sondmand (ph), and it appears, Trump policy was not about that, it was about investigations into a political opponent. Correct? I'll take that question back, we know it.\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd you know, I'm going to say this to President Trump, you want to investigate Joe Biden, you want to investigate Hunter Biden, go at it. Do it. Do it hard. Do it dirty. Do it the way you do do it. Just don't do it by asking a foreign leader to help you in your campaign. That's your job, it's not his.\\n\\n\\n\\nMy goal in these hearings is two things, one is to get an answer to Colonel Vindman's question. And the second, coming out of this, is for us, as a Congress, to return to the Ukraine policy that Nancy Pelosi and Kevin McCarthy both support. It's not investigations, it's the restoration of democracy in Ukraine and the resistance of Russian aggression. I yield back.\\n\\n\\n\\nSCHIFF: Mr. Maloney.\\n\\n\\n\\nMALONEY: thank you both for being here. You know, Lieutenant Colonel Vindman, this may be one of your first Congressional hearings like this, so you may not --\\n\\n\\n\\nVINDMAN: And hopefully the last.\\n\\n\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\n\\n\\nMALONEY: I can't blame you for feeling that way, sir. Particularly when I've been sitting here listening to my Republican colleagues, one of the advantages of being down here at the kids table, is that you get to hear the folks above your ask their questions. And I've been listening closely to my Republican colleagues and I've heard them say just about everything except to contradict any of the substantive testimony you've both given.\\n\\n\\n\\nYou may have notices, there's been a lot of complaints and there's been a lot of insinuations and there's been a lot of suggestions maybe that -- that you're -- that you're service is somehow not -- not to be trusted.\\n\\n\\n\\nYou know, you were treated to questions about your loyalty because of some half-baked job offer, I guess, the Ukrainians made you, which you, of course, dutifully reported. I guess, Mr. Castor's implying you're -- you've got some dual loyalty, which is, of course, an old smear we've heard many times in our history, to try to demean you as though maybe you're -- you've overstated the your importance of your job.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut, of course, you were -- this -- the guy on the National Security Council responsible for directing Ukrainian policy. We've heard the air out some allocations, with no basis improve, but they just want to get them out there and hope maybe some of those strands of spaghetti, I guess, will stick on the wall if they keep throwing them.\\n\\n\\n\\nWe've even had a member of this Committee question -- this is my favorite, question why you would wear your dress uniform today. Even though that dress uniform includes a breastplate that has a Combat Infantry badge on it and a Purple Heart metal ribbon.\\n\\n\\n\\nSeems like if anybody gets to wear their uniform, it's somebody who's got breastplate with those accommodations on it. So, let's do it again, let's do the substance, can we do that? Because we've had a lot of -- a lot of dust kicked up.\\n\\n\\n\\nMs. Williams, you heard the call with your own ears, right?\\n\\n\\n\\nWILLIAMS: Yes sir.\\n\\n\\n\\nMALONEY: Not second hand, not hear say, you heard the president speak. You heard his voice on the call?\\n\\n\\n\\nWILLIAMS: Correct.\\n\\n\\n\\nMALONEY: And you conclusion was what he said about investigating the Bidens was your words, unusual and inappropriate, I believe. Am I right?\\n\\n\\n\\nWILLIAMS: That was my testimony.\\n\\n\\n\\nMALONEY: And Mr. Vindman, you were treated to a July 10th meeting in the White House, where you heard Ambassador Sondland raise investigations, conditioning a White House meeting on that investigations, that you thought were unduly political, I believe that's how you described them. And you went to NSC Council and you reported, right?\\n\\n\\n\\nVINDMAN: Correct.\\n\\n\\n\\nMALONEY: And then later, you too, were on the White House call, am I right? You heard it with your own ears?\\n\\n\\n\\nVINDMAN: Correct.\\n\\n\\n\\nMALONEY: Not second hand, not from somebody else, not hear say, right?\\n\\n\\n\\nVINDMAN: Correct.\\n\\n\\n\\nMALONEY: You heard the president's voice on the call?\\n\\n\\n\\nVINDMAN: I did.\\n\\n\\n\\nMALONEY: And you heard him raise that subject again, that Ambassador Sondland had raised before, about investigating the Bidens, right?\\n\\n\\n\\nVINDMAN: I did.\\n\\n\\n\\nMALONEY: And I want to ask you, when you heard him say that, what was the first thought that went through your mind?\\n\\n\\n\\n[13:20:00]\\n\\n\\n\\nVINDMAN: Frankly, I couldn't believe what I was hearing. There was probably an element of shock that maybe in certain regards my worst fear of how our Ukraine policy could play out was playing out. And how this was likely to have significant implications for U.S. national security.\\n\\n\\n\\nMALONEY: And you went immediately and you reported it, didn't you?\\n\\n\\n\\nVINDMAN: I did.\\n\\n\\n\\nMALONEY: Why?\\n\\n\\n\\nVINDMAN: Because that was my duty.\\n\\n\\n\\nMALONEY: Do you still have your opening statement handy?\\n\\n\\n\\nVINDMAN: I do.\\n\\n\\n\\nMALONEY: Read the last paragraph for me again, not the one -- the very last one, the second to last one. Would you read that one again for me? Because I think the American public deserves to hear it again.\\n\\n\\n\\nVINDMAN: The dad...\\n\\n\\n\\nMALONEY: That's the one.\\n\\n\\n\\nVINDMAN: I think my dad would appreciate this one too.\\n\\n\\n\\nDad, my sitting here today in the U.S. Capitol, talking to our elected officials, is proof that you made the right decision 40 years ago to leave the Soviet Union and come here to the United States America in search of a better life for our family. Do not worry, I will be fine for telling the truth.\\n\\n\\n\\nMALONEY: You realize when you came forward out of sense of duty that you are putting yourself in direct opposition to the most powerful person in the world. Do you realize that, sir?\\n\\n\\n\\nVINDMAN: I knew I was assuming a lot of risk.\\n\\n\\n\\nMALONEY: And I'm struck by that word don't -- that phrase do not worry, you addressed your dad. Was your dad a warrior?\\n\\n\\n\\nVINDMAN: He did serve. It was a different military though.\\n\\n\\n\\nMALONEY: And he would have worried if you were putting yourself up against the president of the United States, is that right?\\n\\n\\n\\nVINDMAN: He deeply worried about it because in his context there was -- it was the ultimate risk.\\n\\n\\n\\nMALONEY: And why you have confidence that you can do that and tell your dad not to worry?\\n\\n\\n\\nVINDMAN: Congressman, because this is America. This is the country I have served and defended, that all of my brothers have served. And here, right matters.\\n\\n\\n\\nMALONEY: Thank you, sir. I yield back.\\n\\n\\n\\n(APPLAUSE) SCHIFF: Ms. Demings.\\n\\n\\n\\nDEMINGS: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\\n\\n\\n\\nFirst of all, Ms. Williams, let me thank you for your service to our nation. It truly matters.\\n\\n\\n\\nLieutenant Colonel Vindman, I had the honor of speaking to a group of veterans this past weekend. And what I said to them was that no words, no words are really adequate or sufficient to fully express our gratitude for their service to our nation. So, Lieutenant Colonel Vindman, today I say to you, there are no words that are sufficient to fully express our gratitude to you for what you have done for our nation and, amazingly, what you are still willing to do for our nation.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt is vitally important that the American people understand how President Trumps unethical demand that Ukraine deliver a politically- motivated investigation in exchange for military assistance created a security risk for our, the United States of America, national security. The president was not just playing a political game by upholding military aid and meetings with Ukraine, threatening the hundreds of millions of dollars of military assistance that Congress had appropriated has real-life consequences for Ukraine and for the USA.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn your test deposition, Colonel Vindman, you testified, and I quote, a strong and independent Ukraine is critical to our security interests. Could you please explain why a strong and independent Ukraine is so critical, and why it is so vital to U.S. interests?\\n\\n\\n\\nVINDMAN: We sometimes refer to Ukraine as a front-line state. It's on the front-line of Europe. It's -- they have actually described to me, the Ukrainians, that that is -- it is a -- they consider themselves as a barrier between Russian aggression and Europe. And what I have heard them describe is the need for U.S. support in order to serve this role in order to protect European and Western security.\\n\\n\\n\\nDEMINGS: Lieutenant Colonel, this is not just a theoretical conflict between Ukraine and Russia. You have already said this morning that Russia is actively fighting to expand into Ukraine, that Ukraine is in a hot war with Russia right now, is that correct?\\n\\n\\n\\n[13:25:00]\\n\\n\\n\\nVINDMAN: It's stable, but it's still a hot war.\\n\\n\\n\\nDEMINGS: And isn't it true, Lieutenant Colonel, that even if the security assistance was eventually delivered to Ukraine, the fact that it was delayed, just that fact, could signal to Russia that the bond between Ukraine and the U.S. was weakening?\\n\\n\\n\\nVINDMAN: That was the concern of myself and my colleagues.\\n\\n\\n\\nDEMINGS: And was the risk of even the appearance that the U.S.-Ukraine bond is shaky is that it could embolden Russia to act with more aggression, would you say that is correct?\\n\\n\\n\\nVINDMAN: I believe that was my testimony.\\n\\n\\n\\nDEMINGS: Just last month, during an interview, President Putin joked about interfering in our political elections. I can only guess that is what we have become to Russia and its president. I think he felt emboldened by the president's reckless actions, both attempts to hold critical military aid from Ukraine and President Trump's effort to blame Ukraine, not Russia, for election interference.\\n\\n\\n\\nMs. Williams and Lieutenant Colonel Vindman, I can only say that every American, regardless of our politics, should be critically concerned about that. And let me just say this. Yes, we do trust the American people. But you know what, the American people trust us too as members of Congress to support, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic. And we intend to do just that.\\n\\n\\n\\nThank you again for your service.\\n\\n\\n\\nMr. Chairman, I yield back.\\n\\n\\n\\nSCHIFF: Mr. Krishnamoorthi.\\n\\n\\n\\nKRISHNAMOORTHI: Good afternoon, Lieutenant Colonel Vindman and Ms. Williams. Thank you for your service.\\n\\n\\n\\nLieutenant Colonel Vindman, I am concerned that your loyalty has been questioned not just because you are bringing forward evidence of wrongdoing against the president, president of United States, but because you are an immigrant. Recently FOX News host Brian Kilmeade said, he, meaning you, were born in the Soviet Union, emigrated with his family young, he tends to feel simpatico with the Ukraine. I find this statement reprehensible because it appears that your immigrant heritage is being used against you.\\n\\n\\n\\nLieutenant Colonel, I came to this country when I was three months old. Your family fled the Soviet Union and moved to America when you are just three-and-a-half years old, right?\\n\\n\\n\\nVINDMAN: Correct.\\n\\n\\n\\nKRISHNAMOORTHI: And I understand that your father worked multiple jobs while also learning English, right?\\n\\n\\n\\nVINDMAN: Correct.\\n\\n\\n\\nKRISHNAMOORTHI: Your father stressed the importance of embracing what it means to be an American, correct?\\n\\n\\n\\nVINDMAN: That is correct.\\n\\n\\n\\nKRISHNAMOORTHI: You and your family faced difficult times during your childhood, correct?\\n\\n\\n\\nVINDMAN: Yes. KRISHNAMOORTHI: I can relate. That's my story too. But your father went on to become an engineer, right?\\n\\n\\n\\nVINDMAN: He reestablished himself in his former profession in the United States.\\n\\n\\n\\nKRISHNAMOORTHI: I can relate. I -- I got a B.S. in engineering. Of course some people claim I practice the B.S. part now.\\n\\n\\n\\n(Laughter)\\n\\n\\n\\nYour father never gave up working hard to build his very own American dream, did he?\\n\\n\\n\\nVINDMAN: He did not.\\n\\n\\n\\nKRISHNAMOORTHI: Well Lieutenant Colonel Vindman, your father achieved the American dream and so did you and your family. From one immigrant American to another immigrant American, I want to say to you that you and your family represent the very best of America. I assume that you are as proud to be an American as I am, correct?\\n\\n\\n\\nVINDMAN: Yes, sir.\\n\\n\\n\\nKRISHNAMOORTHI: Sir, I want to turn your attention to Yuriy Lutsenko. You called him a disruptive actor in your opening statement, correct?\\n\\n\\n\\nVINDMAN: Correct.\\n\\n\\n\\nKRISHNAMOORTHI: Mr. Lutsenko, the former prosecutor general in Ukraine has made various claims about various Americans, right?\\n\\n\\n\\nVINDMAN: Correct.\\n\\n\\n\\nKRISHNAMOORTHI: You are unaware of any factual basis for his accusations against Ambassador Yovanovitch. Right?\\n\\n\\n\\nVINDMAN: Correct.\\n\\n\\n\\nKRISHNAMOORTHI: He also was a source for an article by John Solomon in The Hill, right?\\n\\n\\n\\nVINDMAN: That is correct.\\n\\n\\n\\nKRISHNAMOORTHI: And you said that key elements of that article as well as his accusations are false. Right?\\n\\n\\n\\nVINDMAN: Correct.\\n\\n\\n\\nKRISHNAMOORTHI: Lutsenko is not a credible source, correct?\\n\\n\\n\\nVINDMAN: Correct.\\n\\n\\n\\n[13:30:00]\\n\\n\\n\\nKRISHNAMOORTHI: Sir, the other side claims that there was absolutely no pressure on this July 25 phone call. I think that's what we heard earlier, right?\\n\\n\\n\\nVINDMAN: I believe so.\\n\\n\\n\\nKRISHNAMOORTHI: And you have termed what President Trump asked in terms of investigations on that phone call as a demand. Correct?\\n\\n\\n\\nVINDMAN: Correct.\\n\\n\\n\\nKRISHNAMOORTHI: And you've pointed out the large power disparity between President Trump on the one hand and President Zelensky on the other. Correct?\\n\\n\\n\\nVINDMAN: Yes.\\n\\n\\n\\nKRISHNAMOORTHI: There was pressure on that phone call, right?\\n\\n\\n\\nVINDMAN: The -- the Ukranians needed the meeting. The Ukrainians subsequently when they found out about it needed the security assistance.\\n\\n\\n\\nKRISHNAMOORTHI: So the pressure was brought to bear on them, correct?\\n\\n\\n\\nVINDMAN: I believe so.\\n\\n\\n\\nKRISHNAMOORTHI: Sir, Colonel Vindman, last week we heard a decorated military veteran namely Ambassador Bill Taylor come before us. You interacted regularly with Ambassador Taylor and you know him to be a man of integrity and he's a patriotic American. Isn't that right?\\n\\n\\n\\nVINDMAN: A superb individual.\\n\\n\\n\\nKRISHNAMOORTHI: I asked Ambassador Taylor a series of questions based on his experience as an infantry commander. I asked him quote, is an officer allowed to hold up action placing his troops at risk until someone provides him a personal benefit? Ambassador Taylor responded, no sir. Colonel Vindman, do you agree with Ambassador Taylor?\\n\\n\\n\\nVINDMAN: I do.\\n\\n\\n\\nKRISHNAMOORTHI: I then asked Ambassador Taylor quote, is that because they would be betraying their responsibility to the nation? Ambassador Taylor responded, yes, sir. Colonel Vindman, do you agree with Ambassador Taylor?\\n\\n\\n\\nVINDMAN: I do.\\n\\n\\n\\nKRISHNAMOORTHI: I then asked Ambassador Taylor, quote, could that type of conduct trigger a court martial? Ambassador Taylor said yes sir. Do you agree with Ambassador Taylor Colonel Vindman?\\n\\n\\n\\nVINDMAN: I do.\\n\\n\\n\\nKRISHNAMOORTHI: Thank you for your service.\\n\\n\\n\\nSCHIFF: That concludes the member questioning. Representative Nunes, you're recognized for any concluding remarks. NUNES: Well Act 1 of today's circus is over. For those of you who have been watching at home, the democrats are no closer to impeachment then where they were three years ago. In the process they've -- the Department of Justice, FBI, State Department, elements within the I.C., the ICIG have all suffered long-term damage. The democrats can continue to put -- to poison the American people with this nonsense. We sat here all morning without any evidence for impeachment which would be a very serious crime, high crime and misdemeanor as it says in the Constitution. No such thing.\\n\\n\\n\\nPolicy disagreements and the democrats failure to acknowledge their involvement in the 2016 election, I would say it's astonishing but that would be putting too little emphasis on their actions. With that I yield back the balance of my time.\\n\\n\\n\\nSCHIFF: I thank the gentleman. I want to thank our witnesses today, Ms. Williams, Colonel Vindman, both of you for your service to the country, for your testimony here today and I just want to address briefly some of the evidence you presented as well as others thus far in the impeachment inquiry.\\n\\n\\n\\nFirst of all, I want to join my colleagues in thanking you Colonel Vindman for your military service and I should tell you that notwithstanding all of the questions you got on why didn't you go talk to your supervisor. Why didn't you go talk to Mr. Morrison? Why did you go to the national security lawyer as if there is something wrong with going to the national security lawyer.\\n\\n\\n\\nAre you aware that we asked Mr. Morrison whether he went to the national security lawyer right after the call and that he did.\\n\\n\\n\\nVINDMAN: I am.\\n\\n\\n\\nSCHIFF: And are you aware also that we asked him, well if you have this problem with Colonel Vindman not going to you instead of the lawyer, naturally you must have got your supervisor in you know what his answer was? He didn't go to his supervisor, either. He went directly to the National Security Council lawyers. I hope my colleagues will give him the same hard time for not following his chain of command that he complained about with you apparently.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe president may attack you and has. Others on right-wing TV might attack you, and they have. But I thought you should know and maybe you know already that this is what the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff had to say about you Colonel Vindman. He is a professional, competent, patriotic and loyal officer. He has made an extraordinary contribution to the security of our nation in both peacetime and combat. I am sure your dad is proud to hear that.\\n\\n\\n\\n[13:35:00]\\n\\n\\n\\nMy colleagues have tried to make the argument here today and we've heard it before that the president was just interested in fighting corruption. That's our goal, fighting corruption in Ukraine, this terribly corrupt country. The problem of course with that is there is no evidence of the president trying to fight corruption. The evidence all points in the other direction. The evidence points the direction of the president inviting Ukraine to engage in the corrupt act of investigating a U.S. political opponent.\\n\\n\\n\\nAmbassador Yovanovitch was known as a strong fighter of corruption so what does the president do? He recalls her from her post. Ambassador Yovanovitch, in fact, was at a meeting celebrating other anticorruption fighters including a woman who had acid thrown in her face on the day she was told to get on the next plane back to Washington. You prepared talking points for the president's first conversation with Zelensky. He's supposed to talk about rooting out corruption. If this President had such a deep interest in rooting out corruption in Ukraine, surely he would've brought it up in the call but of course we now know that he did not.\\n\\n\\n\\nWe then see Rudy Giuliani not fighting corruption but asking for an investigation of the Bidens and my colleagues say well maybe he was acting on his own. Even though he says he's acting as the President's lawyer, maybe he was really acting on his own but the two investigations that Rudy Giuliani wanted, come up in the meeting you participate in on July 10th at the White House, when Ambassador Sondland brings up the Bidens and Burisma of 2016, tells the Ukrainians who want that meeting at the White House, you've got to do these investigations.\\n\\n\\n\\nNow they would say Ambassador Sondland was acting on his own, but that doesn't quite work either because we have the call record from July 25th, which the President was forced to release, in which the President doesn't bring up corruption, he doesn't say how are those anti-corruption courts going or great work at the Rada. Of course not.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat does the President say? I want you to invest the -- investigate the Bidens and this debunked conspiracy theory pushed by Vladimir Putin, that also helps me in my re-election. So much for fighting corruption.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe message to Ukraine -- the real message to Ukraine, our U.S. policy message is don't engage in political investigations. The message from the President, however, was the exact opposite -- do engage in political investigations and do it for my re-election.\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd it's also made clear they want the White House meeting and ultimately if they want $400 million in U.S. aid, this is what they have to do. The only lament I hear from my colleagues is it wasn't successful, they got caught, they didn't get the political investigations and they still had to release the money. Now, they still haven't gotten the White House meeting but they had to release the money because the whistleblower blew the whistle -- the whistleblower the President wants to punish -- and because Congress announced it was doing investigations, and very soon thereafter, the President was forced to lift the hold on the aid.\\n\\n\\n\\nThey argue well this makes it -- this makes it OK, that it was a failed effort to bribe Ukraine, a failed effort to extort Ukraine. That doesn't make it better, it's no less odious because it was discovered and it was stopped. And we have courageous people like yourself who come forward, who report things, who do what they should do, who have a sense, as you put it, Colonel, of duty -- of duty. Not to the person of the President, but to the presidency and to the country, and we thank you for that.\\n\\n\\n\\nAt the end of the day, I think this all comes back to something we heard from another career foreign service officer just last Friday, in a conversation he overheard with the President in a restaurant in Ukraine, in which the President, not Rudy Giuliani, not anyone else, the President of the United States wanted to know are they going to do the investigation? This is the day after that July 25th call -- are they going to do the investigations? And he's ensured by Ambassador Sondland they're going to do it.\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd what does Sondland relate to this foreign service officer after he hangs up that call? The President doesn't give a expletive about Ukraine, he only cares about the big things that help his personal interests. That's all you need to know.\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd it isn't just about Ukraine. Of course, Ukraine is fighting our fight against the Russians, against their expansionism. That's our fight, too -- that's our fight, too, at least we thought so on a bipartisan basis, that's our fight, too. That's why we support Ukraine with the military aid that we have.\\n\\n\\n\\n[13:40:00]\\n\\n\\n\\nWell the President may not care about it but we do. We care about our defense, we care about the defense of our allies and we darn well care about our Constitution. We are adjourned. I please ask the -- the audience to allow the witnesses and the members who have to go vote to leave first.\\n\\n\\n\\nJAKE TAPPER, CNN HOST: I'm Jake Tapper, live in Washington.\\n\\n\\n\\nToday's first round of the impeachment hearings for this week is in the books. We just heard from Jennifer Williams. She's a State Department aide to Vice President Mike Pence. We also heard from Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Vindman. He is the National Security Council's top Ukraine advisor at the White House.\\n\\n\\n\\nHouse Intelligence Democrats have largely focus on the witnesses' impression of that phone call between President Trump and Ukrainian President Zelensky on July 25th, which both of them were listening to, while Republicans have attempted to discredit and undermine the witnesses, especially Lieutenant Colonel Vindman.\\n\\n\\n\\nBefore we get to an analysis, I want to play to what could be a key point of this entire investigation of this entire impeachment hearing.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen you strip away the Democrats talking about Lieutenant Colonel Vindman's patriotism, his service, his inspiring story as an immigrant to this country when he was a little boy, when you strip away Republicans trying to undermine him, questions about whether or not he followed the chain of command when it came to his concerns about the call, this is really what this hearing is about.\\n\\n\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\n\\n\\nDANIEL GOLDMAN, COUNSEL FOR HOUSE DEMOCRATS: So just to summarize in this July 25th call between the presidents of the United States and Ukraine, President Trump demanded a favor of President Zelensky to conduct investigations that both of you ang acknowledge were for President Trump's political interest, not the national interest, and in return for his promise of a much-desired White House meeting for President Zelensky.\\n\\n\\n\\nColonel Vindman, is that an accurate summary of the excerpts we just looked at in.\\n\\n\\n\\nVINDMAN: Yes.\\n\\n\\n\\nGOLDMAN: Miss Williams?\\n\\n\\n\\nJENNIFER WILLIAMS, AIDE TO VICE PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE: Yes.\\n\\n\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\n\\n\\nTAPPER: Jeffrey Toobin, your response?\\n\\n\\n\\nJEFFREY TOOBIN, CNN CHIEF LEGAL ANALYST: When you strip away everything, what we have learned over the past month is one thing, which is for the first time in American history, an American president has used taxpayer dollars to persuade, bribe, extort another president for information that will help him get reelected.\\n\\n\\n\\nThat was the initial accusation. And that's what's been proven over and over again with all these witnesses.\\n\\n\\n\\nTAPPER: Dana Bash?\\n\\n\\n\\nDANA BASH, CNN CHIEF POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT: Absolutely. And what you haven't heard is any Republican on that day say anything other than that. No Republican has tried, even attempted to poke a hole in that fundamental question, why we are all here, why these hearings are taking place.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat Republicans did instead is question the credibility of the witness, question the story, repeat conspiracy theories that have been debunked by the Intelligence Community.\\n\\n\\n\\n(CROSSTALK)\\n\\n\\n\\nTAPPER: About whether or not Russia or Ukraine interfered in the election?\\n\\n\\n\\nBASH: Yes. And by the Trump Justice Department, which we can get to in a second. But just keeping it broad, the fact that Republicans didn't even try to go there on the substance of the allegation and what the picture of these witnesses, just like the ones last week, painted, is very, very telling. It goes to the notion of, OK, he did it. And a lot of these\\n\\n\\n\\nRepublicans have said in other forums, it wasn't the right thing to do but it's not impeachable and the process is bad.\\n\\n\\n\\nTAPPER: John King, during the hearing, President Trump didn't tweet at Lieutenant Colonel Vindman or Jennifer Williams as he has before about both of them.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut the White House official account did tweet something -- if we could put that tweet up. The White House official account, paid by your tax dollars, if you're an American watching right now, saying, Tim Morrison, Alex Vindman's former boss, said he had concerns about Vindman's judgement.\\n\\n\\n\\nNow that is factually accurate to Morrison, who is no longer on the National Security Council. Did say that he had concerns about whether or not Vindman had the right policy making chops for the job.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut it is remarkable to see taxpayer dollars being used to attack a current National Security Council official.\\n\\n\\n\\nJOHN KING, CNN CHIEF NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes. First, you had the president do it. He's faced a lot of blowback from Republicans, saying please don't do that, please don't attack these witnesses, we're trying to do this on a different track. Now you have the taxpayer accounts, as you mentioned, doing it here.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut it's part of the Republican strategy. Number one -- and you saw some of this in the hearing as well -- Mr. Morrison did say that.\\n\\n\\n\\nIf you read the full transcript of Mr. Morrison, he said something damaging about the president. He, too, went to the National Security Council lawyer and reported his concerns about the call.\\n\\n\\n\\nThey Republicans are and this is smart politically -- it would be smart in a trial for a lawyer -- they're cherry-picking the information that they believe helps them. They're want challenging the facts. I think that is the most important part.\\n\\n\\n\\n[13:45:04]\\n\\n\\n\\nWe've now had five witnesses in public hearings, the public impeachment hearings, and the Republicans are not challenging the facts.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe facts are being billed that everyone involved, whether they're in Ukraine or the State Department or today inside the West Wing of the White House, thought this was off the rails, thought it was wrong, thought it was improper, though it was possible illegal when you got to the question of putting the hold on the money. The Republicans aren't challenging that.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat they're trying to do is hold the Republicans in line by raising questions about judgment, about loyalty, about maybe political motivations or we're you leaking. It's all a side show, but it's an important side show politically to keep Republicans from breaking. TAPPER: Laura Coates, your take on, this time, not the president but\\n\\n\\n\\nthe White House itself attacking a witness -- that's my interpretation -- I should say criticizing, publicly airing critical testimony against one witness while that witness was testifying?\\n\\n\\n\\nLAURA COATES, CNN LEGAL ANALYST: What I really have a problem with is this idea in isolation not providing the full context of the statement. When you do that and you use selective quotes, you mislead the public and the job of the White House is not to do just that. It's supposed to guide the public to lead them in genuine fact. In fact, that didn't happen. That led to the quote.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe real issue for me is let's compare last week to now. Last week, it was all about, well, he was inappropriate but not outlandish. Now it's, you described an abuse of power, you described a quid pro quo, but you didn't say the words bribery and extortion, therefore, it's not really a problem. That's the only leg they have to stand on.\\n\\n\\n\\nThat combined with -- the really offensive one here to me was the idea of, who are you to tell me this information, Vindman? They questioned why he had the audacity to want his name referred to as lieutenant colonel instead of mister. Who do you think you are? You have the audacity to wear your uniform in this courtroom, this professional hearing room. Who do you think you are?\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd here you are, taking outside --\\n\\n\\n\\n(CROSSTALK)\\n\\n\\n\\nTAPPER: You see Lieutenant Colonel Vindman and his twin brother, who also works in the White House, walking through the halls.\\n\\n\\n\\nI'm sorry.\\n\\n\\n\\nCOATES: And you have both of them walking the halls and both in positions of real power. But he refused repeatedly to overstate his position. He refused to say that he was somebody who was in charge of policy.\\n\\n\\n\\nNobody questioned that he was in charge of policy to the -- that the president of the United States had the prerogative to set foreign policy as the real -- real diplomat. But they tried to attack him for that because they had nothing else there. It was the audacity arguments, the semantics.\\n\\n\\n\\nI think it's the most effective unpersuasive and effective here. And one was, as Dana was talking about, if you do not have anything to retort to the actual substance, you have to fire shots at the messenger and take the position of, well, it may be important for the world to have heard this, but you were the wrong person to tell us.\\n\\n\\n\\nIf that's the case, Jake, who should it have been?\\n\\n\\n\\nTAPPER: Andrew McCabe, former deputy director of the FBI, you know a little about mean tweets from President Trump and the White House.\\n\\n\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\n\\n\\nTAPPER: So without going through your entire history, we heard Ambassador Yovanovitch last week say, in real time, that she found President Trump's tweet intimidating. Republicans have said that mean tweets cannot be intimidating, it just mean tweets, who cares.\\n\\n\\n\\nHaving been on the end of it, having been on the end of a negative campaign from President Trump, coming from the White House, what is it like? Is it intimidating? And what do you say to people who say, it's just a negative tweet, who cares?\\n\\n\\n\\nANDREW MCCABE, CNN CONTRIBUTOR: First of all, nobody said that to me because that's not what it is. It's absolutely horrifying. I know that from my time still serving in government, while I was serving as deputy director and acting director.\\n\\n\\n\\nTo be receiving those sorts of attacks from the president that you serve, while you're in a government position, and therefore not in any position to ever respond or reply or defend yourself in public, it is both horrifying to be turned upon like that by our chief executive of the nation.\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd also just oddly -- you just feel so defenseless because there's absolutely nothing you can do to respond to it, to respond in a way with the sort of amplification and clarity that the president has when he speaks about anything.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt is absolutely horrifying. It's chilling to your family.\\n\\n\\n\\nTAPPER: We heard Lieutenant Colonel Vindman say it's not just about the attacks of the president, it's everything it set off.\\n\\n\\n\\nMCCABE: Right, that it sets off. It unleashes a whole torrent of the president's supporters, people who follow him closely, voters and folks like that. But even worse so, people on the Hill, other folks, elected representatives, in positions of authority, who pick up these false narratives and then begin to repeat the lies that the president says about you.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt's just -- I can't even adequately describe it. And I know exactly how Ambassador Yovanovitch feels.\\n\\n\\n\\nTAPPER: So stepping back from that tweet from the White House, John Dean, tell us what you think was effective. What wasn't effective, what point were made?\\n\\n\\n\\n[13:50:06]\\n\\n\\n\\nJOHN DEAN, FORMER WHITE HOUSE COUNSEL: If I could just footnote what Andrew said about having been attacked. He knows, I know, you know the basic truth of what happened and efforts to stir up, confuse it. You get a certain comfort in knowing you've told the truth, and attacks just don't affect that.\\n\\n\\n\\nI happened to have been in the Witness Protection Program, so I had extra help in protecting myself. But what's happened this morning, to me, was not surprising. There was a lot of speechifying. Republicans found they really had no questions very quickly and posturing, and started posturing, attacking the process. And it shows the weakness of their position overall. The Democrats obviously refuted some of that.\\n\\n\\n\\nBig picture, nothing has changed. We're getting more confirmation, the public is getting educated, putting faces on these people and learning what, indeed -- how unprecedented that a president would use his office in this manner to get political advantage over his potential opponent.\\n\\n\\n\\nTAPPER: Scott Jennings, I want to ask about one point that I thought was not ineffective by Republican Congressman Chris Stewart, of Utah, taking issue with Lieutenant Colonel Vindman's use of the word demand for that part of the call with President Trump, suggesting he'd like a favor and wants President Zelensky to do something for him.\\n\\n\\n\\nWe heard Jennifer Williams and Lieutenant Colonel Vindman say they thought it was inappropriate and a demand.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut here's Chris Stewart taking issue with that. Take a listen.\\n\\n\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\n\\n\\nREP. CHRIS STEWART (R-UT): Much has been talked about as we discussed between President Trump and President Zelensky and the word favor and it being interpreted as a basis for impeachment.\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd your interpretation of the word favor -- and I'll paraphrase you and feel free to correct me. You said, In the military culture, which you and I are both familiar with, when a superior officer asks for a favor of a subordinate, they will interpret that as a demand.\\n\\n\\n\\nIs that a fair synopsis of what you previously stated?\\n\\n\\n\\nVINDMAN: Representative, when a superior makes a request, that's an order.\\n\\n\\n\\nSTEWART: OK. In short then you think your interpretation of a favor is a demand based upon your military experience in the military culture?\\n\\n\\n\\nVINDMAN: I think that is correct.\\n\\n\\n\\nSTEWART: I think that is correct. Is President Trump a member of the military?\\n\\n\\n\\nVINDMAN: He is not.\\n\\n\\n\\nSTEWART: Has he ever served in the military?\\n\\n\\n\\nVINDMAN: Not that I'm aware of.\\n\\n\\n\\nSTEWART: Is President Zelensky a member of the military? VINDMAN: I don't believe so.\\n\\n\\n\\nSTEWART: The answer is, he's not.\\n\\n\\n\\nWould it be fair then to take a person, who has never served in the military, and to take your re-evaluation of their words based on your military experience and your military culture, and to attach that culture and that meaning of those words to someone who's never served?\\n\\n\\n\\nVINDMAN: Representative, I made that judgment, and I stick by that judgment.\\n\\n\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\n\\n\\nTAPPER: He calls in nonsense. I think that's nonsense, is what Stewart says right after I made that judgment. What do you think?\\n\\n\\n\\nSCOTT JENNINGS, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST: Yes. I thought it was an interesting line of questioning. But it went to the overall assertion by Republicans today that Vindman isn't in a position to know exactly what the president's state of mind was.\\n\\n\\n\\nOn other occasions, he says he never met or advised the president directly. He said, quote, I don't know what the president was thinking. He said, quote, I was making a judgment call as a layman.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat Stewart was doing was effective. To say you heard this but, because you don't know the president, you didn't speak to the president, and have a different frame of reference, you're giving your opinion instead of what may be the most important fact, which is what is the president's state of mind.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt's fine for Republicans to argue that today and I thought it was effective. That's all going to change tomorrow when Gordon Sondland shows up, because he actually has been talking to the president.\\n\\n\\n\\nI view today, Jake, as bit of a bridge day to get to the main event, which is Sondland.\\n\\n\\n\\nKING: It is a smart strategy. The Republicans are trying to get that one or two moments that are played on FOX News, that are played on social media, Trump-friendly social media. Where you say, aha, you think it's a demand, because you're a colonel, but the president wouldn't.\\n\\n\\n\\nRepublicans want you to focus on that one moment. The other day, it was, well, Ambassador Yovanovitch, if they wanted to remove you so they could be corrupt in Ukraine, why replace you with Bill Taylor, a man of great integrity? They want you to look at the one moment as opposed to the weeks before, the weeks after, which is Sondland, and more on what Rudy Giuliani were up to.\\n\\n\\n\\nTOOBIN: Far be it for me to predict what viewers of FOX News will think. But can we talk about what a crazy position Stewart was taking there? This president of Ukraine has people dying from lack of military equipment. He has people dying every day because they don't have military equipment.\\n\\n\\n\\n[13:55:00]\\n\\n\\n\\nDonald Trump holds in his hand the potential to save the lives of Ukrainians.

{"original": "(CNN) — A volcanic island in the middle of South Korea's East Sea, remote Ulleungdo island has long been a popular destination among nature-loving South Koreans. But foreigners are just now catching on.\\n\\nTo travel there, you'll first have to navigate a 2.5-hour train ride to Pohang or Gangneung port, followed by a 3.5-hour, stomach-churning ferry ride. At the end of the arduous journey? One of the most beautiful islands on Earth.\\n\\nUlleungdo is peaceful and pristine -- a natural refuge that's home to towering volcanic peaks, fascinating rock formations, cedar wood forests, juniper trees, a few tiny fishing villages and a reputation as South Korea's most spiritual destination.\\n\\nFor first-time visitors, here's how to make the most of it:\\n\\nSouth Korea's 'Mystery' island\\n\\nUlleungdo is nicknamed Mystery Island and is known to be a sacred island for the South Koreans. courtesy Kate Springer\\n\\nNicknamed Mystery Island for its mystical energy, Ulleungdo is believed to have been formed following volcanic eruptions over 2.5 million years ago.\\n\\nUlleungdo is known to be a sacred island where rich energy of the land and clear energy of the sky meet, and where yin and yang marry, explains Jang Yunhee, a local guide from Toursungingbong.\\n\\nFor most of its history, the island has been difficult to access and uninhabited by people, so primitive nature and ecology are well preserved. This has added to the island's spiritual reputation.\\n\\nBetween 1400 and 1882, Korea's Chosun Dynasty adopted an empty-island policy and ordered islanders to evacuate Ulleungdo for fear of Japanese invasion.\\n\\nIt wasn't until the 1880s, when the Japanese claimed Ulleungdo as its own, that the Korean government set in motion a resettlement plan to repopulate the island.\\n\\nArriving in 1883, the first wave of settlers included roughly 54 people. Today, there's just over 10,000 inhabitants.\\n\\nThroughout the spring and summer, fishing and tourism trades thrive. But come winter, the island more or less grinds to a stop.\\n\\nUlleungdo is the snowiest place in South Korea -- on this volcanic island, foot-high snow falls are totally normal.\\n\\nEven though it's difficult to make the ferry journey, due to rough seas, some travelers prefer to visit the island to ski or simply admire the dramatic, snowy mountain scenery.\\n\\nExplore by land\\n\\nA pedestrian suspension bridge leads to the outlying island of Gwaneumdo. courtesy Kate Springer\\n\\nFamed for its diverse ecology, Ulleungdo surrounds visitors with natural beauty.\\n\\nOne of the best ways to get your bearings is with an easy coastal walk, such as the Gwaneum Island hiking trail.\\n\\nThe one-hour trek takes travelers over a bright blue pedestrian suspension bridge to an outlying island called Gwaneumdo.\\n\\nThe short yet steep hike takes you through ancient forests and silvery grasslands, as you make your way toward viewing platforms framing the sea.\\n\\nGwaneumdo offers one of most beautiful walks in Ulleungdo. It is covered with reed forest, says Jang. There are three popular observatories around the hike, including views of Bamboo Island and Three Fairy Rocks.\\n\\nFor more experienced hikers, a trek up to Seonginbong -- the island's highest peak at 3,228 feet -- promises a huge payoff on a clear day.\\n\\nOf the many ways to reach Seonginbong, Jang recommends a walk along the Nari Basin Forest Trail, part of the Nari Basin Geopark.\\n\\nLocated in the center of the island, the basin was created after a volcano eruption millions of years ago. Today, it's best known for its extensive collection of indigenous flora, Mountain Spirit Mineral Spring, and rare mountain vegetables.\\n\\nSurrounded by layers of mountains, the Nari Basin is the only flatland in Ulleungdo where many wild mountain vegetables grow, says Jang.\\n\\nWithin the geopark, you can also admire the cloud fall, layers of clouds which look like waterfalls, and fantastic views in the autumn as the leaves change color.\\n\\nThen there's Bongnaepokpo Falls, where three tiers of water tumble from a height of 25 meters. The vast majority of hotels and restaurants around the area source their drinking water from this pristine waterfall.\\n\\nIn the surrounding redwood forest, hikers can cool off in front of a natural air conditioner formed by holes in the boulders.\\n\\nStand in front of the cave-like crevice and you'll feel a steady blast of cool subterranean air, which maintains a consistent temperature of 4 degrees Celsius all year.\\n\\nFor the best views on Ulleungdo, Jang suggests a trip to the Seokpo Observatory -- the only spot on the island where you can enjoy both sunset and sunrise.\\n\\nRelated content 14 of Seoul's quirkiest bars\\n\\nOn the water\\n\\nUlleungdo is a popular destination for scuba diving, kayaking, fishing and swimming. courtesy Kate Springer\\n\\nThe island is home to clear water that's teeming with marine life, so it's no surprise that Ulleungdo has become a hot spot for scuba diving, kayaking, fishing, and swimming.\\n\\nBefore diving in, we'd recommend taking a scenic boat or fishing tour around the island. From May till November, there are several three-hour tours that depart from Dodong, the main ferry port.\\n\\nThe itineraries typically zig through dramatic rock formations, stop by an old pirate's cave, and afford excellent views of the landscape along the way.\\n\\nA few tours also provide opportunities to catch fresh red sea bream, butter fish, mackerel and rockfish with experienced local fishermen.\\n\\nWith its clear waters and abundant marine life, the island has become the go-to destination in South Korea for serious divers.\\n\\nUlleungdo attracts divers because of far visibility, large fish and dynamic topography, says Jang. Throughout the year, a 20- to 30-meter range of visibility is guaranteed, and you can often see as far as 50 meters.\\n\\nJang suggests visiting between August and October to experience the best of underwater scenery. Thanks to the Kuroshio current, you can see tropical fish swimming north with the current.\\n\\nKayaking is another way for adventurous travelers to freely explore the waters of Ulleungdo.\\n\\nParticularly in the waters around Gwaneumdo, on the northeastern coast, kayakers will be surrounded by dramatic cliffs, stoney beaches, and fascinating rock formations such as Elephant Rock.\\n\\nRelated content Seoul: The city where spas never close\\n\\nWhat to eat\\n\\nIf budget is no obstacle, we'd recommend eating as much seafood -- especially shrimps -- as possible. courtesy Kate Springer\\n\\nAs you wander through the tiny fishing villages on the southeast coast, you'll likely notice squid drying in the sun and tanks full of squirming shrimp in the shade.\\n\\nThis is a land of superlative seafood, so we'd recommend eating as much as possible during your visit.\\n\\nStart your culinary journey on a high note with a meal at Chungeumho, in the tiny fishing town of Jeodong. At this mom 'n' pop restaurant, you'll find wooden sharing tables wrapped in plastic and cushioned seats pad the floor.\\n\\nThe restaurant is run by a fishing company with professional equipment that enables them to bring fresh shrimp from the deep sea [about 50 to 300 meters deep] to the restaurant, says Jang.\\n\\nCalled Dokdo shrimp, these famous shrimp taste sweeter and have great, silky texture.\\n\\nThey're so fresh, in fact, that these pretty pink crustaceans are presented live tableside before a quick bath in the steamer or fryer.\\n\\nIf budget is no obstacle, visitors can try all three kinds of Dokdo shrimp: Chicken Shrimp, Flower Shrimp and Peach Flower shrimp, which is the rarest.\\n\\nNamed after an island that's part of a territorial dispute between South Korea and Japan, Dokdo shrimp recently shot into the spotlight when they were served for President Trump at South Korea's state banquet in November 2017.\\n\\nThe island is also famed for its wild mountain vegetables. The selection of more 700 varieties is known to lure chefs from all over South Korea.\\n\\nUlleungdo gets more snow than any other part of Korea, but these mountain vegetables still thrive here, says Jang. As a result, they absorb rich minerals from the wind, sea, and volcanic soil.\\n\\nOur wild vegetables have a rich flavor and they're abundantly nutritious.\\n\\nFor those curious about these fibrous herbs and vegetables, Jang suggests lunch at Yayeongjang Sikdang. The open-air cafe sits at the entrance of the Nari Basin Forest Trail, so visitors can sit down for a leisurely san-namul (mountain herb) lunch after a hike.\\n\\nThere's no menu. Instead, simply choose how many vegetable banchan (side dishes) you'd like to try -- some have been dried, fermented, others marinated in chili sauce or vinegar.\\n\\nThere's a set menu that includes namul (mountain vegetables), bibimbap, potato pancakes. The vegetables are typically served in tiny white bowls, alongside warm rice, deodeok-root pancakes, seaweed soup and pumpkin rice wine.\\n\\nThe most popular is allium microdictyon (myungee na-mul in Korean), which is also called Siberian onion, says Jang. But it's difficult to get, because it is rare and very expensive. You normally pickle it, then serve it with grilled beef or raw fish.\\n\\nAnother must-try food on the island is local tiger beef. Sporting a distinct black and orange hide, these rare 'medicine cows' spend their lives grazing on mountain herbs.\\n\\nSince the cows grow up eating wild vegetables, the beef has unique flavor, says Jang.\\n\\nTry it at Ulleung Yakso Sutbul Garden, where an on-site restaurant serves up sirloin and bulgogi, as well as a few other local specialties.\\n\\nWhere to Stay\\n\\nThe newly opened KOSMOS Healing Stay is designed to mimic the Yin Yang sign. courtesy Kate Springer\\n\\nThe island is full of tiny guest houses and a few resorts, but recently opened KOSMOS Healing Stay is by far the most visually striking.\\n\\nOpened in 2018, the hotel sits on a sheer cliff in the shadow of Songgot-bong mountain (dubbed ice pick peak in Korean).\\n\\nDesigned by Chanjoong Kim of The System Lab, a Korean architectural firm, the hotel is shaped like a spiral to mimic the Yin Yang sign. It's also the first building in the world to have been constructed by pouring ultra high-performance concrete (UHPC) into a mold on site.\\n\\nWith this innovative material, the stark white walls are just 12 centimeters thick and have a light, airy feel thanks to high vaulted ceilings. From there, the interiors feature natural volcanic stones, terracotta, and bespoke wooden furniture.\\n\\nRelated content 50 beautiful places to visit in South Korea\\n\\nEach room at the villa is dedicated to one of the five elements, and guests are assigned a room based on their personal astrology chart in order to enhance their 'chi', or energy flow.\\n\\nJang says the hotel has excellent feng shui, thanks to its position between the mountains and sea.\\n\\nIt is abundantly clear that this mountain holds a strong energy, says Jang.\\n\\nKoreans believe that a location like this, with a strong chi (energy), can rejuvenate people and help their wishes come true."}

At all.\\n\\nThe sportswear company reported sales and earnings that missed forecasts. It also said revenues for 2017 would be lower than what Wall Street expected.\\n\\nAnd the company said its chief financial officer was stepping down for personal reasons. Wall Street often assumes that an executive leaving for personal reasons is a sign that a company is in trouble and that someone needs to take the fall.\\n\\nUnder Armour (UAA) tanked on this trifecta of bad news.

The Sports Authority went out of business. Finish Line (FINL) closed hundreds of stores last year.\\n\\nThe poor start to 2017 for Under Armour is even more troubling when you consider how awful a year the company had in 2016. The stock plummeted nearly 30% last year because of weak sales and the broader challenges in the athletic apparel industry.\\n\\nArchrival Nike (NKE) also had a dismal 2016.

{"original": "Like most of us, you're probably still trying to figure out how the federal tax overhaul will change what you'll owe Uncle Sam.\\n\\nBut the new law could affect how much you'll pay in state taxes as well.\\n\\nOf the 41 states that impose an income tax, all but five (Alabama, Arkansas, Mississippi, New Jersey and Pennsylvania) directly tie parts of their tax code to elements in the federal code.\\n\\nThey may use as their starting point a filer's federal adjusted gross income or federal taxable income. And they may adopt some of the same exemptions and deductions used at the federal level.\\n\\nBottom line: The more a state conforms to features in the federal code, the more their residents could feel an impact at the state level.\\n\\nThat is, unless their state makes changes. Some have started to, but many more are currently debating what to do.\\n\\nMany states have preliminarily estimated that they'll end up getting more revenue if they do nothing, meaning your state tax bill could grow, even though your state government hasn't done anything to raise your taxes.\\n\\nRelated: New York OKs plan to skirt controversial provision of GOP tax law\\n\\nSo legislatures across the country are debating what to do with the extra cash. They have three choices: Use it to make investments or fill budget holes. Provide offsetting tax cuts to residents. Or some combination of the two.\\n\\nColorado, for instance, estimates that it will collect hundreds of millions of dollars more each year between 2018 and 2025.\\n\\nOne reason is that the elimination of the federal personal and dependent exemptions could increase a Colorado resident's state tax bill by $191 per family member on one's return, according to estimates from staff economists of Colorado's legislative council.\\n\\nWhile Colorado lawmakers have introduced some bills — including one to expand a child care expense tax credit — to offset the loss of the personal exemption, it's not clear where the state will end up.\\n\\nMaryland estimated it could get an additional $500 million by doing nothing. Its lawmakers have decided to keep $200 million to invest in education. But this week, they struck an agreement in principle to make $100 million worth of tax changes to offset some of the state tax increases residents might owe as result of the federal changes.\\n\\nIdaho lawmakers, meanwhile, passed a bill lowering income tax rates to the tune of $100 million to offset their estimated revenue increase.\\n\\nBut that won't protect everyone in Idaho from a higher state tax bill. While the legislation will lower taxes for a lot of people, it would raise taxes on many large families, Richard Auxier, a research associate at the Tax Policy Center, noted in TaxVox.\\n\\nThat's because Idaho residents have been able to claim the full federal personal exemption and standard deduction on their state returns. The new federal law nearly doubled the standard deduction — which may reduce a filer's state tax burden. But it's not enough to offset the loss of personal exemptions for low- and middle-income parents with several kids.\\n\\nLawmakers have recently crafted a partial fix to the problem by increasing the newly created state child tax credit.\\n\\nRelated: 2018 federal tax cuts by state\\n\\nMeanwhile, some other states are trying to make a few technical corrections to address potential tax increases, said John Hicks, executive director of the National Association of State Budget Officers.\\n\\nNebraska lawmakers, for instance, have advanced a bill to create a state personal exemption to offset the loss of the federal one.\\n\\nIf you do face a higher state tax bill because your lawmakers don't act, Hicks thinks it's unlikely that the increase would wipe out the tax cuts you might see on your federal tax return.\\n\\nIt will still be a net tax cut, Hicks said.\\n\\nUnless, of course, you're in the minority of filers in 2018 who are also facing a federal tax increase."}
{"original": "Tulsa, Oklahoma (CNN) Democratic presidential candidate Michael Bloomberg on Sunday released an economic justice plan during a stop in the Tulsa, Oklahoma, neighborhood that was known as Black Wall Street before it was destroyed in a 1921 riot and massacre.\\n\\nBloomberg unveiled his Greenwood Initiative, a plan his campaign says will help address the systemic bias that has kept many Black Americans from gaining wealth. It calls for ending discriminatory business practices and biased policies in the financial, criminal justice and voting systems in America that have resulted in loss of wealth for African American families.\\n\\nThe Greenwood district of North Tulsa, known as Black Wall Street in the early 20th century, was home to more than 300 African American-owned businesses. In 1921, a mob of white residents destroyed the neighborhood and killed at least 300 black people.\\n\\nAccording to Bloomberg's plan, the initiative will pave the way for the creation of 1 million new black homeowners and 100,000 new black-owned businesses over the next 10 years. The former New York City mayor is also calling for a $70 billion investment in America's 100 most disadvantaged communities and wants to help black families triple their wealth over the next decade to an all-time high.\\n\\nMuch of the plan is modeled off of work by Geoffrey Canada , a well-known community leader in New York, according to a campaign aide.\\n\\nDuring the announcement, Bloomberg said that black exploitation through slavery, sharecropping, Jim Crow, segregation, redlining and more, worked exactly as intended -- resulting in the average African American family owning just one-tenth of the wealth of the average white family in America.\\n\\nFor hundreds of years, America systematically stole black lives, black freedom, and black labor. A theft of labor and a transfer of wealth enshrined in law and enforced by violence, he said.\\n\\nBloomberg, who was raised in Medford, Massachusetts, and worked for 15 years on Wall Street before forming his own company, said he would not have been as successful in building his businesses under the conditions black Americans have experienced.\\n\\nCould I have built my business and enjoyed my success under those conditions? Of course not, Bloomberg said. But I also know that my story may have turned out very differently if I had been Black, and that more black Americans of my generation would have ended up with far more wealth, had they been white.\\n\\nBloomberg cites his time from his 12 years as mayor of New York City when pointing to why he is the candidate who can take on these issues and create the kind of change he lays out in the plan.\\n\\nBloomberg's record as mayor\\n\\nAs mayor, Bloomberg expanded affordable housing, permitted charter schools that primarily served black and Hispanic students, announced a Ban the Box policy to remove from job applications the check box that asks about convictions and launched the Young Men's Initiative that focused on the disparities young men of color face.\\n\\nBloomberg's record on race, though, has been clouded by his enforcement of stop and frisk, a type of aggressive policing that allowed -- and some say encouraged -- officers to detain a person on virtually any type of vague suspicion, search that individual without a warrant and arrest the person if any kind of illegal substance or weapon was found.\\n\\nThe policing approach, officially called Stop, question and frisk, sparked a backlash from activists throughout Bloomberg's tenure as New York City mayor because it disproportionately affected African American and Latino men."}

The card details on this page have not been reviewed or provided by the card issuers.\\n\\nWhy did we select these cards as our best cash back credit cards for 2021? CNN Underscored's comprehensive credit card methodology compares every aspect of each cash back credit card to our benchmark credit card to determine which cards can potentially earn you the most cash. So let's dive into the details of each card and see how they stack up.\\n\\nCiti Double Cash\\n\\nBest overall card for cash back\\n\\nWhy it's great in one sentence: The Citi Double Cash Card is extremely simple, since you earn 2% cash back on every purchase — 1% when you buy and 1% when you pay your statement — all for no annual fee.\\n\\nThis card is right for: People looking for an easy and straightforward way to earn cash back without having to worry about category bonuses.\\n\\nHighlights:\\n\\nEarn 2% cash back on everything — 1% when you make a purchase and another 1% when you pay it off.\\n\\n18-month 0% introductory rate on balance transfers (13.99% to 23.99% variable afterward).\\n\\nExpert users can convert the cash back to Citi ThankYou travel points at a ratio of 1 cent per point when combined with the Citi Prestige® Card or Citi Premier℠ Card.\\n\\nNo annual fee.\\n\\nSign-up bonus: None.\\n\\nWhat we like about the Citi Double Cash: When compared to all of the other major no-annual-fee credit cards, the Citi Double Cash offers the highest ongoing flat-rate return on every single purchase. With this card you'll earn 2% in cash back — 1% when you buy something and another 1% when you pay it off — on every purchase you make. There's no maximum on the cash back you can earn, and you don't need to worry about tracking category bonuses.\\n\\nThe Citi Double Cash also offers a relatively long 18-month introductory 0% interest rate period for balance transfers — a great way to pay off your debt (though make sure you pay it off, because the rate jumps to a variable 13.99% to 23.99% after the introductory offer ends). And you have up to four months after you open the account to make your first balance transfer and still have it qualify for the introductory offer.\\n\\nRelated: Read CNN Underscored's list of the best balance transfer credit cards.\\n\\nExperts will enjoy pairing this card with one of the premium Citi ThankYou credit cards, such as the Citi Premier or Citi Prestige. That's because if you also have a premium ThankYou card, you can actually convert your cash back from the Citi Double Cash to Citi ThankYou points and then transfer those points to one of Citi's airline partners or redeem them for airfare at 1.25 cents per point when going through the Citi travel portal with the Citi Premier (though this rate will drop to 1 cent per point after April 21, 2021).\\n\\nOne thing that could be better: Although the Citi Double Cash card will earn you the most cash back on your everyday purchases, it doesn't have any category bonuses. This can be a downside if you routinely make a large number of purchases in a particular category.\\n\\nYou'll also find that the Citi Double Cash doesn't come with many perks, such as travel or purchase protections. This is also not the card to use for international purchases, as you'll be charged a 3% foreign transaction fee when you're overseas, which more than offsets the rewards you'd earn.\\n\\nWhy it's our benchmark card: The ease of use and straightforward top-of-market cash back earning rate of the Citi Double Cash are why CNN Underscored currently uses the Double Cash as our benchmark credit card to compare the features of other credit cards and determine if they're better or worse overall.\\n\\nYou can read more about our benchmark credit card concept in our credit card methodology guide or dig into our complete review of the Citi Double Cash.\\n\\nLearn more and apply for the Citi Double Cash Card.\\n\\nBlue Cash Preferred by American Express\\n\\nBest for US supermarkets\\n\\nPHOTO: iStock Earn bonus cash back at US supermarkets with the Blue Cash Preferred credit card.\\n\\nWhy it's great in one sentence: The Blue Cash Preferred Card from American Express earns 6% cash back at US supermarkets (up to $6,000 per year in purchases, then 1%), making it one of the best credit cards year after year for buying groceries.\\n\\nThis card is right for: People who spend a significant amount of money at US supermarkets but who also want to avoid high interest rates on their purchases for their first year as a card member.\\n\\nHighlights:\\n\\nEarn 6% cash back at US supermarkets on up to $6,000 per year in purchases (then 1%) and on select US streaming subscriptions.\\n\\nEarn 3% cash back at US gas stations and on transit (including taxis/ride-shares, parking, tolls, trains, buses and more).\\n\\nEarn 1% cash back on everything else.\\n\\n0% interest on all purchases for the first 12 months (13.99% to 23.99% variable afterward).\\n\\nPurchase protection and return protection.\\n\\nCar rental loss and damage insurance.\\n\\nTerms apply.\\n\\nWelcome bonus: Earn a $300 statement credit after you spend $3,000 in purchases on your new card within the first six months after opening the account, plus get a $0 introductory annual fee for the first year ($95 thereafter).\\n\\nWhat we like about the Blue Cash Preferred: For many Americans, a significant portion of the monthly family budget goes to supermarket and gas station expenses. The Blue Cash Preferred card dials up the bonus cash back on those two categories, creating a go-to in your wallet for these routine purchases.\\n\\nNot only will you earn extra cash back in the grocery and gas departments, but you'll also earn a significant amount of cash back on all your US streaming subscriptions. This includes over 20 different providers, such as Disney+, HBO, Netflix, Spotify and YouTube TV, among others. And when transit starts to make a comeback, you'll also get a nice return there as well, with 3% cash back on those transactions.\\n\\nRelated: Earn more rewards on your groceries with these credit cards.\\n\\nThe Blue Cash Preferred also comes with a solid return protection policy, which can come in handy during the upcoming holiday season. Return protection allows you to return an eligible item within 90 days from the day of purchase if the merchant won't take it back. As long as you used your Blue Cash Preferred to pay for it, American Express will refund the full purchase price (excluding shipping and handling). Claims are capped at $300 per item, up to a maximum of $1,000 per card account per calendar year.\\n\\nOne thing that could be better: Many of the bonus categories on the Blue Cash Preferred are limited to purchases made within the United States. There's also a 2.7% foreign transaction fee on the card, which doesn't make this an ideal choice for international travel. And the card has a $95 annual fee, which is significantly higher than many other credit cards offering cash back.\\n\\nThe Blue Cash Preferred currently comes with a $0 introductory annual fee for the first year, then $95 thereafter. But if you prefer a card that never has an annual fee and also offers a strong return on groceries, you might consider the Blue Cash Everyday® Card from American Express instead.\\n\\nWhile the Blue Cash Everyday earns a lower 3% cash back at US supermarkets (up to $6,000 per year, then 1%), it has no annual fee. That means if you spend less than $3,166 in grocery purchases annually, it could be a better choice.\\n\\nRelated: Amex Blue Cash Preferred vs. Amex Blue Cash Everyday.\\n\\nWhere it beats our benchmark card: Welcome bonus, an introductory interest rate on purchases, return protection and car rental damage coverage.\\n\\nWhere our benchmark card is better: The Citi Double Cash has an introductory interest rate on balance transfers, and its cash back can be converted to Citi ThankYou travel points when combined with the Citi Prestige Card or Citi Premier Card.\\n\\nLearn more and apply for the Blue Cash Preferred Card.\\n\\nChase Freedom Flex\\n\\nBest for restaurants, including takeout and delivery\\n\\nPHOTO: Chase The Chase Freedom Flex has both fixed and rotating bonus categories.\\n\\nWhy it's great in one sentence: The new Chase Freedom Flex credit card offers both fixed category bonuses — including one specifically for dining — and a set of rotating category bonuses, plus cell phone protection as well.\\n\\nThis card is right for: People who are looking for a no-annual-fee card that earns bonus cash back at restaurants, even if they're just getting delivery or takeout, as well as in several other categories.\\n\\nHighlights:\\n\\nEarn 5% cash back on travel purchased through Chase Ultimate Rewards.\\n\\nEarn 3% cash back on dining at restaurants, including takeout and eligible delivery services.\\n\\nEarn 3% cash back on drugstore purchases.\\n\\nEarn 5% cash back on quarterly bonuses categories (up to $1,500 on combined purchases).\\n\\nEarn 1% cash back on all other purchases.\\n\\nCash back can be transferred to airline and hotel travel programs when combined with select Chase Ultimate Rewards cards, such as the Chase Sapphire Preferred Card\\n\\nCell phone protection.\\n\\nNo annual fee.\\n\\nSign-up bonus: Earn $200 bonus cash back after you spend $500 on purchases in the first three months after opening the account.\\n\\nWhat we like about the Chase Freedom Flex: While you might sign up for the Chase Freedom Flex for its sign-up bonus, it'll likely become one of your long-term go-to cards, thanks to its rotating 5% bonus categories and ongoing 3% category bonuses at restaurants and drugstores.\\n\\nThe Chase Freedom Flex earns 5% on travel booked through Chase Ultimate Rewards, 3% at drugstores and 3% at restaurants. And even if you're not physically eating out at restaurants right now, you'll still receive the increased cash back on takeout and eligible delivery orders.\\n\\nBut in addition to those three fixed bonus categories, the card offers a set of 5% bonus categories that rotate each quarter. For the current quarter from January through March, the categories are wholesale clubs, internet, cable and phone services, and select streaming services, The rotating categories are capped at $1,500 in purchases per quarter, so you can earn as much as $75 in bonus cash.\\n\\nAside from the bonus categories, this card also comes with many unique benefits that differ from most other Chase cards. One of our favorites is cell phone protection. As long as you use your Chase Freedom Flex to pay your monthly cell phone bill, you'll be covered against theft or damage to your phone, up to $800 per claim and $1,000 per year, with a $50 deductible per claim and a maximum of two claims in a 12-month period. This is currently the only no-annual-fee Chase credit card that offers this highly sought-after benefit.\\n\\nOne thing that could be better: While there's no maximum on how much cash back you can earn in the three fixed bonus categories, the rotating 5% cash back categories do have that $1,500 cap in purchases — after that, you'll only earn 1% cash back in those categories for the rest of the quarter. And you'll need to remember to activate the rotating categories each quarter in order to earn bonus cash back in them.\\n\\nWhere it beats our benchmark card: Sign-up bonus, category bonuses and cell phone protection.\\n\\nWhere our benchmark card is better: The Citi Double Cash has an introductory rate on balance transfers.\\n\\nLearn more and apply for the Chase Freedom Flex.\\n\\nCostco Anywhere Visa\\n\\nBest for gas purchases\\n\\nPHOTO: iStock Earn bonus cash back on gasoline purchases, both at Costco and other gas stations.\\n\\nWhy it's great in one sentence: The Costco Anywhere Visa Card by Citi offers big rewards on many practical purchases, such as 4% cash back on eligible gas purchases worldwide (capped at the first $7,000 in purchases per year, then 1% thereafter), 3% cash back at restaurants and on eligible travel purchases and 2% cash back on all Costco and costco.com purchases.\\n\\nThis card is right for: Costco members who want strong rewards when buying at Costco and filling up their gas tank.\\n\\nHighlights:\\n\\nEarn 4% cash back on eligible gas purchases worldwide, including Costco gas (capped at the first $7,000 in purchases per year, then 1% thereafter).\\n\\nEarn 3% cash back at restaurants and on eligible travel purchases.\\n\\nEarn 2% cash back on all Costco and costco.com purchases (other than Costco gas).\\n\\nEarn 1% cash back on all other purchases.\\n\\nPurchase protection and extended warranty coverage.\\n\\nNo foreign transaction fees.\\n\\nNo annual fee.\\n\\nSign-up bonus: None.\\n\\nWhat we like about the Costco Anywhere Visa: For those looking to fill up their vehicle's gas tank, the Costco Anywhere Visa offers the most cash back when compared to other top-earning credit cards.\\n\\nEarning 4% cash back on all gas purchases worldwide for the first $7,000 per year (1% thereafter) can add up quickly and save you some serious money over the course of the year. And aside from the earning potential on gas, earning 3% cash back at restaurants and eligible travel purchases is on par — and many times better — than what you'll see with other cash back credit cards.\\n\\nThe Costco Anywhere Visa also offers purchase protection, which is a great benefit for all purchases, especially during the holiday season. You'll be covered if your item is damaged or stolen within 120 days of purchase (90 days for New York residents). The coverage is good for up to $10,000 per item and $50,000 annually.\\n\\nThe purchase protection applies to items you buy anywhere, not just at Costco. But even while Costco has a favorable return policy for most of its products, electronics and major appliances only have a 90-day return window, which makes the benefits of this credit card extra useful.\\n\\nAlso, with the card's extended warranty coverage, you'll receive an additional two years of warranty on top of the normal manufacturer's warranty for any products you purchase with the card. Again, this extended warranty benefit applies not only to purchases made at Costco, but also to any other retailer as long as you use your Costco Anywhere Visa as your payment method.\\n\\nOne thing that could be better: One big disadvantage of the Costco Anywhere Visa is that you have to wait a full year to receive your rewards, which are sent in the form of an annual certificate after your February billing statement closes each year. The certificate can be redeemed for Costco purchases or exchanged for cash at your local Costco store, and will expire if it's not redeemed by December 31 of that calendar year.\\n\\nAlso, although this card doesn't carry an annual fee, to be a card member, you must have a Costco membership, which starts at $60 per year.\\n\\nWhere it beats our benchmark card: Extended warranty, purchase protection and no foreign transaction fees. Also, the Costco card is a Visa credit card, which is accepted at Costco in-store and at costco.com — Mastercards like the Citi Double Cash are not accepted in-store.\\n\\nWhere our benchmark card is better: With the Citi Double Cash, you receive your cash back on a monthly basis instead of once a year, and you don't have to physically go into a store to exchange your rewards for cash.\\n\\nRead our complete Costco Anywhere Visa credit card review.\\n\\nLearn more and apply for the Costco Anywhere Visa Card by Citi.\\n\\nChase Freedom Unlimited\\n\\nBest for flexibility\\n\\nPHOTO: iStock Cash back earned with the Chase Freedom Unlimited can also be used as points for travel, and at a greater value, when combined with a premium Chase Ultimate Rewards card.\\n\\nWhy it's great in one sentence: If you want to earn bonus rewards on all your purchases but aren't sure whether you'd prefer cash back or travel rewards, the Chase Freedom Unlimited allows you to do both when paired with the Chase Sapphire Preferred or Chase Sapphire Reserve card.\\n\\nThis card is right for: People who want maximum flexibility in a no-annual-fee credit card.\\n\\nHighlights:\\n\\nEarn 5% cash back on travel purchased through Chase Ultimate Rewards.\\n\\nEarn 3% cash back on dining at restaurants, including takeout and eligible delivery services.\\n\\nEarn 3% cash back on drugstore purchases.\\n\\nEarn 1.5% cash back on all other purchases.\\n\\nExpert users can convert the cash back to flexible travel points when pairing the Freedom Unlimited with a Chase Sapphire Preferred or Reserve card.\\n\\n15-month 0% introductory rate on purchases (14.99% to 23.74% variable afterward).\\n\\nNo annual fee.\\n\\nSign-up bonus: Earn $200 bonus cash back after you spend $500 on purchases in the first three months after opening the account.\\n\\nWhat we like about the Chase Freedom Unlimited: If you prefer cash back now but think that a dose of adventure is in your future once travel returns to normal, the Chase Freedom Unlimited can give you the best of both worlds.\\n\\nWhen you pair the Freedom Unlimited with a premium Chase Ultimate Rewards credit card, such as the Chase Sapphire Preferred or Chase Sapphire Reserve, you can convert your cash back to travel points at a rate of 1 cent per point. Then, you're able to redeem those points for travel at an increased value of 1.25 to 1.5 cents apiece via the Chase travel portal.\\n\\nEven better, once you've converted the cash back to points, you can transfer them to any of Chase's 13 airline and hotel loyalty partners. This amazing flexibility is why frequent flyer website The Points Guy values Ultimate Rewards points at 2 cents apiece. At that rate, since you're earning 1.5% cash back in all non-bonus categories with the Freedom Unlimited, you could effectively end up with a 3% return on your everyday purchases.\\n\\nOne thing that could be better: The Citi Double Cash comes with a higher cash back earning rate on everyday purchases, and you can also convert its cash back to travel points in conjunction with a premium Citi card.\\n\\nBut Citi's travel partners aren't as impressive as Chase's, and while the Double Cash doesn't have any bonus categories, the Freedom Unlimited has the same trio of bonus categories as the Chase Freedom Flex (though you won't receive cell phone protection with the Chase Freedom Unlimited).\\n\\nWhere it beats our benchmark card: Sign-up bonus, bonus categories, purchase protection, extended warranty protection and an introductory rate on purchases for 15 months.\\n\\nWhere our benchmark card is better: If you're solely looking to earn flat-rate cash back on every purchase you make, the Citi Double Cash will earn you more on your everyday purchases.\\n\\nLearn more and apply for the Chase Freedom Unlimited.\\n\\nInk Business Unlimited\\n\\nBest for small businesses\\n\\nPHOTO: iStock Small businesses can earn $750 in bonus cash back when opening a new Ink Business Unlimited credit card.\\n\\nWhy it's great in one sentence: Small business owners can earn 1.5% cash back on all their purchases with the Ink Business Unlimited for no annual fee, and also have the option to convert their cash back to travel rewards down the line.\\n\\nThis card is right for: Businesses who want flexible cash back rewards from a no-annual-fee credit card.\\n\\nHighlights:\\n\\nEarn 1.5% cash back on all purchases.\\n\\nExpert business users can convert the cash back to flexible travel points when pairing the Ink Business Unlimited with an Ink Business Preferred Credit Card , or a personal Sapphire card.\\n\\n12-month 0% introductory rate on purchases (13.24% to 19.24% variable afterward).\\n\\nPrimary rental car insurance.\\n\\nPurchase protection and extended warranty coverage.\\n\\nNo annual fee.\\n\\nSign-up bonus: Earn $750 bonus cash back after you spend $7,500 on purchases in the first three months after opening the account.\\n\\nWhat we like about the Ink Business Unlimited: If your business is looking for a simple easy-to-understand cash back card, the Ink Business Unlimited is a great, straightforward option. It earns 1.5% cash back on everything your business buys with it, 365 days a year.\\n\\nAnd if you decide down the line that you'd prefer travel rewards to cash back, you can pair the Ink Business Unlimited with the premium Ink Business Preferred (or alternately, the personal Chase Sapphire Preferred or Chase Sapphire Reserve) and convert your cash back to travel points, then redeem the points for travel or transfer them to any of Chase's 13 airline and hotel loyalty partners.\\n\\nPlus, right now is a fantastic time to get the Ink Business Unlimited. That's because the card currently comes with the highest sign-up bonus we've ever seen on this card. New card holders can earn $750 in bonus cash back after spending $7,500 in purchases in the first three months after opening the account. That's an unbelievable sign-up bonus for a card that has no annual fee.\\n\\nOne thing that could be better: You won't want to use the Ink Business Unlimited on overseas purchases, as it charges a 3% foreign transaction fee. And the $7,500 minimum spend requirement to earn the $750 sign-up bonus isn't small, but it should be feasible for any small business that has regular expenses that can be charged to a credit card.\\n\\nWhere it beats our benchmark card: Sign-up bonus, primary rental car insurance, purchase protection, extended warranty protection and an introductory rate on purchases for 12 months.\\n\\nWhere our benchmark card is better: If you're solely looking to earn flat-rate cash back on every purchase you make, the Citi Double Cash will earn you more on your everyday purchases.\\n\\nLearn more and apply for the Ink Business Unlimited.\\n\\nDiscover it Cash Back\\n\\nBest sign-up bonus\\n\\nPHOTO: iStock For its sign-up bonus, the Discover it Cash Back card matches all cash back earned in the first year.\\n\\nWhy it's great in one sentence: The rotating categories and cash back match bonus on the Discover it Cash Back card mean you can earn a ton of cash back in the first year you have the card.\\n\\nThis card is right for: People looking for a card with a great sign-up bonus and who routinely spend money on popular rotating categories — such as groceries, gas stations, restaurants, Amazon.com and more.\\n\\nHighlights:\\n\\nEarn 5% cash back in rotating quarterly bonus categories up to $1,500 each quarter (must enroll each quarter to earn 5% cash back).\\n\\nEarn 1% cash back on all other purchases.\\n\\n0% interest on all purchases for the first 14 months (11.99% to 22.99% variable afterward).\\n\\n0% introductory APR for 14 months on balance transfers (11.99% to 22.99% variable APR after that) with a 3% intro balance transfer fee, up to 5% fee on future balance transfers (see terms).\\n\\nNo foreign transaction fees.\\n\\nNo annual fee.\\n\\nSign-up bonus: Receive a match of all cash back earned at the end of your first year.\\n\\nWhat we like about the Discover it Cash Back: Earning 5% cash back on a quarterly basis, up to $1,500 per quarter, allows the cash back to really add up. The current quarterly categories on the Discover it Cash Back card are grocery stores, Walgreens and CVS, while other categories later on the 2021 bonus categories calendar includes gas stations, streaming services, restaurants and more.\\n\\nOn top of that, all the cash back you earn on the Discover it Cash Back will be matched at the end of the first year for new card holders, making this an ideal card to have if you know you'll be spending a lot on your credit card over the next year. This means those rotating bonus categories are worth 10% in the first year, and all your purchases outside of the bonus categories earn a solid 2% return the first year.\\n\\nIn addition to a great cash back rewards program, new card holders can also take advantage of a 0% introductory interest on all purchases and balance transfers for the first 14 months from the date of the first transfer, though the rate increases to a variable 11.99% to 2.99% at the end of the 14-month period. There's a 3% intro balance transfer fee that goes up to 5% on future balance transfers (see terms)\\n\\nRelated: Tight on cash? These credit cards charge 0% interest on purchases.\\n\\nOne thing that could be better: You won't get paid out on your sign-up bonus until you've had the card for an entire year, whereas many other credit card welcome offers are paid out as soon as you meet the minimum spend requirement. You also need to pay close attention to the cash back calendar and manually activate the categories on the Discover it Cash Back each quarter, online or by phone, before you make purchases in order to earn the bonus cash back.\\n\\nWhere it beats our benchmark card: No foreign transaction fees or introductory interest on purchases, and the cash back match in the first year equals the earning rate of the Citi Double Cash for everyday purchases and significantly beats it in the bonus categories.\\n\\nWhere our benchmark card is better: After the first year when the cash back match bonus ends, the Citi Double Cash earns a higher return on everyday purchases.\\n\\nU.S. Bank Cash+ Visa\\n\\nBest for streaming\\n\\nPHOTO: iStock Choose streaming as one of your 5% bonus categories on the U.S. Bank Cash+ Visa.\\n\\nWhy it's great in one sentence: Card holders earn 5% cash back in two categories they select from a list — including options like streaming services — every quarter throughout the year, up to $2,000 in purchases per quarter.\\n\\nThis card is right for: People who want a no-annual-fee credit card that offers the flexibility to earn cash back in the categories that work best for them based on their personal spending habits.\\n\\nHighlights:\\n\\nEarn 5% cash back on your first $2,000 in combined credit card purchases each quarter on two categories you choose.\\n\\nEarn 2% cash back on one other category of your choice.\\n\\nEarn 1% cash back on all other purchases.\\n\\n0% interest on all purchases for the first 14 months (11.99% to 22.99% variable afterward).\\n\\n0% introductory APR for 12 billing cycles on balance transfers (13.99% to 23.99% variable APR after that).\\n\\nNo annual fee.\\n\\nSign-up bonus: Earn a $150 rewards bonus after you apply online and spend $500 in eligible purchases within the first 90 days of account opening.\\n\\nWhat we like about the U.S. Bank Cash+ Visa: When compared to the other 5% rotating category cards, the U.S. Bank Cash+ Visa Signature Card is the only one that allows you to customize your cash back categories to select two that work best for your quarterly spending habits. With the other cards, the increased quarterly categories are selected by the issuer and can't be changed by the card holder.\\n\\nWith roughly a dozen category options to choose from, the 5% cash back categories on the U.S. Bank Cash+ Visa include:\\n\\nTV, Internet & Streaming Services\\n\\nCell Phone Providers\\n\\nDepartment Stores\\n\\nElectronics Stores\\n\\nHome Utilities\\n\\nFurniture Stores\\n\\nSince streaming services are popular these days, you can select this as one of your two options. And while the Blue Cash Preferred Card by American Express earns slightly more cash back for US streaming services, it comes with a $95 annual fee after the first year, which you won't have to worry about with the U.S. Bank Cash+ Visa.\\n\\nWith the U.S. Bank Cash+ Visa, you'll also earn 5% cash back on up to $2,000 in purchases in your two chosen categories during each quarter, where other similar cards cap your cash back at $1,500 during the same time frame. That means you can earn up to an extra $100 cash back per quarter or up to $400 per year.\\n\\nOn top of the 5% cash back options, you'll also be able to select one category to earn 2% cash back each quarter, with no cap on the amount you can earn. These 2% categories typically includes popular choices such as:\\n\\nGrocery Stores\\n\\nGas Stations\\n\\nRestaurants\\n\\nOne thing that could be better: You need to activate the cash back categories every quarter on the U.S. Bank Cash+ Visa, and you'll only earn the increased 2% or 5% cash back after activation — rewards can't be retroactively applied. This means you truly need to be on top of your credit card and remember the categories that you select on a quarterly basis.\\n\\nThe 5% cash back options also don't include some more mainstream categories. Instead, everyday purchases, such as buying groceries and filling up your gas tank, are in the inferior 2% cash back bucket.\\n\\nWhere it beats our benchmark card: Sign-up bonus, selectable bonus categories and an introductory offer on balance transfers.\\n\\nWhere our benchmark card is better: The Citi Double Cash has a longer introductory offer on balance transfers and earns a higher 2% flat-rate cash back on all your everyday purchases for those who don't want to worry about category bonuses and a maximum cap.\\n\\nBank of America Cash Rewards\\n\\nBest for travel\\n\\nPHOTO: iStock Choose travel as your 3% cash back bonus category on the Bank of America Cash Rewards card.\\n\\nWhy it's great in one sentence: The Bank of America Cash Rewards credit card allows card holders to select one cash back category — including travel — to earn an increased 3% cash back, but they can change their option on a monthly basis.\\n\\nThis card is right for: Those looking to increase their cash back for all travel-related purchases without having to pay for an annual fee.\\n\\nHighlights:\\n\\nEarn 3% cash back in the category of your choice: gas, online shopping, dining, travel, drugstores or home improvement/furnishings.\\n\\nEarn 2% cash back at grocery stores and wholesale clubs.\\n\\nEarn 1% cash back on all other purchases.\\n\\nBank of America Preferred Rewards members earn 25% to 75% more cash back on every purchase.\\n\\n0% interest on all purchases for the first 12 billing cycles (13.99% to 23.99% variable afterward).\\n\\nNo annual fee.\\n\\nSign-up bonus: Earn $200 cash rewards bonus after making at least $1,000 in purchases in the first 90 days of account opening.\\n\\nWhat we like about the Bank of America Cash Rewards: The Bank of America Cash Rewards card is the only card that allows you to select a category of your choice to earn bonus cash back but where you can change your selection every single month. This allows you to plan ahead and truly maximize your earnings based on upcoming purchases.\\n\\nThis is also the only no-annual-fee cash back card that will earn you 3% cash back on travel. This includes anything from air travel and hotel stays to car rentals, train travel, tolls and more. While there are other cards that allow you to earn 3x points on travel — such as the Chase Sapphire Reserve card — you're usually looking at a significant annual fee.\\n\\nWith the Bank of America Cash Rewards, you're capped at a higher $2,500 per quarter to receive the 2% and 3% cash back categories. If you're able to max out the bonus on a quarterly basis on the 3% cash back categories alone, you'll earn you an extra $75 every quarter.\\n\\nBank of America Preferred Rewards members, which are customers who have at least $20,000 in combined qualifying balances in their Bank of America and/or Merrill investment accounts, can earn an additional 25% to 75% on their rewards earned on the Bank of America Cash Rewards. There are three different tiers, with Gold members earning a 25% bonus, Platinum members a 50% bonus and Platinum Honors members a 75% bonus.\\n\\nThat means if you're a Preferred Rewards member, you're looking at an increased 3.75% to 5.25% cash back in the 3% cash back categories. Of course, this requires parking a significant amount of money in your Bank of America bank or investment account, but it can pay out extremely well for loyal Bank of America customers.\\n\\nOn the benefits front, one of the most unique perks of the Bank of America Cash Rewards card is Bank of America's Museums on Us program. Flash your Bank of America Cash Rewards credit card at a participating museum and you'll receive complimentary general admission to more than 225 cultural institutions across the United States on the first full weekend of every month. For museum lovers, this allows you to visit different museums in your city or while traveling for absolutely no cost.\\n\\nOne thing that could be better: Although the Bank of America Cash Rewards card can earn bonus cash back on your travel purchases, there are very few travel perks that come with this card. If you travel a lot throughout the year and are looking for a card that offers you travel credits, lounge access, complimentary Global Entry or TSA PreCheck and travel protections, you might want to instead consider another travel rewards card, such as the Bank of America®️ Premium Rewards®️ credit card — although it carries a $95 annual fee.\\n\\nWhere it beats our benchmark card: Sign-up bonus, bonus categories, an introductory offer on purchases and complimentary museum access.\\n\\nWhere our benchmark card is better: The Citi Double Cash has an introductory offer on balance transfers and earns a higher 2% flat-rate cash back on all your everyday purchases for those who don't want to worry about category bonuses and a maximum cap.\\n\\nLooking for a credit card that earns travel rewards?

{"original": "WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The CIA destroyed videotapes of interrogations of al Qaeda suspects because they no longer had intelligence value and they posed a security risk, CIA director Michael Hayden said Thursday.\\n\\nCIA Director Michael Hayden says congressional leaders were told about the tapes.\\n\\nThe tapes were made in 2002 and destroyed in 2005, Hayden said in a letter to CIA employees obtained by CNN.\\n\\nThey were made as an internal check on the CIA's use of harsh interrogation techniques, believed to include waterboarding, a technique that involves restraining a suspect and pouring water on them to simulate drowning.\\n\\nThe agency made the decision to destroy the tapes only after it was determined they were no longer of intelligence value and not relevant to any internal, legislative, or judicial inquiries, Hayden said.\\n\\nBeyond their lack of intelligence value -- as the interrogation sessions had already been exhaustively detailed in written channels -- and the absence of any legal or internal reason to keep them, the tapes posed a serious security risk, Hayden said. Were they ever to leak, they would permit identification of your CIA colleagues who had served in the program, exposing them and their families to retaliation from al Qaeda and its sympathizers.\\n\\nHayden said he was providing the background information to CIA employees because he expected possible misinterpretations of the facts in the days ahead. Watch why the tapes' destruction is controversial »\\n\\nA government official with knowledge of the tapes said the tapes were of al Qaeda operative Abu Zubayda and another detainee.\\n\\nHayden said the agency began taping interrogations after the 2002 capture of Zubayda, whose defiant and evasive response to normal questioning ... made imperative the use of other means to obtain the information.\\n\\nTo meet that need, CIA designed specific, appropriate interrogation procedures, Hayden wrote. Before they were used, they were reviewed and approved by the Department of Justice and by other elements of the executive branch.\\n\\nTo ensure the interrogations proceeded in accord with established legal and policy guidelines, the agency began videotaping the questioning. The videotaping began and ended in 2002, Hayden said.\\n\\nThe director said the Office of the General Counsel and the Office of the Inspector General examined the tapes in 2003 and determined the interrogations were lawful. Hayden also said the leaders of the CIA's congressional oversight committees were informed years ago of the videos and the agency's intent to destroy them.\\n\\nWhat matters here is that it was done in line with the law, he said. Over the course of its life, the agency's interrogation program has been of great value to our country. It has helped disrupt terrorist operations and save lives. It was built on a solid foundation of legal review. It has been conducted with careful supervision. If the story of these tapes is told fairly, it will underscore those facts.\\n\\nU.S. President George W. Bush disclosed the detention of Zubayda in September 2006 and said his behavior prompted the use of an alternative set of procedures, which he said were cleared by the U.S. Department of Justice.\\n\\nInformation obtained from Zubayda under the new interrogation procedures led investigators to al Qaeda member Ramzi bin al Shibh, Bush said, and information from Zubayda and bin al Shibh led investigators to Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, the mastermind of the September 11, 2001, terror attacks.\\n\\nCritics have questioned the importance of the information obtained from Zubayda, and the entire question of what type of interrogation techniques are appropriate for use by the United States became a key issue in the confirmation process for Attorney General Michael Mukasey.\\n\\nSen. Patrick Leahy, the Vermont Democrat who heads the Senate Judiciary Committee, said news the CIA destroyed the videotapes is troubling, and it fits a pattern we have seen repeatedly during this administration.\\n\\nWhen an administration abandons the moral high ground to take the low road, they are mortgaging the historic commitment to human rights that is part of the legacy of every American. The damage is compounded when such actions are hidden away from accountability, Leahy said in a statement. E-mail to a friend\\n\\nAll About Central Intelligence Agency • Michael Hayden • Al Qaeda"}

{"original": "(CNN) —\\n\\nThe US Air Force Academy mismanaged its sexual assault prevention and response program during the 2017 academic year and failed to comply with the military's victim assistance and advocacy policy, according to the Department of Defense's annual assessment of service academies released Wednesday.\\n\\nOverall, the Pentagon's Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office's assessment found that reporting of sexual assault at the service academies increased in the 2017 school year – documenting a total of 112 reports of sexual assault, up from 86 reports received in the prior year.\\n\\nMost of the reporting increase occurred at the US Military Academy following a change in reporting policy and the relocation of its victim assistance office, according to the DOD.\\n\\nWe are absolutely committed to making the Academies safe, Robert Wilkie, under secretary of defense for personnel and readiness, said in a press release. It is imperative that these future officers understand how eliminating sexual harassment and assault advances our ability to protect the nation.\\n\\nBased on feedback from focus groups involving 188 cadets/midshipmen, and 107 faculty, and staff participants, the report revealed that most cadets and midshipmen knew how to report and obtain support should they experience a sexual assault.\\n\\nBut while it concluded that the US Military Academy and US Naval Academy were in compliance with Pentagon policies that govern sexual assault and sexual harassment prevention, victim assistance and advocacy, investigation, accountability, and assessment, the report determined that the mismanagement of victim response programs at the Air Force Academy did not meet that standard.\\n\\nSexual assault prevention and response program mismanagement at the US Air Force Academy put it out of compliance with Department and Air Force victim assistance and advocacy policy, the report said. Given this discrepancy, the Air Force Academy is in partial compliance overall.\\n\\nAllegations late in the academic year prompted a commander directed investigation at the Air Force Academy which disclosed significant evidence of mismanagement and unprofessionalism that negatively impacted victim advocacy and assistance rendered to a number of cadets, the assessment stated.\\n\\nWhile the Air Force Academy investigated and took steps to correct these problems, greater oversight of response programs and personnel is required at all three Academies, it said.\\n\\nThe DOD report did not detail the specific nature of these problems.\\n\\nResponding to the report, the Air Force deputy director of public affairs, Capt. Matthew Chism, said in a statement: As expected as a result of the Academy's finding and reporting misconduct on the part of individuals within its Sexual Assault Prevention and Response office, the Academy was found not in compliance in one of the five goals assessed in the report, the goal of victim assistance and advocacy.\\n\\nWe are confident that we have addressed the issues in the SAPR office at the Academy and will continue to scrutinize our efforts and remain transparent as we strive to develop a culture of dignity and respect at the Academy, he added.\\n\\nThe report also noted that compliance with policy does not guarantee effective programs and practices and identified several actions for each academy to better address the issue.\\n\\nProvide cadets and midshipmen with prevention skills and education that are both relevant to their current circumstances and their future roles as officers.\\n\\nEnhance preparation of military officers and senior enlisted leaders so they may more effectively promote and teach about climates of dignity and respect.\\n\\nEnact an oversight process for the assistance rendered by Sexual Assault Response Coordinators and Victim Advocates.\\n\\nOperationalize the Department's sexual harassment definition for the academy environment and expand services and support for cadets and midshipmen who desire to address it.\\n\\nEstablish or enhance a centralized data assessment and reporting resource.\\n\\nReducing the number of future sexual assault victims requires new approaches and resources above what are currently provided for response programs, the report said, adding that service academies are unique environments that require programs tailored to their specific circumstances.\\n\\nNew initiatives require a sustained effort and a long-term view to give such efforts the best chances for success over time, the report concluded.\\n\\nCNN's Barbara Starr contributed to this report"}

They embrace abstract lighting to enable developments to stand out in external appearance.\\n\\nDigital media facades now light up the city, enabling buildings to act as dynamic landmarks. And a well-considered luminous building envelope that displays abstract digital visualizations can also make a cultural contribution to the city.\\n\\nThe Zhuhai Opera House in Zhuhai, China, is built of two shell-like structures, the larger of which sits at 90 meters (295 feet) tall, and the smaller at 60 meters (197 feet) tall.

We are provided with new urban perspectives as buildings color the city. The dynamic lighting can contribute to a sense of safety, provide a creative outlet, or create a shared platform for play.\\n\\nThus, building good media architecture is a complex design challenge. It requires expertise in architectural design, urban design, interaction design, lighting design, user experience and community engagement.\\n\\nPlanning policy must adapt\\n\\nUrban policy evaluates the environmental, social and economic merits of new developments. It aims to ensure that architecture delivers a high-quality public realm for current and future generations.\\n\\nPolicy is regularly updated to take account of emergent needs and opportunities. And cities are increasingly proposing policy for media architecture in urban planning schemes. This indicates a growing consensus on its contribution to urban areas.\\n\\nHarpa Concert Hall and Conference Centre in Reykjavik, Iceland.

If not done well, it can highlight an architectural disconnect or social and cultural issues. This can result in disinterest, disapproval and even vandalism.\\n\\nGood design processes proof media architecture against technical evolution, repurposing and obsolescence. These design requirements should be better represented in policy and decision-making processes. Such an approach would involve councils in stimulating the uptake of media architecture to activate public space. There is an initial opportunity to align policy on digital media with policy on public open space.\\n\\nDigital media policy currently focuses on protecting vistas and avoiding visual clutter. Public open space policy is more qualitative and experiential in nature. It states the need for open spaces that enhance livability, engagement and attractiveness.\\n\\nBoth policies should remain. This is critical. But councils should recognize that media architecture can engage people and improve the appeal of public space at the same time.\\n\\nWhat are the key policy issues?\\n\\nCouncils ought to set out specific guidelines on design and decision criteria to promote long-term sustainability and acceptance. These include:\\n\\nTypes of engagement. How can people interact with media architecture? Who are these people -- local citizens or everyone? Is a specific age group addressed? Is the public involved in the design process? Is there a cultural program that media architecture should align with, such as White Night or Vivid?\\n\\nUniversal comprehensibility of displayed text, images or symbols across cultural norms and values. Should such information undergo moderation? How is this process installed, maintained and reviewed? Who takes part in moderation?\\n\\nPrevention of architectural and urban conflict. How is light intrusion in people's private spaces mitigated? How do the digital media contribute to the architectural experience of the city? How are text, images or symbols designed to align with the architecture?\\n\\nResponses to repurposing and obsolescence. How does media architecture handle occupancy changes, refurbishing and vacancy? How is it affected by the architectural lifespan, and vice versa?\\n\\nPrevention of technological decay. Which optimization measures are in place to assure technical flexibility? How will media architecture be maintained? How regular are information updates?\\n\\nDisagreement procedures. How can occupants and residents voice concerns about displayed information or technical features, before and after project completion?\\n\\nCouncils should also provide policy with specific goals for particular areas. For instance, regulation of light intrusion may be more lenient in tourist areas than in residential areas.\\n\\nWhere the city goes from here\\n\\nThe need for policy is motivated by an architectural concern. In most cases, when we add or alter the external appearance of a building, we have to get a permit. This ensures the modification has minimal adverse impact on the character and appearance of the area. The aim is that the building -- regardless of purpose, dimension or location -- fits in nicely.\\n\\nAs with dwellings, media architecture needs to fit in nicely and maximize its social capabilities. We should prevent media architecture that results in decorated sheds or mere window dressing.\\n\\nPolicy that better addresses the functional and social qualities of media architecture is essential. And for that policy to work, there is a growing need for more comprehensive guidance to ensure people are engaged by digital media in public space."}

Arkin joined a roundtable discussion on the current situation of the war in Iraq.\\n\\nIn his farewell memo, he said the American press is not aggressive enough about covering military engagements.\\n\\nI find it disheartening that we do not report the failures of the generals and national security leaders, he said. I find it shocking that we essentially condone continued American bumbling in the Middle East and now Africa through our ho-hum reporting.\\n\\nHe said that most of his critiques of NBC apply to the rest of the news media, as well.\\n\\nYears ago, he said, particularly as the social media wave began, it was clear that NBC (like the rest of the news media) could no longer keep up with the world. Added to that was the intellectual challenge of how to report our new kind of wars when there were no real fronts and no actual measures of success.\\n\\nArkin is inclined to agree with some of Trump's isolationist instincts, though he called Trump an ignorant and incompetent impostor.\\n\\nAnd yet, he wrote, I'm alarmed at how quick NBC is to mechanically argue the contrary, to be in favor of policies that just spell more conflict and more war.\\n\\nStaffers at NBC might object to that line — pointing out that the network doesn't take an institutional position in favor of any policy. But Arkin is describing the impression he takes away from the news coverage and commentary.\\n\\nHe also said in the memo that the Trump age led NBC to start emulating the national security state itself — busy and profitable. No wars won but the ball is kept in play.\\n\\nIn the memo, Arkin called himself a difficult guy, and gave NBC a lot of credit for keeping him in the corporate family for so long.\\n\\nHe said he is leaving because his expertise, though seeming to be all the more central to the challenges and dangers we face, also seems to be less valued at the moment. And I find myself completely out of synch with the network, being neither a day-to-day reporter nor interested in the Trump circus. He is working on multiple books and other projects.\\n\\nHere is the full text of Arkin's memo.\\n\\n—-\\n\\nJanuary 4 is my last day at NBC News and I'd like to say goodbye to my friends, hopefully not for good. This isn't the first time I've left NBC, but this time the parting is more bittersweet, the world and the state of journalism in tandem crisis. My expertise, though seeming to be all the more central to the challenges and dangers we face, also seems to be less valued at the moment. And I find myself completely out of synch with the network, being neither a day-to-day reporter nor interested in the Trump circus.\\n\\nI first started my association with NBC 30 years ago, feeding Cold War stories to Bob Windrem and Fred Francis at the Pentagon. I became an on-air analyst during the 1999 Kosovo War, continuing to work thereafter with Nightly News, delighting and oftentimes annoying in my peculiar position of being a mere civilian amongst THE GENERALS and former government officials. A scholar at heart, I also found myself an often lone voice that was anti-nuclear and even anti-military, anti-military for me meaning opinionated but also highly knowledgeable, somewhat akin to a movie critic, loving my subject but also not shy about making judgements regarding the flops and the losers.\\n\\nWhen the attacks of 9/11 came, I was called back to NBC. I spent weeks on and off the air talking about al Qaeda and the various wars we were rushing into, arguing that airpower and drones would be the centerpiece not troops. In the new martial environment where only one war cry was sanctioned I was out of sync then as well. I retreated somewhat to writing a column for the Los Angeles Times, but even there I had to fight editors who couldn't believe that there would be a war in Iraq. And I spoke up about the absence of any sort of strategy for actually defeating terrorism, annoying the increasing gaggles of those who seemed to accept that a state of perpetual war was a necessity.\\n\\nI thought then that there was great danger in the embrace of process and officialdom over values and public longing, and I wrote about the increasing power of the national security community. Long before Trump and deep state became an expression, I produced one ginormous investigation – Top Secret America – for the Washington Post and I wrote a nasty book – American Coup – about the creeping fascism of homeland security.\\n\\nLooking back now they were both harbingers for what President Obama (and then Trump) faced in terms of largely failing to make enduring change.\\n\\nSomewhere in all of that, and particularly as the social media wave began, it was clear that NBC (like the rest of the news media) could no longer keep up with the world. Added to that was the intellectual challenge of how to report our new kind of wars when there were no real fronts and no actual measures of success. To me there is also a larger problem: though they produce nothing that resembles actual safety and security, the national security leaders and generals we have are allowed to do their thing unmolested. Despite being at war, no great wartime leaders or visionaries are emerging. There is not a soul in Washington who can say that they have won or stopped any conflict. And though there might be the beloved perfumed princes in the form of the Petraeus' and Wes Clarks', or the so-called warrior monks like Mattis and McMaster, we've had more than a generation of national security leaders who sadly and fraudulently have done little of consequence. And yet we (and others) embrace them, even the highly partisan formers who masquerade as analysts. We do so ignoring the empirical truth of what they have wrought: There is not one county in the Middle East that is safer today than it was 18 years ago. Indeed the world becomes ever more polarized and dangerous.\\n\\nAs perpetual war has become accepted as a given in our lives, I'm proud to say that I've never deviated in my argument at NBC (or at my newspaper gigs) that terrorists will never be defeated until we better understand why they are driven to fighting. And I have maintained my central view that airpower (in its broadest sense including space and cyber) is not just the future but the enabler and the tool of war today.\\n\\nSeeking refuge in its political horse race roots, NBC (and others) meanwhile report the story of war as one of Rumsfeld vs. the Generals, as Wolfowitz vs. Shinseki, as the CIA vs. Cheney, as the bad torturers vs. the more refined, about numbers of troops and number of deaths, and even then Obama vs. the Congress, poor Obama who couldn't close Guantanamo or reduce nuclear weapons or stand up to Putin because it was just so difficult. We have contributed to turning the world national security into this sort of political story. I find it disheartening that we do not report the failures of the generals and national security leaders. I find it shocking that we essentially condone continued American bumbling in the Middle East and now Africa through our ho-hum reporting.\\n\\nI'm a difficult guy, not prone to either protocol or procedure and I give NBC credit that it tolerated me through my various incarnations. I hope people will say in the early days that I made Brokaw and company smarter about nuclear weapons, about airpower, and even about al Qaeda. And I'm proud to say that I also was one of the few to report that there weren't any WMD in Iraq and remember fondly presenting that conclusion to an incredulous NBC editorial board. I argued endlessly with MSNBC about all things national security for years, doing the daily blah, blah, blah in Secaucus, but also poking at the conventional wisdom of everyone from Matthews to Hockenberry. And yet I feel like I've failed to convey this larger truth about the hopelessness of our way of doing things, especially disheartened to watch NBC and much of the rest of the news media somehow become a defender of Washington and the system.\\n\\nWindrem again convinced me to return to NBC to join the new investigative unit in the early days of the 2016 presidential campaign. I thought that the mission was to break through the machine of perpetual war acceptance and conventional wisdom to challenge Hillary Clinton's hawkishness. It was also an interesting moment at NBC because everyone was looking over their shoulder at Vice and other upstarts creeping up on the mainstream. But then Trump got elected and Investigations got sucked into the tweeting vortex, increasingly lost in a directionless adrenaline rush, the national security and political version of leading the broadcast with every snow storm. And I would assert that in many ways NBC just began emulating the national security state itself – busy and profitable. No wars won but the ball is kept in play.\\n\\nI'd argue that under Trump, the national security establishment not only hasn't missed a beat but indeed has gained dangerous strength. Now it is ever more autonomous and practically impervious to criticism. I'd also argue, ever so gingerly, that NBC has become somewhat lost in its own verve, proxies of boring moderation and conventional wisdom, defender of the government against Trump, cheerleader for open and subtle threat mongering, in love with procedure and protocol over all else (including results). I accept that there's a lot to report here, but I'm more worried about how much we are missing. Hence my desire to take a step back and think why so little changes with regard to America's wars.\\n\\nI know it is characteristic of our overexcited moment to blast away at former employers and mainstream institutions, but all I can say is that despite many frustrations, my time at NBC has been gratifying. Working with Cynthia McFadden has been the experience of a lifetime. I've learned a ton about television from her and Kevin Monahan, the secret insider tricks of the trade and the very big picture of what makes for original stories (and how powerful they can be). The young reporters at NBC are also universally excellent. Thanks to Noah Oppenheim for his support of my contrarian and disruptive presence. And to Janelle Rodriguez, who supported deep expertise. The Nightly crew has also been a constant fan of my too long stories and a great team. I continue to marvel as Phil Griffin carries out his diabolical plan for the cable network to take over the world.\\n\\nI'm proud of the work I've done with my team and know that there's more to do. But for now it's time to take a break. I'm ever so happy to return to writing and thinking without the officiousness of editorial tyrants or corporate standards. And of course I yearn to go back to my first love, which is writing boring reports about secret programs, grateful that the American government so graciously obliges in its constant supply. And I particularly feel like the world is moving so quickly that even in just the little national security world I inhabit, I need more time to sit back and think. And to replenish.\\n\\nIn our day-to-day whirlwind and hostage status as prisoners of Donald Trump, I think – like everyone else does – that we miss so much. People who don't understand the medium, or the pressures, loudly opine that it's corporate control or even worse, that it's partisan. Sometimes I quip in response to friends on the outside (and to government sources) that if they mean by the word partisan that it is New Yorkers and Washingtonians against the rest of the country then they are right.\\n\\nFor me I realized how out of step I was when I looked at Trump's various bumbling intuitions: his desire to improve relations with Russia, to denuclearize North Korea, to get out of the Middle East, to question why we are fighting in Africa, even in his attacks on the intelligence community and the FBI. Of course he is an ignorant and incompetent impostor. And yet I'm alarmed at how quick NBC is to mechanically argue the contrary, to be in favor of policies that just spell more conflict and more war. Really? We shouldn't get out Syria? We shouldn't go for the bold move of denuclearizing the Korean peninsula? Even on Russia, though we should be concerned about the brittleness of our democracy that it is so vulnerable to manipulation, do we really yearn for the Cold War? And don't even get me started with the FBI: What? We now lionize this historically destructive institution?\\n\\nEven without Trump, our biggest challenge as we move forward is that we have become exhausted parents of our infant (and infantile) social media children. And because of the cycle, we at NBC (and all others in the field of journalism) suffer from a really bad case of not being able to ever take a breath. We are a long way from resolving the rules of the road in this age, whether it be with regard to our personal conduct or anything related to hard news. I also don't think that we are on a straight line towards digital nirvana, that is, that all of this information will democratize and improve society. I sense that there is already smartphone and social media fatigue creeping across the land, and my guess is that nothing we currently see – nothing that is snappy or chatty – will solve our horrific challenges of information overload or the role (and nature) of journalism. AndI am sure that once Trump leaves center stage, society will have a gigantic media hangover. Thus for NBC – and for everyone else – there is challenge and opportunity ahead. I'd particularly like to think and write more about that.\\n\\nThere's a saying about consultants, that organizations hire them to hear exactly what they want to hear. I'm proud to say that NBC didn't do that when it came to me. Similarly I can say that I'm proud that I'm not guilty of giving my employers what they wanted. Still, the things this and most organizations fear most – variability, disturbance, difference – those things that are also the primary drivers of creativity – are not really the things that I see valued in the reporting ranks.\\n\\nI'm happy to go back to writing and commentary. This winter, I'm proud to say that I've put the finishing touches on a 9/11 conspiracy novel that I've been toiling on for over a decade. It's a novel, but it meditates on the question of how to understand terrorists in a different way. And I'm undertaking two new book-writing projects, one fiction about a lone reporter and his magical source that hopes to delve into secrecy and the nature of television. And, If you read this far, I am writing a non-fiction book, an extended essay about national security and why we never seem to end our now perpetual state of war. There is lots of media critique out there, tons of analysis of leadership and the Presidency. But on the state of our national security? Not so much. Hopefully I will find myself thinking beyond the current fire and fury and actually suggest a viable alternative. Wish me luck."}
{"original": "West Point, New York (CNN) -- President Obama spoke Tuesday night at the United States Military Academy in West Point, New York, about the future of the U.S. military engagement in Afghanistan. The following is a transcript of his remarks:\\n\\nGood evening. To the United States Corps of Cadets, to the men and women of our armed services, and to my fellow Americans. I want to speak to you tonight about our effort in Afghanistan -- the nature of our commitment there, the scope of our interests, and the strategy that my administration will pursue to bring this war to a successful conclusion. It is an honor for me to do so here at West Point where so many men and women have prepared to stand up for our security, and to represent what is finest about our country.\\n\\nTo address these issues, it is important to recall why America and our allies were compelled to fight a war in Afghanistan in the first place. We did not ask for this fight. On September 11, 2001, 19 men hijacked four airplanes and used them to murder nearly 3,000 people. They struck at our military and economic nerve centers. They took the lives of innocent men, women and children without regard to their faith or race or station. Were it not for the heroic actions of the passengers on board one of those flights, they could have also struck at one of the great symbols of our democracy in Washington, and killed many more.\\n\\nAs we know, these men belonged to al Qaeda -- a group of extremists who have distorted and defiled Islam, one of the world's great religions, to justify the slaughter of innocents. Al Qaeda's base of operations was in Afghanistan, where they were harbored by the Taliban -- a ruthless, repressive and radical movement that seized control of that country after it was ravaged by years of Soviet occupation and civil war, and after the attention of America and our friends had turned elsewhere.\\n\\nJust days after 9/11, Congress authorized the use of force against al Qaeda and those who harbored them -- an authorization that continues to this day. The vote in the Senate was 98 to 0. The vote in the House was 420 to 1. For the first time in its history, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization invoked Article 5 -- the commitment that says an attack on one member nation is an attack on all. And the United Nations Security Council endorsed the use of all necessary steps to respond to the 9/11 attacks. America, our allies and the world were acting as one to destroy al Qaeda's terrorist network, and to protect our common security.\\n\\nUnder the banner of this domestic unity and international legitimacy -- and only after the Taliban refused to turn over Osama bin Laden -- we sent our troops into Afghanistan. Within a matter of months, al Qaeda was scattered and many of its operatives were killed. The Taliban was driven from power and pushed back on its heels. A place that had known decades of fear now had reason to hope. At a conference convened by the U.N., a provisional government was established under President Hamid Karzai. And an International Security Assistance Force was established to help bring a lasting peace to a war-torn country.\\n\\nThen, in early 2003, the decision was made to wage a second war in Iraq. The wrenching debate over the Iraq War is well-known and need not be repeated here. It is enough to say that for the next six years, the Iraq War drew the dominant share of our troops, our resources, our diplomacy, and our national attention -- and that the decision to go into Iraq caused substantial rifts between America and much of the world.\\n\\nToday, after extraordinary costs, we are bringing the Iraq war to a responsible end. We will remove our combat brigades from Iraq by the end of next summer, and all of our troops by the end of 2011. That we are doing so is a testament to the character of our men and women in uniform. Thanks to their courage, grit and perseverance , we have given Iraqis a chance to shape their future, and we are successfully leaving Iraq to its people.\\n\\nBut while we have achieved hard-earned milestones in Iraq, the situation in Afghanistan has deteriorated. After escaping across the border into Pakistan in 2001 and 2002, al Qaeda's leadership established a safe haven there. Although a legitimate government was elected by the Afghan people, it has been hampered by corruption, the drug trade, an under-developed economy, and insufficient Security Forces. Over the last several years, the Taliban has maintained common cause with al Qaeda, as they both seek an overthrow of the Afghan government. Gradually, the Taliban has begun to take control over swaths of Afghanistan, while engaging in increasingly brazen and devastating acts of terrorism against the Pakistani people.\\n\\nThroughout this period, our troop levels in Afghanistan remained a fraction of what they were in Iraq. When I took office, we had just over 32,000 Americans serving in Afghanistan, compared to 160,000 in Iraq at the peak of the war. Commanders in Afghanistan repeatedly asked for support to deal with the reemergence of the Taliban, but these reinforcements did not arrive. That's why, shortly after taking office, I approved a long-standing request for more troops. After consultations with our allies, I then announced a strategy recognizing the fundamental connection between our war effort in Afghanistan, and the extremist safe havens in Pakistan. I set a goal that was narrowly defined as disrupting, dismantling, and defeating al Qaeda and its extremist allies, and pledged to better coordinate our military and civilian efforts.\\n\\nSince then, we have made progress on some important objectives. High-ranking al Qaeda and Taliban leaders have been killed, and we have stepped up the pressure on al Qaeda world-wide. In Pakistan, that nation's Army has gone on its largest offensive in years. In Afghanistan, we and our allies prevented the Taliban from stopping a presidential election, and -- although it was marred by fraud -- that election produced a government that is consistent with Afghanistan's laws and constitution.\\n\\nYet huge challenges remain. Afghanistan is not lost, but for several years it has moved backwards. There is no imminent threat of the government being overthrown, but the Taliban has gained momentum. Al Qaeda has not reemerged in Afghanistan in the same numbers as before 9/11, but they retain their safe havens along the border. And our forces lack the full support they need to effectively train and partner with Afghan security forces and better secure the population. Our new commander in Afghanistan -- Gen. McChrystal -- has reported that the security situation is more serious than he anticipated. In short: the status quo is not sustainable.\\n\\nAs cadets, you volunteered for service during this time of danger. Some of you have fought in Afghanistan. Many will deploy there. As your commander in chief, I owe you a mission that is clearly defined, and worthy of your service. That is why, after the Afghan voting was completed, I insisted on a thorough review of our strategy. Let me be clear: There has never been an option before me that called for troop deployments before 2010 -- so there has been no delay or denial of resources necessary for the conduct of the war. Instead, the review has allowed me ask the hard questions, and to explore all of the different options along with my national security team, our military and civilian leadership in Afghanistan, and our key partners. Given the stakes involved, I owed the American people and our troops no less.\\n\\nThis review is now complete. And as commander in chief, I have determined that it is in our vital national interest to send an additional 30,000 U.S. troops to Afghanistan. After 18 months, our troops will begin to come home. These are the resources that we need to seize the initiative, while building the Afghan capacity that can allow for a responsible transition of our forces out of Afghanistan.\\n\\nI do not make this decision lightly. I opposed the war in Iraq precisely because I believe that we must exercise restraint in the use of military force, and always consider the long-term consequences of our actions. We have been at war for eight years, at enormous cost in lives and resources. Years of debate over Iraq and terrorism have left our unity on national security issues in tatters, and created a highly polarized and partisan backdrop for this effort. And having just experienced the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression, the American people are understandably focused on rebuilding our economy and putting people to work here at home.\\n\\nMost of all, I know that this decision asks even more of you -- a military that, along with your families, has already borne the heaviest of all burdens. As president, I have signed a letter of condolence to the family of each American who gives their life in these wars. I have read the letters from the parents and spouses of those who deployed. I have visited our courageous wounded warriors at Walter Reed. I have traveled to Dover to meet the flag-draped caskets of 18 Americans returning home to their final resting place. I see firsthand the terrible wages of war. If I did not think that the security of the United States and the safety of the American people were at stake in Afghanistan, I would gladly order every single one of our troops home tomorrow.\\n\\nSo no -- I do not make this decision lightly. I make this decision because I am convinced that our security is at stake in Afghanistan and Pakistan. This is the epicenter of the violent extremism practiced by al Qaeda. It is from here that we were attacked on 9/11, and it is from here that new attacks are being plotted as I speak. This is no idle danger; no hypothetical threat. In the last few months alone, we have apprehended extremists within our borders who were sent here from the border region of Afghanistan and Pakistan to commit new acts of terror. This danger will only grow if the region slides backwards, and al Qaeda can operate with impunity. We must keep the pressure on al Qaeda, and to do that, we must increase the stability and capacity of our partners in the region.\\n\\nOf course, this burden is not ours alone to bear. This is not just America's war. Since 9/11, al Qaeda's safe havens have been the source of attacks against London and Amman and Bali. The people and governments of both Afghanistan and Pakistan are endangered. And the stakes are even higher within a nuclear-armed Pakistan, because we know that al Qaeda and other extremists seek nuclear weapons, and we have every reason to believe that they would use them.\\n\\nThese facts compel us to act along with our friends and allies. Our overarching goal remains the same: to disrupt, dismantle, and defeat al Qaeda in Afghanistan and Pakistan, and to prevent its capacity to threaten America and our allies in the future.\\n\\nTo meet that goal, we will pursue the following objectives within Afghanistan. We must deny al Qaeda a safe haven. We must reverse the Taliban's momentum and deny it the ability to overthrow the government. And we must strengthen the capacity of Afghanistan's security forces and government, so that they can take lead responsibility for Afghanistan's future.\\n\\nWe will meet these objectives in three ways. First, we will pursue a military strategy that will break the Taliban's momentum and increase Afghanistan's capacity over the next 18 months.\\n\\nThe 30,000 additional troops that I am announcing tonight will deploy in the first part of 2010 -- the fastest pace possible -- so that they can target the insurgency and secure key population centers. They will increase our ability to train competent Afghan security forces, and to partner with them so that more Afghans can get into the fight. And they will help create the conditions for the United States to transfer responsibility to the Afghans.\\n\\nBecause this is an international effort, I have asked that our commitment be joined by contributions from our allies. Some have already provided additional troops, and we are confident that there will be further contributions in the days and weeks ahead. Our friends have fought and bled and died alongside us in Afghanistan. Now, we must come together to end this war successfully. For what's at stake is not simply a test of NATO's credibility -- what's at stake is the security of our Allies, and the common security of the world.\\n\\nTaken together, these additional American and international troops will allow us to accelerate handing over responsibility to Afghan forces, and allow us to begin the transfer of our forces out of Afghanistan in July of 2011. Just as we have done in Iraq, we will execute this transition responsibly, taking into account conditions on the ground. We will continue to advise and assist Afghanistan's security forces to ensure that they can succeed over the long haul. But it will be clear to the Afghan government -- and, more importantly, to the Afghan people -- that they will ultimately be responsible for their own country.\\n\\nSecond, we will work with our partners, the United Nations, and the Afghan people to pursue a more effective civilian strategy, so that the government can take advantage of improved security.\\n\\nThis effort must be based on performance. The days of providing a blank check are over. President Karzai's inauguration speech sent the right message about moving in a new direction. And going forward, we will be clear about what we expect from those who receive our assistance. We will support Afghan ministries, governors, and local leaders that combat corruption and deliver for the people. We expect those who are ineffective or corrupt to be held accountable. And we will also focus our assistance in areas -- such as agriculture -- that can make an immediate impact in the lives of the Afghan people.\\n\\nThe people of Afghanistan have endured violence for decades. They have been confronted with occupation -- by the Soviet Union, and then by foreign al Qaeda fighters who used Afghan land for their own purposes. So tonight, I want the Afghan people to understand -- America seeks an end to this era of war and suffering. We have no interest in occupying your country. We will support efforts by the Afghan government to open the door to those Taliban who abandon violence and respect the human rights of their fellow citizens. And we will seek a partnership with Afghanistan grounded in mutual respect -- to isolate those who destroy; to strengthen those who build; to hasten the day when our troops will leave; and to forge a lasting friendship in which America is your partner, and never your patron.\\n\\nThird, we will act with the full recognition that our success in Afghanistan is inextricably linked to our partnership with Pakistan.\\n\\nWe are in Afghanistan to prevent a cancer from once again spreading through that country. But this same cancer has also taken root in the border region of Pakistan. That is why we need a strategy that works on both sides of the border.\\n\\nIn the past, there have been those in Pakistan who have argued that the struggle against extremism is not their fight, and that Pakistan is better off doing little or seeking accommodation with those who use violence. But in recent years, as innocents have been killed from Karachi to Islamabad, it has become clear that it is the Pakistani people who are the most endangered by extremism. Public opinion has turned. The Pakistani Army has waged an offensive in Swat and South Waziristan. And there is no doubt that the United States and Pakistan share a common enemy.\\n\\nIn the past, we too often defined our relationship with Pakistan narrowly. Those days are over. Moving forward, we are committed to a partnership with Pakistan that is built on a foundation of mutual interests, mutual respect and mutual trust. We will strengthen Pakistan's capacity to target those groups that threaten our countries, and have made it clear that we cannot tolerate a safe haven for terrorists whose location is known, and whose intentions are clear. America is also providing substantial resources to support Pakistan's democracy and development. We are the largest international supporter for those Pakistanis displaced by the fighting. And going forward, the Pakistani people must know: America will remain a strong supporter of Pakistan's security and prosperity long after the guns have fallen silent, so that the great potential of its people can be unleashed.\\n\\nThese are the three core elements of our strategy: a military effort to create the conditions for a transition; a civilian surge that reinforces positive action; and an effective partnership with Pakistan.\\n\\nI recognize that there are a range of concerns about our approach. So let me briefly address a few of the prominent arguments that I have heard, and which I take very seriously.\\n\\nFirst, there are those who suggest that Afghanistan is another Vietnam. They argue that it cannot be stabilized, and we are better off cutting our losses and rapidly withdrawing. I believe this argument depends upon a false reading of history. Unlike Vietnam, we are joined by a broad coalition of 43 nations that recognizes the legitimacy of our action. Unlike Vietnam, we are not facing a broad-based popular insurgency. And most importantly, unlike Vietnam, the American people were viciously attacked from Afghanistan, and remain a target for those same extremists who are plotting along its border. To abandon this area now -- and to rely only on efforts against al Qaeda from a distance -- would significantly hamper our ability to keep the pressure on al Qaeda, and create an unacceptable risk of additional attacks on our homeland and our allies.\\n\\nSecond, there are those who acknowledge that we can't leave Afghanistan in its current state, but suggest that we go forward with the troops that we have. But this would simply maintain a status quo in which we muddle through, and permit a slow deterioration of conditions there. It would ultimately prove more costly and prolong our stay in Afghanistan, because we would never be able to generate the conditions needed to train Afghan security forces and give them the space to take over.\\n\\nFinally, there are those who oppose identifying a timeframe for our transition to Afghan responsibility. Indeed, some call for a more dramatic and open-ended escalation of our war effort -- one that would commit us to a nation building project of up to a decade. I reject this course because it sets goals that are beyond what we can achieve at a reasonable cost, and what we need to achieve to secure our interests. Furthermore, the absence of a timeframe for transition would deny us any sense of urgency in working with the Afghan government. It must be clear that Afghans will have to take responsibility for their security, and that America has no interest in fighting an endless war in Afghanistan.\\n\\nAs president, I refuse to set goals that go beyond our responsibility, our means, our or interests. And I must weigh all of the challenges that our nation faces. I don't have the luxury of committing to just one. Indeed, I am mindful of the words of President Eisenhower, who -- in discussing our national security -- said, Each proposal must be weighed in the light of a broader consideration: the need to maintain balance in and among national programs.\\n\\nOver the past several years, we have lost that balance. We have failed to appreciate the connection between our national security and our economy. In the wake of an economic crisis, too many of our friends and neighbors are out of work and struggle to pay the bills, and too many Americans are worried about the future facing our children. Meanwhile, competition within the global economy has grown more fierce. So we can't simply afford to ignore the price of these wars.\\n\\nAll told, by the time I took office the cost of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan approached a trillion dollars. Going forward, I am committed to addressing these costs openly and honestly. Our new approach in Afghanistan is likely to cost us roughly $30 billion for the military this year, and I will work closely with Congress to address these costs as we work to bring down our deficit.\\n\\nBut as we end the war in Iraq and transition to Afghan responsibility, we must rebuild our strength here at home. Our prosperity provides a foundation for our power. It pays for our military. It underwrites our diplomacy. It taps the potential of our people, and allows investment in new industry. And it will allow us to compete in this century as successfully as we did in the last. That is why our troop commitment in Afghanistan cannot be open-ended -- because the nation that I am most interested in building is our own.\\n\\nNow, let me be clear: none of this will be easy. The struggle against violent extremism will not be finished quickly, and it extends well beyond Afghanistan and Pakistan. It will be an enduring test of our free society, and our leadership in the world. And unlike the great power conflicts and clear lines of division that defined the 20th century, our effort will involve disorderly regions, failed states, diffuse enemies.\\n\\nSo as a result, America will have to show our strength in the way that we end wars and prevent conflict. We will have to be nimble and precise in our use of military power. Where al Qaeda and its allies attempt to establish a foothold -- whether in Somalia or Yemen or elsewhere -- they must be confronted by growing pressure and strong partnerships.\\n\\nAnd we can't count on military might alone. We have to invest in our homeland security, because we can't capture or kill every violent extremist abroad. We have to improve and better coordinate our intelligence, so that we stay one step ahead of shadowy networks.\\n\\nWe will have to take away the tools of mass destruction. That is why I have made it a central pillar of my foreign policy to secure loose nuclear materials from terrorists; to stop the spread of nuclear weapons; and to pursue the goal of a world without them. Because every nation must understand that true security will never come from an endless race for ever-more destructive weapons -- true security will come for those who reject them.\\n\\nWe will have to use diplomacy, because no one nation can meet the challenges of an interconnected world acting alone. I have spent this year renewing our alliances and forging new partnerships. And we have forged a new beginning between America and the Muslim world -- one that recognizes our mutual interest in breaking a cycle of conflict, and that promises a future in which those who kill innocents are isolated by those who stand up for peace and prosperity and human dignity.\\n\\nFinally, we must draw on the strength of our values -- for the challenges that we face may have changed, but the things that we believe in must not. That is why we must promote our values by living them at home -- which is why I have prohibited torture and will close the prison at Guantanamo Bay. And we must make it clear to every man, woman and child around the world who lives under the dark cloud of tyranny that America will speak out on behalf of their human rights, and tend to the light of freedom, and justice, and opportunity, and respect for the dignity of all peoples. That is who we are. That is the source -- the moral source of America's authority.\\n\\nSince the days of Franklin Roosevelt, and the service and sacrifice of our grandparents and great-grandparents, our country has borne a special burden in global affairs. We have spilled American blood in many countries on multiple continents. We have spent our revenue to help others rebuild from rubble and develop their own economies. We have joined with others to develop an architecture of institutions -- from the United Nations to NATO to the World Bank -- that provide for the common security and prosperity of human beings.\\n\\nWe have not always been thanked for these efforts, and we have at times made mistakes. But more than any other nation, the United States of America has underwritten global security for over six decades -- a time that, for all its problems, has seen walls come down, markets open, billions lifted from poverty, unparalleled scientific progress, and advancing frontiers of human liberty.\\n\\nFor unlike the great powers of old, we have not sought world domination. Our union was founded in resistance to oppression. We do not seek to occupy other nations. We will not claim another nation's resources or target other peoples because their faith or ethnicity is different from ours. What we have fought for -- what we continue to fight for -- is a better future for our children and grandchildren, and we believe that their lives will be better if other peoples' children and grandchildren can live in freedom and access opportunity.\\n\\nAs a country, we are not as young -- and perhaps not as innocent -- as we were when Roosevelt was president. Yet we are still heirs to a noble struggle for freedom. Now we must summon all of our might and moral suasion to meet the challenges of a new age.\\n\\nIn the end, our security and leadership does not come solely from the strength of our arms. It derives from our people -- from the workers and businesses who will rebuild our economy; from the entrepreneurs and researchers who will pioneer new industries; from the teachers that will educate our children, and the service of those who work in our communities at home; from the diplomats and Peace Corps volunteers who spread hope abroad; and from the men and women in uniform who are part of an unbroken line of sacrifice that has made government of the people, by the people and for the people a reality on this Earth.\\n\\nThis vast and diverse citizenry will not always agree on every issue -- nor should we. But I also know that we, as a country, cannot sustain our leadership nor navigate the momentous challenges of our time if we allow ourselves to be split asunder by the same rancor and cynicism and partisanship that has in recent times poisoned our national discourse.\\n\\nIt is easy to forget that when this war began, we were united -- bound together by the fresh memory of a horrific attack, and by the determination to defend our homeland and the values we hold dear. I refuse to accept the notion that we cannot summon that unity again. I believe with every fiber of my being that we -- as Americans -- can still come together behind a common purpose. For our values are not simply words written into parchment -- they are a creed that calls us together, and that has carried us through the darkest of storms as one nation, as one people.\\n\\nAmerica, we are passing through a time of great trial. And the message that we send in the midst of these storms must be clear: that our cause is just, our resolve unwavering. We will go forward with the confidence that right makes might, and with the commitment to forge an America that is safer, a world that is more secure, and a future that represents not the deepest of fears but the highest of hopes. Thank you, God Bless you and God Bless the United States of America."}

Authorities said Tuesday, Oct. 31, 2017, that three Dartmouth psychology professors are under criminal investigation for allegations of sexual misconduct. The previous week the college said the professors were put on paid leave and had their access to campus restricted due to allegations of serious misconduct. The college later told authorities it had received allegations of sexual misconduct. (AP Photo/Jim Cole, File)\\n\\n(CNN) —\\n\\nDartmouth College says it is launching a new initiative to combat sexual harassment and abuses of power on campus. But a lawyer for seven women who are suing the university over its handling of sexual harassment allegations say the efforts miss the mark.\\n\\nThe announcement comes nearly two months after a federal complaint was filed against the Ivy League school by seven current and former graduate students who allege three professors created a toxic environment where female subjects were routinely subjected to sexual harassment and even rape.\\n\\nA school inquiry led to the resignations of the three professors in 2018 and the school pledged to take steps to improve the campus culture. The new Campus Climate and Culture Initiative is the latest step in that direction, school officials said in a press release.\\n\\nThe new program will include the following components:\\n\\n- A single policy to address sexual misconduct for faculty, staff, and students, with appropriate processes for adjudicating potential violations;\\n\\n- A mandatory online sexual violence prevention training program for all faculty, staff, professional and graduate students, and postdoctoral scholars;\\n\\n- Research advisory committees for all graduate programs to ensure that all graduate students have access to multiple advisors.\\n\\nThe announcement comes as American universities grapple with how to handle allegations of campus sexual misconduct and their obligations under Title IX, the federal law that bars discrimination based on sex, including harassment, in federally funded education programs and activities.\\n\\nThe Department of Education in November proposed new rules for dealing with sexual harassment and assault on college campuses that would bolster the rights of those accused of wrongdoing.\\n\\nThe lawsuit accuses the New Hampshire school of failing to create an environment free from gender-based discrimination, in violation of Title IX.\\n\\nDartmouth says the new program will expand the school's Title IX office, which is responsible for reviewing reports of sexual misconduct and conducting investigations. The school also pledged to increase mental health resources at Dartmouth and said that an outside expert who specializes in creating inclusive communities will review academic departments.\\n\\nThe lawsuit claims that the prominent researchers, who no longer are allowed on campus, coerced female students into drinking and made the women feel as if their success depended on their willingness to participate in their alcohol-saturated culture the men created.\\n\\nThe complaint claims that Dartmouth knew about the professors' behavior for more than 16 years and did nothing until 2017, when several female graduate students reported the allegations to the college's Title IX office. During the Title IX investigation, the lawsuit claims that Dartmouth failed to provide the plaintiffs with support, accommodations or guidance, then unilaterally terminated the disciplinary process without seeking their input.\\n\\nPreviously, school officials said they applauded the courage of the women who came forward. However, we respectfully, but strongly, disagree with the characterizations of Dartmouth's actions in the complaint and will respond through our own court filings, they said.\\n\\nDeborah Marcuse, an attorney representing seven women plaintiffs in the sexual harassment lawsuit, said the initiatives miss the mark and simply bring the school into compliance with federal law.\\n\\nTo the extent that Dartmouth is now seeking to conform its policies to what federal law requires, we certainly support that though we think it's long overdue, Marcuse said. What's striking about this is that Dartmouth continues to fail to acknowledge or accept responsibility for the damage that its long history of inaction has caused.\\n\\nMarcuse faulted the school for not reaching out to her clients for their input. Dartmouth's formal response to their complaint is due in a little over a week on January 15.\\n\\nIt appears to us that for all of the lip service to their courage, there has been no interest from Dartmouth in materially responding to or really listening to these women despite a lot of vague call outs to 'we want to include everyone and everything', she said.\\n\\nIf you just look at the nature of the various responses there really just isn't any acknowledgment that what these women experienced is something that has had any impact on Dartmouth at all."}
{"original": "(CNN) Moments after news broke that Iran had fired missiles at US forces in Iraq Tuesday night, Elizabeth Warren took the stage in Brooklyn for her first joint campaign rally with Julián Castro .\\n\\nEven before thanking Castro for his endorsement , Warren first addressed the breaking development : This is a reminder of why we need to de-escalate tension in the Middle East. The American people do not want a war with Iran.\\n\\nThe moment captured how President Donald Trump's order to kill Iran's military commander Qasem Soleimani has abruptly thrust foreign policy to the forefront of the 2020 Democratic race , shining a new spotlight on candidates' foreign policy experiences and records, and sparking fresh debates about the use of military force and US interventions abroad. With the election now unfolding against a backdrop of conflict and war, for Warren, her ability to articulate her own vision on foreign policy will be particularly critical as she takes on rivals like former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders , who have spent more time publicly articulating those ideas in their decades in public office.\\n\\nAs her national security credentials face their most strenuous test so far, Warren has been making a more explicit case about how she would revise American foreign policy -- and how her agenda abroad is linked to her agenda at home. A member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Warren has weighed in frequently in recent days both on Iran and her foreign policy vision more broadly, slamming Trump as reckless and repeatedly stressing that the United States should not start another war in the Middle East.\\n\\nCNN interviewed more than half dozen foreign policy veterans who have been quietly advising Warren and her team over the past year, as well as senior campaign aides. The network of informal advisers consulting with the Warren campaign is previously unreported. Collectively, these interviews paint a picture of a second-term senator who is deeply weary of US military interventions, resists drawing distinctions between domestic and foreign policies, and has attracted to her presidential campaign a number of career diplomats who say Washington, as one adviser described it, is in urgent need of a substantial rethink of how it conducts foreign policy.\\n\\nThose who spoke with CNN described emails, group text chains and conference calls where they brainstorm responses to urgent international events, help draft campaign statements and policy papers, and flag developments that they believe should be top of mind for Warren and her senior aides. They coordinate closely with Warren's top foreign policy aide, Sasha Baker, former deputy chief of staff to ex-Secretary of Defense Ash Carter, who transitioned from Warren's Senate office to the White House campaign last year.\\n\\nWhile the majority of the policy plans that Warren has released over the last year tackle domestic issues, several have been foreign policy-oriented, including a proposal last month on curtailing global financial corruption. Warren has also made a campaign pledge to not appoint donors and campaign bundlers to ambassadorship positions as president, and has called on her rivals to do the same.\\n\\nShe has this theme for domestic policy which is about corruption and deep structural change and inequality, said Ilan Goldenberg, former chief of staff to the Special Envoy for Israeli-Palestinian Negotiations in the Obama State Department who has been advising the Warren campaign since the summer. She wants to apply that to foreign policy writ large.\\n\\nYachts, corporations and corruption\\n\\nWarren made clear, even before she became a candidate, that she would draw a close linkage between domestic and foreign policy.\\n\\nShe signaled as much in an early speech: Speaking to a packed hall on a college campus, Warren railed against policies that favor wealthy elites, corporations and special interests; deployed a metaphor about yachts; and made at least a dozen references to corruption.\\n\\nBut this was not a campaign stump speech -- Warren was not yet a presidential candidate. It was a rare foreign policy speech that the senator delivered in November 2018 at American University. To political observers, it appeared to be a clear signal that Warren was gearing up for a 2020 run -- she would launch an exploratory committee for president weeks later on New Year's Eve.\\n\\nWarren has not made a foreign policy-focused speech since jumping into the 2020 race, and an aide told CNN that there are no plans at the moment to do so. That speech from more than a year ago, along with a lengthy article in Foreign Affairs magazine from around the same time, serve as two of the most detailed and recent blueprints of Warren's foreign policy vision.\\n\\nSince then, there have been striking similarities in the language Warren used at American University and what she has said over the last year on the campaign trail. Corruption has emerged as the overarching theme of Warren's campaign for the White House, with the majority of her diagnoses on the domestic problems that face the country tracing back to it in some shape or form.\\n\\nHer advisers stress that there is little daylight between how Warren views the gravest domestic and foreign policy challenges facing the country. One foreign policy aide on the campaign, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, described such a distinction as arbitrary.\\n\\nAnti-corruption: It runs through everything that she's talking about on both the domestic and foreign policy side, said Jarrett Blanc, former coordinator for the Iran nuclear implementation at the State Department and acting special representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan under President Barack Obama. That question of corruption -- the ways that it damages our partners, destabilizes key countries abroad, damages our interests and our country -- that is a foreign policy question that needs to be acknowledged as such.\\n\\nBlanc has assumed a lead role in corralling a group of outside foreign policy advisers helping the Warren campaign. According to the campaign, it includes Alexandra Bell, former senior adviser to the Under Secretary of State for Arms Control and International Security, Brittany Brown, former acting senior director for African Affairs at the National Security Council, Hady Amr, former deputy special envoy for Israeli-Palestinian negotiations, Mike Fuchs, former Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for East Asia and Pacific Affairs and Laurel Miller, former acting special representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan.\\n\\nNon-military tools in the toolbox\\n\\nThe US operation that killed Soleimani has reinvigorated the debate over the use of American military force and interventions abroad. The question has dominated the 2020 Democratic contest, putting White House hopefuls on the spot on the controversial airstrikes that killed Soleimani, and what actions the Trump administration and Congress should take in its aftermath.\\n\\nThe development has prompted Warren to state repeatedly: No more wars in the Middle East.\\n\\nSeveral of Warren's outside foreign policy advisers and an aide to the senator said minimizing the deployment of US military abroad and reevaluating what international challenges can and cannot be resolved with military force is central to Warren's foreign policy outlook. (Each of outside adviser that CNN interviewed emphasized that they did not speak on behalf of the campaign or candidate.)\\n\\nFor years, senior leaders have done a disservice to our military by remaining mired in these conflicts and not being open with the American people about their cost, said Loren DeJonge Schulman, who served as senior adviser to Obama's national security adviser Susan Rice and has been advising the Warren campaign since last summer.\\n\\nWe've put service members at enormous risk by asking them to solve problems without military solutions. Warren has no qualms calling this out, she said.\\n\\nOn the campaign trail, Warren tells voters that it is time to bring our troops home, and regularly makes the case for exploring non-military, diplomatic actions to take, describing them as other tools in the toolbox. She also frequently references her three brothers who are veterans, saying she has seen first-hand the sacrifices that military families make.\\n\\nOver the summer, the senator released a proposal to reform the State Department -- as a part of that plan, she pledged to fill some of the senior-most positions there with career diplomats, double the size of the US foreign service and not give ambassador posts to donors and bundlers.\\n\\nShe believes in staying engaged in the world but reinvigorating diplomacy as part of that and considering when the military is absolutely necessary and when the military is absolutely not necessary, said Robert Ford, former US ambassador to Syria.\\n\\n'Now that I live here, I see it'\\n\\nBut even some of Warren's foreign policy advisers say it is her domestic agenda, as much as anything else, that has drawn them to her campaign.\\n\\nThe many years that Ford served as a career foreign service officer took him to war-torn, devastated areas around the world. When he retired in 2014, he and his wife settled down in Bangor, Maine. It was then, Ford said, that he saw up close some of the most urgent problems plaguing his home country.\\n\\nHe's driven by shuttered factories, wood mills and furniture manufacturers, witnessed the wrenching effects of the opioid crisis, and at his church in Bangor, St. John's Episcopal, where he serves lunch once a month to the needy, he's met struggling families, including single parents and their children.\\n\\nNow that I live here, I see it, Ford told CNN in a recent interview. We have to help people at home. We can't be strong overseas if we have really deep structural weaknesses back here in the United States.\\n\\nIn her foreign policy speech at American University, Warren stated that investments at home strengthen the economy, but these investments also serve national security. It's a sentiment she has reiterated on the campaign trail over the last year as she has released one domestic policy plan after another and embraced her campaign's unofficial campaign slogan, I have a plan for that.\\n\\nFord said this philosophy was one of the major reasons that he has chosen to get behind Warren in the 2020 election, and he has been advising her team, with a focus on Middle East issues, since around Thanksgiving.\\n\\nOther advisers and aides echoed that it has been made clear to them that Warren's foreign policy priorities stem from first and foremost directing resources and energy to combating challenges at home.\\n\\nDave Rank, former deputy chief of mission at the US Embassy to China who worked under five presidents, resigned from the State Department after the Trump administration withdrew from the Paris climate accord. In an interview, he pointed to the climate crisis as a vivid example of the US losing its sway abroad by failing to take action domestically.\\n\\nIf we're not going to lead, Rank said, China's not going to step forward. Rank has been advising the Warren campaign for several months.\\n\\nThe country over which we have the most influence is the United States -- so I'm attracted to somebody who says that's where we should put our energy, he said. Not that we should ignore the problems coming out of Beijing, but the road to fixing them to a large extent starts here."}

The school also pledged to increase mental health resources at Dartmouth and said that an outside expert who specializes in creating inclusive communities will review academic departments.\\n\\nThe lawsuit claims that the prominent researchers, who no longer are allowed on campus, coerced female students into drinking and made the women feel as if their success depended on their willingness to participate in their alcohol-saturated culture the men created.\\n\\nThe complaint claims that Dartmouth knew about the professors' behavior for more than 16 years and did nothing until 2017, when several female graduate students reported the allegations to the college's Title IX office. During the Title IX investigation, the lawsuit claims that Dartmouth failed to provide the plaintiffs with support, accommodations or guidance, then unilaterally terminated the disciplinary process without seeking their input.\\n\\nPreviously, school officials said they applauded the courage of the women who came forward. However, we respectfully, but strongly, disagree with the characterizations of Dartmouth's actions in the complaint and will respond through our own court filings, they said.\\n\\nDeborah Marcuse, an attorney representing seven women plaintiffs in the sexual harassment lawsuit, said the initiatives miss the mark and simply bring the school into compliance with federal law.\\n\\nTo the extent that Dartmouth is now seeking to conform its policies to what federal law requires, we certainly support that though we think it's long overdue, Marcuse said. What's striking about this is that Dartmouth continues to fail to acknowledge or accept responsibility for the damage that its long history of inaction has caused.\\n\\nMarcuse faulted the school for not reaching out to her clients for their input. Dartmouth's formal response to their complaint is due in a little over a week on January 15.\\n\\nIt appears to us that for all of the lip service to their courage, there has been no interest from Dartmouth in materially responding to or really listening to these women despite a lot of vague call outs to 'we want to include everyone and everything', she said.\\n\\nIf you just look at the nature of the various responses there really just isn't any acknowledgment that what these women experienced is something that has had any impact on Dartmouth at all."}
{"original": "Male presenters at the BBC and the CEO of EasyJet made headlines recently, but not for the reasons you'd think: they say they all took pay cuts in the name of gender equality.\\n\\nSix male staffers at the BBC took voluntary pay cuts, the network announced earlier last week. In January, editor Carrie Grace stepped down from her position because she said the network is breaking equality law and resisting pressure for a fair and transparent pay structure.\\n\\nAt easyJet, CEO Johan Lundgren announced he'll lower his salary to £706,000 -- the same salary earned by his predecessor Carolyn McCall.\\n\\nAt easyJet we are absolutely committed to giving equal pay and equal opportunity for women and men, Lundgren said in a statement. I want that to apply to everybody at easyJet and to show my personal commitment I have asked the board to reduce my pay to match that of Carolyn's when she was at easyJet.\\n\\nRelated: The link between the gender wage gap and sexual harassment\\n\\nBut to many equal pay advocates, this isn't the progress they want to see.\\n\\nOn one hand, it's encouraging to see these leaders acknowledge that the wage gap is a problem, says Ashley Louise, co-founder of Ladies Get Paid, a career development organization. But on the other hand, when it comes to closing the gap between most employees at a company, pay equity is not only a question of dollars and cents -- it's also a question of value.\\n\\nYou're telling women, 'Yeah, we'd rather take pay away from other people than increase your pay to what we had already defined as the value of this work,' she says.\\n\\nThere's a difference between taking a pay cut voluntarily, as the men at the BBC and the EasyJet CEO have done, and making less money to begin with, despite all your efforts to the contrary, which is the reality for so many women. Research shows that when some women negotiate their salaries, they can be penalized for even trying.\\n\\nRelated: What happens when women know what other women make\\n\\nSo slashing men's pay isn't the only solution, Louise says. In fact, it could breed resentment amongst employees.\\n\\nIn terms of a broad social strategy, I don't think we would say that men's salaries have to come down to equalize, says Ariane Hegewisch, study director at the Institute for Women's Policy Research. The assumption is women's salaries should come up, so individual men are not made to pay for policies that went wrong.\\n\\nHegewisch says when closing pay gaps, some organizations instead temporarily freeze male employees' raises and bonuses, until female employees are brought to the same pay level.\\n\\nOther companies have announced plans to close their gaps with pay increases for female employees -- a strategy that doesn't ask male employees to take a pay cut.\\n\\nFor example, after disclosing small differences in employee pay earlier this year, Citigroup announced it will give raises this year to help close the pay gaps between men and women, as well as minority employees.\\n\\nAt Salesforce, CEO Marc Benioff says the company has spent around $3 million to raise women's salaries to equal that of their male counterparts.\\n\\nWith just the push of one button, I was able to know exactly what the discrepancy was and how I needed to fix it, which I have now done, Benioff told CNN. This is really easy, this is so easy to do. With just the push of one button, every CEO in the world can know exactly what is their pay discrepancy between men and women."}

Unprecedented support from central banks and governments remains in place, and the vaccine rollout that will eventually feed an economic recovery is gathering steam.\\n\\nFiscal and monetary policy are highly supportive, and financial conditions are very loose, said Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management. We therefore continue to expect strong global growth in 2021.\\n\\nIn the meantime, however, virus headlines are generating turbulence.\\n\\nOn Monday, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced a third lockdown for England. The nation is grappling with a surge in Covid-19 cases believed to be triggered by a new, more infectious variant. Italy said Tuesday that it's extending most of the coronavirus restrictions imposed during the Christmas holidays until Jan. 15. German leaders are also discussing an extension of the country's lockdown.\\n\\nMeanwhile, hospitalizations continue to surge in the United States, while the vaccination effort is lagging behind targets. Just 4.5 million people have received their first dose, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Monday. That's well behind what officials had hoped for by now.\\n\\nThen there's the political action in Georgia on Tuesday. Two runoff contests there will determine whether Republicans can keep hold of the Senate.\\n\\nIt is impossible to overstate how critical these races are for fiscal, tax and regulatory policy over the next two years, Chris Krueger, policy analyst at Cowen Washington Research, said in a report Monday.\\n\\nA sweep by Democrats would allow for more ambitious spending programs once President-elect Joe Biden enters the White House. But it would also make corporate tax hikes more likely, which could jolt investors.\\n\\nA jittery Wall Street thinks the vote could go either way. That means traders, and not just political junkies, will be glued to their TVs tonight.\\n\\nThe race looks close to a toss-up, albeit with a slight Republican lean, Goldman Sachs chief US political economist Alec Phillips told clients.\\n\\nWall Street reverses plan to kick out China telcos\\n\\nThe New York Stock Exchange has abruptly reversed its decision to kick out three of China's largest state-owned telecom companies, my CNN Business colleague Laura He reports.\\n\\nIn a bizarre turn of events, the exchange said late Monday that it no longer intends to delist the firms after further consultation with relevant regulatory authorities, and that they will continue to be listed and traded on the NYSE at this time.\\n\\nThe sudden about-face comes just days after the NYSE announced that it would end trading in the shares of China Mobile, China Telecom and China Unicom — a move it said was needed to comply with an order President Donald Trump signed late last year banning Americans from investing in firms that the US government suspects are either owned or controlled by the Chinese military.\\n\\nThe action was poised to increase tensions between the world's two biggest economies. The Chinese government has criticized the United States for wantonly suppressing foreign companies listed in the country and previously said it would take necessary measures to safeguard the interests of Chinese firms.\\n\\nThe reasons behind the NYSE's reversal were not immediately clear — though investors are certainly getting whiplash.\\n\\nInvestor insight: Shares of all three affected firms, which also trade in Hong Kong, dropped Monday before rallying Tuesday. China Unicom advanced 8.5%, while China Mobile jumped 5% and China Telecom rose more than 3%.\\n\\nThe company that tried to fix US health care is shutting down\\n\\nThere was palpable excitement when Amazon's Jeff Bezos, JPMorgan Chase's Jamie Dimon and Berkshire Hathaway's Warren Buffett announced that they were forming a company to reimagine health care.\\n\\nBut three years later, the partnership — known as Haven — is shutting down, my CNN Business colleague Paul R. La Monica reports.\\n\\nThe ambitious venture was created in 2018 to provide better health care services and insurance at a lower cost to workers and families at the three companies. The hope was their learnings could be applied at other firms, too.\\n\\nBut Haven struggled to usher in large-scale changes to a notoriously thorny and complex system. CEO Atul Gawande, who was given significant bandwidth and funding to make his vision a reality, stepped down last May.\\n\\nIn a letter to employees, Dimon lauded the effort.\\n\\nHaven worked best as an incubator of ideas, a place to pilot, test and learn — and a way to share best practices across our companies, he said. Our learnings have been invaluable.\\n\\nThat may be true. But the end of the high-profile venture likely comes as a disappointment to those in the industry who hoped for bigger solutions.\\n\\nUp next\\n\\nOPEC and allies enter their second day of meetings as deliberations continue on whether to boost output.\\n\\nAlso today: The ISM Manufacturing Index for December posts at 10 a.m. ET.\\n\\nComing tomorrow: The ADP private employment report will provide an important preview of US jobs numbers due Friday."}

During the Title IX investigation, the lawsuit claims that Dartmouth failed to provide the plaintiffs with support, accommodations or guidance, then unilaterally terminated the disciplinary process without seeking their input.\\n\\nPreviously, school officials said they applauded the courage of the women who came forward. However, we respectfully, but strongly, disagree with the characterizations of Dartmouth's actions in the complaint and will respond through our own court filings, they said.\\n\\nDeborah Marcuse, an attorney representing seven women plaintiffs in the sexual harassment lawsuit, said the initiatives miss the mark and simply bring the school into compliance with federal law.\\n\\nTo the extent that Dartmouth is now seeking to conform its policies to what federal law requires, we certainly support that though we think it's long overdue, Marcuse said. What's striking about this is that Dartmouth continues to fail to acknowledge or accept responsibility for the damage that its long history of inaction has caused.\\n\\nMarcuse faulted the school for not reaching out to her clients for their input. Dartmouth's formal response to their complaint is due in a little over a week on January 15.\\n\\nIt appears to us that for all of the lip service to their courage, there has been no interest from Dartmouth in materially responding to or really listening to these women despite a lot of vague call outs to 'we want to include everyone and everything', she said.\\n\\nIf you just look at the nature of the various responses there really just isn't any acknowledgment that what these women experienced is something that has had any impact on Dartmouth at all."}

If no changes are made, the CBO projects that public debt will rise to 96% of GDP by 2028.

The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own.\\n\\nAs administrator of NASA over the last two and a half years, Jim Bridenstine did many great things for the space agency, not the least of which was to become successful at getting Americans back into space on American rockets from American soil. He also set a vision for space exploration through the Artemis program, with the objective of human exploration of space, initially focused on getting people back to the moon and women there for the first time by 2024.\\n\\nAs America transitions to the Biden administration, it is clear that there will be a new administrator of NASA put in place. It is important that this new administrator focus on continuing our space exploration efforts whilst extending environmental protections to include outer space. This means being better stewards and custodians of life both here on Earth and on other celestial bodies.\\n\\nThis is more important now than ever before as we are in the midst of a new space race -- this time among information and technology-driven companies seeking to capitalize on new markets and pushing the limits of miniaturization, speed and technology, from earth observation to global satellite-based internet. Additionally, the Department of Defense has recently birthed another service branch called the US Space Force, which will provide safety and security for US commerce and activities in space.\\n\\nWith the current pandemic, the Biden-Harris administration will likely be less focused on space exploration and commerce than the outgoing administration. But given the incoming administration's emphasis on climate change, the new NASA administrator could be most effective by focusing on how space services, capabilities and activities can help underwrite achievable environmentalism. Much of the data used to monitor and assess climate change, for example, are collected from space-based assets\\n\\nBut the near-Earth space in which our satellites travel has become increasingly congested, leaving our assets unprotected from space traffic hazards and threats. If any of the climate change data-gathering satellites suffer damage from space junk, that would greatly diminish our ability to understand the scope of environmental sustainability. The incoming administrators must seek ways to make space traffic more predictable (where it is and where it will be on the orbital highways), which will greatly help space safety. By widely sharing satellite locations and planned maneuvers, the rest of the satellite operators can plan accordingly.\\n\\nRead More"}

Instead, it's because drugs cost more, doctors and nurses are paid better, hospital administration is more expensive and many medical services have higher price tags, the study found.\\n\\nThe new analysis – an update of a well-known 2003 report by Princeton health care economist Uwe Reinhardt titled It's the prices, stupid – found that the US remains an outlier when it comes to spending, which was $9,892 per person in 2016. That compares to a median of $4,033 for Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development countries in 2016 and to the $4,559 the US spent per person in 2000, adjusted for inflation.\\n\\nSpending increased at an average rate of 2.8% annually in the US between 2000 and 2016, compared to the OECD median of 2.6%. This was driven in part by how much Americans shell out on drugs, which increased 3.8% per year, compared to a median of 1.1% for OECD nations.\\n\\nIn spite of all the efforts in the US to control health spending over the past 25 years, the story remains the same, said lead author Gerard Anderson, a Johns Hopkins professor. The US remains the most expensive because of the prices the US pays for health services.\\n\\nOne reason for the jump in spending increase is the widening gap between what the federal government reimburses for Medicare and what private insurers and employers pay for those with job-based coverage, Anderson said. In 2000, the difference was roughly 10%. Now, studies have shown it has widened to 50% or more.\\n\\nAnderson attributes this to consolidation among hospitals and doctors' practices, which allows them to demand higher prices.\\n\\nDespite paying higher prices, Americans actually have less access to doctors, nurses and hospital beds. There are only 2.6 practicing doctors per 1,000 people in the US, compared to a median of 3.2 active physicians in the OECD, for instance.\\n\\nIt's not that we're getting more. It's that we're paying much more, Anderson said.\\n\\nPoliticians, policy experts, health care industry executives and employers have wrestled with the nation's high health care costs for decades. The efforts include raising deductibles to give consumers more incentive to shop around for health care services and paying doctors and hospitals based on patients' health outcomes rather than for every service rendered.\\n\\nCurrently in the spotlight are high drug prices, which are expected to be a major focus of both Congress and the Trump administration this year."}
{"original": "(CNN) —\\n\\nLife insurance may not be one of the most glamorous purchases you can make, but it's a necessary one for many Americans. After all, life insurance coverage may be the only source of financial protection for your family if you pass away during your working years. Without coverage, your spouse and dependents could easily struggle to pay your final expenses, let alone get by without your income for years to come.\\n\\nBut because there are so many different types of life insurance, searching for a policy can be downright overwhelming — yet failing to buy life insurance could easily leave your family in a dire situation when you're no longer there to help.\\n\\nSo if you don't already have life insurance, you should consider whether it makes sense for you to be covered. And if you're in the market for a new life insurance policy, our guide will help you explore the different types of insurance that are available, depending on your budget, needs and goals.\\n\\nDo you need life insurance?\\n\\nFor the most part, many people could benefit from having some sort of life insurance coverage in place. In particular, most experts agree that adults with careers and kids should really have a significant amount of coverage in case the worst happens.\\n\\nBut Americans haven't necessarily gotten the memo. In fact, a 2020 Insurance Barometer Study from Limra, an insurance and financial services research association, shows that the number of people with life insurance in the United States has fallen nine percentage points to 54% over the last 10 years.\\n\\nThe experts at Limra note that this trend could be due to a broad drop in employer-based group life insurance benefits. However, the result is the same — fewer people with life insurance coverage means fewer families are afforded this type of financial protection.\\n\\nIf you're unsure whether you need life insurance, here are some of the reasons you may want to buy coverage:\\n\\nIncome replacement : At its core, life insurance is designed to provide replacement of your income once you're gone. This can be crucial if you have a spouse and/or dependents who are relying on you during your working years.\\n\\nCoverage for other financial obligations : If you have a mortgage, a car loan, credit card debt or other financial obligations, the proceeds from a life insurance policy can be used to pay off your debts. Without it, your family could be left figuring out how to liquidate your assets or pay your bills after you're gone.\\n\\nFinal expense coverage : According to the : According to the National Funeral Directors Association (NFDA) , the median cost of a funeral with burial and viewing (without the cost of a vault) was $7,640 in 2019. Without life insurance coverage, your family could struggle to cover these final expenses.\\n\\nBetter rates and eligibility when you're young: If you're young and healthy, now's the time to buy life insurance since you'll qualify for lower rates. And if you wait to buy coverage and your health deteriorates, you may not even qualify for coverage later on.\\n\\nWhen should you skip life insurance? Most experts agree there are situations where you may not need life insurance at all. If you're young and debt-free and you don't have any dependents, it's possible you may not need this important coverage. The same can be said if your kids are grown and you have plenty of assets, or if you're already retired and no longer need to replace a lost income.\\n\\nClick here to compare life insurance plans for free using QuoteWizard by LendingTree.\\n\\nTypes of life insurance\\n\\nPHOTO: iStock Most, but not all, life insurance policies require a medical exam in order to qualify.\\n\\nAs you shop for and compare life insurance policies, you should know about the many types of life insurance out there. Policies exists for every budget, whether you just need cheap life insurance coverage for your working years or you're a high-net-worth individual who wants to pass on tax-free income to your heirs.\\n\\nKeep in mind that most types of life insurance require applicants to go through a medical exam. This physical is used to determine your general level of health, as well as how much you'll pay in premiums.\\n\\nWhile there are types of life insurance that don't require an exam, favorable results from a medical checkup can help you secure lower premiums or afford a higher level of coverage, so you shouldn't shy away from taking one. With that being said, some individuals in especially good health or at a young age may be able to qualify for no exam life insurance at a relatively reasonable price.\\n\\nLet's break down the various types of life insurance you may want to consider and explore which type may be best for you.\\n\\nTerm life insurance\\n\\nTerm life insurance is the most basic type of life insurance coverage, but that doesn't mean it's any less valuable. With term life insurance, you'll typically pay a fixed premium in exchange for a fixed amount of coverage for a specific term or period, usually 10 to 30 years. If you pass away during the term of your policy, your family is paid the amount of your fixed death benefit.\\n\\nBecause term life insurance coverage has a start date and an end date, this type of protection is typically the least expensive to buy. However, once your term ends, you won't have any coverage. Also, there are different variants of term life insurance coverage you can choose from, including return-of-premium policies that let you get your premiums back when your policy ends, or term coverage you can convert to permanent life insurance later on.\\n\\nBest for: People who need a considerable amount of income protection during their working years and those buying life insurance on a budget.\\n\\nWhole life insurance\\n\\nWhole life insurance is a type of coverage that is permanent, meaning your policy lasts for your lifetime. While whole life is more expensive than term life insurance, the lifetime benefit that whole life offers can provide consumers with more peace of mind.\\n\\nLike term life insurance, premiums on whole life insurance generally stay the same throughout the policy, and your beneficiaries receive a guaranteed fixed benefit amount at your death (provided you make on-time payments on your policy for its duration). But whole life insurance also comes with a cash value component, which many companies tout as a savings account of sorts that you can borrow against while you're alive.\\n\\nBest for: People who are willing to pay more in premiums for a death benefit that lasts for life, as well as potential cash value from their insurance policy.\\n\\nUniversal life insurance\\n\\nUniversal life insurance is another type of permanent coverage that combines a death benefit with a cash value component. Customers with universal life can rely on the cash value of their policy for a loan, but they can also withdraw funds over time. The cash value also earns interest that's based on market rates, which means the amount of interest you can earn will fluctuate.\\n\\nThis type of coverage also comes with some flexibility when it comes to your premiums. For example, you may be able to use the cash value of your policy to adjust how much you pay in premiums each month, or to cover your premiums altogether.\\n\\nSome companies allow policyholders to adjust the death benefit on universal life insurance policies over time if you remain in good health. This can be useful if you want to increase your benefit amount as your family expands (though it requires paying a higher premium), or reduce it and pay a lower premium when your children are grown and your replacement income needs are less.\\n\\nBest for: People who want permanent life insurance with a cash component and flexibility in their premiums and death benefit over time.\\n\\nSave money when you buy life insurance with QuoteWizard by LendingTree.\\n\\nVariable life insurance\\n\\nPHOTO: iStock Premiums from a variable life insurance policy are invested, with the cash value and death benefit rising or falling based on the results.\\n\\nVariable life insurance is another type of permanent coverage that comes with a death benefit and a savings component. The main difference is that the premiums on variable life policies are typically invested by your insurance company in stocks, bonds and money market funds, with the goal of receiving a higher return.\\n\\nBecause of the investment component of variable life insurance, this type of coverage is generally seen as more risky. However, taking on more risk offers the opportunity for potentially higher returns. If the underlying investments within your variable life policy perform well, you may see the cash value of your policy and your death benefit increase substantially.\\n\\nBest for: People who want the option to grow the death benefit and cash value of their insurance policy over time through investments.\\n\\nGroup life insurance\\n\\nGroup life insurance can come in many different forms, and it may include any type of life insurance coverage. The main difference is group life insurance is marketed and sold to an entire group at once — usually a cohort of employees at a company. Typically speaking, this means the group can get coverage without individual medical exams.\\n\\nDepending on where you work, you may get group life insurance coverage extended to you for free as an employee benefit. However, the benefit amount is typically on the smaller side, so if you need a higher level of protection, you'll want to supplement any group life insurance coverage with other coverage. You're also likely to lose any group life coverage you have if and when you switch jobs.\\n\\nBest for: Group life insurance can be valuable for anyone who receives it as part of their job benefits through work or a membership organization.\\n\\nSupplemental life insurance\\n\\nWhere group life insurance is typically offered through an employer, supplemental life insurance is any additional life insurance you can buy to boost your coverage. Typically speaking, supplemental life insurance coverage is paid for by employees via payroll deduction.\\n\\nOne interesting benefit of supplemental life insurance is the fact that, like group coverage, employees can often bypass taking a medical exam and still qualify for a policy.\\n\\nBest for: People who want to pay an added premium to increase the amount of coverage they receive through work or a membership organization.\\n\\nFamily life insurance\\n\\nPHOTO: iStock A family life insurance policy covers various family members with appropriately different types of coverage under one policy.\\n\\nThe term family life insurance can mean many things, including any combination of policies that cover an entire family. However, some specific family life insurance policies are extended to provide comprehensive coverage for every member of a family structure.\\n\\nFamily life insurance policies typically include whole life coverage for the main breadwinner of the family as well as term life insurance coverage for their spouse and children. Policies usually include different benefit amounts on different members of the family so that you have appropriate coverage depending on which member of the family were to pass away.\\n\\nBest for: Families who want tiered protection for each family member based on their income (if any), risk of loss and other factors.\\n\\nGuaranteed life insurance\\n\\nGuaranteed life insurance is a type of coverage you cannot be denied for regardless of your health. Of course, the fact that you'll be approved no matter what makes guaranteed life insurance much more expensive than other similar policies. Further, guaranteed life insurance can come with other downsides, like a decreasing death benefit over time.\\n\\nBecause guaranteed life insurance is available to anyone who applies and pays the premiums, this type of coverage may only provide a death benefit large enough to cover your final expenses.\\n\\nBest for: People in poor health who want to cover their final expenses but cannot get approved for other types of life insurance.\\n\\nNo exam life insurance\\n\\nWhile most life insurance policies require you to take a medical exam before you get approved for coverage, no exam life insurance is afforded to individuals in excellent health. Providers are able to offer no exam life insurance based on complex computer algorithms that show which consumers are at a low risk of early death based on their age and other factors.\\n\\nGenerally speaking, no exam life insurance comes in the form of term life insurance. But because no medical exam is required, you may pay higher premiums than you would with an underwritten policy and a standard medical checkup.\\n\\nBest for: Young and healthy individuals who want term coverage without the hassle of a medical exam.\\n\\nCheck your life insurance rates from multiple insurers now using QuoteWizard by LendingTree.\\n\\nHow much life insurance do you need?\\n\\nWhen it comes to actually purchasing a life insurance policy, most consumers wind up asking the same important questions: How much life insurance do I need, and how long do I need my policy to last?\\n\\nAt the end of the day, only you can decide if you want life insurance coverage in place until the day you die or only for a specific term. However, the price of different types of life insurance coverage may ultimately help make this choice for you. After all, permanent life insurance premiums can easily set you back 10 times more than term life insurance coverage in the same amount.\\n\\nGenerally speaking, you'll want to make sure you have enough life insurance coverage to replace most of your income during your working years. Or, if you prefer, you can follow the rule of thumb that says you should purchase a minimum of 10 times your income in life insurance protection (so $1 million in life insurance if you earn $100,000 per year).\\n\\nAs you spend time comparing different policies and deciding how much coverage to buy, you may want to consider the following factors:\\n\\nHow much you earn each year, including salary and bonuses.\\n\\nHealth insurance benefits and other perks your employer offers that would need to be paid for after your death.\\n\\nDebts that your estate would be responsible for after you're gone, including any personally guaranteed business loans, a mortgage, car loans and other obligations.\\n\\nHow many working years you have left before retirement.\\n\\nWhether you want to pass an inheritance to your heirs.\\n\\nThe cost of your final expenses and disposition.\\n\\nWhether you want an insurance benefit to cover the cost of college tuition, family weddings and other major life events after you're gone.\\n\\nShould you buy life insurance?\\n\\nPHOTO: iStock Life insurance is an important financial tool that can make sure your family is taken care of after you're gone.\\n\\nMost people should have some type of life insurance protection in place, even if coverage is only enough to cover their final expenses. After all, your dependents and other family members will be left to pay your funeral costs and other final expenses once you pass away. Without life insurance, this could create hardship and stress on them at a time when your loved ones will be grieving your passing.\\n\\nStill, many individuals and families make the choice to buy enough life insurance coverage to replace their entire income during their working years, and potentially their entire lifetime. Consumers typically do so in order to make sure their remaining loved ones don't have to struggle if they pass away, and that dependents can continue their current standard of living. With enough life insurance, you may even be able to leave a legacy for your heirs.\\n\\nFortunately, life insurance — and especially term life insurance — doesn't have to be expensive. In fact, based on our research, right now a 30-year-old man in excellent health could purchase 20 years of term life insurance worth $500,000 for less than $27 per month, and a woman at the same age and in the same health could buy this coverage for less than $21 per month.\\n\\nRegardless of the type of life insurance you may want to buy, your best bet is taking steps to apply now — as in today. The older you get, the more expensive life insurance becomes. So don't let life slip away before your family is protected, or you could easily regret it.\\n\\nLearn more about life insurance and get a free quote with QuoteWizard by LendingTree.\\n\\nGet all the latest personal finance deals, news and advice at CNN Underscored Money."}

It's time to rebuild our country to bring back our jobs. On Friday he is scheduled to appear at an infrastructure roundtable at the Department of Transportation.\\n\\nBut an analysis of the Trump budget finds that it cuts infrastructure spending overall by $55 billion, according to the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton Budget Model, a nonpartisan research organization. (Coincidentally, Trump graduated from the Wharton School in 1968.)\\n\\nOver 10 years, Trump's budget allocates $200 billion of federal money for infrastructure spending. But it also cuts $255 billion in existing infrastructure programs that it calls wasteful, including grants for highway renovation, Native American water facilities and rural airports.\\n\\nRelated: Civil engineers say fixing infrastructure will take $4.6 trillion\\n\\nThe White House's Office of Management and Budget contests the UPenn tally of the budget. It says the cuts proposed for one year can't be assumed to be the same for 10 years.\\n\\nKimberly Burham, managing director at the Penn Wharton Budget Model, says such assumptions are reasonable and common when conducting a budget analysis, even if they aren't ideal.\\n\\nThe White House OMB says some cuts are for programs in which not all the funds go to infrastructure. It further adds that major cuts in UPenn's tally aren't considered cuts by the administration but are programs it won't be renewing once they run out of their current funds.\\n\\nBut Trump isn't convincing many that his infrastructure plan will become law anytime soon.\\n\\nThe Office of Economic Cooperation and Development cut its forecast for U.S. growth on Wednesday, citing the slow pace of Trump's economic reforms.\\n\\nEconomists surveyed by CNNMoney also don't believe a detailed bill, let alone a passed one, is coming from the White House this year, though they are hopeful for 2018.\\n\\nIt is looking less and less likely that any major deals are going to get done this year, says Sam Bullard, senior economist at Wells Fargo.\\n\\nRelated: Good Wisconsin jobs are moving to Canada\\n\\nInfrastructure spending is a proven winner for the economy: It creates jobs, fuels growth and allows Americans to get from point A to B faster, making them more productive.\\n\\nAll sides agree the United States needs a major upgrade of infrastructure to update congested and crumbling highways, overworked subways and also to build new tunnels and bridges.\\n\\nBut experts say Trump's budget doesn't reflect a commitment to his own infrastructure plan. Since it's only funding $200 billion of the $1 trillion plan, it's aiming to have private businesses foot the other $800 billion.\\n\\nThe Trump administration argues that private investment lowers costs for federal taxpayers.\\n\\nCritics of the plan say private companies that build new roads, bridges and runways will just send the bill to taxpayers or drivers paying tolls. In short, it would hit the wallets of ordinary Americans.\\n\\nThe private sector is not going to build our roads and bridges for free, they expect something in return, says Hunter Blair, a budget analyst a the Economic Policy Institute, a left-leaning research group.\\n\\nTrump's team plans to change regulations to make it more attractive for companies to invest in public construction projects, but it hasn't said exactly how it will change the rules.\\n\\nThat lack of clarity leaves some scratching their heads as to how businesses will foot 80% of Trump's infrastructure plan.\\n\\nRelated: Trump is hurting American tourism\\n\\nThere's a lot riding on changing regulations, says Burham of UPenn. It's hard to assess how successful the regulatory reforms will be to encourage private investment.\\n\\nThe administration's budget proposes spending cuts for Amtrak, federal grants for highway renovation and transit projects. It argues those programs were wasteful spending.\\n\\nThere could be some truth to that. For instance, the government's TIGER grants for highway projects received several repeat applicants last year, meaning they didn't finish the project with the original funds they got.\\n\\nThe only thing Trump, critics and the public appear to agree on is that a big fix is long overdue. But the path to get there is unclear."}

Authorities said Tuesday, Oct. 31, 2017, that three Dartmouth psychology professors are under criminal investigation for allegations of sexual misconduct. The previous week the college said the professors were put on paid leave and had their access to campus restricted due to allegations of serious misconduct. The college later told authorities it had received allegations of sexual misconduct. (AP Photo/Jim Cole, File)\\n\\n(CNN) —\\n\\nDartmouth College says it is launching a new initiative to combat sexual harassment and abuses of power on campus. But a lawyer for seven women who are suing the university over its handling of sexual harassment allegations say the efforts miss the mark.\\n\\nThe announcement comes nearly two months after a federal complaint was filed against the Ivy League school by seven current and former graduate students who allege three professors created a toxic environment where female subjects were routinely subjected to sexual harassment and even rape.\\n\\nA school inquiry led to the resignations of the three professors in 2018 and the school pledged to take steps to improve the campus culture. The new Campus Climate and Culture Initiative is the latest step in that direction, school officials said in a press release.\\n\\nThe new program will include the following components:\\n\\n- A single policy to address sexual misconduct for faculty, staff, and students, with appropriate processes for adjudicating potential violations;\\n\\n- A mandatory online sexual violence prevention training program for all faculty, staff, professional and graduate students, and postdoctoral scholars;\\n\\n- Research advisory committees for all graduate programs to ensure that all graduate students have access to multiple advisors.\\n\\nThe announcement comes as American universities grapple with how to handle allegations of campus sexual misconduct and their obligations under Title IX, the federal law that bars discrimination based on sex, including harassment, in federally funded education programs and activities.\\n\\nThe Department of Education in November proposed new rules for dealing with sexual harassment and assault on college campuses that would bolster the rights of those accused of wrongdoing.\\n\\nThe lawsuit accuses the New Hampshire school of failing to create an environment free from gender-based discrimination, in violation of Title IX.\\n\\nDartmouth says the new program will expand the school's Title IX office, which is responsible for reviewing reports of sexual misconduct and conducting investigations. The school also pledged to increase mental health resources at Dartmouth and said that an outside expert who specializes in creating inclusive communities will review academic departments.\\n\\nThe lawsuit claims that the prominent researchers, who no longer are allowed on campus, coerced female students into drinking and made the women feel as if their success depended on their willingness to participate in their alcohol-saturated culture the men created.\\n\\nThe complaint claims that Dartmouth knew about the professors' behavior for more than 16 years and did nothing until 2017, when several female graduate students reported the allegations to the college's Title IX office. During the Title IX investigation, the lawsuit claims that Dartmouth failed to provide the plaintiffs with support, accommodations or guidance, then unilaterally terminated the disciplinary process without seeking their input.\\n\\nPreviously, school officials said they applauded the courage of the women who came forward. However, we respectfully, but strongly, disagree with the characterizations of Dartmouth's actions in the complaint and will respond through our own court filings, they said.\\n\\nDeborah Marcuse, an attorney representing seven women plaintiffs in the sexual harassment lawsuit, said the initiatives miss the mark and simply bring the school into compliance with federal law.\\n\\nTo the extent that Dartmouth is now seeking to conform its policies to what federal law requires, we certainly support that though we think it's long overdue, Marcuse said. What's striking about this is that Dartmouth continues to fail to acknowledge or accept responsibility for the damage that its long history of inaction has caused.\\n\\nMarcuse faulted the school for not reaching out to her clients for their input. Dartmouth's formal response to their complaint is due in a little over a week on January 15.\\n\\nIt appears to us that for all of the lip service to their courage, there has been no interest from Dartmouth in materially responding to or really listening to these women despite a lot of vague call outs to 'we want to include everyone and everything', she said.\\n\\nIf you just look at the nature of the various responses there really just isn't any acknowledgment that what these women experienced is something that has had any impact on Dartmouth at all."}

{"original": "(CNN) —\\n\\nWhen the British defense minister revealed this week that new military bases were being considered in Asia, critics questioned whether London has the money – or strategic vision – to carry out such a plan.\\n\\nBut an examination of recent British defense initiatives shows that far from being an off-the-cuff play, a base in Asia would be a logical extension of moves made over the last few years.\\n\\nDefense Secretary Gavin Williamson broached ideas for a post-Brexit British military in an interview with the Sunday Telegraph.\\n\\nThis is our biggest moment as a nation since the end of the Second World War, Williamson said.\\n\\nThis is our moment to be that true global player once more – and I think the armed forces play a really important role as part of that.\\n\\nPHOTO: Dan Rosenbaum/Royal Navy The British frigate HMS Argyll (center) in October takes part in Exercise Bersama Lima 2018, which also included vessels from the Malaysian, Singapore, Australian and New Zealand navies.\\n\\nWhile Williamson said new British bases could be in the Far East, defense sources specifically mentioned Singapore and Brunei to the Telegraph.\\n\\nFrom a British standpoint, those countries make sense. Both still host small British military contingents – a legacy from the first half of the 20th century, when Britain, then a world superpower, wielded control over both as a colony (Singapore) or a protectorate (Brunei).\\n\\nAnd both sit on the South China Sea, where Beijing's shadow looms large.\\n\\nPlaying by the rules\\n\\nThe Chinese government staunchly maintains that large areas of the South China Sea have been its territory since ancient times. Beijing's nine-dash line extends more than 1,000 kilometers (621 miles) from its southernmost province, taking in more or less the entirety of the waters.\\n\\nMost other countries consider Beijing's sovereignty claims unsubstantiated, a view backed by an international tribunal in 2016.\\n\\nWilliamson told the Shangri-La Dialogue security conference in Singapore in June that Britain would demonstrate its solidarity with the rules-based system in Asian waters by sending its warships there – focusing, at the time, on the threats of North Korea.\\n\\nWe have to make it clear that nations need to play by the rules and that there are consequences for it doing so, Williamson said on June 3.\\n\\nBut a week later the Donald Trump-Kim Jong Un summit took much of the sting out of North Korea tensions.\\n\\nAnd when the Royal Navy's amphibious assault ship HMS Albion showed up in the South China Sea two months later, it made headlines by sailing near the disputed but Chinese-controlled Paracel Islands in what Beijing called a provocative action.\\n\\nA nod to Washington\\n\\nWarship movements like that are a regular feature of US Navy policy in the South China Sea, and Washington has been encouraging its allies to join in and ease its burden.\\n\\nSo a new or expanded British base in Singapore – where the US also has military facilities – would surely be well received by Washington, Britain's No. 1 military ally.\\n\\n02:43 - Source: CNN CNN's rare view of contested South China Sea\\n\\nIt is a complementary step to Washington's Indo-Pacific strategy and Washington will be pleased, Ni Lexiong, a naval expert at the Shanghai University of Political Science and Law, told the South China Morning Post.\\n\\nAs far as security arrangements go, much of the work may be done. The United Kingdom in 1971 signed on to the Five Power Defense Arrangements, a pact that includes Singapore, Australia, New Zealand and Malaysia.\\n\\nThe agreements, made when Britain was pulling back its forces from Asia in the 1970s, are the longest-standing defense pact in Southeast Asia, according to The Diplomat.\\n\\nThe five-nation group held three weeks of war games based out of Singapore in October, with operations in the South China Sea part of the plan.\\n\\nMaking the sale\\n\\nWhile the strategic importance of a Singapore base is clear, it could also make economic sense for Britain.\\n\\nAny salesman can tell you, it helps to show off the stuff you're selling.\\n\\nBritain was the world's sixth-largest arms exporter from 2013 to 2017, according to a report from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI). It was also the world's second-largest military exporter from 2008 to 2017, the Defense Ministry says.\\n\\nBases in Asia could be a showroom for some of that military hardware. And big arms deals would be a big boost for a post-Brexit British economy.\\n\\nPHOTO: Stu Hill/Royal Navy The British Type 45 destroyer HMS Duncan is shown at a Glasgow shipyard in 2015. One in every 200 UK jobs is defense related, the Defense Ministry says.\\n\\nIn 2017, Britain posted $11.3 billion in overseas military sales, according to the Defense Ministry. While this represented just 2.6% of the UK's overall goods exported, the sales were of big-ticket items that provide well-paying manufacturing jobs.\\n\\nOne of every 200 British jobs was defense-related in 2015/16, the Defense Ministry says.\\n\\nAnd Britain's 10-year history of sales shows they were largely to countries outside the European Union, with large purchases by Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Oman, India, Brazil and the US among the nine key sales mentioned in the Defense Ministry report.\\n\\nWhen Australia signed a $26 billion deal in June to buy nine British-designed – albeit Australian-built – anti-submarine warfare frigates, the Financial Times called it a coup for giant defense contractor BAE as Britain prepares to exit the European Union.\\n\\nThe Financial Times noted that the sale, which it called the world's biggest naval defense contract in a decade, could help drive down unit costs for Britain's fleet of the frigates and entice other foreign buyers.\\n\\nSeeing those frigates at British bases in Asia helps the sales pitch even more. And who is among the competitors is the frigate export market? China.\\n\\nThe Chinese military carried a story on its English-language website this week saying the state-owned China State Shipbuilding Corp. had started building a guided-missile frigate for Pakistan, part of what it called a major arms deal.\\n\\nThe British expansion in Oman\\n\\nMeanwhile, the SIPRI report says arms markets are growing in Asia, Oceania and the Middle East while shrinking in Europe, Africa and the Americas. The report also showed Indonesia was Britian's third-largest arms client, following Saudi Arabia and Oman.\\n\\nSo don't consider it any coincidence that, in October, Britain held its largest military exercises in nearly two decades in Oman.\\n\\nOr that the Royal Navy is getting a permanent naval base at the Duqm port in the sultanate, a base which will have drydock facilities for its submarines and Queen Elizabeth-class aircraft carriers.\\n\\n01:29 - Source: CNN See Britain's huge new aircraft carriers\\n\\nFrom Duqm, HMS Queen Elizabeth will be able to project influence across an important region. She will fulfill multiple roles from providing air power anywhere at any time, to supporting allies or delivering humanitarian aid, the Defense Ministry said when announcing the base deal in 2017.\\n\\nSubstituting Singapore or Brunei for Duqm, how could the above statement look in 2020?\\n\\nIn a speech in Australia in 2017, then-British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said the Royal Navy would be sending HMS Queen Elizabeth and its under-construction sister ship, HMS Prince of Wales, into the South China Sea in 2020. So a British base nearby for the 65,000-ton warships, the most powerful Britain has ever put to sea, makes support efforts easier.\\n\\nTaking sides or not?\\n\\nIf Britain follows through on a plan for an Asian base, expect strong opposition from Beijing.\\n\\nWhen Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi met his British counterpart, Jeremy Hunt, at the United Nations in September – after the British warship had sailed near the Paracels – Wang urged Britain not to take sides in the South China Sea, according to a report from China's state-run Xinhua news agency.\\n\\nHunt assured Wang that Britain would not do so, according to Xinhua.\\n\\nBut in an October interview with the Financial Times, the head of the Royal Navy, Adm. Sir Philip Jones, offered support for British allies in the Asia Pacific and said the UK would resist Chinese defiance of international maritime law\\n\\nIf you are going to have a different interpretation of that [convention] to the majority of nations then that has to be resisted, the British admiral is quoted as saying. Otherwise you could see right around the world nations who will start to make their own interpretations."}

These contracts either ran out in December or are expiring this month. Another 550 contracts are set to lapse in February.\\n\\nThose contracts cover around 130,000 households, who have an average income of $12,000 a year. Many tenants are elderly or disabled.\\n\\nWith no sign of the shutdown ending soon, HUD has asked landlords to draw on their reserves to cover any shortfalls. The Washington Post first reported the development earlier this week.\\n\\nThe Trump administration is taking steps to shield some low-income Americans from the impact of the partial government shutdown, which started in late December. The Department of Agriculture on Tuesday extended the time it can provide food stamps and other nutritional assistance programs to the end of February, a month later that the agency originally announced.\\n\\nHUD officials suggested that the expiration of the rental contracts likely won't prompt landlords to begin eviction proceedings immediately.\\n\\nIt's never been our experience that people were evicted by virtue of a government shutdown, a HUD official told CNN. It would run counter to the best interests of the landlords.\\n\\nBut the building owners may have to delay repairs or suspend services they provide, such as transportation, after-school care or social programs, experts said. Eventually, they may have to raise the rent on those living in the apartments, they said.\\n\\nUnder the program, tenants pay 30% of their household income, while the federal government makes up the rest of the rent, which is based on the local market.\\n\\nWithout getting that rental assistance, owners will be forced to make very difficult choices, Ellen Lurie Hoffman, federal policy director of the National Housing Trust, told CNN's Brianna Keilar.\\n\\nLandlords will likely turn to the money they've set aside, if they have any, but they are also looking at other options to continue meeting their operating needs. These include reaching out to their lenders about getting a break on their mortgages if the shutdown continues, said Andrea Ponser, executive vice president for policy at Stewards of Affordable Housing for the Future, a collaborative of non-profit affordable housing owners.\\n\\nA longer-term concern is that the uncertainty may prompt landlords to wash their hands of the program, especially in neighborhoods with fewer low-income residents.\\n\\nSome owners, because of experiences like this, will choose not to renew their contracts, said Doug Rice, senior policy analyst at the Center on Budget & Policy Priorities. In that case, there's a permanent loss of affordable housing in those communities.\\n\\nOverall, the agency's project-based rental assistance program serves 1.2 million households. HUD has said that it has funding to make payments on active contracts through February, but the payments are set to stop after that.\\n\\nTwo other agency programs for low-income Americans are more secure – at least for the next few weeks, Rice said. The department said last week that it can continue making payments to state and local housing authorities for public housing maintenance and upkeep and for housing vouchers given to low-income residents through February. These two programs serve about 3.2 million households.\\n\\nStill, some authorities may be hesitant to issue vouchers to new applicants until Congress sets the appropriation because they won't know how much funding they'll receive, Rice said.\\n\\nCNN's Athena Jones contributed to this report."}

{"original": "New York (CNN Business) The surprise sweep by Democrats in Georgia should pave the way for a faster economic recovery from the pandemic, says Goldman Sachs.\\n\\nThe bank upgraded its 2021 GDP and unemployment forecasts Wednesday evening after CNN and other media outlets projected Democrats will take control of the US Senate, saying it means they will have enough votes to provide hundreds of billions of dollars of additional relief to an economy being hurt by the worsening pandemic.\\n\\nDemocrats are likely to pass further fiscal stimulus in Q1, Goldman Sachs economists wrote in a client note.\\n\\nThe optimism from economists helps explain why investors have mostly been unfazed by the chaos rocking Washington. The Dow finished at record highs Wednesday even after a mob of Trump supporters stormed the US Capitol.\\n\\nGoldman Sachs is now projecting GDP growth of 6.4% in 2021, up from 5.9% previously. That's well above consensus estimates of about 3.9%.\\n\\nThat faster growth also should translate to more hiring and less firing. The Wall Street bank now expects unemployment to dip to 4.8% at the end of 2021 and 3.9% at the end of 2023.\\n\\nMorgan Stanley is similarly growing more optimistic about the economy: The bank anticipates US GDP growth of 5.9% in 2021.\\n\\nWith the likelihood of further fiscal expansion, this gives us greater confidence that the recovery in the US economy will be on a solid footing, Morgan Stanley economists wrote in a note to clients Wednesday.\\n\\nAnother $750 billion in relief on the way?\\n\\nPresident-elect Joe Biden has called the $900 billion stimulus package enacted by Congress last month a down payment.\\n\\nGoldman Sachs now expects Congress to enact another $750 billion in fiscal stimulus in February or March, including $300 billion in stimulus checks, $200 billion of aid to state and local governments, and $150 billion in additional unemployment benefits.\\n\\nThe bad news is that it increasingly looks like the economy will need more aid to get through the intensifying pandemic. Private-sector employers unexpectedly shed jobs in December, according to ADP.\\n\\nNot only have Covid-19 deaths and hospitalizations surged to record highs , but the vaccine rollout has also been sluggish . Fewer than half of the vaccines distributed by the federal government have been administered. There also are concerns about how quickly new strains of the virus are spreading around the world.\\n\\nDiscouraging news on the virus front -- including the slow pace of vaccination and the emergence of more infectious virus strains -- suggests the spending boost from stimulus will be more lagged than usual, Goldman Sachs economists said.\\n\\nIn other words, the next stimulus package may not accelerate economic growth as much as hoped, at least initially.\\n\\nEconomists and policy analysts do not expect Democrats to enact dramatic tax hikes that would threaten the recovery. The narrow majorities in the Senate and the US House of Representatives will make it difficult to get sweeping legislation through Congress.\\n\\nTop Democrat is bullish on infrastructure, stimulus\\n\\nHowever, some senior Democrats are optimistic about the ability to pass major legislation.\\n\\nDemocratic Senator Sherrod Brown said the fact that Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell will no longer control the agenda is a gamechanger.\\n\\nMcConnell put a lid on our ability to address issues that the public supports, Brown told CNN Business on Thursday.\\n\\nBrown, who is in line to become chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, predicts there will be enough votes to enact $2,000 stimulus checks, a higher minimum wage, additional rental assistance and increased unemployment insurance. And, he added, multiple Republicans will back these initiatives -- now that they have the opportunity to vote on them.\\n\\nThe Ohio Senator is also bullish at the prospect of bipartisan support for a long-elusive infrastructure package that includes funding not just for roads and bridges but expanded access to broadband.\\n\\nWe've talked about it forever, Brown said.\\n\\nWill the Fed raise rates during Biden's first term?\\n\\nThe big debate on Wall Street now is whether the Georgia sweep by Democrats disrupts the goldilocks environment boosting financial markets. Very low inflation has led the Federal Reserve to promise to keep interest rates at zero for the foreseeable future. With bonds yielding next to nothing, that emergency stance has forced investors to plow money into stocks.\\n\\nBut the Fed's plans could change if inflation starts to show signs of life.\\n\\nGoldman Sachs said it now projects inflation to nearly hit the Fed's 2% goal by the end of 2023. The bank also now expects the Fed to liftoff from zero during the second half of 2024, compared with early 2025 previously.\\n\\nBut Morgan Stanley is warning that inflationary conditions are already brewing. The bank expects US core inflation to hit 2% much sooner -- by the end of this year -- and overshoot that goal in 2022. That's because the company expects US officials to take more forceful actions to address worsening inequality.\\n\\nThe Covid-19 shock has exacerbated the impact on lower income households, Morgan Stanley economists wrote, creating even greater urgency for policy makers to act to provide relief for affected households."}

The trial in Santa Maria, California, in a short break at the moment, which gives us a chance to check in with our CNN legal analyst, Jeffrey Toobin, who is in the courtroom.\\n\\n\\n\\nYesterday, Jeff, you just gave us a hint about what I heard you talking about later, which was a disastrous opening statement by the prosecution and a really compelling one by the defense. Is the momentum the same today?\\n\\n\\n\\nJEFFREY TOOBIN, CNN LEGAL ANALYST: I thought so, Miles. Tom Mesereau, the defense attorney for Michael Jackson, continued and completed his opening statement this morning and talked about the repeated occasions in which the accuser and his family denied that Michael Jackson had done anything inappropriate with them. Over and over again, they denied, including with the government, with the Department of Children's Services in Los Angeles, on videotape, which I'm sure the jurors will be hearing, right up until the time they changed their story 180 degrees and this case moved forward. It's going to be difficult, it seems to me, for the prosecutors to explain away all of these statements, but that's what -- the task the prosecution has set for itself.\\n\\n\\n\\nO'BRIEN: So so far Mesereau is having quite a bit of success playing out essentially a grifter defense?\\n\\n\\n\\nTOOBIN: That is exactly what the defense is. And today, we just came from -- the first witness, Martin Bashir, has been testifying, although he only answered about two questions. He answers -- he basically just authenticated his documentary. And I have to tell you, Miles, I just spent one of the strangest hours I've spent in the courtroom. We're sitting there in front of the jury watching the Martin Bashir documentary, complete with music and laughter and the jurors are laughing at some of it. And people are tapping their feet to Billie Jean. It is a very strange way to have a criminal trial.\\n\\n\\n\\nO'BRIEN: Wow! Brings new meaning to the term surreal, doesn't it? Give us a sense of what that is like in that courtroom, that mood there. That, obviously, is bizarre.\\n\\n\\n\\nTOOBIN: It is bizarre. And obviously, it had been worked out in advance, so both sides knew it was coming. But, I mean, here you have Michael Jackson talking about his childhood and, you know, being beaten by his father, and his mother and brother, I believe it's Randy, sitting there sort of nodding their heads about how terrible it was with their father. You have Michael -- you know, his back is to us. So we can't see Michael's reaction, but, you know, the jurors, you know, some of the stuff in the Bashir documentary is really very funny -- when Martin Bashir, who was in the courtroom, tries to dance with Michael, it's funny, and the jurors are laughing.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut I have to tell you, I'm not sure if this helps the prosecutors that much, at least so far. Obviously, what they're building to is the point in the documentary where Michael says he sleeps with children and tries to explain that. But a lot of this documentary is really somewhat sympathetic to him, about a lonely man who has, you know, is insulated by this tremendous wealth, but, you know, here you have Michael Jackson's life being played out in a courtroom with a jury evaluating it. It's very surreal.\\n\\n\\n\\nO'BRIEN: All right. Jeffrey Toobin, the analysis is excellent. I look forward to seeing some of your printed work in The New Yorker, as well, on this one. I'm sure it's going to be rather interesting.\\n\\n\\n\\nTOOBIN: It's strange.\\n\\n\\n\\nO'BRIEN: Good material there, as they say. Jeffrey Toobin, our senior legal analyst.\\n\\n\\n\\nTOOBIN: Thank you, Miles.\\n\\n\\n\\nO'BRIEN: Appreciate it -- Kyra.\\n\\n\\n\\nPHILLIPS: Well, let's hear what the public is saying about the Jackson trial. Gallup editor-in-chief Frank Newport is in Princeton, New Jersey, crunching the latest poll numbers for us. Frank, race has been an underlying issue in this case. Is there a difference in the way African Americans and whites are viewing it?\\n\\n\\n\\nFRANK NEWPORT, EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, GALLUP: Indeed there is. Overall, about three quarters of Americans -- of course, they're not privy to what's going on in the courthouse, but over the weekend, they said they thought the charges were probably true. There is a race difference. I'll compare this in a moment to O.J. Simpson about ten years ago. With 75 percent of whites say the charges against Michael Jackson are probably true. Notice for African-Americans, it's still a majority, but it's way down to 51 percent.\\n\\n\\n\\nThat's about a 24-point spread there, Kyra. Back for O.J. Simpson, there were 40-point spreads between the percent of whites who thought he was probably guilty of murder and African-Americans. So although the race difference is there in this case, not nearly as pronounced as ten years ago.\\n\\n\\n\\nPHILLIPS: All right. Let's turn to Iraq. The single deadliest attack happened since Saddam Hussein fell from power happened yesterday in Hilla. Is the violence making Americans more pessimistic about the long-term future of the U.S. presence there?\\n\\n\\n\\nGALLUP: Well, Kyra, we look at the data, poll after poll, and the country is still divided. Now, in the short term, the numbers go up and they go down a little. This is a question -- we've showed it to you before here on CNN. We started asking this about Korea, actually, many, many years ago. Now we're asking it about the Iraq situation. Was it a mistake to be involved?\\n\\n\\n\\nYou can see at one point, the percent who said yes was 52 percent, then it was down. Now it's at 47 percent in our last poll. Slightly more say it was not a mistake. So a little more optimism there. But Kyra, there's no way around it, the public is still split on Iraq and pessimistic about the long-term need for troops there in Iraq. Here's the question. You see it in front of you. Look at the bottom two rows there. We've got two-thirds of Americans who think it may be necessary to have U.S. troops there three or more -- three years or longer than that -- Kyra.\\n\\n\\n\\nPHILLIPS: The world still watching Rome as Pope John Paul II recovers from his tracheotomy. He's rejected the possibility of retiring. How do American Catholics see the situation?\\n\\n\\n\\nNEWPORT: They're split on that issue. We have a slight majority, I think, who would prefer that the pope, as you see here, stay in office. 43 percent of American Catholics say he should resign for health reasons. Apparently he will not do that. It was the 12th century or 13th century, I think, when the last pope resigned before for passing away.\\n\\n\\n\\nPHILLIPS: Gallup editor-in-chief, Frank Newport. Pulse on America there. Thanks, Frank.\\n\\n\\n\\nNEWPORT: You bet.\\n\\n\\n\\nPHILLIPS: Miles. O'BRIEN: So who will be the future movers and shakers in Washington?

Arroyo Sr. did have an unlawful weapons charge on his record, but it was just a misdemeanor. So it was legal for him to buy that AK-47.\\n\\n\\n\\nTOM CROWLEY, ATF: He was not a convicted felon, so he could purchase that weapon.\\n\\n\\n\\nREAVES (on camera): And what about the body armor?\\n\\n\\n\\nCROWLEY: That is legal to possess.

Although you get all the credit for Barack Obama, I got to tell you. I just supported you. So you were telling us, OK, since we were so good at nailing Barack Obama and talking about him and now let's see where he is. You have moved into another genre, I guess you could say, right? The people that we're about to talk to, you see as big movers in politics out of academics.\\n\\n\\n\\nWATSON: Out of academics. By the way, it's worth remembering that Barack himself was one of these. He was a professor, law professor, at the University of Chicago.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut we've got five people today, Kyra, beginning with a woman by the name of Caroline Hoxby, who is a professor at Harvard, economics professor. But although she's an economics professor, she's actually having her biggest impact on education. So she's helping lots of states, from Florida to Texas, decide how do we help our kids learn? Do we do it through smaller class sizes? Do we increase teacher pay? Does bilingual education make a difference? Should we do charter schools? She's a name you're going to hear a lot. Could be end up being a secretary of education, maybe even a secretary of the treasury. She's going to be a big deal.\\n\\n\\n\\nPHILLIPS: Well, I know the White House is already listening to her, too. Let's talk about Noah Feldman. I can't believe that Noah isn't even 35 yet.\\n\\n\\n\\nWATSON: Not even 35. Law professor at NYU, helped write the Iraqi interim constitution. And lots of people, from Republicans like Senator Dick Lugar, chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, to Democrats, have called on him for advice. He's a guy you'll hear a lot of, and a lot of people think of him as the next Condi Rice, if you will. An academic who ultimately goes into foreign policy in a major way.\\n\\n\\n\\nPHILLIPS: Wow. Viet Dinh, the next Al Gonzales, you say.\\n\\n\\n\\nWATSON: You bet. Already a big name in legal circles, former Supreme Court clerk himself, former assistant attorney general, helped draft the Patriot Act. In conservative circles, people absolutely love him. Rising star. Professor at Georgetown. And he's someone who, like Al Gonzales, could have lots of big jobs. Could be a White House counsel, a solicitor general, maybe even get talked about one day for a Supreme Court spot.\\n\\n\\n\\nPHILLIPS: An incredible success story for a Vietnamese immigrant, yes?\\n\\n\\n\\nWATSON: Yes. Just arrived in the U.S. at age 10, 1978, found his way to Harvard and other universities and has just done exceptionally well.\\n\\n\\n\\nPHILLIPS: All right. Dr. Phil meets Lou Dobbs. That's how you describe Elizabeth Warren.\\n\\n\\n\\nWATSON: Elizabeth Warren, you just -- I got a chance to spend a little time talking to her. And you just love talking to her. She married at 19, pregnant at 22, never thought she was going to go to law school, much less become a law professor. And now everyone from Ted Kennedy and Chuck Schumer on the left, to John Corn (ph) and John Kyl, two U.S. senators on the right, listen to her when she talks about the middle-class economic squeeze. And guess who really loves her, besides our own Lou Dobbs, maybe, because she talks about the economic squeeze? Dr. Phil. She's Dr. Phil's favorite. So I call her Lou Dobbs meets Dr. Phil, and she's someone we'll hear a lot from.\\n\\n\\n\\nPHILLIPS: It's good to be on Dr. Phil's side, so I hear. All right. I know there's one more. You just e-mailed it to me actually a few minutes ago. Fernando Guerra, the go-to guy for California politics.\\n\\n\\n\\nWATSON: You bet you. Professor at Loyola Marymount, political science professor, grew up in East L.A., first in his family to go to college, decided to go to graduate school to get a Ph.D. instead of law school. But now state legislators on either side of the aisle, when they're thinking about state and local issues, they're listening often to Fernando Guerra. You're going to hear a lot from him.

But the number of survivor stories is growing, thanks in part to better detection methods. Here's Veronica De La Cruz.\\n\\n\\n\\nVERONICA DE LA CRUZ, CNN.COM: According to the American Cancer Society, 40,000 women are expected to die from breast cancer this year, making it one of the top killers of women in the United States. Many high-profile people have battled the disease. Among the many faces, a first lady who spoke of her battle at a time when talk of the disease was taboo, an athlete in good shape with no family history, an actor who chose unconventional treatments, and most recently, a singer who brought her battle with breast cancer to the forefront at the Grammy Awards. In her first appearance since diagnosis, Melissa Etheridge stood as a symbol of empowerment for the millions who have suffered from the disease.\\n\\n\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\n\\n\\nMELISSA ETHERIDGE, MUSICIAN: Chemotherapy's horrible and I know there's some people out there right now, laying in bed on chemotherapy and I'm just hear to tell ya, yeah, it sucks, but you know what?

The American Cancer Society estimates that nearly 1,700 men will be diagnosed this year. While men are far less likely to get the disease, the fact that they do shows the reach of breast cancer. Experts stress the importance of early detection and say you should visit your doctor if you notice any abnormalities such as lumps, swelling, skin irritation or dimpling.

Ford's car loan unit is being taken to court in a class-action lawsuit alleging its lending practices allowed dealers to discriminate against minorities. The case accuses Ford dealers of discriminating against minorities by tacking on larger markups that raised the overall interest rate on their loans -- larger than the rates they would charge to non-whites, that is -- (UNINTELLIGIBLE) minorities. Lawyers for the plaintiffs say research show minorities are often the targets of those higher markups. Ford Motor Credit is not the first lender to be accused of such discrimination. The financing units at GM, Honda and Nissan already settled similar suits out of court -- Miles.\\n\\n\\n\\nO'BRIEN: All right.

He's also spent the last decade working with Singapore Airlines to develop inflight menus.\\n\\nThis is my third visit in the last six months -- so I've been here umpteen times.\\n\\nSingapore's authentic hawker markets\\n\\nl e v a r t\\n\\nAs a veteran Singapore tourist, Ramsay's had plenty of time to sample the local cuisine.\\n\\nBut the renowned street food markets remind him of more than just delicious cuisine.\\n\\nI love that family environment, he says. I grew up in Birmingham and so our first landlord was from Pakistan. The level of cooking was extraordinary.\\n\\nThe landlord taught mom how to make the most amazing curries and mom taught me, so that's quite a fun memory I have when I'm down in Newton. You don't really see that in London... All that authenticity gone, here we still have it.\\n\\nRamsay says he usually goes for the bloody delicious chili crabs when he's in town.\\n\\nMichelin is coming\\n\\nA Singapore edition of the hallowed restaurant guide is due to publish in the second half of 2016. Courtesy of Michelin Guides\\n\\nIt's a tough town to make it, he says. Singaporeans are impatient. They're incredibly knowledgeable. They've an amazing culture of great food.\\n\\nRamsay says the arrival of the guide puts a stamp of approval on the city as a foodie destination.\\n\\nIt's such good news to see such a reverent guide come to Singapore and lift the standards even higher, says the 49-year-old chef. There's now a big international scene of chefs from the U.S., Europe, Japan, Australia, making big names here. You'll see it getting a lot busier.\\n\\nSecond restaurant in Singapore?\\n\\nBread Street Kitchen is one of the more casual dining brands in Ramsay's restaurant group.\\n\\nIts menu, offering primarily British flavors, has adapted to the local palate by going spicier than other global Bread Street Kitchens.\\n\\nBread Street Kitchen was sort of dipping its toe into Singapore without trying to put its neck in a noose, the chef explains of his reason for entering the market with that particular brand.\\n\\nA fine-dining London restaurant, it's held three Michelin stars since 2001.\\n\\nI welcome that kind of pressure, says the chef, who once disclosed he cried when he lost stars . I think from an actor's point of view you want to win an Oscar; footballers wants to play in the World Cup; and chefs want the Michelin star.\\n\\nRamsay currently holds nine Michelin stars across his few dozen restaurants.\\n\\nI remember winning my first third star in 2001, he recalls. The week before the guide was published the senior inspectors from all over the globe sat me down and said, 'In this year's publication we are happy to announce you got your third star.'\\n\\nAnd then just that moment where everything stopped for 30 seconds and you think 'Wow, that's it.'"}
{"original": "Amassing $1,000 might seem like a reasonable enough feat, but the majority of Americans have yet to accumulate that much in a savings account. In a recent GoBankingRates survey, 69% of adults admitted to having less than $1,000 in the bank. Worse yet, 34% have no savings at all.\\n\\nThe problem with not having adequate savings is that you never know when an emergency might strike. You could lose your job, fall ill, or find yourself up against a major home repair that simply can't be postponed -- and if you don't have the cash available, you could end up in serious debt with an equally serious black mark on your credit history. If you don't yet have $1,000 to your name, here are a few ways to work toward that goal.\\n\\n1. Create a budget\\n\\nA household budget can open the door to savings by helping you identify your key expenses and get a better sense of where your money is going. But for some reason, nearly 60% of U.S. adults don't follow a budget. If you're serious about saving money, you'll need to create a road map of your various costs so you can see where there might be some fat to trim. Not sure where to start? You can consult this guide for ways to go about the process.\\n\\n2. Cut back on small luxuries\\n\\nWhile you may dread the idea of giving up your beloved morning coffee or brown-bagging your lunch on a regular basis, if you're willing to make a few smaller sacrifices, you can accumulate $1,000 rather quickly without having to compromise on the big stuff. Imagine that every time you walk to work instead of springing for bus fare, you shave $2 off your commute. Throw in the $2 you'll save by making your own cup of joe and the $6 you can easily save by packing your own sandwich, and you're looking at an extra $12 a day. If you do this twice a week, you'll have that $1,000 at your disposal well within a year's time.\\n\\n3. Reduce one major expense\\n\\nSometimes it's easier to eliminate one large expense than to give up the daily indulgences you've come to enjoy. But if you're willing to forgo that new TV or take a staycation instead of going away, you can save $1,000 in one fell swoop.\\n\\n4. Pocket your raise or bonus\\n\\nDepending on your company's fiscal year, your raise may not yet have kicked in. Similarly, if you work on commission or are eligible for bonuses, you may be looking at some additional income in the not-so-distant future. If you're about to get your hands on some extra cash, your best bet is to stick it right in your savings account.\\n\\nYou can set up an automatic transfer with your bank so that the additional money that would normally appear in your paycheck never actually shows up, but rather, gets filtered seamlessly into savings. This will help you resist the urge to spend that money, and you won't miss it because you won't even know it's there.\\n\\n5. Find a side hustle\\n\\nNot everyone has the opportunity to get a raise or pick up extra hours at work. If your primary job doesn't offer a chance to snag some extra cash, your next best bet is to pursue income opportunities on your own. You might, for example, look into babysitting, dog walking, or teaching an instrument you've been playing for years. Or you might moonlight as a sales associate for a local business with a known busy season.\\n\\nYou can even look into performing your regular job duties on a part-time, consultant basis on nights and weekends, provided your company doesn't have a policy forbidding such activity. You may need to get a bit creative, but if you're willing to put in the time, it's a surefire way to build up your savings.\\n\\nRelated links:\\n\\n• Motley Fool Issues Rare Triple-Buy Alert\\n\\n• This Stock Could Be Like Buying Amazon in 1997\\n\\n• 7 of 8 People Are Clueless About This Trillion-Dollar Market\\n\\nWhile saving $1,000 is far better than saving nothing at all, most of us need considerably more than that to be truly protected in the face of an emergency. In fact, the typical worker should have anywhere from three to six months' worth of living expenses available in a savings account at all times, which means $1,000 alone just won't cut it.\\n\\nThat said, the last four tips on this list are fully scalable, so once you reach your initial $1,000 target, you can keep going until you've met your ultimate savings goal. It may take some time and some work, but the peace of mind you'll get in return will be well worth the effort."}
{"original": "SAUL LOEB/AFP/Getty Images\\n\\nPresident Trump reacted for the first time to the news that his former national security adviser John Bolton is prepared to testify if issued a subpoena, telling reporters Bolton would know nothing about what we're talking about, despite the fact that Bolton was his adviser at the time and has first hand knowledge of the hold on Ukrainian aid.\\n\\nThat's gonna be up to the lawyers. It'll be up to the Senate. And we'll see how they feel, Trump said. He would know nothing about what we're talking about because if you know, the Ukrainian government came out with a very strong statement — no pressure, no anything. And that's from the boss. That's from the President of Ukraine…\\n\\nFrankly, if you look at it, and you look at everything all they have to do is read the transcripts, he said.\\n\\nTrump continued to lament his impeachment and trial as well as his perfect phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.\\n\\nSome background: Bolton announced in an unexpected and newsworthy statement Monday that he is prepared to testify if issued a subpoena as part of a Senate impeachment trial.\\n\\nBolton is potentially a crucial witness, as he had firsthand knowledge of many of the events that formed the House's impeachment of the President over his dealings with Ukraine. The House sought his testimony but ultimately never subpoenaed Bolton, and Democrats withdrew their subpoena for his former deputy after it was challenged in court, as Democrats wanted to move forward with their impeachment probe and not wait for the court's decision."}

{"original": "(CNN) Democratic voters turning out for Tuesday's New Hampshire primary say they are looking for a candidate who can beat President Donald Trump over one who agrees with them on the issues by a roughly 2-to-1 margin, according to early exit polls conducted for CNN.\\n\\nSix in 10 Democratic voters in New Hampshire prioritize a nominee who can beat Trump. Yet Democrats seem split over what qualities a candidate ought to have.\\n\\nJust over a third say that they sought a candidate who could bring needed change, while about the same amount said they were seeking one who could unite the country. Far fewer prioritized finding a candidate who cares about people like them, and the share who said they were looking for a fighter landed in single digits.\\n\\nAlmost 2 in 5 New Hampshire Democratic voters who prefer a nominee who can bring about needed change voted for Sen. Bernie Sanders, far more than any other candidate. Sen. Amy Klobuchar and Sanders lead among those who prioritize a candidate who can unite the country, with each drawing around 3 in 10 voters in that group.\\n\\nAmong voters who prefer a nominee who can beat Trump in November over someone who they agree with on the issues, over a quarter voted for former South Bend, Indiana mayor Pete Buttigieg, 1 in 5 for Klobuchar, 1 in 5 for Sanders, 1 in 7 for former Vice President Joe Biden, and around 1 in 10 for Sen. Elizabeth Warren.\\n\\nStill, more than 8 in 10 who voted today say they plan to vote for the Democratic nominee in November regardless of who it is, while just 1 in 8 say they won't.\\n\\nLiberals vs. moderates\\n\\nSanders leads among New Hampshire voters who consider themselves very liberal in ideology, with around half of the group voting for him. Warren follows with fewer than 1 in 5 of this group, and Buttigieg at 1 in 7.\\n\\nBut the balance of the electorate has shifted since 2016. In 2020, very liberal voters made up about 1 in 5 voters, down from 26% in 2016. Moderate voters were up to just over a third in 2020, from 27% in 2016.\\n\\nKlobuchar and Buttigieg lead among moderate Democrats, around 3 in 10 for Klobuchar and a quarter for Sanders, still a close race. Less than 1 in 5 in that group voted for Sanders and 1 in 10 voted for Biden.\\n\\nKlobuchar drew around a third of white college-educated women, followed by over 1 in 5 for Buttigieg, and slightly less for Sanders. White women without degrees were split between Buttigieg and Sanders. For white men, those without college degrees strongly supported Sanders (over a third), while around a quarter of those with degrees supported him, followed by Klobuchar and Buttigieg.\\n\\nDemocratic voters are angry\\n\\nEight in 10 New Hampshire Democratic primary voters are angry at the Trump administration, the highest share of voters from the non-incumbent party who are angry stretching back to 2000, according to CNN exit polls. Six in 10 Republican primary voters were angry at the Obama administration in 2016, and 40% were angry in 2012. Meanwhile, 62% of Democratic primary voters were angry at the Bush administration in 2008, and 46% were angry in 2004.\\n\\nAlmost 6 in 10 of Tuesday's voters say that impeachment hasn't made any difference to Trump's reelection chances, while one in five say it has hurt him and fewer say it has helped.\\n\\nAbout 6 in 10 who turned out to vote in Tuesday's primary say they made up their minds since the beginning of February, including nearly half who say they decided on their candidate just in the last few days. That's double the 25% who decided in the final few days in 2016, and, in early data, the highest in exit polling back to 2000.\\n\\nAbout half overall say the most recent debate -- held in New Hampshire on Friday night -- was an important factor in deciding their vote for president.\\n\\nAnd early exits indicate that only about 1 in 8 are first-time Democratic primary voters, down slightly from 16% in 2016 and 19% in 2008.\\n\\nTurnout was expected to be high heading into the primary. According to the most recent CNN tracking poll conducted by University of New Hampshire, 74% of adults in New Hampshire said they were extremely or very interested in the 2020 primary election and a similar three-quarters said they would definitely vote.\\n\\nThe eventual Democratic nominee for president has taken first or second place in the New Hampshire primary in every race since 1968.\\n\\nHealth care is the top issue\\n\\nMore than one-third of Democratic voters going to the polls in New Hampshire's first-in-the-nation primary said health care was the most important issue in determining their vote.\\n\\nSanders was the clear favorite among this group, garnering support from more than three in 10. Buttigieg and Klobuchar each attracted 1 in 5 of these voters, while Biden was the pick of 1 in 10. Warren, who has also campaigned on health care, landed in the single digits among this group.\\n\\nJust under two-thirds of voters supported a single-payer system -- with Sanders attracting more than one-third of those voters and Buttigieg nearly a quarter.\\n\\nClimate change followed, with about 3 in 10 naming it their top concern. About 2 in 10 rated income inequality as tops and 1 in 10 named foreign policy.\\n\\nThe early exit polls also indicate majorities of Democratic primary voters turning out today support more liberal policy positions designed to address both health care and income inequality.\\n\\nSupport for a Medicare-for-All-style health care plan, where a single government plan provides coverage for all Americans and replaces the current system of private health insurance, has divided the top candidates in the race for much of the campaign. But almost 6 in 10 New Hampshire Democratic primary voters today said they would support such a government plan, 4 in 10 were opposed.\\n\\nAbout two-thirds said they would be in favor of making tuition free at public colleges and universities, a plan that has likewise divided the top candidates.\\n\\nSeveral residents who voted in Manchester told CNN that health care was their top priority and influenced their vote.\\n\\nMoe Abdel, a 24-year-old pharmacist, said he supports Medicare for All.\\n\\nI see firsthand a lot of people who struggle to pay for their prescription drugs, especially older people on fixed incomes,' said Abdel, who declined to specify whom he voted for.\\n\\nHealth care also emerged as the most important issue for choosing a nominee among Iowa Democratic caucusgoers earlier this month, according to the entrance polls conducted there. Two in five Iowa caucus participants chose health care, and about 1 in 5 said climate change, while fewer chose foreign policy or income inequality.\\n\\nHealth care has been at the forefront of the campaign since the beginning, but the party is split between radically overhauling the nation's health insurance system or taking smaller steps.\\n\\nVermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, an independent, has led the fight to create Medicare for All. It would essentially replace private insurance, providing sweeping benefits at no cost to patients.\\n\\nBut its price tag -- estimated at around $32 trillion over 10 years -- has spooked many people, providing a line of attack by rivals former Vice President Joe Biden and former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg.\\n\\nWhile Sanders has acknowledged he'd have to raise taxes on the middle class, he hasn't laid out specifically how he would cover the tab.\\n\\nProviding a detailed financing plan for Medicare for All may have contributed to the decline of Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren's popularity. Her poll numbers took a nose dive after she laid out a proposal in November that called for states, employers, corporations and the wealthy to pay for the single-payer system, which she also supports.\\n\\nMeanwhile, moderates such as Biden, Buttigieg and Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar favor building on the Affordable Care Act. They would add to the Obamacare exchanges a government-backed public option, which would presumably have lower premiums and would compete with the private insurers. They would also boost federal subsidies so more people could afford coverage.\\n\\nThe CNN Exit Poll was conducted by Edison Research for the National Election Pool. Results are based on interviews conducted throughout the day with 1,947 randomly selected Democratic primary voters at 45 wards in New Hampshire. Results for the full sample have a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage points."}

A futile exercise. There was no funicular. Yamadera Risshakuji Temple, located on Mount Hoju-san in Japan's Yamagata prefecture, isn't about travel shortcuts. And thankfully so.\\n\\nI would have missed out on one of the most rewarding experiences of my entire Japan journey.\\n\\nl e v a r t\\n\\nThough its official name is Risshakuji, locals refer to it simply as Yamadera -- which means mountain temple. The temple complex, founded in AD 860 to oversee the northern Tohoku region's Tendai Buddhism sect, is actually made up of more than a dozen various sites of religious importance, such as shrines, gates and monuments.\\n\\nThat includes the Konpon-chudo Hall, which is said to house a Buddhist flame that's been burning continuously for more than 1,000 years. The Hiho-kan (treasure hall), built in 1144, is where Yamadera's most precious Buddhist artifacts are held.\\n\\nTackling the 1,015 steps\\n\\nClimbing the 1,015-step staircase that winds its way up Mount Hoju-san to the temple's main hall -- Okunoin -- is intended to be a meditative experience.\\n\\nSomeone obviously didn't tell that to the half a dozen or so packs of middle school students I encountered on the trail during my visit.\\n\\nMany cried out in exaggerated agony as they gripped the staircase railing, while the athletes of the group charged ahead, stoically looking forward as they took the stairs two at a time. But this was not a race to the top. Camaraderie was on full display. Descending hikers offered nods of encouragement to those of us making the ascent, many saying konnichiwa as they passed.\\n\\nSympathetic gazes were cast upon a sweat-drenched father making the climb while carrying his toddler daughter, who sat in a carrier on his back. Fortunately, stopping is encouraged.\\n\\nWhether it's a stone sculpture in front of a cliff wall that's embedded with thousands of one-yen coins or a burst of fiery red leaves hanging just perfectly over a shrine, there are plenty of plausible excuses to pause and catch your breath. And when you finally do reach the summit, the payoff is instant. Interestingly it's not the Okunoin main hall that's the biggest draw.\\n\\nBefore you even reach Okunoin you'll pass what are likely the two most photographed buildings at Yamadera: Kaisando Hall and the small red Nokyodo building, which tower over the valley below.\\n\\nA nearby path takes visitors to the wooden observation platform, Godaido, which gives incredible views of the surrounding Yamagata countryside.\\n\\nCNN\\n\\nGetting there\\n\\nYamadera Station is about a 40-minute train ride from Tohoku's biggest city, Sendai, in neighboring Miyagi prefecture.\\n\\nFor those traveling from Tokyo, the Shinkansen train from Tokyo Station to Yamagata Station takes just over 2.5 hours. Yamadera Station is a 20-minute train ride from there. The temple's entrance is about a 10-minute walk from the station. Multiple signs direct the way."}

{"original": "Walter Rodgers: Remembering Reagan assassination attempt\\n\\n(CNN) -- John Hinckley Jr., the man who shot President Reagan in 1981, wants a federal court to allow him to take unsupervised trips to his parent's house in Virginia. Hinckley has been institutionalized since 1982, when he was found not guilty by reason of insanity of attempting to assassinate Reagan and wounding a Secret Service agent and presidential spokesman James Brady outside a hotel in Washington.\\n\\nCNN correspondent Walter Rodgers witnessed the assassination attempt, working for Associated Press Radio. He spoke Monday from Baghdad with anchor Wolf Blitzer about the events of March 30, 1981.\\n\\nRODGERS: I knew John Hinckley. He and I had an altercation 30 seconds before he shot the president of the United States. I was working my way to the front of the crowd to get a microphone in position to ask a question. I said, Press, excuse me, please. I became conscious of a young man in a tan raincoat. He said, Press, press. Who do they think they are? Don't let him through. I made my way to the front.\\n\\nA few seconds later, Mr. Ronald Reagan came out, all of a sudden 18 inches over my left ear, Hinckley started firing. My friend Jim Brady fell at my feet. I can see it now, I will never forget it. He had a bullet hole in his forehead at the time. Secret Service agents knocked everybody down, I was on the bottom of the pile. They weren't looking for him. I managed to wiggle out and dash out and file the story.\\n\\nBLITZER: Those were momentous seconds. You remember them so vividly, Walter, an incredible moment. You were part of the pool covering President Ronald Reagan at the Washington Hilton hotel.\\n\\nRODGERS: It was open coverage. Everybody was covering the president doing a speech. There was a foreign policy event, overseas. We wanted to dash outside and get the president's reaction. We jumped outside. As soon as he came out, in a matter of seconds, John Hinckley starting firing. He wounded a Secret Service agent.\\n\\nI challenge the jury who acquitted him on the base of insanity. I told this to the U.S. attorney when I was debriefed. My contention was, he had an argument with me, he was as hostile to me as he was to the person he was shooting at. He could have done, five, six, seven shots to the approximate, say one for me. I always said he knew what he was doing, because he didn't shoot me.\\n\\nBLITZER: Hinckley wants unsupervised visits -- since you were there, so close to him, it was such an important story that you remember so vividly. What goes through your mind, Walter?\\n\\nRODGERS: I remember my last conversation with the prosecutors before the trial. We talked about my audiotape. I had a radio tape of the entire thing. He said to me, yes, Hinckley remembers you. He doesn't like you very much. I would like to see him locked up forever. I am not covering the story. He maintained his hostility to me about our original altercation even after he shot the president. I am glad I am not in Washington if he gets out on weekends.\\n\\nBLITZER: I know how strongly all of our colleagues who covered Ronald Reagan feel about that one moment. It wasn't just Ronald Reagan, as you correctly point out, that was shot that day, either, was it?\\n\\nRODGERS: No, a Secret Service agent badly wounded. The memory, as I look at the camera lens and talk to you, I see Jim Brady's bald head at my feet. It is not like the movies. What you get is a hole. Jim Brady, a friend of mine, fell at my feet. We all got knocked down as the agents came over."}

{"original": "Story highlights Richard Haass broke down President Donald Trump's foreign policy one year into his administration Haass said the policy is based on a real misreading of the costs and benefits of US leadership\\n\\n(CNN) —\\n\\nThe Trump administration is engaged in an abdication of US global leadership, the president of the Council on Foreign Relations argued Tuesday night, saying the US chose to walk away from key institutions and alliances.\\n\\nRichard Haass, who was a State Department official during the George W. Bush administration, broke down President Donald Trump's foreign policy one year into his administration on Anderson Cooper 360.\\n\\nI don't see this administration as isolationist, Haass said, citing military strikes in Syria and Afghanistan. The reason I use the word 'abdication' is what they've done is unilaterally – it wasn't forced on them – they chose to walk away from many of the institutions, frameworks, introduce questions into alliances that have really formed or informed American foreign policy now for nearly three quarters of a century.\\n\\nHaass continued, What's so interesting, what's really unprecedented, it wasn't because we don't have the capacity. We're still the world's strongest economy, the world's strongest military. We've essentially decided in many cases that we simply don't think it's worth it, that we don't want to do it anymore. I think that's flawed. It's based on a real misreading of the costs and benefits of US leadership.\\n\\nHaass argued that in the short run it's made US allies less reliant on us, thinking more about how they have to carry out their own foreign policy and that it's diminished respect for us. He cited Trump's decision to walk away from the Paris climate agreement and to spike the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal.\\n\\nNow I think there are bigger issues about what is this United States? What is your DNA? And much less confidence about what it is we're prepared to do in the world, Haass said.\\n\\nThe former diplomat also noted that people forget US foreign policy is not something conducted simply by the US military or by diplomats.\\n\\nEverything we do, everything we are as a society, as an economy, sends a message, sets an example. So, Charlottesville, that's foreign policy. When the economy grows, that's foreign policy. When we have high levels or sustained levels of unemployment, that's also foreign policy."}

But a lawyer for seven women who are suing the university over its handling of sexual harassment allegations say the efforts miss the mark.\\n\\nThe announcement comes nearly two months after a federal complaint was filed against the Ivy League school by seven current and former graduate students who allege three professors created a toxic environment where female subjects were routinely subjected to sexual harassment and even rape.\\n\\nA school inquiry led to the resignations of the three professors in 2018 and the school pledged to take steps to improve the campus culture. The new Campus Climate and Culture Initiative is the latest step in that direction, school officials said in a press release.\\n\\nThe new program will include the following components:\\n\\n- A single policy to address sexual misconduct for faculty, staff, and students, with appropriate processes for adjudicating potential violations;\\n\\n- A mandatory online sexual violence prevention training program for all faculty, staff, professional and graduate students, and postdoctoral scholars;\\n\\n- Research advisory committees for all graduate programs to ensure that all graduate students have access to multiple advisors.\\n\\nThe announcement comes as American universities grapple with how to handle allegations of campus sexual misconduct and their obligations under Title IX, the federal law that bars discrimination based on sex, including harassment, in federally funded education programs and activities.\\n\\nThe Department of Education in November proposed new rules for dealing with sexual harassment and assault on college campuses that would bolster the rights of those accused of wrongdoing.\\n\\nThe lawsuit accuses the New Hampshire school of failing to create an environment free from gender-based discrimination, in violation of Title IX.\\n\\nDartmouth says the new program will expand the school's Title IX office, which is responsible for reviewing reports of sexual misconduct and conducting investigations. The school also pledged to increase mental health resources at Dartmouth and said that an outside expert who specializes in creating inclusive communities will review academic departments.\\n\\nThe lawsuit claims that the prominent researchers, who no longer are allowed on campus, coerced female students into drinking and made the women feel as if their success depended on their willingness to participate in their alcohol-saturated culture the men created.\\n\\nThe complaint claims that Dartmouth knew about the professors' behavior for more than 16 years and did nothing until 2017, when several female graduate students reported the allegations to the college's Title IX office. During the Title IX investigation, the lawsuit claims that Dartmouth failed to provide the plaintiffs with support, accommodations or guidance, then unilaterally terminated the disciplinary process without seeking their input.\\n\\nPreviously, school officials said they applauded the courage of the women who came forward. However, we respectfully, but strongly, disagree with the characterizations of Dartmouth's actions in the complaint and will respond through our own court filings, they said.\\n\\nDeborah Marcuse, an attorney representing seven women plaintiffs in the sexual harassment lawsuit, said the initiatives miss the mark and simply bring the school into compliance with federal law.\\n\\nTo the extent that Dartmouth is now seeking to conform its policies to what federal law requires, we certainly support that though we think it's long overdue, Marcuse said. What's striking about this is that Dartmouth continues to fail to acknowledge or accept responsibility for the damage that its long history of inaction has caused.\\n\\nMarcuse faulted the school for not reaching out to her clients for their input. Dartmouth's formal response to their complaint is due in a little over a week on January 15.\\n\\nIt appears to us that for all of the lip service to their courage, there has been no interest from Dartmouth in materially responding to or really listening to these women despite a lot of vague call outs to 'we want to include everyone and everything', she said.\\n\\nIf you just look at the nature of the various responses there really just isn't any acknowledgment that what these women experienced is something that has had any impact on Dartmouth at all."}

Investigators on Friday were examining a video said to show Pearl's killing to discover the time of the killing and clues to his killers, U.S. officials said. A senior U.S. official told CNN that the tape came into American hands when two men approached an undercover FBI operative they believed to be a journalist. The whereabouts of those two men were unclear. The tape reportedly shows Pearl alive and speaking, and then being killed as his throat is cut. 'We know their names' The official said that investigators were analyzing the tape with forensic techniques to try to determine when Pearl was killed, and that more advanced techniques would be applied later in the United States. The tape contains some pretty gruesome stuff, the source said. Pakistan's Interior Minister Moinuddin Haider told reporters that President Pervez Musharraf had telephoned his condolences to President Bush, and that both agreed the perpetrators of this barbaric act cannot be the friends of Islam nor of Pakistan. Haider also said that Pakistani investigators, with the accused ringleader of the kidnapping and three accomplices already in custody, are looking for four more suspects -- including the men believed to have abducted Pearl. We know their names, we know their identity, Haider said. We have got some of their close relatives, who we are investigating, and we are surely after them ... and once that is done, the whole net will be broken. Alleged ringleader freed in hijacking deal Further investigations were looking at how Islamic extremists could seize a journalist, send e-mails with pictures of their hostage and still elude discovery. In Washington, State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said Pearl's murder was an absolute outrage. Both the United States and Pakistan are committed to identifying the perpetrators of the crime and bringing them to justice, said Boucher, who added that Deputy Secretary Richard Armitage had conveyed the same message to Pearl's widow. President Bush, wrapping up a trip to China, said Thursday that Pearl's death had only deepened the resolve of the United States of America to rid the world of these agents of terror. (Full statement) Pearl's abduction resulted in the arrests of several people believed to have been involved in the kidnapping, including Ahmed Omar Saeed Sheikh -- the man Pakistani officials called the ringleader. Saeed Sheikh is an Islamic militant who was released from an Indian prison in 1999 as part of a deal to end the hijacking of an Indian jetliner. He told Pakistani officials at his first court appearance after his arrest earlier this month that as far as I know Pearl had been killed. Another arrested suspect told a Pakistani court Thursday that Pearl was seized because he was anti-Islam and a Jew. Fahad Naseem, who said he knew of plans of the abduction two days in advance, confessed to sending e-mails about Pearl's abduction at Saeed Sheikh's instructions and disclosed the roles of others in custody and some still at large, authorities said. The e-mails contained photographs of Pearl in captivity and demands for the release of Pakistani detainees at the Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, compound where captured al Qaeda and Taliban fighters are being held. Former hostage: Pearl won't be last victim Former Associated Press correspondent Terry Anderson, who was kidnapped in 1985 and held by Islamic militants in Lebanon for nearly seven years, said that Pearl's killing would do nothing to further the militants' cause. Those who murdered him gained absolutely nothing, said Anderson, now the honorary co-chairman of the Committee to Protect Journalists. There was no purpose to his death, political or otherwise. They didn't even gain publicity for the cause that they supposedly espouse. On the contrary, they discredit their cause. ... It's just such a senseless and pointless murder that it's outrageous. Journalist Charles Glass, who was kidnapped in Beirut in 1987 and escaped his captors two months later, said the investigation must extend beyond the kidnappers. Why was a member or leader of the kidnap group actually arrested by the Pakistanis, and why wasn't he able to provide better information on the exact location of Pearl? Glass said. All these things are going to have to be looked into, because I have a terrible feeling this won't be the last kidnapping of an American abroad by Muslim groups who are disenchanted with American foreign policy. Musharraf sent his condolences to Pearl's family, pledged to find the reporter's killers and said he would not relent in his month-old crackdown on militant groups, which some believe may have been the impetus for the kidnapping. While the investigation in Pakistan continued, friends, colleagues and family struggled to come to terms with a stunning loss. Pearl's close friend Daniel Gill told CNN that Pearl was the absent-minded professor going to an interview with papers flying out of his shirt pockets. He just wanted to get a story, Gill said. He wasn't about getting into the dangerous places. That wasn't for him. I believe he thought this was a safe assignment. Peter R. Kann, publisher of The Wall Street Journal, and Paul E. Steiger, the paper's managing editor, said in a joint statement, (Pearl's) murder is an act of barbarism that makes a mockery of everything Danny's kidnappers claimed to believe in. Pearl was the 10th reporter to die while involved in coverage of the war against terrorism, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists."}

Nicole Mason C. Nicole Mason\\n\\nGains in the stock market and the robust economy obscure the reality that many of the most marginalized workers, those with limited skills and education, are still struggling. Under Trump, the wealthy are doing extremely well, while the middle-class is hanging on.\\n\\nOn Friday, more than 800,000 federal workers across the country will go without a paycheck if the government fails to reopen. Trump says these workers will make adjustments as the shutdown could last months, even years. This, no doubt, will have a trickle-down effect on small businesses and others who rely on these workers to purchase goods and products.\\n\\nThe wall between Mexico and the United States, cheered by Trump's most ardent supporters as a metaphorical and political symbol of America First, has lost its appeal to some as the government shutdown has dragged on. Furloughed workers and those who sympathize with them have begun to realize the wall will not feed their families, keep their lights on or make sure their mortgage is paid.\\n\\nBut there are other reasons American workers may be disenchanted with the President. Trump campaigned on a promise to bring back coal mining jobs. Yet, as Bloomberg reported, analysts say that Trump's plan for the coal industry is not likely to have a large effect on its fortunes.\\n\\nAt campaign rallies and in interviews, Trump likes to say that he turned the West Virginia economy around by cutting energy regulations, but over the last decade, middle-class West Virginia households have seen no overall income gains from the state's modest economic growth, and there has been no sustained surge in the state's economy under Trump. These kinds of results will continue unless we are able to turn away from the divisive politics and rhetoric, and focus on building an economy that works for the majority of Americans – not just the few.\\n\\nWorking-class black and Latino Americans are also losing under Trump. In his address to the nation Tuesday night, President Trump asserted that illegal migration hurts all Americans by driving down jobs and wages, specifically impacting African-Americans and Hispanics. This is a bid to whip up support among both groups for the wall and his nativist immigration policies.\\n\\nWhile it is true that African-Americans and Hispanics tend to be employed in lower wage jobs than white and Asian workers, and compete in the labor market with undocumented immigrants for those jobs, it cannot be ignored that some US employers and corporations often exploit immigrant labor for their gain, by paying them less, forcing them to work in deplorable conditions, or threatening to deport them if they complain.\\n\\nThese habits not only harm undocumented immigrants, but American middle-class workers as well by suppressing wages and making it nearly impossible to demand safer working conditions or benefits without the fear of being fired. If Trump is concerned about the well-being of these black and Hispanic American workers, he should do more than suggest a wall to address the income disparity.\\n\\nCome March, if the government fails to reopen, tens of millions of Americans could lose their Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits, putting their families at risk of food insecurity. According to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, in 2017, 42 million Americans participated in the SNAP program – and more than 44% of them were in working families. It is hard to accept that this protracted and partisan skirmish over a wall could soon bring real hardship to the lives of the most vulnerable Americans.\\n\\nGet our free weekly newsletter Sign up for CNN Opinion's new newsletter.\\n\\nJoin us on Twitter and Facebook\\n\\nIn 2016, the white working class was cautiously optimistic, while others of us held our breath for the deal-maker and mega-businessman Donald Trump to work his magic to bring back jobs and revive struggling industries.

{"original": "(CNN) President-elect Joe Biden will aim to release nearly every available dose of the coronavirus vaccine when he takes office, a break with the Trump administration's strategy of holding back half of US vaccine production to ensure second doses are available.\\n\\nReleasing nearly all vaccine doses on hand could quickly ratchet up the availability of coronavirus vaccines by allowing more people access to a first dose. It could also be a risky strategy as both Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna's vaccines require two doses, administered at specific intervals, and vaccine manufacturing has not ramped up as rapidly as many experts had hoped.\\n\\nThe President-elect believes we must accelerate distribution of the vaccine while continuing to ensure the Americans who need it most get it as soon as possible. He supports releasing available doses immediately, and believes the government should stop holding back vaccine supply so we can get more shots in Americans' arms now, said TJ Ducklo, a spokesman for Biden's transition. He will share additional details next week on how his Administration will begin releasing available doses when he assumes office on January 20th.\\n\\nA transition official said the Biden team believes that vaccine manufacturers will be able to produce enough second doses in a timely fashion while administering first doses to more Americans. Biden's team plans to use the Defense Production Act to produce vaccine materials and other supplies in order to ensure there's enough vaccine for both doses.\\n\\nThe transition official added that the Biden team may hold back a small amount of doses in case of unforeseen circumstances. The Trump administration also does this -- in addition to holding back the second doses -- in the event of incidents such as shipment errors or vaccine spoilage.\\n\\nThe comment from Biden's transition comes after a group of governors wrote a letter to Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar and Operation Warp Speed Chief Operating Officer Gen. Gustave Perna pressing the federal government to distribute reserved doses of the Covid-19 vaccine to states that need them.\\n\\nOur states are ready to work around the clock to ramp up distribution, get more shots in arms, and save more American lives. General Perna, as you have stated before, 'a vaccine sitting on a shelf is not effective,' the letter reads. We couldn't agree with you more. That's why we are asking for your help now. When we work together, we can end this pandemic and return to a life of normalcy sooner.\\n\\nBut Azar said Friday that he worries that might backfire if manufacturing goes wrong.\\n\\nWe have product that is going through QC right now -- quality control -- for sterility, identity check -- that -- we have tens and tens of millions of product. We always will. But batches fail. Sterility fails. ... And then you don't have a product for that second dose, Azar told the American Hospital Association, according to a transcript released by HHS.\\n\\nAnd frankly, talking about that or encouraging that can really undermine a critical public health need, which is that people come back for their second vaccine, he said.\\n\\nTrump administration defends rollout\\n\\nThe Trump administration has insisted it's necessary to hold back doses to ensure Americans who receive the first course of the two-dose vaccine will be sure to have access to a second dose. But the move has sparked a debate about whether a better strategy would be releasing all available doses as quickly as possible, particularly amid rising death and hospitalization rates. A study published Monday in the Annals of Internal Medicine also found that administering first doses of a Covid-19 vaccine to more individuals instead of withholding available supply for use as a second dose may reduce the number of new cases.\\n\\nOperation Warp Speed is continuing to ensure second doses are available to vaccine administration sites, at appropriate intervals, as directed by jurisdiction leaders, said a spokesman for HHS. We would be delighted to learn that jurisdictions have actually administered many more doses than they are presently reporting. We are encouraging jurisdictions to expand their priority groups as needed to ensure no vaccine is sitting on the shelf after having been delivered to the jurisdiction-directed locations.\\n\\nThe spokesman also noted the US Food and Drug Administration recently reiterated the importance of requiring two doses for both the Pfizer and Modern vaccines.\\n\\nMichael Pratt, a spokesman for Operation Warp Speed, pushed back against the transition's plan.\\n\\nIf President-Elect Biden is calling for the distribution of vaccines knowing that there would not be a second dose available, that decision is without science or data and is contrary to the FDA's approved label. If President-Elect Biden is suggesting that the maximum number of doses should be made available, consistent with ensuring that a second dose of vaccine will be there when the patient shows up, then that is already happening, Pratt said.\\n\\nHe continued, Second-dose management was always about ensuring supply chain availability. Operation Warp Speed monitors manufacturing closely, with the intent to transition from reserving as many second doses as manufacturing further stabilizes with a consistent flow of vaccines. Our top priority remains maximizing availability of safe and effective vaccines to the American people responsibly, fairly and equitably.\\n\\nFDA officials say two doses needed\\n\\nThe vaccines by Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna are both about 95% effective after two full doses.\\n\\nEarlier this week, two top officials from the FDA said anyone who receives those vaccines needs both doses, dismissing the idea of stretching the supply by allowing just one dose or cutting doses in half.\\n\\nThey also dismissed other ideas for stretching the vaccine supply and said people who are speculating about the possibility of making do with just one dose or cutting doses in half are misinterpreting the data.\\n\\nWe have been following the discussions and news reports about reducing the number of doses, extending the length of time between doses, changing the dose (half-dose), or mixing and matching vaccines in order to immunize more people against COVID-19, FDA Commissioner Dr. Stephen Hahn and Dr. Peter Marks, who heads FDA's vaccine division, said in a statement.\\n\\nThese are all reasonable questions to consider and evaluate in clinical trials. However, at this time, suggesting changes to the FDA-authorized dosing or schedules of these vaccines is premature and not rooted solidly in the available evidence. Without appropriate data supporting such changes in vaccine administration, we run a significant risk of placing public health at risk, undermining the historic vaccination efforts to protect the population from COVID-19, they added.\\n\\nHahn and Marks also said the data supports giving the second dose of each vaccine at the specified interval -- 21 days after the first dose for the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine and 28 days after the first dose for the Moderna vaccine.\\n\\nAccording to the study published in the Annals of Internal Medicine on Monday, by reducing the amount of the vaccine doses withheld to 10% for the first three weeks and supplying a steady dose of 6 million doses per week, the US could avoid up to 29% more cases over eight weeks.\\n\\nThe US government currently withholds 50% of the available vaccine supply, distributing to states and other jurisdictions weeks later to be administered as the second in a 2-dose series.\\n\\nThe researchers modeled various scenarios, with variables including vaccine supply, protection provided by the first dose and waning efficacy of the first dose if the second dose is delayed. Only in the unlikely worst-case scenario of a collapse in supply and minimal protection among individuals who have received the first dose would the model suggest that withholding 50% of available supply provides better protection.\\n\\nWe find that under most plausible scenarios, a more balanced approach that withholds fewer doses during early distribution in order to vaccinate more people as soon as possible could substantially increase the benefits of vaccines, while enabling most recipients to receive second doses on schedule, write the study's authors, who were supported by the Canadian Institutes for Health Research and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\\n\\nThis story and its headline have been updated with additional reporting on Biden's plan and comments from Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar."}

We're human beings, we have negative thoughts, you've just got to get on with it, he says.\\n\\nOn the flip side, weekend warriors boasting of how quickly they play compared to the pros are not taking tournament venues into account, according to Pepperell's European Tour colleague Laurie Canter.\\n\\n01:51 - Source: CNN Lee Westwood: Modern courses are too difficult\\n\\nI'm not saying there aren't slow players, but it makes me laugh when I read tweets from 15-handicappers saying, 'It takes me two-and-a-half-hours to get around my local course,' says Canter.\\n\\nThat may be, but put them on our courses, make them finish every hole, and then see how long their round would take.\\n\\nHe points out that as well as layouts getting longer, the whole infrastructure around modern courses, often designed to be played in a buggy, can also have an impact.\\n\\nI played a course a couple of years ago that had four-minute walks from greens to tees on every hole. That's an extra hour of play, and it all adds up, he says.\\n\\nPHOTO: Tom Dulat/Getty Images Englishman Eddie Pepperell won the Qatar Masters in Doha in February.\\n\\nSlow play or poor play?\\n\\nOften slow play is just a manifestation of poor play, particularly among high handicappers, and Canter is cautious of draconian measures.\\n\\nAre you going to penalize players for playing poorly? asks the 27-year-old. And it's going to happen more at majors, because of the extra challenge of major golf courses. I've played two (British) Opens, and both times it took an incredible amount of time to play my rounds.\\n\\nThe argument that pro golfers are playing for vast sums of money – or, indeed, their futures on tour – and therefore have every right to take their time is anathema to some.\\n\\nBut others empathize with Australia's former world No.1 Jason Day when he said he had no intention of speeding up his play, and that he's got to get back to what makes me good. If that means I have to back off five times, I'm going to back off five times.\\n\\nPHOTO: Stuart Franklin/Getty Images Jordan Spieth took 30 minutes to play a shot during the 2017 Britih Open at Royal Birkdale, although his deliberations were to establish where he could take a drop.\\n\\n'Important shots'\\n\\nPlayers deemed to be slow are warned and put on the clock by officials – if they then fail to speed up they are given a one-shot penalty.\\n\\nBut despite the stigma attached, the PGA Tour has only penalized two players since 1995 (Miguel Angel Carballo and Brian Campbell were docked a shot at the Zurich Classic last year, although that was in a team event, in which their timings were combined).\\n\\nAnd many players have stated that nothing will change unless shots start being docked from serial offenders.\\n\\nBut both Pepperell and Canter worry that such a system would be devilishly difficult to implement without causing controversy.\\n\\nHow are you going to implement a policy that makes slow players play faster without penalizing the faster players who occasionally take longer over a shot because it's particularly challenging? says Canter.\\n\\nThink about one of the most iconic shots of all time, Tiger Woods' chip-in at the 16th at Augusta in 2005: it took him two-and-a-half minutes to play that shot. Imagine if a referee had come out, looking important and brandishing a yellow card in the middle of his pre-shot routine. That's not realistic.\\n\\nJB Holmes took way too long, but that might be one of his most important shots of the season.\\n\\nPHOTO: Harry How/Getty Images Sport Classic/Getty Images Tiger Woods' chip-in on the 16th in the 2005 Masters is one of golf's most iconic shots.\\n\\n'Keep it flowing'\\n\\nPepperell says there are some simple tweaks that would speed things up, such as being ready to play when it's your turn or hitting before it's your turn if your partner isn't ready.\\n\\nIt doesn't matter who plays when, let's just keep it flowing, says Pepperell, who also thinks the etiquette around avoiding other players' putting lines could be looked at to reduce the length of time spent on greens.\\n\\nPepperell and Canter are divided on green books – diagrams depicting the contours on the putting surfaces; the former thinks their banning would make rounds quicker, the latter thinks it might make them longer, because certain players' minds would be even more muddled without them.\\n\\nAnd Canter thinks it is up to the players to take responsibility and police themselves, with the help of the on-course referees.\\n\\nA catalog could be built up on certain players. Maybe then slow players would say, 'My peers have a problem, so I've adjusted my routine accordingly,' he says.\\n\\nI'm not sure it's right slagging off players for isolated incidents. We could go through the archive and find lots of incredible shots that were well over the time limit, by lots of different players. That's part of the drama.\\n\\nPHOTO: Ross Kinnaird/Getty Images The jury is out whether green books are a help or hindrance to slow play.\\n\\n'Society has changed'\\n\\nPepperell and Canter agree that golf is never going to be anything but a slow, cerebral spectacle, but they both say it can be made into a sexier product, given funkier television coverage and with tournaments married to other forms of entertainment – for example, the Made in Denmark event in Himmerland doubles as a music festival.\\n\\nBut Pepperell believes that if we all just looked at the slow play debate from a different angle, we might just chill out a little bit.\\n\\nTake the Shot Clock Masters [which will be played for the first time in Austria in June], says Pepperell. If you limit players to 40 seconds per shot, what's the best that's going to happen? We get around in three-and-a-half hours? That's still a long time.\\n\\nGolf is always going to take a long time, unless you fundamentally change the way it is played, like Twenty20 cricket.\\n\\nBut I wouldn't advocate that. Golf's been around for centuries, it's society that's changed. Should golf react to the changing pace of life, or does it acknowledge that we live in a state of flux, and there might come a time when people want to slow down again and get away from the stresses of life?\\n\\nI understand why golf's appeal is diminishing, because young people's attention spans are shorter – including mine – and people want things here and now. But will it always be that way? I hope not."}

{"original": "Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump rescinded restrictions on the US military's ability to use landmines, weapons that have been banned by more than 160 countries due to their history of killing and wounding civilians, the White House said Friday.\\n\\nThe President has canceled the Obama administration's policy to prohibit United States military forces from employing anti-personnel landmines outside of the Korean Peninsula, White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said in a statement.\\n\\nThe Department of Defense has determined that restrictions imposed on American forces by the Obama Administration's policy could place them at a severe disadvantage during a conflict against our adversaries. The President is unwilling to accept this risk to our troops, she added.\\n\\nCNN reported Thursday that the move was expected and came about following a lengthy Pentagon review.\\n\\nThe policy represents a major reversal from the approach of the Obama administration which in 2014 committed the US to largely adhering to the 1997 Ottawa Convention, the international agreement which banned the use, stockpiling, production and transfer of anti-personnel landmines. The Obama policy committed to replacing landmines in the US stockpile after they expire and directed the destruction of stockpiles not required for the defense of South Korea.\\n\\nAnti-landmine campaigners were quick to criticize the new policy after news of the change broke.\\n\\nMr. Trump's policy rollback is a step toward the past, like many of his other decisions, and sends exactly the wrong message to those working to rid the world of the scourge of landmines, Jody Williams, who received the 1997 Nobel Peace Prize together with the International Campaign to Ban Landmines, said in a statement Thursday.\\n\\nSecretary of Defense Mark Esper defended the new policy prior to it being formally announced.\\n\\nI think landmines are -- are an important tool that our forces need to have available to them in order to ensure mission success, and in order to reduce risk to forces. That said, in everything we do, we also want to make sure that these instruments, in this case landmines, also take into account both the safety of employment, and the safety to civilians and others after a conflict, Esper told reporters at the Pentagon Friday.\\n\\nThe new Department of Defense landmine policy will permit the operational use of landmines only if they have a 30-day self-destruction or self-deactivation feature, a design feature seen as helping to prevent civilian casualties.\\n\\nSpeaking to reporters on Friday Victorino Mercado, who is performing the duties of Assistant Secretary of Defense for Strategy, Plans, and Capabilities, acknowledged that landmines were an emotional issue but stressed that the US would only use landmines with these safety features, noting that China and Russia maintain a stockpile of thousands of persistent landmines that are seen as much more likely to kill or maim civilians.\\n\\nThe new Pentagon policy gives the authority to use landmines in combat to the commanders of the US military's combatant commands, usually a four-star general or admiral, such as the commanders of US Africa Command and US Central Command which oversee operations on the African continent and the Middle East respectively.\\n\\nDefense officials argue that landmines can play an important role in defending US forces from both enemy armored vehicles and ground forces, helping to ensure US forces are not outflanked or overrun during an attack and can help influence the enemy's direction of movement in a manner to give US troops the advantage.\\n\\nOne of the drivers of the change in policy is greater concern about the prospect of a major conflict with a great power adversary like Russia or China where denying conventional enemy forces access to critical terrain would be seen as a more urgent need than it has been in recent years where the US has focused on counterterrorism and counterinsurgency operations. Moscow and Beijing are not parties to the Ottawa treaty.\\n\\nMercado said that the growing challenge of Russia and China meant that the strategic environment has changed since the Obama administration instituted its policy in 2014.\\n\\nRussian troops occupied Crimea and intervened in eastern Ukraine in 2014 sparking new concerns about the threat posed by Moscow to NATO's eastern flank where the US has relatively few military forces.\\n\\nYou can take a situation where in the early stages we could be extremely outnumbered and by adding this capability and to be able to shape that battle space, that's an enormous equalizer and that could allow more (US) forces to flow in, Mercado said.\\n\\nWe can create areas for the enemy to avoid, Mercado said, later adding that just the threat of potential landmines having been emplaced could affect an adversary's calculus without the US having to actually lay any mines.\\n\\nHe said he does not envision landmines being used in current military operations in places like Syria, Iraq or Afghanistan, saying, I don't see that right now."}

The stock market has certainly turned itself around in a hurry.\\n\\nA few weeks ago, the S&P 500 was inches away from entering bear market territory. But the Dow has rallied 2,000 since Christmas, and all is well on Wall Street again.\\n\\nFor now, at least.\\n\\nInvestors hate ambiguity, and we got a triple dose of ambiguity between Brexit, the Fed and trade, said Mark Howard, senior multi-asset specialist at BNP Paribas on CNN Business' Markets Now live show on Wednesday. We've seen some of that dissipate, and when people jump in the pool, it persuades others to jump in.\\n\\nHoward told CNN Business editor-at-large Richard Quest that a few positive factors have improved market sentiment this year.\\n\\nFederal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell successfully calmed the market last week when he said the Fed could change its hawkish monetary policy if the economy takes a turn for the worse. The Trump administration's trade talks with China have eased fears of a trade war escalation. And though Brexit remains a giant question mark, investors have considered that by now when valuing stocks.\\n\\nInvestors aren't out of the woods yet, though. The global economy is slowing down, and China's jittery consumers aren't buying as many Amerian products. Apple and FedEx both recently warned that their sales and profits would be lower than forecast because of China's lagging economy.\\n\\nCorporate earnings across the board are expected to be weaker this year than they were last year. But that's not going to shock investors anymore, Howard noted.\\n\\nEarnings will be lower, but we think a lot of that is priced in, he said. It's not going to be a surprise when Apple (AAPL) and FedEx (FDX) say the international market has slowed this quarter … unlike US equities before the fourth quarter, when valuations were very high.\\n\\nHoward believes the current market rally has enough momentum to last through February. In March, however, when the Fed may begin to raise rates again, the market could enter another volatile period.\\n\\nUntil then, US stocks remain a good bet.\\n\\nI think the economic numbers in America are so strong, we're the best house in the worst neighborhood, said Alan Valdes, senior partner at Silverbear Capital, on Markets Now.\\n\\nNext week, Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic adviser at Allianz, will join CNN Business for Markets Now.\\n\\nThe show streams live from the New York Stock Exchange every Wednesday at 12:45 p.m. ET.

The legislation is being debated in Parliament just days after officers from London's Metropolitan Police forcefully broke up a peaceful demonstration mourning the death of a young woman, Sarah Everard.\\n\\n(CNN) —\\n\\nAs 2018 unfolded and details of how Brexit might ultimately play out became clearer, political differences that have existed for years between the United Kingdom's four nations were dragged into the open. Bluntly, Brexit has shone a light on the fact that the foundations holding up the UK had been crumbling for some time.\\n\\nThe current deadlock in Westminster – and what it might mean for the union between England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland – is spooking politicians from all over the political divide.\\n\\nJacob Rees-Mogg, a longstanding Conservative Euroskeptic, told me earlier this week: The two greatest risks to the union are splitting Northern Ireland from Great Britain, as the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement with the EU proposes, and a second referendum, which would legitimize the calls for a second independence vote in Scotland.\\n\\nThe movement in the UK's politics and resulting divisions is nicely illustrated by the last eight years of its voting history.\\n\\nThe two greatest risks to the union are splitting Northern Ireland from Great Britain, as the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement with the EU proposes, and a second referendum, which would legitimize the calls for a second independence vote in Scotland. Jacob Rees-Mogg\\n\\nLet's take the 2010 general election as a starting point, in which voters opted for a coalition between David Cameron's Conservative Party and Nick Clegg's Liberal Democrats. These two centrists looked like a safe pair of hands at a time of turmoil in the immediate aftermath of the 2008 global financial crisis.\\n\\nOver the five years of the coalition, austerity measures were introduced that made most politics junkies certain that Labour would win back power under its then leader, Ed Miliband.\\n\\nBut a shock result in 2015 saw Cameron win a majority in Parliament. Scotland voted for the pro-independence Scottish Nationalist Party in huge numbers. After the failed Scottish independence referendum a year earlier, the general election result was a clear sign of just how wide the gap between England and Scotland had become.\\n\\nFast forward past the Brexit referendum and Cameron's own exit to Theresa May's 2017 snap election for more clues. Many voters in pro-Brexit areas of England snubbed her in favor of Labour's Jeremy Corbyn – who at the time had an unclear position on Brexit, though much of his party is pro-Europe. She lost her majority, but strangely picked up votes in Remain-supporting Scotland, despite her party backing the very definition of a so-called hard Brexit.\\n\\nPHOTO: TOLGA AKMEN/AFP/Getty Images Britain's Prime Minister Theresa May leaves from 10 Downing Street on December 17, 2018.\\n\\nClearly, the British public is divided – and that division is especially acute in the politics of the four nations.\\n\\nIn England, the UK's wealthiest and most populous city, London, stands in contrast to the rest of the country.\\n\\nIt is from London that the campaign for a second vote that could ultimately stop Brexit is being driven. But it was English votes that carried the victory for Leave. This creates tension not just in England, but in the union at large – the politics of the English are the most influential in the union and can often dictate policy that affects everyone.\\n\\nIn the case of Brexit, that means Scottish remainers feeling as though the English are dragging them out of the EU against their will. Alarmingly for unionists, recent polling showed that English Conservative voters (officially called the Conservative and Unionist Party) would be happy with the union breaking up in exchange for a good Brexit.\\n\\nThe division is more obvious in Scotland. The SNP would clearly like to push for a second independence referendum and rejoin the EU as an independent nation. Meanwhile, Scottish Conservatives would clearly prefer a softer form of Brexit to protect Scotland's economy while keeping the union together – something about which they disagree with their English counterparts.\\n\\nIn Northern Ireland, the devolved National Assembly has not sat in nearly two years after the power-sharing agreement that allows both unionists and republicans to be involved in government collapsed.\\n\\nDespite this, the Democratic Unionist Party holds the balance of power in Westminster and is currently one of the biggest obstacles to May getting her Brexit deal through Parliament.\\n\\nThey believe the deal ignores their most important demand: no friction between Northern Ireland and Great Britain. We do not want a hard border, we believe there are many ways of resolving it, the DUP's Emma Little-Pengelly said to me of the Irish border issue. Instead, she believes that May and the EU's solution aims to ensure no checks at all on the Irish border between two sovereign states by creating 68 new checks between Great Britain and Northern Ireland.\\n\\nIt must be worrying for the DUP that both those wanting May's deal to pass and hardline Brexit voters are so happy to see their red lines rubbed out for the sake of getting the job done.\\n\\nPHOTO: PAUL FAITH/AFP/AFP/Getty Images Traffic crosses the border into Northern Ireland from the Irish Republic.\\n\\nOne thing seems to have been forgotten by politicians in all this: some people in Brussels speak English. The UK's chaos has been watched with astonishment by EU officials.\\n\\nIt's still not clear what the UK wants, Guy Verhofstadt, Brexit coordinator for the EU Parliament, told CNN. I hope the deal agreed finds a majority. If not, then MPs have to work together to find a compromise solution on a future relationship. Whatever the choice, we need a withdrawal agreement to be agreed to avoid a disastrous no-deal outcome.\\n\\nLoathe as many in Westminster will be to take advice from a former Prime Minister of Belgium, he makes a solid point. Wild politics is not a good enough reason for a nation as important as the UK to fall into a black hole of its own creation.\\n\\nIt's still not clear what the UK wants. Guy Verhofstadt\\n\\nThe good news is that as things stand, both main parties believe the union should be preserved. It shouldn't be beyond the wit of our elected officials to forge some cross-party unity on a matter they claim to care so much about.\\n\\nAs Brexit reaches its apex, perhaps the minds of the political elite will sharpen and we will all start to see a way out of this hellscape. They need to make the public care about the union, or frankly, it's only going to crumble further.\\n\\nIf that doesn't happen, then the UK as we know it will have to continue to exist on life support.\\n\\nAnd if we don't take this moment to fix the union between the four nations, then distressingly few will be in mourning, should the switch get flipped."}

This will be the first Cabinet ever with the majority of people of color occupying this Cabinet, the President-elect said. He noted his nominees would, if confirmed, include the first female treasury secretary, the first African American defense secretary and the first Native American Cabinet secretary.\\n\\nBiden on Friday also announced Isabel Guzman, the director of California's Office of the Small Business Advocate, to lead the Small Business Administration and Don Graves, who was the executive director of the President's Council on Jobs and Competitiveness at the Obama White House, as his nominee for deputy secretary of commerce.\\n\\nBiden spoke of the challenges his administration will face when he takes office in the middle of a pandemic and economic downturn, when so many Americans have lost their jobs and are struggling financially.\\n\\nBiden said his administration would prioritize distributing emergency economic aid to small businesses on Main Street that aren't wealthy and well connected, that are facing real economic hardships through no fault of their own. He said he would focus on supporting Black, Latino, Asian, Native American and women-owned small businesses.\\n\\nThe President-elect stressed that Americans and small businesses struggling amid the pandemic need immediate and direct economic relief, including $2,000 stimulus checks.\\n\\n$600 is simply not enough, when you have to choose between paying rent, putting food on the table, keeping the lights on, Biden said of the stimulus checks that were recently approved by Congress.\\n\\nHe sympathized with Americans across the country who have lost their jobs and are now forced to line up at food banks to feed their families. He pointed out that the gap between White unemployment and Black and Latino unemployment remains much too large.\\n\\nIn the wake of the two Democratic US Senate wins in Georgia, the President-elect said he hoped that having Democrats controlling both the House and the Senate will increase the changes of raising the minimum wage.\\n\\nDuring a Q&A after he introduced the nominees, Biden said President Donald Trump's decision to skip his inauguration is one of the few things he and I have ever agreed on.\\n\\nHere are key lines from the nominees, who will all require Senate confirmation:\\n\\nGina Raimondo, Commerce Secretary\\n\\nRhode Island Gov. Gina Raimondo (L) delivers remarks after U.S. President-elect Joe Biden (R) announced her as his Commerce Secretary nominee at The Queen theater on January 08, 2021 in Wilmington, Delaware.\\n\\nWhen I announced my run for governor, Rhode Island was in the midst of an eight-month streak as the state with the highest unemployment rate in the nation. But over the last six years, we've worked hard, we fought back and we've grown our way back, achieving a record number of jobs and the lowest unemployment rate in over 30 years.\\n\\nI am excited to get to work on a national scale to help realize the vision of the President-elect and Vice President-elect to help more hardworking families in every community write the next chapter of their own American stories.\\n\\nMarty Walsh, Labor Secretary\\n\\nBoston Mayor Marty Walsh, nominee for Secretary of Labor, speaks after being nominated by US President-elect Joe Biden at The Queen theater January 8, 2021 in Wilmington, Delaware.\\n\\nToday, we're at a crossroads in America. It's a time of great hardship. Working people are holding their country together. I've seen it up close as mayor of the city that I love, Boston. Health care workers, first responders, grocery store workers, delivery drivers, postal workers, sanitation workers, custodians. Coming through for us under impossible conditions.\\n\\nWorking people have been struggling for a long time under the erosion of their rights and the deep inequities of race, gender and class. For the last four years they've been under assault, attacks on their rights, their livelihoods and the unions that built the middle class. We are facing hard times but nobody's tougher than the American worker, and now, now we have the opportunity to put power back in the hands of working people all across this country.\\n\\nIsabel Guzman, Small Business Administrator\\n\\nU.S. Vice President-elect Kamala Harris (L) looks on as Isabel Guzman (R) delivers remarks after U.S. President-elect Joe Biden announced her as his nominee for head of the Small Business Administration at The Queen theater on January 08, 2021 in Wilmington, Delaware.\\n\\nI'm honored to return to the SBA at a crossroads moment for small businesses, the dreams they embody, the people they lift up and the communities they serve. So many small businesses across the country have been devastated by the pandemic and economic crisis. A disproportionate impact has fallen, as it often does, on our businesses owned by people of color.\\n\\nSmall businesses have had to adapt quickly to survive and chase down relief while facing closures, drops in revenues, shrinking cash flow and increasing debt. I know you believe wholeheartedly, Mr. President-elect and Madam Vice President-elect, that all of our small businesses are critical to our collective success as a nation.\\n\\nDon Graves, Deputy Secretary of Commerce\\n\\nBiden's former counselor Don Graves, nominee for Deputy Secretary of Commerce, speaks after being nominated by US President-elect Joe Biden at The Queen theater January 8, 2021 in Wilmington, Delaware.\\n\\nI've spent my career -- in government, the private sector and nonprofits -- finding ways to ensure that economic opportunity is inclusive and broad-based. And as it is for all of us in our own ways, it's personal. I come from a long line of small business owners, including one who owned and operated the only African American-owned hotel in the mid to late 1800s just four short blocks from where the Commerce Department sits today.\\n\\nBut for too many people in this country, the chance to start and grow a business, to take their idea into market and sell all over the world remains elusive all these years later. But we also know that government, its resources and its experienced and capable civil servants can help level the playing field and empower people, communities and our economy to reach their full potential.\\n\\nRaimondo is the first woman governor of Rhode Island, and has served in the role since her election in 2014. She was among the women considered to serve as Biden's vice president, and has been praised for her leadership amid the coronavirus pandemic. Raimondo was also considered for Biden's health and human services secretary, but The New York Times reported last month that labor unions helped block Raimondo from becoming his pick to lead HHS because of her record on pension changes.\\n\\nWalsh is a veteran union operative and rose to lead Boston's Building and Construction Trades Council, a group that represents ironworker and electrician unions, among others. Walsh has been serving as Boston's mayor since 2013, and was a rumored potential Labor pick in 2016 if Hillary Clinton had won the presidency. Walsh's selection is a victory for AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka, who rallied his federation of 56 unions to back the Boston mayor soon after Biden won the election.\\n\\nGuzman is the director of California's Office of the Small Business Advocate, a government office that works to support and grow small businesses in America's most populous state. Prior to taking over the state office, Guzman was the deputy chief of staff and senior adviser at the US Small Business Administration, the office she will now lead.\\n\\nGraves served in the Obama White House as the executive director of the President's Council on Jobs and Competitiveness and as the deputy assistant secretary for small business, community development and housing policy at the US Department of Treasury. Graves was previously a partner with Graves, Horton, Askew & Johns, LLC. He was the former director of public policy for the business roundtable and was previously a policy adviser for the US Department of the Treasury's Office of Domestic Finance.\\n\\nThe announcements come days after pro-Trump supporters stormed and breached the US Capitol.

{"original": "New York (CNN Business) Lured by his promises of fat tax cuts and deregulation, Corporate America enthusiastically backed President Donald Trump following his shocking 2016 victory.\\n\\nBut the relationship broke down as Trump failed to condemn racism, attacked major American companies, ignored the climate crisis and imposed tariffs. And the divorce was completed in spectacular fashion this week after Trump incited an angry mob that assaulted the US Capitol.\\n\\nWhen Trump took office, the business community initially praised the self-styled CEO president's pro-business agenda : In late 2016, the influential lobbying group Business Roundtable cheered Trump's economic team and tax cut promises. The following year Jay Timmons, CEO of the National Association of Manufacturers, urged lawmakers to back Trump's infrastructure plan and said all of Congress needs to get onboard the 'Trump train.\\n\\nBoth parties struck an entirely different tone this week with the insurrection on the US Capitol, a symbol of American democracy, proving to be the final straw.\\n\\nThe Business Roundtable slammed US politicians for spreading the fiction of a fraudulent election, warning it's a threat to democracy and the economy. Leading CEOs condemned the violence.\\n\\nAnd in perhaps the strongest political statement by a major business group in modern history, Timmons -- a former GOP operative -- called on Vice President Mike Pence and the Cabinet to consider removing Trump from power : This is chaos. It is mob rule. It is dangerous. This is sedition and it should be treated as such.\\n\\nBut critics say business leaders should have condemned Trumpism far earlier and in some ways enabled him.\\n\\nThis is a lesson in not standing up to bullies, said Eleanor Bloxham, CEO of the Value Alliance, a firm that advises boards on corporate governance practices. By embracing Trump, they were enabling a very narrow perspective, not a long-term one.\\n\\nSenator Sherrod Brown, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee, suggested the timing of the divorce was convenient.\\n\\nThese CEOs have already gotten their tax cuts, deregulation and pro-corporate judges. They don't really need Trump anymore, so they can finally do the right thing, Brown told CNN Business in an interview on Thursday. It's nice they stepped up with such great courage with 13 days left in the Trump administration.\\n\\nThese CEOs have already gotten their tax cuts, deregulation and pro-corporate judges. They don't really need Trump anymore, so they can finally do the right thing. Democratic Senator Sherrod Brown\\n\\n'Oh no, Trump'\\n\\nTo be fair, the relationship between Trump and Corporate America has always been full of ups and downs. And CEOs did provide critical moments of moral leadership during the turbulent Trump era.\\n\\nIn the primaries, the feeling seemed to be, 'Oh no, Trump,' Bloxham recalled of her conversations in 2015 and 2016 with generally Republican-leaning board members.\\n\\nAfter Trump won the nomination, many business leaders threw their weight behind Hillary Clinton.\\n\\nThey never saw him as one of them, said Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, founder of Yale University's Chief Executive Leadership Institute. Sonnenfeld recalled that some executives who are active CEOs today threatened to walk out when he brought Trump to a business summit around 2006.\\n\\nWait, there's tax cuts?\\n\\nBut once Trump won the White House, the industry saw him as a vehicle for the pro-business agenda they craved -- especially on tax cuts.\\n\\nIn January 2017, there was great enthusiasm. He was speaking their language, said Sonnenfeld. The business community was quite excited.\\n\\nBy the end of 2017, Trump delivered by enacting sweeping corporate tax cuts that the White House promised would create a roaring economy.\\n\\nThe Business Roundtable did a deal with the devil, said Sonnenfeld.\\n\\nTrump's tax cuts had a greater impact on Wall Street than Main Street. A lasting acceleration in job-creating investments never materialized, with the windfall largely going toward stock buybacks, dividends and mergers. By early 2019, Bank of America economists dubbed it the investment boom that wasn't.\\n\\nBeyond tax cuts, Trump set in motion a wave of deregulation that the business community was clamoring for after eight years of the Obama administration. And he appointed pro-business judges, including three conservatives to the Supreme Court.\\n\\nThey got most of what they wanted, said Ed Mills, Washington policy analyst at Raymond James.\\n\\nClashes over race, climate and immigration\\n\\nBut relations began to fray in the summer of 2017.\\n\\nDisney DIS Tesla TSLA First, business leaders including formerCEO Bob Iger andCEO Elon Musk slammed Trump's decision to withdraw the United States from the Paris climate agreement.\\n\\nThey didn't want to be on the wrong side of history, said Sonnenfeld.\\n\\nToo toxic?\\n\\nThe question now is whether business leaders will offer support to the Trump movement after his term ends January 20.\\n\\nTrump and his surrogates have vowed to mount well-funded primary challenges to sitting Republicans who refused to back his attempt to overturn the election.\\n\\nYou've got a lot of Republican businessmen wondering: Am I going to latch onto this Trump movement because it's still low-tax and pro-energy? said Michael Cembalest, chairman of market and investment strategy at JPMorgan Asset Management in an interview conducted before Wednesday's siege on the Capitol.\\n\\nOn the other hand, there is a lot of other stuff that goes with the Trump movement: anti-trade, intensely anti-immigration and arguably a degree of authoritarianism that isn't in sync with the party, he added.\\n\\nBloxham, the Value Alliance CEO, said much will depend on whether Trump faces serious consequences, such as impeachment or invocation of the 25th Amendment, before his term ends.\\n\\nIf there is a strong response, Bloxham said, then the Trump brand will be much more toxic."}
{"original": "A will is a document that lets you tell the world whom you want to get your assets. Die without one, and the state decides who gets what, without regard to your wishes or your heirs' needs.\\n\\nSo-called intestacy laws vary considerably from state to state. In general, though, if you die and leave a spouse and kids, your assets will be split between your surviving mate and children. If you're single with no children, then the state is likely to decide who among your blood relatives will inherit your estate.\\n\\nMaking a will is especially important for people with young children, because wills are the best way to transfer guardianship of minors.\\n\\nYou may amend your will at any time. In fact, it's a good idea to review it periodically and especially when your marital status changes. At the same time, review your beneficiary designations for your 401(k), IRA, pension and life insurance policy since those accounts will be transferred automatically to your named beneficiaries when you die.\\n\\nA will is also useful if you have a trust. A trust is a legal mechanism that lets you put conditions on how your assets are distributed after you die and it often lets you minimize gift and estate taxes. But you still need a will since most trusts deal only with specific assets such as life insurance or a piece of property, but not the sum total of your holdings.\\n\\nEven if you have what's known as a revocable living trust in which you can put the bulk of your assets, you still need what's known as a pour-over will. In addition to letting you name a guardian for your children, a pour-over will ensures that all the assets you intended to put into the trust are put there even if you fail to retitle some of them before your death.\\n\\nAny assets that are not retitled in the name of the trust are considered subject to probate. As a result, if you haven't specified in a will who should get those assets, a court may decide to distribute them to heirs whom you may not have chosen.\\n\\nA living will (also known as an advance medical directive) is a statement of your wishes for the kind of life-sustaining medical intervention you want, or don't want, in the event that you become terminally ill and unable to communicate."}

Watch more on Cheney's unannounced visit »\\n\\nTheir stop at the palace overlapped for about an hour, but the vice president did not interact with McCain and the other senators; Cheney arrived while McCain was sitting down for an interview with CNN and he was in a meeting with Gen.

He said his view was strengthened by visits to neighborhoods in Mosul, Ramadi, Baghdad and other Iraqi cities, and by his briefings here.\\n\\nTaking a position that reverberates in the campaign, McCain said U.S. troop reductions should pause once the 30,000 combat troops added for the surge are rotated back to the United States. That would leave U.S. troop levels at roughly 145,000. Watch McCain discuss the future of Iraq »\\n\\nDemocrats have insisted that further troop reductions should continue.

BROWN/AFP via Getty Images)\\n\\n(CNN Business) —\\n\\nFederal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell says he would not resign if pressured to do so by President Donald Trump.\\n\\nNo, Powell answered simply, when asked Friday morning during a panel at the annual American Economics Association conference alongside former Fed chairs Janet Yellen and Ben Bernanke.\\n\\nTrump has repeatedly criticized Powell for continuing to tighten monetary policy, saying on Twitter that it's the only problem with the economy. The President has also asked advisers amid increasing market volatility in recent weeks whether he can fire Powell.\\n\\nIt's unclear whether presidents legally can fire Fed chairs, whom they appoint for four-year terms. Trump chose Powell in 2017 to succeed Yellen, bucking the practice of reappointing Fed chairs to second terms.\\n\\nTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who supported Powell's appointment, tweeted in late December that Trump had never suggested firing Powell and did not believe he had the power to do so.\\n\\nOnstage in Atlanta on Friday, Powell said Trump had not directly expressed dissatisfaction to him, and that he has no plans to meet with Trump. White House aides have floated the idea of inviting the former investment banker to sit with the President in person to allay Trump's concerns.\\n\\nMeetings between presidents and Fed chairs do happen, but nothing's been scheduled, Powell told moderator Neil Irwin, an economics reporter for the New York Times.\\n\\nBoth Yellen and Bernanke spoke about the importance of insulating monetary policy decisions from political concerns in order to reassure investors that rate changes are solidly grounded in economic data.\\n\\nPresidents Lyndon Johnson and Richard Nixon tangled with their Fed chairs, but more recently American leaders have refrained from commenting on policy decisions.\\n\\nObviously the president has the right to comment on the Fed, Yellen said. But I would worry that if it continues or intensifies, it could undermine confidence in the Fed.\\n\\nPowell jumped in again to reiterate that the Fed would not be swayed by comments from the President or any other politician.\\n\\nWe are committed to achieving the goals that the law gives us, based on the best thinking, he said. It's very much in the DNA of the Fed. We have a strong culture. It's not a fragile one, it's not subject to being disrupted, and I would want the public to have confidence in that.\\n\\nThe Federal Reserve raised rates in December and has signaled that it would be open to considering rate changes in 2019, even amid signs that the global economy is starting to slow."}

His most recent books are the novel Cautivos, The Rabbits' Rebellion, a children's story, and The Compensation Bureau, a forthcoming novella about the apocalypse. He lives with his wife in Chile and in Durham, North Carolina, where he is a distinguished emeritus professor of literature at Duke University. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. Read more opinion on CNN.\\n\\nI ask as an American citizen concerned about our damaged democracy but also as someone with roots in Chile, which after many years of dictatorship suffered the harmful consequences of failing to fully complete its democratic transition.\\n\\nIt is just such a major transition that the United States needs today.\\n\\nMost of my fellow Americans may find this idea puzzling, even insulting. Our country has no restrictions of freedom of speech or assembly. It just carried out an election that the sitting President lost decisively, despite his and his supporters' many desperate efforts to overturn the result. It seems clear that by Wednesday, when Congress meets to officially acknowledge Donald Trump's defeat, we should no longer be worried about the transfer of power, the successful transition, in effect, between administrations.\\n\\nIt is true that Trump continues to deny his loss and to recklessly try to undermine his successor, President-elect Joe Biden. He may yet inflict more havoc and pain on our country and the world before he is gone, but at least this specific nightmare will end on January 20, when Biden is sworn in as the 46th President.\\n\\nThe inability of our nation's institutions to have blocked, let alone prosecuted in the courts, such malfeasance and venality is a symptom of deeper problems that a changing of the guard, however encouraging, cannot ultimately resolve.\\n\\nAfter all, if slightly more than 40,000 voters in three states had changed their minds — or had their ballots suppressed or thrown out — the result would have been different, creating a tie in the Electoral College that would have thrown the question of who should be President into the House of Representatives. In that scenario, each state would only have a single vote in the House of Representatives, and it is possible and indeed probable that Trump would have been elected, thwarting the will of the majority — more than 81 million people. It is the sort of trouble we do not need — and it stems from the absurd Electoral College , devised in the 18th century to appease slave states desperate to keep their human chattel.\\n\\nThis is an America where, as we have seen demonstrated in only the past few years, just a handful of Supreme Court justices, anointed by a flagrantly unrepresentative Senate, can undo the rights obtained through decades of struggle by women, patients, workers, minorities and unions — and too often contravene the rights recognized and protected by their wiser colleagues and predecessors on the high court. We have seen how justices can allow the earth to be ravaged for profit and open the door to corporations to influence elections and legislation with enormous infusions of money.\\n\\nIt is an America where an indecent accumulation of wealth at the top leads to breathtaking inequality and despair in vast sectors of the population, with millions of disaffected men and women looking to some faux populist savior to rescue them. This is an America that gerrymanders districts, disenfranchises minorities and tolerates racial hatred and anti-immigrant sentiment. An America that, unwilling to rein in police brutality and gun violence at home, has supported dictators and autocrats abroad as part of a foreign policy that was the de facto consensus for most of our history, no matter which party was in power.\\n\\nAn America where a startling number of ordinary men and women, in thrall to serial mendacity, mistrust the electoral process when their candidate loses.\\n\\nIt would be all too easy to postpone confronting the structural causes behind this state of affairs, given that the nation — including its lawmakers and the incoming Biden-Harris administration — must cope with an unrelenting economic recession, volatile international relations, ecological catastrophes, a polarized public and, above all, a criminally mismanaged pandemic.\\n\\nBut Americans, awakened by the traumatic Trump experience to the more permanent frailties and limitations of their governing system, should not waste this unique opportunity to simultaneously tackle a festering crisis of democracy itself, which, if left unaddressed, will continue to endanger the republic.\\n\\nIf we think of Trump's reign not as an outlier but the extreme expression of a morbidity that has been accumulating since the birth of the country, rooted in the tangles of our collective history and DNA, then true healing can only begin if we the people decide to make an open-ended transition to an all-inclusive, all-embracing democracy, one that dares to reimagine the nation's broken identity. A new Constitution would be ideal, but if that is unfeasible, let us at least start a wide-ranging conversation about how to face this crisis with our eyes, hearts and intellects open.\\n\\nPerhaps due to my Chilean origins, I am convinced that we urgently need drastic solutions and radical reforms, not piecemeal and partial ones. Americans should heed the cautionary tale that Chile sends us. In 1990, after 17 years of dictatorship, Chileans regained the right to determine their own destiny, but they were unable to take the crucial next step of pressuring their leaders to right the wrongs of the past and move forward to a full democracy. Remnants of the old regime survived , and strangled attempts at indispensable economic, political and social reforms.\\n\\nWithout those reforms, a majority of the people felt left out of the mainstream of public life, discourse and consensus, and became more cynical about democracy itself. They got ever angrier as they watched their land riven by economic disparity, with one system for the privileged and another for those without the means or power to be really heard.\\n\\nGet our free weekly newsletter Sign up for CNN Opinion's new newsletter.

But the Dow has rallied 2,000 since Christmas, and all is well on Wall Street again.\\n\\nFor now, at least.\\n\\nInvestors hate ambiguity, and we got a triple dose of ambiguity between Brexit, the Fed and trade, said Mark Howard, senior multi-asset specialist at BNP Paribas on CNN Business' Markets Now live show on Wednesday. We've seen some of that dissipate, and when people jump in the pool, it persuades others to jump in.\\n\\nHoward told CNN Business editor-at-large Richard Quest that a few positive factors have improved market sentiment this year.\\n\\nFederal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell successfully calmed the market last week when he said the Fed could change its hawkish monetary policy if the economy takes a turn for the worse. The Trump administration's trade talks with China have eased fears of a trade war escalation. And though Brexit remains a giant question mark, investors have considered that by now when valuing stocks.\\n\\nInvestors aren't out of the woods yet, though. The global economy is slowing down, and China's jittery consumers aren't buying as many Amerian products. Apple and FedEx both recently warned that their sales and profits would be lower than forecast because of China's lagging economy.\\n\\nCorporate earnings across the board are expected to be weaker this year than they were last year. But that's not going to shock investors anymore, Howard noted.\\n\\nEarnings will be lower, but we think a lot of that is priced in, he said. It's not going to be a surprise when Apple (AAPL) and FedEx (FDX) say the international market has slowed this quarter … unlike US equities before the fourth quarter, when valuations were very high.\\n\\nHoward believes the current market rally has enough momentum to last through February. In March, however, when the Fed may begin to raise rates again, the market could enter another volatile period.\\n\\nUntil then, US stocks remain a good bet.\\n\\nI think the economic numbers in America are so strong, we're the best house in the worst neighborhood, said Alan Valdes, senior partner at Silverbear Capital, on Markets Now.\\n\\nNext week, Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic adviser at Allianz, will join CNN Business for Markets Now.\\n\\nThe show streams live from the New York Stock Exchange every Wednesday at 12:45 p.m. ET.

Authorities said Tuesday, Oct. 31, 2017, that three Dartmouth psychology professors are under criminal investigation for allegations of sexual misconduct. The previous week the college said the professors were put on paid leave and had their access to campus restricted due to allegations of serious misconduct. The college later told authorities it had received allegations of sexual misconduct. (AP Photo/Jim Cole, File)\\n\\n(CNN) —\\n\\nDartmouth College says it is launching a new initiative to combat sexual harassment and abuses of power on campus. But a lawyer for seven women who are suing the university over its handling of sexual harassment allegations say the efforts miss the mark.\\n\\nThe announcement comes nearly two months after a federal complaint was filed against the Ivy League school by seven current and former graduate students who allege three professors created a toxic environment where female subjects were routinely subjected to sexual harassment and even rape.\\n\\nA school inquiry led to the resignations of the three professors in 2018 and the school pledged to take steps to improve the campus culture. The new Campus Climate and Culture Initiative is the latest step in that direction, school officials said in a press release.\\n\\nThe new program will include the following components:\\n\\n- A single policy to address sexual misconduct for faculty, staff, and students, with appropriate processes for adjudicating potential violations;\\n\\n- A mandatory online sexual violence prevention training program for all faculty, staff, professional and graduate students, and postdoctoral scholars;\\n\\n- Research advisory committees for all graduate programs to ensure that all graduate students have access to multiple advisors.\\n\\nThe announcement comes as American universities grapple with how to handle allegations of campus sexual misconduct and their obligations under Title IX, the federal law that bars discrimination based on sex, including harassment, in federally funded education programs and activities.\\n\\nThe Department of Education in November proposed new rules for dealing with sexual harassment and assault on college campuses that would bolster the rights of those accused of wrongdoing.\\n\\nThe lawsuit accuses the New Hampshire school of failing to create an environment free from gender-based discrimination, in violation of Title IX.\\n\\nDartmouth says the new program will expand the school's Title IX office, which is responsible for reviewing reports of sexual misconduct and conducting investigations. The school also pledged to increase mental health resources at Dartmouth and said that an outside expert who specializes in creating inclusive communities will review academic departments.\\n\\nThe lawsuit claims that the prominent researchers, who no longer are allowed on campus, coerced female students into drinking and made the women feel as if their success depended on their willingness to participate in their alcohol-saturated culture the men created.\\n\\nThe complaint claims that Dartmouth knew about the professors' behavior for more than 16 years and did nothing until 2017, when several female graduate students reported the allegations to the college's Title IX office. During the Title IX investigation, the lawsuit claims that Dartmouth failed to provide the plaintiffs with support, accommodations or guidance, then unilaterally terminated the disciplinary process without seeking their input.\\n\\nPreviously, school officials said they applauded the courage of the women who came forward. However, we respectfully, but strongly, disagree with the characterizations of Dartmouth's actions in the complaint and will respond through our own court filings, they said.\\n\\nDeborah Marcuse, an attorney representing seven women plaintiffs in the sexual harassment lawsuit, said the initiatives miss the mark and simply bring the school into compliance with federal law.\\n\\nTo the extent that Dartmouth is now seeking to conform its policies to what federal law requires, we certainly support that though we think it's long overdue, Marcuse said. What's striking about this is that Dartmouth continues to fail to acknowledge or accept responsibility for the damage that its long history of inaction has caused.\\n\\nMarcuse faulted the school for not reaching out to her clients for their input. Dartmouth's formal response to their complaint is due in a little over a week on January 15.\\n\\nIt appears to us that for all of the lip service to their courage, there has been no interest from Dartmouth in materially responding to or really listening to these women despite a lot of vague call outs to 'we want to include everyone and everything', she said.\\n\\nIf you just look at the nature of the various responses there really just isn't any acknowledgment that what these women experienced is something that has had any impact on Dartmouth at all."}

{"original": "President Trump often says that Mexico is the big winner from free trade with the U.S.\\n\\nIt has been a one-sided deal from the beginning of NAFTA, Trump tweeted on Jan. 26, referring to the trade agreement between the U.S., Mexico and Canada.\\n\\nBut Mexico's experience with NAFTA has been anything but a clean victory.\\n\\nPoverty in Mexico has increased since NAFTA became law in 1994, and the country's economy performed worse than many of its peers in Latin America, according to a new study published by the Center for Economic and Policy Research, a left-leaning think tank.\\n\\nMany people think that since American workers lost out from NAFTA, Mexicans must have benefited, says Mark Weisbrot, co-director of the think tank. But the data show that this is not true.\\n\\nRelated: Mexico ready to 'step away from NAFTA' if new deal isn't good\\n\\nNAFTA's fate is coming to a head as the Trump administration prepares to formally kick off a 90-day countdown to start talks with Mexico and Canada.\\n\\nSeveral studies show that Mexico both won and lost from NAFTA, depending on the sector of its economy. That's akin to the U.S. experience -- broadly speaking, some U.S. manufacturers suffered while many American farmers gained.\\n\\nThe latest analysis cites Mexican government figures and finds that about 55% of Mexicans today cannot afford basic expenses, such as food, housing, health care, education transportation and clothing. That's up from 52% in 1994, which may sound like a small increase, but it amounts to an additional 20 million Mexicans living under these conditions.\\n\\nRelated: I sent money home to support my family in Mexico\\n\\nMexico also ranks 15th out of 20 in Latin America in GDP per capita -- a measure of the population's purchasing power. Between 1994 and 2016, growth in Mexico's GDP per capita averaged 1.2%, significantly lower than other nations such as Colombia, Peru and Chile, according to CEPR.\\n\\nA double whammy for Mexico was the entry of China into the World Trade Organization in 2001. China quickly became Mexico's biggest competitor over trade with the United States.\\n\\nChina's share of trade with the U.S. increased sharply after it joined the WTO, which hurt Mexico's prospects and share of the U.S. market.\\n\\nNAFTA has also hurt rural Mexico. According to the think tank's research, Mexico lost about 2 million farming jobs between 1991 and 2007 (it didn't provide more recent data).\\n\\nLarge-scale U.S. farmers, especially corn farmers, outperformed production from their Mexican counterparts, many of whom owned small and medium-size farms that lacked advanced technology.\\n\\nToday, Mexico is one of the world's top buyers of U.S. corn and soy.\\n\\nRelated: My American job is moving to Mexico\\n\\nIn general, Mexico did win when it comes to the manufacturing sector. Over 80% of Mexico's exports go to the U.S. tax-free today. American companies of all stripes, from John Deere (DE) to Krispy Kreme, have created jobs in Mexico since NAFTA began.\\n\\nAnd other data does show that poverty in Mexico has actually declined in some respects. According to World Bank data, in 1994 there were 9.2 million Mexicans living in poverty, defined as living on $1.90 a day -- a yardstick which has been adjusted for inflation over the years. Today, that figure stands at 3.8 million."}
{"original": "(CNN) —\\n\\nSen. Kamala Harris' unique biography and unlikely political ascent might have been summed up best by a political strategist who incorrectly predicted her defeat in the 2010 California attorney general's race.\\n\\nThere was no way I could win, Harris writes in her new memoir, recalling the strategist's stinging words, because I was 'a woman running for attorney general, a woman who is a minority, a woman who is a minority who is anti-death penalty who is DA of wacky San Francisco.' Old stereotypes die hard.\\n\\nHarris did win that race (barely) and is now poised for another steep and daunting climb – this time a potential quest for the Democratic presidential nomination in what might become the most diverse and seasoned field of presidential candidates in the party's history.\\n\\nIn a twist of fate, what one strategist viewed as her vulnerabilities – her gender, her race and the interrogation skills she developed as a prosecutor – may now be what sets her apart in the 2020 crowd.\\n\\nThe California senator's memoir publishing Tuesday, The Truths We Hold, lays the groundwork by chronicling Harris' journey as the daughter of immigrants from India and Jamaica who grew up with a stroller-eye view of the civil rights movement and was educated in the black intellectual circles of Oakland and Berkeley in the 1960s and early 1970s.\\n\\nThe book is a rallying cry against what Harris views as the un-American policies of the Trump administration, alongside her set of policy alternatives. She casts herself as a champion for everyday Americans against the powerful, and she is unsparing in her disdain for the policies of President Donald Trump. She notes that after her own victory speech in 2016, she watched the returns with her husband in a state of shock, eating an entire family-size bag of classic Doritos. Didn't share a single chip.\\n\\nI did know this: one campaign was over but another was about to begin, Harris writes. This time, a battle for the soul of our nation.\\n\\nIn the years since, she continues, we've seen an administration align itself with white supremacists at home and cozy up to dictators abroad; rip babies from their mothers' arms in grotesque violation of their human rights; give corporations and the wealthy huge tax cuts while ignoring the middle class; derail our fight against climate change; sabotage health care and imperil a woman's right to control her own body; all while lashing out at seemingly everything and everyone, including the very idea of a free and independent press. We're better than this.\\n\\nThe memoir is also her most personal account to date of her exploration of her own heritage, her path to becoming a progressive prosecutor and her brushes with sexism as a woman in the male-dominated spheres of law and politics.\\n\\nShe will launch a media blitz Tuesday with appearances on ABC's Good Morning America and The View, followed by a late night interview later this week with CBS' Stephen Colbert and a series of talks about her book in Washington D.C., New York, San Francisco and Los Angeles. Her announcement about a presidential run is expected toward the end of this month.\\n\\nFor many years in California, Harris recoiled from questions about her personal life, which helped establish her image as a disciplined and cautious politician. Her first book, Smart on Crime, reflected that private veneer with its narrow focus on policy, drawing from her experience prosecuting crimes that ranged from child sexual assault to homicide in Alameda County and San Francisco.\\n\\nIn the new book, Harris delves far more deeply into her upbringing by a single mother who was determined to see that she and her sister Maya would grow into confident, proud black women. A mother, Harris writes, who taught them to be tough and rarely offered praise for behavior or achievements that were expected.\\n\\nHarris stitches together touchstones from her childhood – like her mother's pride in finally saving enough money to buy a home when Harris was in high school – with stories about her work as California's attorney general pursuing predatory lenders and holding out for a larger settlement from the big banks after the foreclosure crisis.\\n\\nNoting her self-doubt during that period as California held out for what ultimately became a $20 billion settlement, Harris recalled a tart message from then-Gov. Jerry Brown – I hope you know what you're doing – as well as a tense meeting with top officials at the big banks who seemed to be under the misimpression that I could be bullied into submission, she writes.\\n\\nIn one dramatic moment, she describes how she engaged in a shouting match with Jamie Dimon, the chairman and CEO of JPMorgan Chase.\\n\\nI was tired of feeling caged, of talking through lawyers and other intermediaries in endless obfuscation, Harris writes of her decision to call Dimon directly. I took off my earrings (the Oakland in me) and picked up the receiver.\\n\\n 'You're trying to steal from my shareholders!' he yelled, almost as soon as he heard my voice. I gave it right back, Harris writes.\\n\\n 'Your shareholders? Your shareholders? My shareholders are the homeowners of California! You come and see them. Talk to them about who got robbed.' It stayed at that level for a while. We were like dogs in a fight. A member of my senior team later recalled thinking, 'This was either a really good or a colossally bad idea.'  (The settlement was reached two weeks later).\\n\\nIn a series of stories, Harris explains how the people she met as a prosecutor, and later as attorney general, steered her agenda in the Senate toward criminal justice revisions, legal protections for immigrants, boosting wages for the middle class and advocating for universal health care and for lowering the cost of prescription drugs.\\n\\nShe notes a career high point in performing gay weddings in California after the Supreme Court struck down Proposition 8, the 2008 California ballot measure that prohibited marriages for same-sex couples. (Like Brown, who served as attorney general before her, Harris refused to defend Proposition 8 in the courts).\\n\\nWalking out of the Supreme Court after watching oral arguments in the case, Harris notes that day underscored her rationale for becoming a lawyer: It was in the courtroom, I believed, that you could translate that passion into action and precedent and law.\\n\\nThe most interesting passages of the book often tie back to Harris' family heritage and the values instilled in her by her mother, who separated from Harris' father when she was young.\\n\\nHarris describes her focus on immigration as a senator – including her efforts to drill Trump officials like former Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly on protections for recipients of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program and children crossing the border – as being shaped by watching her mother's experience of being a target as an immigrant in America.\\n\\nI saw it, and it made me mad, Harris writes. I have too many memories of my brilliant mother, a breast cancer researcher who migrated from India to go to graduate school, being treated as though she were dumb because of her accent. Memories of her being followed around a department store with suspicion, because surely a brown-skinned woman like her couldn't afford the dress or the blouse she had chosen.\\n\\nAt times, Harris reveals a more vulnerable side that she rarely shows in public. She notes, for example, her shock and horror when she failed the California Bar on her first try, and how she almost didn't notice that her now-husband was proposing marriage because she was so caught up in what she calls the balancing act of the working woman.\\n\\nShe describes her nervousness changing into jeans and Chuck Taylors before she was introduced to her stepson and stepdaughter. She explains the Momala descriptor on her Twitter handle as the name she and the kids settled on because of their dislike of the word stepmom.\\n\\nThere are also relatable moments when she describes her anguish at missing sports matches and family milestones as she tried to balance her home life with her job in Washington.\\n\\nFor now, she writes that her centering ritual is the tradition of a Sunday gathering of friends and family.\\n\\nAs long as I'm making Sunday family dinner, she writes, I know I'm in control of my life."}

Many have resigned and others are still considering it.\\n\\nOn Monday, after an extended period of silence, Trump and Pence spoke for the first time after a deadly riot of Trump supporters broke out at the US Capitol with Pence inside, according to two administration officials.\\n\\nA senior administration official told CNN they met in the Oval Office, had what was described as a good conversation and discussed the week ahead while reflecting on the last four years of the administration's work and accomplishments.\\n\\nThey reiterated that those who broke the law and stormed the Capitol last week do not represent the America First movement backed by 75 million Americans, and pledged to continue the work on behalf of the country for the remainder of their term, the senior official said.\\n\\nTrump had spent the weekend largely in isolation, as aides either distanced themselves from him or limited their time in his presence. Trump canceled a planned trip to Camp David, where his closest aides were hoping he would get into a good mindset ahead of his final stretch in office. Instead, he spent the weekend stewing to his deputy chief of staff, Dan Scavino, and entered his final full week angrier than ever.\\n\\nPence finally got a glimpse of POTUS' vindictiveness, one source familiar with the situation said, using the acronym for President of the United States.\\n\\nTrump's treatment of a man who served him faithfully for more than four years outraged those in Pence's orbit -- but also many in Trump's, who view Pence as the most loyal of lieutenants whose treatment they regarded as deeply unfair. And while Pence now appears unlikely to entertain invoking the 25th Amendment to remove Trump from office, he has not weighed in on it publicly, allowing the idea to persist, which people close to him described as intentional.\\n\\nPence, who is often internally mocked for how deferential he is toward Trump, has taken a quiet but defiant stance in their final days in office. One source close to the vice president said Pence is hoping to spend his remaining days in office telegraphing to our allies and adversaries that we have a fully functioning government.\\n\\nAfter the two men spoke Monday, a source close to the vice president told CNN's Jim Acosta that Pence's advisers are trying to cool the temperature with Trump after their initial outcry.\\n\\nThe feeling is we made our point, the source said.\\n\\nBroken bond\\n\\nThe mob event, and Trump's fury at Pence in the lead-up to it, left their relationship in tatters. Before their Oval Office meeting Monday, the pair had not spoken since before Trump's rally on the Ellipse last week. Their last conversation was punctuated by a vulgarity the President uttered after Pence informed him, for a final time, that he could not unilaterally reject the results of the election, something he had already told Trump in previous meetings that often dragged on for hours.\\n\\nOn several occasions, Trump had sent a random assortment of lawyers, such as Jenna Ellis, to the vice president to explain, in his mind, that he could disrupt the results process.\\n\\nThe final conversation left Trump irate, and his anger emerged during the rally itself, when he told the crowd he hoped Mike has the courage to do what he has to do and ignores the stupid people that he's listening to.\\n\\nIt was the first time in their more than four years as political partners that Trump's vengeance had been trained on a man known mostly for his fealty. Even as others once close to Trump -- from his personal attorney Michael Cohen to his first attorney general, Jeff Sessions, to any manner of former aides -- met similar fates, Pence was spared.\\n\\nThe turn of events has left Pence shaken and caused him to exclaim in anger to a fellow Republican: After all the things I've done for (Trump)!\\n\\nPence also recently learned that pro-Trump attorney Sidney Powell was involved in the lawsuit filed by Trump's Republican allies against him. Trump was not only aware, but had encouraged the effort, people close to the situation said.\\n\\nEven when the President returned to the White House while his crowd set off for the Capitol, Trump's anger at Pence did not abate. And as the crowd broke down doors, mobbed the building, and in some cases appeared to be hunting Pence himself, Trump remained focused on the perceived disloyalty.\\n\\nThe threats against Pence have not been limited to the particular actions of the rioters on Wednesday. Pence's staff has received two threatening emails sent to an internal distribution list from an outside sender in the past days, both before and after the insurrection attempt at the Capitol on Wednesday, according to a White House official. Pence himself is not on the distribution list.\\n\\nPence's office declined to comment on the threatening emails sent to the staff distribution list. On Saturday, deputy press secretary Judd Deere said the White House strongly condemn(s) all calls to violence, including those against any member of this administration.\\n\\nAfter Wednesday's events, Pence allies were aghast the President did not call to ensure the vice president's safety, or the safety of his wife and daughter, who had accompanied him as he performed the ceremonial role of overseeing the Electoral College tally. Pence's brother, Rep. Greg Pence, an Indiana Republican, was also inside. Instead, the President was trying to phone Republican allies to convince them to persist in their futile rejection of the election results.\\n\\nWas he concerned at all that an angry mob that he commanded to march on the Capitol might injure the vice president or his family? a person familiar with the matter asked.\\n\\nInside the besieged Capitol, it was Pence and not Trump who coordinated phone calls with law enforcement and security agencies. Afterward, Pence phoned the family of the fallen Capitol Police officer, Brian Sicknick, even as Trump remained silent. And after Trump finally conceded he would not serve another term in office, it is Pence who will attend President-elect Joe Biden's inauguration while Trump says he will boycott it.\\n\\nPence's actions earned him praise within the administration, including from national security adviser Robert O'Brien, who tweeted on Wednesday that Pence is a genuinely fine and decent man. He exhibited courage today.\\n\\nPending impeachment\\n\\nDemocrats, however, remain frustrated at Pence's unwillingness to move on the 25th Amendment, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. She and Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer made an unsuccessful attempt to phone the vice president to discuss the matter last week, but were placed on hold with a military aide for 20 minutes before being told Pence wasn't available.\\n\\nI was at home, so I was running the dishwasher, putting my clothes in the laundry. We're still waiting for him to return the call, Pelosi said Sunday on CBS News' 60 Minutes.\\n\\nOther Democrats are skeptical that after four years of standing by Trump -- including through his attempts to cast doubt on the election results using false claims of voter fraud -- Pence can recover his moral standing now.\\n\\nAll of us, including Speaker Pelosi, will prefer that Donald Trump simply do the right thing and resign, or that Vice President Pence actually shows some spine, at least for himself and his own family, and invoke the 25th Amendment, Rep. Ted Lieu said on CNN Newsroom on Sunday.\\n\\nA day later, an attempt by House Democrats to bring up a resolution urging Pence to invoke the 25th Amendment to remove Trump from power was blocked by Republicans. If that resolution ends up failing, Democrats plan to to vote Wednesday to impeach Trump for his role in the Capitol riot.\\n\\nOn Saturday, a source close to the vice president told CNN that Pence had not ruled out entirely an effort to invoke the 25th Amendment, and wants to preserve the option in case Trump becomes more unstable. But he hasn't held discussions on the issue with members of the Cabinet, and still appears unlikely to move forward with it.\\n\\nInstead, Pence and his advisers seem to be looking toward their final week in office with an eye toward his legacy, hoping to tout the administration's achievements. Advisers have been encouraging Trump to hold similar events, including on Middle East diplomacy and deregulation, but it's unclear whether he will agree to do so as he remains consumed with his permanent suspension on Twitter.\\n\\nLast week, second lady Karen Pence was looking at available homes for rent in Virginia, according to a source familiar with her schedule.\\n\\nAdvisers have said Pence hopes to provide a bridge to the next administration and do as much as possible to assist Biden's team in preparing for dealing with the coronavirus pandemic. Pence and Biden consulted regularly in the early days of the Trump administration, including on foreign policy matters.\\n\\nOn Monday, Pence's schedule listed a coronavirus task force meeting -- one of the final times the group meets before the end of the administration. Pence did not bring up the siege at the Capitol during the discussion, a person close to the task force said.\\n\\nTrump, meanwhile, had nothing on his schedule."}

Like, financially, depend on you?\\n\\nNo?\\n\\nThen you're probably fine without life insurance.\\n\\nOf course, there are certain circumstances in which a single person with no one financially dependent upon them would need life insurance.\\n\\nBut, generally, financial advisers say young, single, childless folks can focus on paying down debts and building up savings first.\\n\\nIf, however, you have a spouse or children, you need to think seriously about what their lives will look like if you die and they discover there's no backup plan.\\n\\nHere's how much life insurance you'll need to take care of them.\\n\\nDo you even need life insurance?\\n\\nEven if you don't have kids, you may still need some insurance, says Cliff Wilson, an insurance agent in the Phoenix area and former chair of LifeHappens.org.\\n\\nPerhaps you run your own company? You should have life insurance (your employees are counting on you). Or you could have massive debts you don't want to saddle your parents with when you're gone.\\n\\nMaybe you're a young and single financial overachiever making maximum contributions to your retirement account and sitting on a fully-funded emergency account -- go ahead get life insurance.\\n\\nThe price will be driven down by the two things you've got going for you (besides being on top of your financial game): you're definitely younger and probably healthier now than you will be later.\\n\\nSo while it may not be necessary, if it's within your means why not help out your family members to cover your funeral costs and go through a grieving process without worry?\\n\\nCalculating your family's needs\\n\\nOne guideline about how much life insurance you need is to calculate 10 times your yearly income.\\n\\nBut Wilson cautions against such generalities. I stay away from rules of thumb, he says. There is a lot of information that has to be taken into account like your income, your debt, any businesses, the number of children, if there's credit card debt, mortgages.\\n\\nEstimates based on income also don't give much guidance to people who are not employed. Particularly a parent who primarily cares for children. That parent needs life insurance, too, so that -- at the very least -- the surviving parent can cover the childcare and home maintenance costs that had been provided for free.\\n\\nTo get to your specific number for the amount of life insurance you should have, you'll need to calculate how much your family will need at the time of your death.\\n\\nHere's the formula: take your family's debt obligations left behind and cash needs going forward then subtract the assets you have.\\n\\nDebt obligations take into account things like mortgages and other debts. They also include outstanding credit card, personal loan or auto loan debts. These costs should be known now.\\n\\nBut there are also debt obligations that may be unknown. You'll need to estimate any future education costs and to account for final expenses like medical bills, funeral and estate-settling costs that you leave behind.\\n\\nThe other part of getting to the number of what your family needs, is to determine their cash-flow needs to sustain the household going forward.\\n\\nHere's where your income -- that your family will lose upon your death -- comes in.\\n\\nThe higher your income, the higher your responsibilities and typically the higher your spending, says Wilson. Consequently, the more insurance you'll need to cover its loss.\\n\\nOffsetting needs with assets\\n\\nBut, the good thing is you have assets. You have liquid assets, right?\\n\\nWhat you have available to go toward your family's ongoing expenses -- in cash savings, college savings or other life insurance -- should be subtracted from their needs.\\n\\nHere's a back-of-the-envelope example. You earn $50,000 a year and are married with 5-year-old and 3-year-old children. You and your spouse owe $100,000 on your mortgage and carry $15,000 of debt on your car and credit cards. You're looking to get a 15-year life insurance policy that will cover you until your youngest is out of high school.\\n\\nYou'll take those obligations together with $750,000 in income replacement ($50,000 for 15 years), $200,000 for the anticipated cost of two college educations and $9,000, the average cost of a funeral.\\n\\nThat's a grand total of $1.074 million.\\n\\nFrom that you're going to subtract what you already have going on.\\n\\nMaybe you have $15,000 in college savings, $30,000 in cash savings and a $100,000 group life insurance policy through your job (up to two times your $50,000 salary). Those are your assets.\\n\\nThat leaves you with life insurance needs of around $929,000.\\n\\nYou'll need to conduct your own calculations. Your spouse's earnings, taxes, earnings from investments and inflation also play a part. Fill in your own numbers using the calculators at LifeHappens.org.\\n\\nIt is important to protect our families and the people who depend on us, says Wilson. Most everyone is responsible and loving, they just don't act because they think they can put off until later."}

We know it's bad, but because comprehensive data isn't being collected, we don't know exactly how bad it is.\\n\\nDefeating this pandemic begins with understanding the extent of the problem, and that starts with addressing the alarming shortage of comprehensive data from state and federal prisons and local jails.

{"original": "President Barack Obama helps give out books at Leckie Elementary School while celebrating Martin Luther King Day January 18, 2016 in Washington, DC.\\n\\nStory highlights President Barack Obama's education department appears to have rushed to adopt new regulations The regulation would increase federal control over spending at many of the nation's school districts Donald Trump's pick for secretary of Education testifies Tuesday in the Senate\\n\\n(CNN) —\\n\\nThe Obama administration is considering a major last-minute policy shift that could force hundreds of school districts to cut spending at well-financed elementary and secondary schools and move nearly $1 billion dollars to schools with large numbers of low-income students.\\n\\nThe policy, written by the Department of Education, is under review by the White House budget office and has drawn fierce opposition from Republican lawmakers and school administrators.\\n\\nIt was first proposed in September, but the department appears to have rushed to adopt it since Donald Trump won the presidential election. Adopting the regulation before Friday at noon would bind the incoming Trump administration unless Congress overturns it.\\n\\nRepublicans on Capitol Hill have pledged to oppose many midnight regulations from the Obama White House, and the issue could also come up at the nomination hearing Tuesday for Donald Trump's secretary of education, Betsy DeVos.\\n\\nThe regulation would dramatically increase federal control over spending at many of the nation's 14,000 school districts and force some districts to increase spending at low-income schools.\\n\\nDistricts could achieve the increase by diverting money – a total of $800 million nationwide – from more-affluent schools, or by spending an additional $2.2 billion in state and local funds, the Education Department says.\\n\\nThe regulation would apply only to school districts that have both low-income schools that get Title I federal funds and higher-income schools that are not eligible for the money.\\n\\nIf this were to be finalized, it would be a huge deal because it's saying how local and state money inside school districts is to be distributed across schools, said Nora Gordon, a school-finance expert at Georgetown University.\\n\\nScott Sargrad, a former Education Department official, said the regulation could significantly improve achievement for students in low-income schools.\\n\\nThis is the federal government explicitly saying poor students need to have at least the same resources as their higher-income counterparts. That's a significant step for the federal government to say that, said Sargrad, who is now an education policy expert at Center for American Progress, a liberal Washington think tank.\\n\\nBut opponents including Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tennessee, say federal law does not give the administration the authority to enact such a far-reaching regulation.\\n\\nAlexander, chairman of the Senate education committee and a former secretary of education, has vowed to block the regulation – a move that would require a majority vote in both houses of Congress and the President's signature.\\n\\nCongress could also effectively stymie the regulation by denying the department funding to implement it.\\n\\nThe National School Boards Association called the regulation unnecessary and unwarranted federal overreach that would constrain school districts.\\n\\nMoving quickly\\n\\nAfter accepting public comments for 60 days, until early November, the department took just four weeks to send a final version of the regulation to the White House budget office for review.\\n\\nDepartments and agencies typically take at least several months – and sometimes years – to write a final rule after receiving public comments.\\n\\nThey've been pushing this rule pretty hard, said Nat Malkus, an education-policy expert at the conservative American Enterprise Institute.\\n\\nThe budget office has given no indication of when and if it will approve the regulation. The Education Department has not released its final version, although experts expect it will closely resemble the initial proposal.\\n\\nDepartment spokeswoman Dorie Nolt would say only that the agency is still working on the final rule.\\n\\nStudents at low-income schools shortchanged\\n\\nEducation Secretary John B. King Jr. has championed the regulation as a way of improving education for low-income students by requiring school districts spend the same amount of state and local dollars at their low-income schools as they do at higher-income schools.\\n\\nAn Education Department study in 2011 found many low-income schools were receiving less in per-pupil funding than their higher-income counterparts in the same district.\\n\\nThe department says that 3.3 million of the nation's 50 million public-school students attend low-income schools that receive less money per pupil than higher-income schools in the same district. As a result, the department says, nearly 6,000 low-income schools are shortchanged by about $440,000 a year.\\n\\nIn announcing the proposal in August, King called it an important step forward to advancing resource equity across the country. King also urged districts and states to comply with the regulation by providing additional funds for education focused on high-needs schools, not by shifting dollars around or forcing transfers of teachers or other personnel.\\n\\nThe regulation interprets a small section of a 400-page education law enacted in December 2015 whose main goal is to increase local control over education standards, school curriculums and standardized testing.\\n\\nThe law was sponsored by Sen. Alexander and received broad bipartisan support. It reverses parts of the No Child Left Behind Act, and requires, for example, that states consider more than just test scores in evaluating schools.\\n\\nThe section of the 2015 act currently in question concerns the longstanding policy that requires school districts to use Title I education funds only to supplement state and local funding and not in place of those funds. Until now, the policy has stopped short of requiring school districts to spend the same money per pupil in Title I schools and in non-Title I schools.\\n\\nThe Education Department has said that 90 percent of the nation's school districts do not have substantial funding disparities between low-income and high-income schools, and would not need to adjust funding.\\n\\nBut Gordon, the Georgetown expert, said the new rule would affect even those school districts that do not need to make immediate funding changes.\\n\\nAnything they're thinking about doing, like opening a special arts program in a school, they would need to make sure they're still in compliance, Gordon said. It really could inhibit innovation in districts because they'd worry about falling out of compliance."}

{"original": "North Korea: The cost of conflict\\n\\nBy Andrew Demaria\\n\\nCNN\\n\\n\\n\\n(CNN) -- When U.S. President George W. Bush met with South Korean President Kim Dae-jung last October, he was reportedly taken aback by a horrific scenario.\\n\\nAny conflict with North Korea, Bush was warned, would wreak enormous casualties in South Korea.\\n\\nNorth Korea has thousands of artillery pieces and hundreds of missiles within striking range of Seoul, the South Korean capital that is home to more than 10 million people and many of the 37,000 U.S. troops stationed in the country.\\n\\nThe potential damage and casualties would be unthinkable, the U.S. president was told.\\n\\nWith Seoul less than 80 kilometers (50 miles) from the Demilitarized Zone that separates North and South Korea, U.S. military planners have had a difficult task in constructing a blueprint for any possible conflict with Pyongyang.\\n\\nA simple looks at the numbers shows that any military campaign against North Korea would be a grim and daunting prospect.\\n\\nFirepower\\n\\nAt more than a million men under arms, North Korea's army is one of the largest in the world.\\n\\nA massive seventy percent of this force is stationed within 150 km of the border, equipped with an estimated 8,000 artillery units and over 1,000 tanks.\\n\\nMuch of it is well-fortified, underground or bunkered down. Added to that are hundreds of rocket launchers, capable of delivering chemical payloads.\\n\\nElsewhere, it has over 500 combat aircraft, 200 helicopters and dozens of submarines among its arsenal and a total military budget expenditure of over $5 billion annually -- equal to a little over 30 percent of North Korea's gross domestic product, according to CIA figures.\\n\\nBut with the North Korean economy in dire straits, doubt exists over the war-worthiness of its defenses and its true military capability.\\n\\nThough North Korea has made noises it has made no plans to attack the South, rather its beef is with America, analysts believe that in the event of war the North would almost certainly strike southwards.\\n\\nThe initial onslaught would begin with a massive barrage of artillery, missiles and rockets combined with the extensive use of Special Forces soldiers, U.S. assessments indicate.\\n\\nNorth Korea also possesses several hundred Scud-variant missiles that can also carry chemical weapons that could easily reach South Korean targets.\\n\\nIt also has around 100 longer-range No Dong missiles capable of hitting Japan and is working on another missile capable of striking the continental United States.\\n\\nWhile chemical weapons are believed to be at the forefront of any North Korean missile or artillery strike, a major fear is Pyongyang's nuclear capability and its willingness to employ it.\\n\\nThe CIA thinks North Korea has enough material to have constructed one or two crude nuclear bombs though a method of delivery is unknown.\\n\\nAdd to the equation the ruthlessness of Kim Jong Il's forces and harsh terrain, and a conflict with North Korea proves a difficult vision to entertain.\\n\\nCasualties\\n\\nNorth Korea's military strength and its proximity to Seoul make it a more formidable adversary than Iraq\\n\\nWhen the U.S. drew up plans for a possible military action against North Korea in 1993 -- again over its suspected nuclear weapons program -- a Pentagon estimate suggested four months of high-intensity combat would be required, using more than 600,000 South Korean troops and half a million U.S. reinforcements to the personnel already stationed in South Korea.\\n\\nIn 1994, advisers to then President Bill Clinton predicted 52,000 U.S. casualties in the first 90 days of combat alone, Don Oberdorfer, a former Washington Post reporter, wrote in his book The Two Koreas.\\n\\nTo put that figure in perspective, 55,000 U.S. military personnel were killed in the 1950-53 Korean War, and about 58,000 in the 1957-75 Vietnam War.\\n\\nSome estimates went as far as forecasting a million casualties, not to mention economic damages and war-related costs that ran into trillions of dollars.\\n\\nNow, the casualty estimates are higher, with North Korea's massive firepower moving closer to U.S. and South Korean forces stationed on the border.\\n\\nTo wage a campaign against North Korea would require hundreds of thousands of extra U.S. troops.\\n\\nThat's a tough demand -- despite Washington's claims to be able to fight two separate conflicts simultaneously -- given the military build up in the Persian Gulf and ongoing operations in Afghanistan.\\n\\nLack of options\\n\\nSouth Korean troops pass a K1 battle tank along its side of the DMZ\\n\\nThis lack of military options is at the forefront in Washington's pursuit of diplomatic efforts in trying to resolve the current nuclear standoff with Pyongyang.\\n\\nThe U.S. has categorically said it has no intentions of taking any military action against North Korea.\\n\\nFor its part, Pyongyang has been seeking a non-aggression treaty from Washington -- a pledge from the U.S. not to attack.\\n\\nAny strike, no matter how covert or pin-point should the U.S. choose to hit one of North Korea's nuclear facilities runs the risk of pushing the standoff into a full-scale war.\\n\\nOn Sunday, National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice rejected comments from South Korean President-elect Roh Moo-hyun who said some officials in Washington were talking about striking North Korea.\\n\\nBush decided for diplomacy over force at the very beginning of the confrontation with North Korea, Rice said.\\n\\nRoh has since backpedaled from the remarks, saying he had been misunderstood and was referring instead to media accounts of Washington's policy towards the situation.\\n\\nThe president-elect added he was well aware the U.S. had no intentions to attack the North.\\n\\nRoh, a backer of his predecessors so-called 'Sunshine Policy' of engagement with Pyongyang, is no doubt also well aware of the consequences of any conflict.\\n\\nThe frightening image of a smoldering Seoul, and a Korean Peninsula once again engulfed by war, will be weighing heavily on his mind."}

BROWN/AFP via Getty Images)\\n\\n(CNN Business) —\\n\\nFederal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell says he would not resign if pressured to do so by President Donald Trump.\\n\\nNo, Powell answered simply, when asked Friday morning during a panel at the annual American Economics Association conference alongside former Fed chairs Janet Yellen and Ben Bernanke.\\n\\nTrump has repeatedly criticized Powell for continuing to tighten monetary policy, saying on Twitter that it's the only problem with the economy. The President has also asked advisers amid increasing market volatility in recent weeks whether he can fire Powell.\\n\\nIt's unclear whether presidents legally can fire Fed chairs, whom they appoint for four-year terms. Trump chose Powell in 2017 to succeed Yellen, bucking the practice of reappointing Fed chairs to second terms.\\n\\nTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who supported Powell's appointment, tweeted in late December that Trump had never suggested firing Powell and did not believe he had the power to do so.\\n\\nOnstage in Atlanta on Friday, Powell said Trump had not directly expressed dissatisfaction to him, and that he has no plans to meet with Trump. White House aides have floated the idea of inviting the former investment banker to sit with the President in person to allay Trump's concerns.\\n\\nMeetings between presidents and Fed chairs do happen, but nothing's been scheduled, Powell told moderator Neil Irwin, an economics reporter for the New York Times.\\n\\nBoth Yellen and Bernanke spoke about the importance of insulating monetary policy decisions from political concerns in order to reassure investors that rate changes are solidly grounded in economic data.\\n\\nPresidents Lyndon Johnson and Richard Nixon tangled with their Fed chairs, but more recently American leaders have refrained from commenting on policy decisions.\\n\\nObviously the president has the right to comment on the Fed, Yellen said. But I would worry that if it continues or intensifies, it could undermine confidence in the Fed.\\n\\nPowell jumped in again to reiterate that the Fed would not be swayed by comments from the President or any other politician.\\n\\nWe are committed to achieving the goals that the law gives us, based on the best thinking, he said. It's very much in the DNA of the Fed. We have a strong culture. It's not a fragile one, it's not subject to being disrupted, and I would want the public to have confidence in that.\\n\\nThe Federal Reserve raised rates in December and has signaled that it would be open to considering rate changes in 2019, even amid signs that the global economy is starting to slow."}

{"original": "Transcript: Bush, Kerry debate domestic policies\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTEMPE, Arizona (CNN) -- The following is a running transcript of the final debate between President George W. Bush and Sen. John Kerry held Wednesday night at Arizona State University.\\n\\nCBS News anchor Bob Schieffer moderated the debate that focused on domestic policy.\\n\\nAll answers are linked to the questions in the box to the right.\\n\\nQuestion 1: Will our children be as safe as we were?\\n\\nSCHIEFFER: Gentleman, welcome to you both.\\n\\nBy coin toss, the first question goes to Sen. Kerry.\\n\\nSenator, I want to set the stage for this discussion by asking the question that I think hangs over all of our politics today and is probably on the minds of many people watching this debate tonight.\\n\\nAnd that is, will our children and grandchildren ever live in a world as safe and secure as the world in which we grew up?\\n\\nKERRY: Well, first of all, Bob, thank you for moderating tonight.\\n\\nThank you, Arizona State, for welcoming us.\\n\\nAnd thank you to the Presidential Commission for undertaking this enormous task. We're proud to be here.\\n\\nMr. President, I'm glad to be here with you again to share similarities and differences with the American people.\\n\\nWill we ever be safe and secure again? Yes. We absolutely must be. That's the goal.\\n\\nNow, how do we achieve it is the most critical component of it.\\n\\nI believe that this president, regrettably, rushed us into a war, made decisions about foreign policy, pushed alliances away. And, as a result, America is now bearing this extraordinary burden where we are not as safe as we ought to be.\\n\\nThe measurement is not: Are we safer? The measurement is: Are we as safe as we ought to be? And there are a host of options that this president had available to him, like making sure that at all our ports in America containers are inspected. Only 95 percent of them -- 95 percent come in today uninspected. That's not good enough.\\n\\nPeople who fly on airplanes today, the cargo hold is not X-rayed, but the baggage is. That's not good enough. Firehouses don't have enough firefighters in them. Police officers are being cut from the streets of America because the president decided to cut the COPS program.\\n\\nSo we can do a better job of homeland security. I can do a better job of waging a smarter, more effective war on terror and guarantee that we will go after the terrorists.\\n\\nI will hunt them down, and we'll kill them, we'll capture them. We'll do whatever is necessary to be safe.\\n\\nBut I pledge this to you, America: I will do it in the way that Franklin Roosevelt and Ronald Reagan and John Kennedy and others did, where we build the strongest alliances, where the world joins together, where we have the best intelligence and where we are able, ultimately, to be more safe and secure.\\n\\nSCHIEFFER: Mr. President, you have 90 seconds.\\n\\nBUSH: Thank you very much.\\n\\nI want to thank Arizona State as well.\\n\\nYes, we can be safe and secure, if we stay on the offense against the terrorists and if we spread freedom and liberty around the world.\\n\\nI have got a comprehensive strategy to not only chase down the al Qaeda, wherever it exists -- and we're making progress; three-quarters of al Qaeda leaders have been brought to justice -- but to make sure that countries that harbor terrorists are held to account.\\n\\nAs a result of securing ourselves and ridding the Taliban out of Afghanistan, the Afghan people had elections this weekend. And the first voter was a 19-year-old woman. Think about that. Freedom is on the march.\\n\\nWe held to account a terrorist regime in Saddam Hussein.\\n\\nIn other words, in order to make sure we're secure, there must be a comprehensive plan.\\n\\nMy opponent just this weekend talked about how terrorism could be reduced to a nuisance, comparing it to prostitution, illegal gambling.\\n\\nI think that attitude and that point of view is dangerous. I don't think you can secure America for the long run if you don't have a comprehensive view as to how to defeat these people.\\n\\nAt home, we'll do everything we can to protect the homeland. I signed the homeland security bill to better align our assets and resources. My opponent voted against it.\\n\\nWe're doing everything we can to protect our borders and ports.\\n\\nBut absolutely we can be secure in the long run. It just takes good, strong leadership.\\n\\nSCHIEFFER: Anything to add, Senator Kerry?\\n\\nKERRY: Yes. When the president had an opportunity to capture or kill Osama bin Laden, he took his focus off of them, outsourced the job to Afghan warlords, and Osama bin Laden escaped.\\n\\nSix months after he said Osama bin Laden must be caught dead or alive, this president was asked, Where is Osama bin Laden?\\n\\nHe said, I don't know. I don't really think about him very much. I'm not that concerned.\\n\\nWe need a president who stays deadly focused on the real war on terror.\\n\\nSCHIEFFER: Mr. President?\\n\\nBUSH: Gosh, I just don't think I ever said I'm not worried about Osama bin Laden. It's kind of one of those exaggerations.\\n\\nOf course we're worried about Osama bin Laden. We're on the hunt after Osama bin Laden. We're using every asset at our disposal to get Osama bin Laden.\\n\\nMy opponent said this war is a matter of intelligence and law enforcement. No, this war is a matter of using every asset at our disposal to keep the American people protected.\\n\\n(Back to top)\\n\\nQuestion 2: How did the U.S. end up with a flu vaccine shortage?\\n\\nSCHIEFFER: New question, Mr. President, to you.\\n\\nWe are talking about protecting ourselves from the unexpected, but the flu season is suddenly upon us. Flu kills thousands of people every year.\\n\\nSuddenly we find ourselves with a severe shortage of flu vaccine. How did that happen?\\n\\nBUSH: Bob, we relied upon a company out of England to provide about half of the flu vaccines for the United States citizen, and it turned out that the vaccine they were producing was contaminated. And so we took the right action and didn't allow contaminated medicine into our country.\\n\\nWe're working with Canada to hopefully -- that they'll produce a -- help us realize the vaccine necessary to make sure our citizens have got flu vaccinations during this upcoming season.\\n\\nMy call to our fellow Americans is if you're healthy, if you're younger, don't get a flu shot this year. Help us prioritize those who need to get the flu shot, the elderly and the young.\\n\\nThe CDC, responsible for health in the United States, is setting those priorities and is allocating the flu vaccine accordingly.\\n\\nI haven't gotten a flu shot, and I don't intend to because I want to make sure those who are most vulnerable get treated.\\n\\nWe have a problem with litigation in the United States of America. Vaccine manufacturers are worried about getting sued, and therefore they have backed off from providing this kind of vaccine.\\n\\nOne of the reasons I'm such a strong believer in legal reform is so that people aren't afraid of producing a product that is necessary for the health of our citizens and then end up getting sued in a court of law.\\n\\nBut the best thing we can do now, Bob, given the circumstances with the company in England is for those of us who are younger and healthy, don't get a flu shot.\\n\\nSCHIEFFER: Sen. Kerry?\\n\\nKERRY: This really underscores the problem with the American health-care system. It's not working for the American family. And it's gotten worse under President Bush over the course of the last years.\\n\\nFive million Americans have lost their health insurance in this country. You've got about a million right here in Arizona, just shy, 950,000, who have no health insurance at all. 82,000 Arizonians lost their health insurance under President Bush's watch. 223,000 kids in Arizona have no health insurance at all.\\n\\nAll across our country -- go to Ohio, 1.4 million Ohioans have no health insurance, 114,000 of them lost it under President Bush; Wisconsin, 82,000, Wisconsites lost it under President Bush.\\n\\nThis president has turned his back on the wellness of America. And there is no system. In fact, it's starting to fall apart not because of lawsuits -- though they are a problem, and John Edwards and I are committed to fixing them -- but because of the larger issue that we don't cover Americans.\\n\\nChildren across our country don't have health care. We're the richest country on the face of the planet, the only industrialized nation in the world not to do it.\\n\\nI have a plan to cover all Americans. We're going to make it affordable and accessible. We're going to let everybody buy into the same health-care plan senators and congressmen give themselves.\\n\\nSCHIEFFER: Mr. President, would you like to add something?\\n\\nBUSH: I would. Thank you.\\n\\nI want to remind people listening tonight that a plan is not a litany of complaints, and a plan is not to lay out programs that you can't pay for.\\n\\nHe just said he wants everybody to be able to buy in to the same plan that senators and congressmen get. That costs the government $7,700 per family. If every family in America signed up, like the senator suggested, [it] would cost us $5 trillion over 10 years.\\n\\nIt's an empty promise. It's called bait and switch.\\n\\nSCHIEFFER: Time's up.\\n\\nBUSH: Thank you.\\n\\nKERRY: Actually, it's not an empty promise.\\n\\nIt's really interesting, because the president used that very plan as a reason for seniors to accept his prescription drug plan. He said, if it's good enough for the congressmen and senators to have choice, seniors ought to have choice.\\n\\nWhat we do is we have choice. I choose Blue Cross/Blue Shield. Other senators, other congressmen choose other programs.\\n\\nBut the fact is, we're going to help Americans be able to buy into it. Those that can afford it are going to buy in themselves. We're not giving this away for nothing.\\n\\n(Back to top)\\n\\nQuestion 3: With rising costs, how do you keep from raising taxes?\\n\\nSCHIEFFER: All right.\\n\\nSen. Kerry, a new question. Let's talk about economic security. You pledged during the last debate that you would not raise taxes on those making less than $200,000 a year. But the price of everything is going up, and we all know it. Health care costs, as you all talking about, is skyrocketing, the cost of the war.\\n\\nMy question is, how can you or any president, whoever is elected next time, keep that pledge without running this country deeper into debt and passing on more of the bills that we're running up to our children?\\n\\nKERRY: I'll tell you exactly how I can do it: by reinstating what President Bush took away, which is called pay as you go.\\n\\nDuring the 1990s, we had pay-as-you-go rules. If you were going to pass something in the Congress, you had to show where you are going to pay for it and how.\\n\\nPresident Bush has taken -- he's the only president in history to do this.\\n\\nHe's also the only president in 72 years to lose jobs -- 1.6 million jobs lost. He's the only president to have incomes of families go down for the last three years; the only president to see exports go down; the only president to see the lowest level of business investment in our country as it is today.\\n\\nNow, I'm going to reverse that. I'm going to change that. We're going to restore the fiscal discipline we had in the 1990s.\\n\\nEvery plan that I have laid out -- my health-care plan, my plan for education, my plan for kids to be able to get better college loans -- I've shown exactly how I'm going to pay for those.\\n\\nAnd we start -- we don't do it exclusively -- but we start by rolling back George Bush's unaffordable tax cut for the wealthiest people, people earning more than $200,000 a year, and we pass, hopefully, the McCain-Kerry Commission which identified some $60 billion that we can get.\\n\\nWe shut the loophole which has American workers actually subsidizing the loss of their own job.\\n\\nThey just passed an expansion of that loophole in the last few days: $43 billion of giveaways, including favors to the oil and gas industry and the people importing ceiling fans from China.\\n\\nI'm going to stand up and fight for the American worker. And I am going to do it in a way that's fiscally sound. I show how I pay for the health care, how we pay for the education.\\n\\nI have a manufacturing jobs credit. We pay for it by shutting that loophole overseas. We raise the student loans. I pay for it by changing the relationship with the banks.\\n\\nThis president has never once vetoed one bill; the first president in a hundred years not to do that.\\n\\nSCHIEFFER: Mr. President?\\n\\nBUSH: Well, his rhetoric doesn't match his record.\\n\\n[He's] been a senator for 20 years. He voted to increase taxes 98 times. When they tried to reduce taxes, he voted against that 127 times.\\n\\nHe talks about being a fiscal conservative, or fiscally sound, but he voted over -- he voted 277 times to waive the budget caps, which would have cost the taxpayers $4.2 trillion.\\n\\nHe talks about PAY-GO. I'll tell you what PAY-GO means, when you're a senator from Massachusetts, when you're a colleague of Ted Kennedy, pay go means: You pay, and he goes ahead and spends.\\n\\nHe's proposed $2.2 trillion of new spending, and yet the so-called tax on the rich, which is also a tax on many small-business owners in America, raises $600 million by our account -- billion, $800 billion by his account.\\n\\nThere is a tax gap. And guess who usually ends up filling the tax gap? The middle class.\\n\\nI propose a detailed budget, Bob. I sent up my budget man to the Congress, and he says, here's how we're going to reduce the deficit in half by five years. It requires pro-growth policies that grow our economy and fiscal sanity in the halls of Congress.\\n\\n(Back to top)\\n\\nQuestion 4: What do you say to someone who lost his job?\\n\\nSCHIEFFER: Let's go to a new question, Mr. President. Two minutes. And let's continue on jobs.\\n\\nYou know, there are all kind of statistics out there, but I want to bring it down to an individual.\\n\\nMr. President, what do you say to someone in this country who has lost his job to someone overseas who's being paid a fraction of what that job paid here in the United States?\\n\\nBUSH: I'd say, Bob, I've got policies to continue to grow our economy and create the jobs of the 21st century. And here's some help for you to go get an education. Here's some help for you to go to a community college.\\n\\nWe've expanded trade adjustment assistance. We want to help pay for you to gain the skills necessary to fill the jobs of the 21st century.\\n\\nYou know, there's a lot of talk about how to keep the economy growing. We talk about fiscal matters. But perhaps the best way to keep jobs here in America and to keep this economy growing is to make sure our education system works.\\n\\nI went to Washington to solve problems. And I saw a problem in the public education system in America.\\n\\nThey were just shuffling too many kids through the system, year after year, grade after grade, without learning the basics.\\n\\nAnd so we said: Let's raise the standards. We're spending more money, but let's raise the standards and measure early and solve problems now, before it's too late.\\n\\nNo, education is how to help the person who's lost a job. Education is how to make sure we've got a workforce that's productive and competitive.\\n\\nGot four more years, I've got more to do to continue to raise standards, to continue to reward teachers and school districts that are working, to emphasize math and science in the classrooms, to continue to expand Pell Grants to make sure that people have an opportunity to start their career with a college diploma.\\n\\nAnd so the person you talked to, I say, here's some help, here's some trade adjustment assistance money for you to go a community college in your neighborhood, a community college which is providing the skills necessary to fill the jobs of the 21st century.\\n\\nAnd that's what I would say to that person.\\n\\nSCHIEFFER: Sen. Kerry?\\n\\nKERRY: I want you to notice how the president switched away from jobs and started talking about education principally.\\n\\nLet me come back in one moment to that, but I want to speak for a second, if I can, to what the president said about fiscal responsibility.\\n\\nBeing lectured by the president on fiscal responsibility is a little bit like Tony Soprano talking to me about law and order in this country.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nThis president has taken a $5.6 trillion surplus and turned it into deficits as far as the eye can see. Health-care costs for the average American have gone up 64 percent; tuitions have gone up 35 percent; gasoline prices up 30 percent; Medicare premiums went up 17 percent a few days ago; prescription drugs are up 12 percent a year.\\n\\nBut guess what, America? The wages of Americans have gone down. The jobs that are being created in Arizona right now are paying about $13,700 less than the jobs that we're losing.\\n\\nAnd the president just walks on by this problem. The fact is that he's cut job-training money. $1 billion was cut. They only added a little bit back this year because it's an election year.\\n\\nThey've cut the Pell Grants and the Perkins loans to help kids be able to go to college.\\n\\nThey've cut the training money. They've wound up not even extending unemployment benefits and not even extending health care to those people who are unemployed.\\n\\nI'm going to do those things, because that's what's right in America: Help workers to transition in every respect.\\n\\nQuestion 5: Is Bush entirely to blame for loss of jobs?\\n\\nSCHIEFFER: New question to you, Sen. Kerry, two minutes. And it's still on jobs.\\n\\nYou know, many experts say that a president really doesn't have much control over jobs. For example, if someone invents a machine that does the work of five people, that's progress. That's not the president's fault.\\n\\nSo I ask you, is it fair to blame the administration entirely for this loss of jobs?\\n\\nKERRY: I don't blame them entirely for it. I blame the president for the things the president could do that has an impact on it.\\n\\nOutsourcing is going to happen.\\n\\nI've acknowledged that in union halls across the country. I've had shop stewards stand up and say, Will you promise me you're going to stop all this outsourcing?\\n\\nAnd I've looked them in the eye and I've said, No, I can't do that.\\n\\nWhat I can promise you is that I will make the playing field as fair as possible, that I will, for instance, make certain that with respect to the tax system that you as a worker in America are not subsidizing the loss of your job.\\n\\nToday, if you're an American business, you actually get a benefit for going overseas. You get to defer your taxes.\\n\\nSo if you're looking at a competitive world, you say to yourself, Hey, I do better overseas than I do here in America.\\n\\nThat's not smart.\\n\\nI don't want American workers subsidizing the loss of their own job.\\n\\nAnd when I'm president, we're going to shut that loophole in a nanosecond and we're going to use that money to lower corporate tax rates in America for all corporations, 5 percent. And we're going to have a manufacturing jobs credit and a job hiring credit so we actually help people be able to hire here.\\n\\nThe second thing that we can do is provide a fair trade playing field. This president didn't stand up for Boeing when Airbus was violating international rules and subsidies. He discovered Boeing during the course of this campaign after I'd been talking about it for months.\\n\\nThe fact is that the president had an opportunity to stand up and take on China for currency manipulation. There are companies that wanted to petition the administration. They were told: Don't even bother; we're not going to listen to it.\\n\\nThe fact is that there have been markets shut to us that we haven't stood up and fought for.\\n\\nI'm going to fight for a fair trade playing field for the American worker. And I will fight for the American worker just as hard as I fight for my own job. That's what the American worker wants. And if we do that, we can have an impact.\\n\\nPlus, we need fiscal discipline. Restore fiscal discipline, we'll do a lot better.\\n\\nSCHIEFFER: Mr. President?\\n\\nBUSH: Whew!\\n\\nLet me start with the Pell Grants. In his last litany of misstatements he said we cut Pell Grants. We've increased Pell Grants by a million students. That's a fact.\\n\\nYou know, he talks to the workers. Let me talk to the workers.\\n\\nYou've got more money in your pocket as a result of the tax relief we passed and he opposed.\\n\\nIf you have a child, you got a $1,000 child credit. That's money in your pocket.\\n\\nIf you're married, we reduced the marriage penalty. The code ought to encourage marriage, not discourage marriage.\\n\\nWe created a 10 percent bracket to help lower-income Americans. A family of four making $40,000 received about $1,700 in tax relief.\\n\\nIt's your money. The way my opponent talks, he said, We're going to spend the government's money. No, we're spending your money. And when you have more money in your pocket, you're able to better afford things you want.\\n\\nI believe the role of government is to stand side by side with our citizens to help them realize their dreams, not tell citizens how to live their lives.\\n\\nMy opponent talks about fiscal sanity. His record in the United States Senate does not match his rhetoric.\\n\\nHe voted to increase taxes 98 times and to bust the budget 277 times.\\n\\nSCHIEFFER: Sen. Kerry?\\n\\nKERRY: Bob, anybody can play with these votes. Everybody knows that.\\n\\nI have supported or voted for tax cuts over 600 times. I broke with my party in order to balance the budget, and Ronald Reagan signed into law the tax cut that we voted for. I voted for IRA tax cuts. I voted for small-business tax cuts.\\n\\nBut you know why the Pell Grants have gone up in their numbers? Because more people qualify for them because they don't have money.\\n\\nBut they're not getting the $5,100 the president promised them. They're getting less money.\\n\\nWe have more people who qualify. That's not what we want.\\n\\nBUSH: Senator, no one's playing with your votes. You voted to increase taxes 98 times. When they voted -- when they proposed reducing taxes, you voted against it 126 times.\\n\\nHe voted to violate the budget cap 277 times. You know, there's a main stream in American politics and you sit right on the far left bank. As a matter of fact, your record is such that Ted Kennedy, your colleague, is the conservative senator from Massachusetts.\\n\\n(Back to top)\\n\\nQuestion 6: Do you believe homosexuality is a choice?\\n\\nSCHIEFFER: Mr. President, let's get back to economic issues. But let's shift to some other questions here.\\n\\nBoth of you are opposed to gay marriage. But to understand how you have come to that conclusion, I want to ask you a more basic question.\\n\\nDo you believe homosexuality is a choice?\\n\\nBUSH: You know, Bob, I don't know. I just don't know. I do know that we have a choice to make in America and that is to treat people with tolerance and respect and dignity. It's important that we do that.\\n\\nAnd I also know in a free society people, consenting adults can live the way they want to live.\\n\\nAnd that's to be honored.\\n\\nBut as we respect someone's rights, and as we profess tolerance, we shouldn't change -- or have to change -- our basic views on the sanctity of marriage.\\n\\nI believe in the sanctity of marriage. I think it's very important that we protect marriage as an institution, between a man and a woman.\\n\\nI proposed a constitutional amendment. The reason I did so was because I was worried that activist judges are actually defining the definition of marriage, and the surest way to protect marriage between a man and woman is to amend the Constitution.\\n\\nIt has also the benefit of allowing citizens to participate in the process. After all, when you amend the Constitution, state legislatures must participate in the ratification of the Constitution.\\n\\nI'm deeply concerned that judges are making those decisions and not the citizenry of the United States. You know, Congress passed a law called DOMA, the Defense of Marriage Act.\\n\\nMy opponent was against it. It basically protected states from the action of one state to another. It also defined marriage as between a man and woman.\\n\\nBut I'm concerned that that will get overturned. And if it gets overturned, then we'll end up with marriage being defined by courts, and I don't think that's in our nation's interests.\\n\\nSCHIEFFER: Sen. Kerry?\\n\\nKERRY: We're all God's children, Bob. And I think if you were to talk to Dick Cheney's daughter, who is a lesbian, she would tell you that she's being who she was, she's being who she was born as.\\n\\nI think if you talk to anybody, it's not choice. I've met people who struggled with this for years, people who were in a marriage because they were living a sort of convention, and they struggled with it.\\n\\nAnd I've met wives who are supportive of their husbands or vice versa when they finally sort of broke out and allowed themselves to live who they were, who they felt God had made them.\\n\\nI think we have to respect that.\\n\\nThe president and I share the belief that marriage is between a man and a woman. I believe that. I believe marriage is between a man and a woman.\\n\\nBut I also believe that because we are the United States of America, we're a country with a great, unbelievable Constitution, with rights that we afford people, that you can't discriminate in the workplace. You can't discriminate in the rights that you afford people.\\n\\nYou can't disallow someone the right to visit their partner in a hospital. You have to allow people to transfer property, which is why I'm for partnership rights and so forth.\\n\\nNow, with respect to DOMA and the marriage laws, the states have always been able to manage those laws. And they're proving today, every state, that they can manage them adequately.\\n\\n(Back to top)\\n\\nQuestion 7: How does Kerry handle criticism from Catholic archbishops?\\n\\nSCHIEFFER: Sen. Kerry, a new question for you.\\n\\nThe New York Times reports that some Catholic archbishops are telling their church members that it would be a sin to vote for a candidate like you because you support a woman's right to choose an abortion and unlimited stem-cell research.\\n\\nWhat is your reaction to that?\\n\\nKERRY: I respect their views. I completely respect their views. I am a Catholic. And I grew up learning how to respect those views. But I disagree with them, as do many.\\n\\nI believe that I can't legislate or transfer to another American citizen my article of faith. What is an article of faith for me is not something that I can legislate on somebody who doesn't share that article of faith.\\n\\nI believe that choice is a woman's choice. It's between a woman, God and her doctor. And that's why I support that.\\n\\nNow, I will not allow somebody to come in and change Roe v. Wade.\\n\\nThe president has never said whether or not he would do that. But we know from the people he's tried to appoint to the court he wants to.\\n\\nI will not. I will defend the right of Roe v. Wade.\\n\\nNow, with respect to religion, you know, as I said, I grew up a Catholic. I was an altar boy. I know that throughout my life this has made a difference to me.\\n\\nAnd as President Kennedy said when he ran for president, he said, I'm not running to be a Catholic president. I'm running to be a president who happens to be Catholic.\\n\\nMy faith affects everything that I do, in truth. There's a great passage of the Bible that says, What does it mean, my brother, to say you have faith if there are no deeds? Faith without works is dead.\\n\\nAnd I think that everything you do in public life has to be guided by your faith, affected by your faith, but without transferring it in any official way to other people.\\n\\nThat's why I fight against poverty. That's why I fight to clean up the environment and protect this earth.\\n\\nThat's why I fight for equality and justice. All of those things come out of that fundamental teaching and belief of faith.\\n\\nBut I know this, that President Kennedy in his inaugural address told all of us that here on Earth, God's work must truly be our own. And that's what we have to -- I think that's the test of public service.\\n\\nSCHIEFFER: Mr. President?\\n\\nBUSH: I think it's important to promote a culture of life. I think a hospitable society is a society where every being counts and every person matters.\\n\\nI believe the ideal world is one in which every child is protected in law and welcomed to life. I understand there's great differences on this issue of abortion, but I believe reasonable people can come together and put good law in place that will help reduce the number of abortions.\\n\\nTake, for example, the ban on partial birth abortion. It's a brutal practice. People from both political parties came together in the halls of Congress and voted overwhelmingly to ban that practice. It made a lot of sense. My opponent, in that he's out of the mainstream, voted against that law.\\n\\nWhat I'm saying is is that as we promote life and promote a culture of life, surely there are ways we can work together to reduce the number of abortions: continue to promote adoption laws -- it's a great alternative to abortion -- continue to fund and promote maternity group homes; I will continue to promote abstinence programs.\\n\\nThe last debate, my opponent said his wife was involved with those programs.

The airline says the new program allows flight attendants to take immediate action.\\n\\nWe wanted to provide this at the point of first contact, so that passengers don't have to file a complaint, said American spokesman Ross Feinstein. We want the customer to get off the plane feeling good about their experience. It makes the customers feel good and it makes the flight attendant feel good.\\n\\nFeinstein declined to say how many miles a passenger might receive.\\n\\nIt depends on what the issue is, and its severity, he said. It might be different for a cross-country flight than it would be for a short flight.\\n\\nThe flight attendants at American and Delta can award frequent flyer miles to the passengers using computer tablets they carry on every flight.\\n\\nRelated: Lands End is making new uniforms for American Airlines employees\\n\\nFeinstein said if passengers don't have a frequent flyer account, they can supply their email address in order to receive another form of compensation.\\n\\nDelta Air Lines (DAL) says it has had a program like that for five years, while United (UAL) and Southwest (LUV) did not reply to a request for comment.\\n\\nComplaints about airlines filed with the Department of Transportation were up 4% during the first three quarters of 2017, according to official government statistics.

{"original": "(CNN) Hospitals now have to disclose the rates they privately negotiate with insurers under a Trump administration rule that took effect Friday.\\n\\nWhile President Donald Trump has boasted that the historic measure will save patients money, health policy experts aren't so sure. And hospitals, which unsuccessfully fought the rule in court , say it's an extra burden on them while they are battling the coronavirus.\\n\\nThe effort stems from an executive order Trump issued in 2019. The administration argues that such price transparency will allow patients to shop for lower-priced medical services and help reduce health care costs overall -- one of the President's main promises during his campaigns and while in office.\\n\\nTransparency in medical pricing will be one of the biggest and most important things done for the American citizen, Trump said in a tweet Saturday. Enjoy all the extra money you will have.\\n\\nThe rule, which applies to about 6,000 hospitals, also requires them to provide in an online, searchable way the rates for 300 common services, such as X-rays, outpatient visits, Cesarean deliveries and lab tests. In addition, hospitals must disclose the amount they are willing to accept in cash.\\n\\nHospitals that don't comply will face a civil penalty of up to $300 a day. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services said it will start auditing hospitals this month.\\n\\nRule may mean more confusion for consumers\\n\\nHowever, the industry argues that the disclosure could actually confuse patients, rather than inform them. It does not tell consumers what out-of-pocket charges they may face since the posted rates don't account for a patient's personal deductible or copay requirements.\\n\\nThe American Hospital Association last month wrote to the Joe Biden transition team asking the incoming administration to exercise discretion in enforcing compliance with the rule and to evaluate whether it should be rescinded.\\n\\nWhichever way that issue is resolved in consultation with your administration, now is not the time to heap these requirements on hospitals that need to keep their focus and resources devoted to caring for patients and administering vaccines, wrote Richard Pollack, the association's chief executive officer.\\n\\nSome health policy experts doubt the rule will reduce costs or save patients' money. The theory is that patients will visit the hospital websites and choose lower-priced options, which will lead to competition in the US health care system and drive prices down.\\n\\nTo date, the evidence is that that does not work, said Ateev Mehrotra, an associate professor of health policy at Harvard Medical School who has studied price transparency efforts.\\n\\nWhen insurers have provided pricing tools -- with more personalized cost information -- few people have used them.\\n\\nAlso, it will likely be difficult for consumers to use hospitals' pricing lists since there can be multiple medical codes involved for each service, such as an X-ray or MRI, he said.\\n\\nInsurers must disclose out-of-pocket costs in 2023\\n\\nA separate rule, which was made final in October and takes effect in 2023, requires insurers to provide an online shopping tool that allows consumers to see negotiated rates with providers and gives them estimates of their out-of-pocket costs for 500 of common shoppable items and services.\\n\\nThe following year, insurers must show all remaining procedures, drugs and other items.\\n\\nThis measure was prompted by feedback that consumers are more interested in what they are on the hook for based on their insurance plans' deductibles and copays."}
{"original": "Watched,judged,detained Leaked Chinese government records reveal detailed surveillance reports on Uyghur families and Beijing's justification for mass detentions By Ivan Watson and Ben Westcott\\n\\nHong Kong (CNN) — Rozinsa Mamattohti couldn't sleep or eat for days after she read the detailed records the Chinese government had been keeping on her entire family.\\n\\nShe and her relatives, most of whom live in China's western Xinjiang region, aren't dissidents or extremists or well-known. But in a spreadsheet kept by local officials, her entire family's lives are recorded at length along with their jobs, their religious activity, their trustworthiness and their level of cooperation with the authorities. And this spreadsheet could determine if Mamattohti's sister remains behind razor wire in a government detention center.\\n\\nHer family's records, and hundreds of government reports like them, have been leaked to journalists by a patchwork of exiled Uyghur activists.\\n\\nThe document reveals for the first time the system used by the ruling Chinese Communist Party to justify the indefinite detention on trivial grounds of not only Mamattohti's family but hundreds -- and possibly millions -- of other citizens in heavily fortified internment centers across Xinjiang.\\n\\nIt is the third major leak of sensitive Chinese government documents in as many months, and together the information paints an increasingly alarming picture of what appears to be a strategic campaign by Beijing to strip Muslim-majority Uyghurs of their cultural and religious identity and suppress behavior considered to be unpatriotic.\\n\\nThe Chinese government has claimed it is running a mass deradicalization program targeting potential extremists, but these official records, verified by a team of experts, show people can be sent to a detention facility for simply wearing a veil or growing a long beard.\\n\\nFor Mamattohti's sister, 34-year-old Patem, the crime for which she was detained, according to the document, was a violation of family planning policy, or put simply, having too many children. Under the countrywide policy, which rarely if ever is cause for imprisonment, rural families in Xinjiang are limited to three children. Patem had four.\\n\\nIt was the first time since 2016 that Mamattohti had received any concrete news of what had happened to her family.\\n\\nI never imagined that my younger sister would be in prison, Mamattohti told CNN, through tears, in her house in Istanbul. She said she first saw the leaked records when they were informally circulated on social media among Uyghurs overseas. As I was reading their names I couldn't hold myself together, I was devastated.\\n\\nThe leak exposes what appears to be a detailed and far-reaching system of state surveillance in the region, run by the local government in Xinjiang, designed to target Chinese citizens for peacefully practicing their culture or religion.\\n\\nCNN has only been able to independently verify some of the records contained in the document. But a team of experts, led by Adrian Zenz, senior fellow in China studies at the Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation in Washington DC, say they are confident that it is an authentic Chinese government document.\\n\\nThe leaked document is a 137-page PDF file, likely generated from an Excel spreadsheet or Word table. Zenz pointed to the use of similar terminology and language in this document, which he refers to as the Karakax List, and other records leaked from Xinjiang.\\n\\nHe said the records showed that Beijing was detaining Uyghur citizens for actions that in many cases did not remotely resemble a crime.\\n\\nThe contents of this document are really significant to all of us because it shows us the paranoid mindset of a regime that's controlling the up-and-coming super power of this globe, Zenz told CNN.\\n\\nA redacted version of part of a Chinese government PDF document which was leaked to CNN, showing records of detainees in Xinjiang.\\n\\nCNN sent a copy of the document to both the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the local government in Xinjiang, to see if they could verify its authenticity. There was no response.\\n\\nSpeaking in Germany on Thursday, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said that he would gladly welcome any international diplomats or media to visit Xinjiang to see the truth for themselves.\\n\\n(Those who have come) have not seen any concentration camps or persecution in Xinjiang. However, what they have seen is that all ethnic groups are able to live peacefully and harmoniously … Their religious freedom is totally protected and they can practice their religion without any restrictions, he said.\\n\\nThe so-called concentration camps with so-called 1 million people are 100% rumors. It is completely fake news. I do not understand why these people are still lying while having the facts. I can only say that these people are deeply prejudiced against China.\\n\\nA previous attempt by CNN to visit the detention centers in Xinjiang was blocked by local government authorities.\\n\\nThe document: Family, neighbors, religion\\n\\nChina's vast western region of Xinjiang has for centuries been home to a large population of predominantly Muslim ethnic groups, the largest of which is the Uyghur. Until recently, there were many more Uyghur citizens in Xinjiang than Han Chinese, the ethnic majority in the rest of the country.\\n\\nSince 2016, evidence has emerged that the Chinese government has been operating huge, fortified centers to detain its Uyghur citizens. As many as two million people may have been taken to the camps, according to the US State Department.\\n\\nFormer detainees and activists say the facilities are actually designed for the purposes of re-education -- places where inmates are forcibly taught Mandarin and instructed in Communist Party propaganda. Some testimonies from former detainees describe over-crowded cells, torture and even the deaths of fellow detainees.\\n\\nCamp 4 Camp 3 Camp 2 Camp 1 Karakax\\n\\nThe leaked document appears to be a compilation of 667 records of detained Uyghur citizens, all of whom lived within a small neighborhood of Karakax county, also known as Moyu, in southwestern Xinjiang. A number of the 667 records appear to be duplicates, but in total they represent 311 individuals who were sent to detention centers. Population figures from 2015 show Karakax was home to just over 560,000 people, 97.6% of whom were ethnically Uyghur.\\n\\nIn December 2016, five people were killed -- including three assailants -- when a group of men allegedly attacked the local Karakax Communist Party office with knives and detonated an explosive device. Chinese state media described it as a terrorist attack.\\n\\nIt was a series of deadly attacks like this across Xinjiang and other parts of China which Beijing has used to justify its mass detention of Uyghurs, purportedly as a means of nullifying the alleged threat of Islamic extremism. The Chinese Foreign Ministry says that since the system was put in place three years ago, no one has been killed in terror attacks in Xinjiang.\\n\\nFew dates are included on the leaked document, but the earliest date of detention listed is in January 2017, suggesting that these Uyghurs began to be put into camps after the December attack.\\n\\nThe leaked evaluations contain detailed reports on each of the detained residents and their families, including not only their national ID numbers and occupations, but descriptions of their neighbors and rigorous assessments of their daily religious activity.\\n\\nThese elements are referred to in the document as the Three Circles -- family, social and religious associations. Based on these evaluations, each record also contains an official judgment on whether the detainee should be allowed to leave their camp.\\n\\nHow a detainee is judged He participated in the four events (Went to mosque Friday, attended festivals, wedding and funeral) It is found sometimes he prayed His religious knowledge came from his grandfather RELIGIOUS CIRCLE SOCIAL CIRCLE NEIGHBOR Sentenced to 6 years (Inciting terrorism) NEIGHBOR (Endangering public security) Sentenced to 5.5 years NEIGHBOR Sentenced to 14 years (Advocating terrorism) ELDEST SON Middle school FATHER Unemployed at home ELDEST DAUGHTER Kindergarten WIFE Detained (For being a potential risk) FAMILY CIRCLE MALE Detained (Illegally went abroad, violated family planning policy) VERDICT The transforming of his thought was not ideal. It is recommended to continue his training He participated in the four events (Went to mosque Friday, attended festivals, wedding and funeral) It is f ound sometimes he p r ay ed His religious knowledge came from his grandfather RELIGIOUS CIRCLE NEIGHBOR Sentenced to 14 years (Advocating Terrorism) NEIGHBOR Sentenced to 5.5 years (Endangering public security) (Inciting terorism) Sentenced to 6 years NEIGHBOR SOCIAL CIRCLE (For being a potential risk) Detained WIFE FATHER Unemployed at home ELDEST DAUGHTER Kindergarten ELDEST SON Middle school FAMILY CIRCLE (Illegally went abroad, violated family planning policy) MALE Detained VERDICT The transforming of his thought was not ideal. It is recommended to continue his training.\\n\\nOne report concludes: (The detainee's) stay has been less than one year and it is recommended she continue her training to improve her Mandarin.\\n\\nThe document never refers to detention centers or detainees specifically, referring to them euphemistically as training centers and trainees, in keeping with the Communist Party's practices of referring to the camps as places for vocational training.\\n\\nThe fact that the document's assessments all question whether or not the people sent to the detention centers should be allowed to leave would appear to indicate their real function.\\n\\nIt isn't clear who has compiled the list or from which government department it comes, but the level of detail on each detainee's daily religious behavior before they were sent away is carefully recorded and specific.\\n\\nEditor's note: this is a recreation of one record, not a copy.\\n\\nOne case study reads: It is found that before (the detainee) was sent to the training center, she did namaz (daily prayers) every day in 2014, prayed after meals and prayed at the family graves during festivals. Her religious knowledge came from her grandmother.\\n\\nAnother detainee is recorded as having refused to take off her face veil for years. She went to Saudi Arabia with her husband twice, she insisted on wearing a face veil … with the excuse of rhinitis (allergies), despite committee cadres asking her (not) to do so several times, the report says. The woman took off her veil in 2016, but was still sent to a detention center for being a potential threat.\\n\\nThe alleged offenses for which Uyghurs and other ethnic Muslim minorities have been detained appear to be at odds with Beijing's claims of a program of deradicalization.\\n\\nFor example, about 114 of the detainees in the leaked records were sent to the camps for having too many children, 25 for having a passport without having traveled internationally and 13 for having strong religious traditions in their family.\\n\\nSome were detained simply for reading or owning illegal books or having a family member who used to be in jail.\\n\\nMain reasons for detention in the document Violation of family planning policy\\n\\n(having more children than is allowed) Potential threat (various reasons) Having a criminal record, ex-prisoner Holding a passport without\\n\\nvisiting a foreign country Visiting one of 26 sensitive countries Illegal preaching, attending or\\n\\nallowing room for illegal preaching Prone to being radicalized due to\\n\\nreligious traditions in family Family member of a criminal\\n\\nor ex-prisoner Wearing a face veil Having a long beard Your wife wearing a face veil Making an unauthorized pilgrimage\\n\\nThe document clearly shows … that the re-education camps are not for people who have been convicted of anything at all. They are simply for people who fall into some kind of general category of general suspicion or who have simply practiced their own religion, Zenz said.\\n\\nUyghur activists who shared the document have declined to reveal their source, due to fears of retaliation.\\n\\nSince receiving the information, academic Adrian Zenz and his team have authenticated the identities of 337 out of the more than 2,800 individual people named in the records.\\n\\nThrough interviews with Uyghurs outside China, CNN was able to verify the cases of eight relatives, friends or acquaintances identified in the document.\\n\\nThe document also rings true with the continued efforts of the Chinese government to bring the culturally disparate Xinjiang in line with state-approved mainstream cultural norms. The steady growth of Han Chinese in the province is a direct result of a policy push by Beijing to encourage migration to the Muslim-majority region.\\n\\nSince the government launched its Strike Hard Campaign Against Extremism campaign in 2014, the local administration's stance towards Uyghurs has hardened. The detention centers were constructed, Uyghur mosques and graveyards have vanished beneath bulldozers and even loyal Communist Party cadres have been imprisoned apparently due to their Uyghur sympathies.\\n\\nAccording to Zenz, this newly leaked document appears to be partially based on information gathered by Chinese government workers who have been sent to live with and monitor Uyghur families in recent years. This data is being collected by government workers who visit minorities, who live with families, who sleep (in their houses), who spend time with them, who find out every intimate and private detail … And then they enter all of this information into a digital database through a smart phone app, he said.\\n\\nOther likely sources of information are the neighborhood committees and cooperative family members who are regularly mentioned in the document.\\n\\nNo release dates are recorded for any of the detainees, even those who have had their return to the community approved. In some cases, the detainee is recommended to be released from the camp but to continue working in the industrial park, potentially corroborating allegations that Uyghurs are made to perform forced labor.\\n\\nIf the document is extrapolated for the rest of Xinjiang, home to 11 million Uyghurs, there could be hundreds of thousands more surveillance records like these.\\n\\nThe family member: 'She is no real threat'\\n\\nFor some Uyghur expatriates, living overseas with no word from their families for months or years, this document provides the first official confirmation of the fate of their loved ones. For Rozinsa Mamattohti, it was a devastating coda to years of uncertainty and fear.\\n\\nShe moved to Turkey to study as a teenager in 2002, after dropping out of school at an early age to be a seamstress. Despite the distance between Xinjiang and Turkey, there are many connections between the two. Uyghurs are considered ethnically Turkic, and speak a language closely related to Turkish. Activists pushing for Xinjiang to become a separate country call it East Turkestan.\\n\\nWithin three years Mamattohti had married a local man and they soon started their own family.\\n\\nAt first, she regularly kept in touch with her family back in Xinjiang over the phone and later through email and video calls.\\n\\nShe thought she'd have many years to introduce her family back in Xinjiang to her children. But then things began to change at home.\\n\\nRozinsa's family tree Rozinsa Mamattohti SISTER Patem Mamattohti Detained (Violation of family policy) FATHER Mamattohti Sayit Farmer MOTHER Baimmehan Heyt Farmer BROTHER Muhammad Abdulla Mamattohti Farmer, lives at home lives at home BROTHER Muhammet Omer Mamattohti Farmer, lives at home lives at home SISTER Rozniyaz Mamattohti Formerly detained SISTER Rizwangul Mamattohti Sells kebabs, lives at home lives at home DAUGHTER 14 years old middle school student middle school student DAUGHTER 12 years old middle school student middle school student SON 9 years old primary school student primary school student SON 7 years old primary school student primary school student Rozinsa Mamattohti SISTER Patem Mamattohti Detained (Violation of family policy) FATHER Mamattohti Sayit Farmer MOTHER Baimmehan Heyt Farmer BROTHER Muhammad Abdulla Mamattohti Farmer, lives at home lives at home BROTHER Muhammet Omer Mamattohti Farmer, lives at home lives at home SISTER Rozniyaz Mamattohti Formerly detained SISTER Rizwangul Mamattohti Sells kebabs, lives at home lives at home DAUGHTER 14 years old middle school student middle school student DAUGHTER 12 years old middle school student middle school student SON 9 years old primary school student primary school student SON 7 years old primary school student primary school student\\n\\nIn April 2016, while Mamattohti's parents were visiting her in Turkey, the news came that her older sister Rozniyaz Mamattohti had been arrested by the Chinese government.\\n\\nHer parents returned to Xinjiang to find out what had happened, but soon phone calls from Rozinsa began to ring out. Regularly used family phone numbers were disconnected, without explanation.\\n\\nI haven't been able to contact my family since June 2016, she said.\\n\\nIn January 2020, she saw Uyghur translations of the leaked document distributed on social media by exiled activists and her worst fears seemed to be confirmed.\\n\\nFirst, I saw the document\\n\\nwith my older sister's name on it.\\n\\nIt was heartbreaking.Rozinsa Mamattohti\\n\\nA second undated case study reveals Mamattohti's older sister Rozniyaz was sent to a different detention center from their younger sibling, Patem. She was detained for two purported violations: Having too many children and holding an unused passport, which is not an official crime under Chinese law.\\n\\nAccording to the evaluation of both sisters, their family had been cooperative with the village committee. Despite having been sent to the camp in March 2018, the undated evaluation of the anonymous assessor is that younger sister Patem didn't pose any danger. She is no real threat. It is recommended to end her training.\\n\\nBut the document doesn't say if Patem was freed from the camps or how long she spent inside.\\n\\nRozniyaz had already been released, according to her assessment, although there is no record of the length of her detention.

In an interview at her home in Turkey, she told CNN her brother and sister were in prison, and during her last phone call with her mother, the older woman claimed not to know who she was.\\n\\nKarakas said it was a shock when she received a translation of the leaked document over social media and quickly recognized the name of her cousin, Mahire Mahmut.\\n\\nAccording to the document, Mahmut was put in a detention center because her parents and two elder siblings took a trip to Turkey in 2016, which the Chinese government claimed was illegal.\\n\\nOn their way to Mecca in Saudi Arabia to take part in the Hajj, they had stopped off in Turkey to visit Ipargul and her husband Hafiz.\\n\\nThey came here legally.

It's not clear what became of them.\\n\\nWhen we think about the difficult and harsh conditions (our family) might be in back in Xinjiang … we just sit and cry helplessly, Hafiz said.\\n\\nThe leakers: 'Nothing is free'\\n\\nUyghur hip-hop artist Tahirjan Anwar was celebrating his 32nd birthday in the Netherlands when, without warning, he received more than a hundred pages of classified Chinese records.\\n\\nAt the time, he had no idea what to do with the information. But he knew that it was a priceless gift.\\n\\nBecause this is crucial evidence. Information about ethnic cleansing towards Uyghurs by the Chinese government, he told CNN, speaking publicly for the first time about his role in the leak of the document.\\n\\nAnwar has been living in the Netherlands since his father sent him away from Xinjiang in 2005. He was just 17 when he left, but according to Anwar his father could feel something was going to happen.\\n\\nHe hasn't seen his parents in person since, and the last time they spoke was by telephone in 2016. He said they asked how he was, told him they loved him and then said: Now, you are not my son.\\n\\nThe Chinese government made my father say that to me, he said.\\n\\nAnwar won't reveal the source of this new document, only saying that they were taken out of China and passed to exiled Uyghur activists. He said if his source's identity is made public that person will die.\\n\\nAnwar passed on the leaked material to another Uyghur exile in the Netherlands, writer Asiye Abdulahad, in the hope she'd know how to spread the word. Between them, Anwar and Abdulahad have been responsible for disseminating two of the Chinese government's most embarrassing internal leaks in decades. They say neither of them was involved in an earlier leak of internal Chinese government documents to the New York Times.\\n\\nQuietly-spoken writer Abdulahad isn't a member of any formal Uyghur organization, but when the document appeared in her inbox, she knew she had to act.\\n\\nThis document is important evidence that can prove the unjustifiable and illegal measures the Chinese government has taken to arrest these people and send them to re-education centers and prisons. Asiye Abdulahad\\n\\nThe first set of documents the pair distributed to the media was the leak published by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ), which appears to be the operating manual for the Chinese government's Xinjiang detention centers.\\n\\nThe documents, mostly from 2017 and published in November 2019, reveal plans to construct a large number of heavily secured facilities in which detainees are forcibly taught in the Chinese language, proper manners, and ideological education.\\n\\n(Beijing) never really denied that those weren't Chinese government documents, never said anything about the classified documents' authenticity, she said.\\n\\nAbdulahad said that she believes the Chinese government is aiming to carry out a political cleansing of Xinjiang through its detention center program, to change the character of the Uyghur people in the region. She said the strategy was unlikely to succeed, adding it has been tried before by many empires in the world.\\n\\n(Empires) all end eventually. It's impossible for them to last, she said.\\n\\nAnwar bluntly describes the actions of the Chinese government as ethnic cleansing.\\n\\nWe aren't terrorists … We are\\n\\njust humans. We are just Uyghurs.\\n\\nWe are just like you.Tahirjan Anwar\\n\\nHe said that it wasn't a difficult decision to reveal his role in leaking the document, as he is sure his family are already in prison. Privately, part of him even hopes that his family members will be paraded out by Chinese state media to denounce him publicly.\\n\\nI will be happy (if that happens) because first of all, I can see that they are alive, he said.\\n\\nAbdulahad said people need to look beyond their own family's safety and speak out for change. Nothing is free. You have to pay some price in order to pursue the things you want, she said.\\n\\n'What is their crime?'\\n\\nNone of the men and women behind the newly leaked document believes it is likely to lead to an immediate change of policy by the Chinese government.\\n\\nPrevious releases of sensitive documents have been stone-walled by Beijing officials, who claimed that they were maliciously misinterpreted.\\n\\nBut in the past six months, the Chinese government has been working hard to try to defuse rising global concern about its detention system in Xinjiang.\\n\\nDelegations of foreign diplomats and selected media have been given tours of the fortified facilities. Government officials have claimed, without providing proof, that the camps are increasingly empty.\\n\\nPeople arrive and leave constantly, said Shohrat Zakir, chairman of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region in July. Most have already gone back to society.\\n\\nIn any case, the leaked document shows that the Chinese government knows in detail what its Xinjiang residents are doing, house by house, street by street. If the 11 million Uyghurs living in Xinjiang should fall foul of Beijing again, the Chinese government knows where to find them.\\n\\nUyghur exile Rozinsa Mamattohti said she wants the whole world to know what the Chinese government is doing to her people.\\n\\nTo the Chinese I want to say -- why? What is the reason you have arrested my aging, sick parents? What are you doing to them? What is your purpose? And my innocent sisters, what is their crime? she said."}
{"original": "(CNN) As President-elect Joe Biden prepares to take over from the outgoing Trump administration, the goal for the families of Americans unlawfully detained and held hostage abroad remains the same: to see their loved ones returned home.\\n\\nWhile some are holding out hope that progress could be made in the final three weeks of Donald Trump's presidency, the families are also now looking to the incoming administration to keep up the efforts to secure their relatives' freedom. The Biden team has pledged to work tirelessly to reunite the families.\\n\\nAccording to the Foley Foundation , there are at least 42 publicly known hostage or detainee cases in 11 countries, including Iran, Afghanistan, Syria, Venezuela, Russia, and even apparent allies such as Saudi Arabia.\\n\\nFor the families of these individuals, each day brings more anguish and concern. Some have been separated for years, missing birthdays and holidays, the birth of grandchildren and other key milestones.\\n\\n'An empty chair'\\n\\nPresident-elect Biden, during the debates, you know, many times he mentioned about families that have empty chairs because they're missing loved ones, and we're missing our loved one, said Ibrahim Kamalmaz, the son of Majd Kamalmaz, a humanitarian worker who disappeared in Syria in 2017.\\n\\nWe have an empty chair for my father, and now we're coming up on four years of that empty chair. And hopefully, knowing that President-elect Biden cares about families, we hope that he will care about the families of the detainees and proactively and aggressively try to bring them home, he said.\\n\\nHis sister, Maryam Kamalmaz, told CNN that they still have hope that the Trump administration will be productive up until their last day, but we're hoping that the Biden administration will be able to pick up exactly where the Trump administration left off.\\n\\nMarc and Debra Tice, the parents of journalist Austin Tice, who went missing in Syria in 2012, told CNN that their request of the US government remains the same regardless of who is in charge.\\n\\nOur plea is simple: We ask the governments of the Syrian Arab Republic and the United States to make every possible diplomatic effort to bring Austin safely home, they said.\\n\\nSome of the efforts by the Trump administration to free Americans have been reported publicly. Two senior administration officials engaged in rare direct talks in Damascus as part of an effort to secure the release of Americans like Tice and Kamalmaz who are believed to be held by the Assad regime.\\n\\n'I know it's taking its toll on him'\\n\\nIn Russia, US Ambassador John Sullivan acknowledged to the BBC that there were discussions underway with the Russian government regarding US citizens there.\\n\\nI have no higher priority in what's left of the Trump administration than to advocate for Paul (Whelan) and to do all we possibly can to get him released, Sullivan said last week, but noted that we also need a willing interlocutor to engage in discussions of what would be remotely possible and acceptable, something that an American president could agree to.\\n\\nWhelan has been detained in Russia for more than two years, sentenced to 16 years in prison by a Moscow court in June of this year on espionage charges. Another American, Trevor Reed , has been held for more than 500 days in Russia. He was sentenced to nine years in July for for endangering life and health of Russian police officers in an altercation, per Russia's state-run news agency TASS.\\n\\nHis mother, Paula Reed, said that she's been told the ball is in Russia's court with regard to Trevor's release. In the meantime, she's worried about her son's wellbeing, telling CNN that she can already hear a change in his personality during their phone calls.\\n\\nHe's not the happy-go-lucky kind of guy, even though he always makes it a point to tell me that he's fine and not to worry about him, I can just, I know it's taking its toll on him, she said.\\n\\nElizabeth Whelan told CNN that she too is worried about her brother's continued imprisonment.\\n\\nWe want to give the Trump administration every opportunity to come up with something, to work something out with the Russian authorities before the end of President Trump's term, but that's approaching pretty quickly, she said, noting that the apparent lack of movement on the case is extremely worrying.\\n\\nEvery day that goes by is another day of Paul's life that he's spending in a Russian prison for no fault of his own, she said.\\n\\n'Extremely hard to resolve'\\n\\nPeter Bergen, a vice president at New America and CNN national security analyst, noted the complexity of some of the cases, like that of Tice, are extremely hard to resolve regardless of the administration because of other complicating factors like broader policy considerations. There are other foreign policy issues that may be bigger than the question of hostage releases, Bergen said.\\n\\nHowever, Bergen noted that there's kind of a long and honorable tradition in America, around issues about hostages and kind of counterterrorism in general, where there's a lot of agreement between the Republicans and the Democrats about what to do and who should do it.\\n\\nBergen also told CNN, the way that the government deals with the hostage families is markedly better than it was at the midpoint of the Obama administration, when President Barack Obama faced heavy criticism for the handling of the cases of journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff and humanitarian workers Kayla Mueller and Peter Kassig. All four were detained and murdered by ISIS in Syria, and their deaths led to a 2015 review of US hostage policy.\\n\\nDiane Foley, the mother of James Foley , and Sarah Moriarty, the daughter of Robert Levinson , a former FBI agent who disappeared in Iran more than a decade ago, called on the Biden administration to make the return of Americans taken hostage abroad a top priority, both in words and swift action in an opinion piece in The Hill last week.\\n\\nMr. Biden knows us. He and all of America felt the horror with us when journalist James Foley was kidnapped, brutally tortured and murdered by ISIS, and when Bob Levinson was taken hostage by the Iranian regime and imprisoned, with no contact with the outside world for 13 long years, they wrote.\\n\\nOur families know President-elect Biden's compassion from his time in Congress and as vice president, they continued. But we also believe he and the American public will agree that more could have been done to have brought Jim, Bob and too many others home alive. So much more work remains.\\n\\nThe two said it was essential to ensure continuity where possible, including a joint review with the outgoing administration of all active cases of Americans held hostage and wrongfully detained abroad in order to ensure that no momentum or information is lost.\\n\\nTheir piece laid out a series of requests, including the swift appointment of the special envoy for hostage affairs, the National Security Council's Senior Director for Counterterrorism, and the Director of the Hostage Recovery Fusion cell, and that any deals made with foreign entities put the recovery of Americans front and center, not as an afterthought.\\n\\nFoley Foundation executive director Margaux Ewen told CNN that they are slated to meet with incoming national security adviser Jake Sullivan next week.\\n\\n'We will work tirelessly'\\n\\nMany of the families who spoke to CNN expressed optimism about the continuity of the efforts to free their loved ones.\\n\\nGabriela Zambrano Hill's father and uncle are among the CITGO 6, the six US executives who have been jailed in Venezuela for more than three years.\\n\\nShe said she's been told that the biggest goal here is to maintain as much momentum as possible and keep it going throughout the transition and that that plan seems to be working and that there's promising signs that the new incoming team places as much value on my family's freedom as the current administration has.\\n\\nTransition spokesperson Ned Price told CNN that the Biden-Harris administration will have no higher priority than the safety and security of Americans — both at home and around the world.\\n\\nWe will work tirelessly to reunite Americans held unjustly against their will with their families and other loved ones, Price said.\\n\\nMany of the officials who work on the hostage and detainee cases are career government workers, but some -- like the Special Presidential Envoy for Hostage Affairs (SPEHA) -- are political appointees.\\n\\nThe families who spoke to CNN praised the current special envoy, Roger Carstens, with some saying that they would like to see him stay on in the role after Biden takes office, at least in an interim capacity. A source close to Carstens indicated he would be willing to stay on.\\n\\nOur goal has and will always be to support the families of US hostages and wrongful detainees with every available resource and tool, Carstens said."}
{"original": "Do you want to have more money?\\n\\nSilly question, right? Who doesn't want some extra cash? The good news is, there are simple things you can do in just 20 minutes to avoid wasting your hard-earned dollars. Jump right in and get started to take advantage of the savings.\\n\\n1. Ask your credit card company for a reduced interest rate or an annual-fee waiver\\n\\nAre you paying an annual fee on your credit card, have you been charged fees for a late payment, or is your credit card interest rate too high? You may be able to fix these issues simply by asking.\\n\\nIn one study of almost 1,000 Americans conducted by CreditCards.com, 82% of cardholders were able to get their creditors to waive an annual fee or to reduce the amount of the fee. An even higher number of cardholders -- a full 87% -- were successful in getting a late fee waived. And close to two-thirds of cardholders were able to convince creditors to lower their rate with a simple request.\\n\\nCards with fees usually charge $25 to $500 annually, with an average fee of around $60, so saving that cash is well worth a quick call. Lowering your interest rate could save much more if you have a high balance.\\n\\n2. Cancel a service that isn't providing value\\n\\nAre you paying for a gym membership you aren't using, like around half of all gym members? You could save an average of $480 to $600 annually by calling to cancel. And gyms are just one of many things you may be paying for, even though you're not getting enough value to make costs worthwhile.\\n\\nCanceling cable and switching to a streaming service, like the new $40 offering from Hulu or the $20 Sling TV package, could save you hundreds of dollars. You could cancel an AAA membership if your car has roadside assistance, cancel paid music services like Sirius and use free alternatives, or drop a membership at Sam's Club or Costco if you're no longer buying in bulk.\\n\\nAlmost everyone is paying for at least some service they don't need -- you just need to find what your unnecessary expense is and call to cancel.\\n\\n3. Raise your insurance deductible (if you can cover it)\\n\\nYour homeowners insurance policy and your auto insurance have deductibles you must pay before the insurer covers your costs. If you have a $250 deductible and a $300 repair bill, you'd pay $250 and the insurer would pay $50.\\n\\nPolicies with lower deductibles cost more. Depending upon your situation, you may be able to raise deductibles on some or all of your policies.\\n\\nAnd the more you raise the deductible, the more money you keep in your pocket. Going from a $250 to $500 deductible on car insurance could save you 7% on premiums, while going from a $500 to $2,000 deductible could save you 16% on average.\\n\\nRaising your deductible is a good idea only if you have money to cover costs in an emergency. One option: Set aside money saved on premiums to pay your deductible if something goes wrong. Drivers nationwide paid average premiums of $1,325 in 2016, so if you pay the average, raise your deductible from $250 to $500, and save 7%, you'd pay $92.75 less each year for auto insurance. Put the $92.75 into savings, and you'll have $250 to cover the higher deductible in just 2 1/2 years. Drivers make claims around once every 17.9 years -- so there's a good chance you'll have time to save up and be able to pocket extra premium savings for many years to come.\\n\\n4. Optimize your home's energy efficiency\\n\\nIn the U.S., around half of all energy produced is wasted due to various inefficiencies. You probably have some inefficiencies in your own home that are costing you.\\n\\nYour water heater, for example, may be set at the 140 degrees Fahrenheit manufacturers generally default to, while the U.S. Department of Energy suggests most residential homeowners should set their temp to 120 degrees Fahrenheit. Lowering the temperature can prevent scalding, slow the mineral buildup that causes corrosion, and save you between 4% and 22% on energy each year -- and it's as simple as turning down the thermostat.\\n\\nHere are a few other ways to optimize your home to stop wasting money on utilities:\\n\\nTurn off heated dry on your dishwasher and let the dishes air-dry.\\n\\nClose vents in rooms that are not being used.\\n\\nChange your light bulbs to CFLs (compact fluorescent lights).\\n\\nProgram your thermostat to use less heat and air conditioning when you're at work or sleeping.\\n\\nUnplug devices like laptops, coffee makers, and cellphones when not in use, as these phantom power users continue drawing electricity while plugged in, costing average households around $200 annually.\\n\\n5. Optimize your car\\n\\nOnce you've cut energy costs at home, take your optimization project on the road to reduce what you spend on gas. Lowering fuel costs is a simple process:\\n\\nInflate your tires to the manufacturer's recommended level.\\n\\nClean out vehicle air filters every 30,000 to 40,000 miles.\\n\\nRemove heavy items you're transporting but don't need, including items on roof racks.\\n\\nInflating tires to the optimum pressure is not only safer, but could also improve gas mileage by an average of 0.6% and as much as 3%. A cleaner air filter could result in a 10% improvement in gas mileage, and help protect your engine. And you'd be surprised how much extra cargo can cost you -- in testing by Consumer Reports, bikes being carried on a roof rack caused fuel economy to fall by more than a third.\\n\\nRelated links:\\n\\n• Motley Fool Issues Rare Triple-Buy Alert\\n\\n• This Stock Could Be Like Buying Amazon in 1997\\n\\n• 7 of 8 People Are Clueless About This Trillion-Dollar Market\\n\\nYes, gas prices are cheap now -- but that's no reason to waste fuel or money. Like all the activities on this list, optimizing your car takes 20 minutes or less, and the payoff over time could be big."}
{"original": "(CNN) President Donald Trump is tearing the Republican Party apart on his way out the door, forcing Republicans to choose sides as they wrestle with the future of the party in the wake of Trump's overt attempts to subvert the results of the election.\\n\\nThe President's fixation with overturning the results of a fair and free election is the latest crusade throwing the GOP into a full-blown crisis mode as members attack one another's motives and grapple with what a vote to reject the results of the election that could do harm not just to their party but to democracy itself.\\n\\nThere's no evidence of widespread election fraud that would affect the results of the November election that President-elect Joe Biden won, and the courts have rejected dozens of legal challenges brought by the Trump campaign and congressional Republicans seeking to overturn the result.\\n\\nBut that hasn't stopped a dozen Republican senators -- including Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri -- and more than 100 House Republicans from planning to join with Trump to reject the Electoral College votes in states that Biden won when Congress convenes a joint session on Wednesday. That group of lawmakers has been openly clashing with other prominent Republicans -- including Sens. Mitt Romney of Utah and Ben Sasse of Nebraska , as well as the House's No. 3 Republican Liz Cheney -- who say the fight is dangerous to democracy. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell told his conference this past week that congressional certification of the election was the most consequential vote of his career.\\n\\nThe effort will only delay the inevitable, as the objections are sure to fail in both the House and the Senate, and even some Republicans are warning their colleagues about the dangerous precedent Republicans would be setting by seeking to overturn the election result through Congress.\\n\\nFor weeks, McConnell privately warned his party against making an unforced error by forcing votes on the Electoral College objections, fully aware that questioning the results of the election when Congress meets Wednesday would expose rifts in his ranks and force members up for reelection in 2022 into an unenviable political position. But, Hawley, a Republican with presidential ambitions, went ahead announcing last week he will object to certifying the election results of at least one state Wednesday, forcing both chambers to vote on whether to side with Trump's baseless claims the election was stolen from him or the will of the voters that selected Biden.\\n\\nWhat has followed is a nasty internal debate that has spilled into public view, with members publicly ridiculing their colleagues and choosing whether they will follow Hawley down the rabbit hole or stand against what even supporters have acknowledged is a futile effort.\\n\\nI'm concerned about the division in America, that's the biggest issue, but obviously this is not healthy for the Republican Party either, said Sasse, who has been critical of Trump's false election claims. What's good for America is the main question here, but this is bad for the country and bad for the party.\\n\\nA group of nearly a dozen Republican senators announced Saturday that they would vote for Hawley's objection when it was brought forward, unless a commission was created to study voter fraud, something that is unlikely. The group, led by GOP Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, speaks to the balancing act many Republicans feel like they have to maintain. Cruz's group has not said if any members would separately file their own objections or just vote in support of challenges that Hawley brings up, but the practical effect is the same: a dozen Republicans rejecting the results of at least one state's election.\\n\\nTrump's close ally, Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, tweeted on Sunday that proposing an election commission was not effectively fighting for President Trump and added It appears to be more of a political dodge than an effective remedy.\\n\\nRepublicans opposed to Hawley's move have said they believe the conference will be able to overcome the drama, even if the next several days threaten to upend party unity. But the long-term effects could stretch for years -- and into the 2022 Senate races, with Trump and his allies threatening primary challenges to those Republicans who cross him and vote against the objections. Aides to GOP members still trying to decide what to do next describe an anxious time for the party as members grapple with what choice to make.\\n\\nI think we will put it past us. We have done it before, Sen. Roger Wicker, a Republican from Mississippi, said. I am going to certify the electorate. ... I think that overwhelming weight of the evidence is Joe Biden defeated my candidate Donald Trump. I have to live with it.\\n\\nThroughout Trump's four years in office, Republicans have often expressed frustration or looked the other way at some of Trump's efforts and rhetoric, though they rarely crossed him. But in the past month, many Republicans voted to override Trump's veto of a popular defense policy bill , the first override of Trump's presidency, and McConnell blocked his attempts to give people $2,000 stimulus checks instead of the $600 in the spending and Covid-19 bill that Trump reluctantly signed.\\n\\nThe tensions over the Electoral College vote have spilled into the House too, where Republicans have predicted a majority of the GOP conference -- at least 140 House members -- will vote to reject Biden's victory. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy has quietly blessed the effort from conservative lawmakers, while Cheney, the No. 3 House Republican, has tried to push back.\\n\\nCheney sent a 21-page memo to Republicans Sunday outlining why she believes objecting to the Electoral College count is unconstitutional and an exceptionally dangerous precedent.\\n\\nThere is substantial reason for concern about the precedent Congressional objections will set here. By objecting to electoral slates, members are unavoidably asserting that Congress has the authority to overturn elections and overrule state and federal courts, Cheney wrote. Such objections set an exceptionally dangerous precedent, threatening to steal states' explicit constitutional responsibility for choosing the President and bestowing it instead on Congress. This is directly at odds with the Constitution's clear text and our core beliefs as Republicans, she added.\\n\\nFormer House Speaker Paul Ryan discouraged his former colleagues from objecting to the election results in a statement Sunday, saying it was difficult to conceive of a more anti-democratic and anti-conservative act than a federal intervention to overturn the results of state-certified elections and disenfranchise millions of Americans.\\n\\nWhile a group of House members had been vowing to object to the 2020 election results for weeks, their protest would have died had no senator joined them, which is what happened when a handful of House Democrats objected to Trump's victory in several states when the Electoral College votes were counted in 2017.\\n\\nHawley's detractors have expressed frustration that he's pushed his colleagues into a difficult vote for an effort that's doomed to fail.\\n\\nI think that if you have a plan, it should [be] a plan that has some chance of working. And neither of the two proposals that have been advanced will produce a result, said Sen. Roy Blunt, a Republican from Missouri, who added: I don't believe it has much long-term impact on our conference.\\n\\nBut the last several days have led to a testy back and forth between those who support Hawley and those who do not. On Thursday morning, McConnell repeatedly called on Hawley to make his case to members on why he was objecting to the results from at least one state. Hawley wasn't on the call, however, and later responded by email to the conference on his rationale. Then over the weekend, multiple senators including Romney, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania skewered any questions that the election had been compromised.\\n\\nRomney specifically said the effort to overturn the election was an egregious ploy that may enhance the political ambition of some, but dangerously threatens our Democratic Republic. The statement was shot at Hawley and others eyeing the presidential campaign in 2024 and Trump's powerful sway over the GOP base, should he not try to run again.\\n\\nToomey, who is retiring, accused Hawley and others of undermining the rights of Americans to pick their own leaders.\\n\\nHawley fired back in an email to colleagues.\\n\\nI read Sen. Toomey's statement, Hawley said. I recognize that our caucus will have varied opinions about this subject. That's not surprising. But I also believe we should avoid putting words into each other's mouths, Hawley wrote.\\n\\nFour Senate Republicans -- Murkowski, Romney, Susan Collins of Maine and Bill Cassidy of Louisiana -- joined with six Democrats in a statement Sunday blasting efforts to undermine the legitimacy of the 2020 election. It was many of the same senators who came together last month to push for a bipartisan Covid-19 relief deal that eventually was signed into law.\\n\\nThe 2020 election is over. All challenges through recounts and appeals have been exhausted. At this point, further attempts to cast doubt on the legitimacy of the 2020 Presidential election are contrary to the clearly expressed will of the American people and only serve to undermine Americans' confidence in the already determined election results, the senators said.\\n\\nNewly elected GOP Sen. Roger Marshall of Kansas, who joined Cruz's effort Saturday, predicted Senate Republicans would overcome the challenge of Wednesday's vote.\\n\\nI think this will make us stronger, Marshall said. I think this will prove we can listen to each other."}

This is a CNN town hall event. Good evening, I'm Anderson Cooper. Voters in Nevada are just days away from putting their stamp on the 2020 Democratic presidential primary race. Tonight we have already heard from two candidates vying for the chance to take on President Trump, Senator Bernie Sanders and Mayor Pete Buttigieg.\\n\\n\\n\\nNow to another Democratic hopeful, please welcome Senator Amy Klobuchar.\\n\\n\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\n\\n\\nSEN. AMY KLOBUCHAR (D-MN), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Hi, everybody. Very good.\\n\\n\\n\\nCOOPER: Welcome.\\n\\n\\n\\nKLOBUCHAR: Thanks, Anderson.\\n\\n\\n\\nCOOPER: Thanks for being here.\\n\\n\\n\\nKLOBUCHAR: How are you?\\n\\n\\n\\nCOOPER: Good. We're going to get to audience questions in just a minute. I just want to ask you about tomorrow night on the debate stage. You have been saying that you want to see Michael Bloomberg on a debate stage. It's going to happen tomorrow night. You've said you can't beat him in terms of the money he has got, but you can on a debate stage.\\n\\n\\n\\nHow do you plan to do that?\\n\\n\\n\\nKLOBUCHAR: Well, you know, it's maybe a series of debates. But I'm just -- I actually thought he should be on the debate stage because I don't think you should just be able to buy your way to the presidency. And my issue is that a number of us, including the three of us that you saw tonight, have been going in town halls like this. We've been answering questions. We have been going to states like Nevada and actually meeting the voters and having them quiz us and ask all kind of things, and put our policies out there. And I think that is what a presidential candidate should do. So, you\\n\\n\\n\\nknow, I don't mind that he has this money, that's a great thing he made that money. But we want to make sure that we have the best candidate to lead the ticket. And I don't think that when people look at Donald Trump they automatically say, hmm, can we get someone richer?\\n\\n\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\n\\n\\nKLOBUCHAR: I just don't think that's what they say. I think they say we want to have someone that we know can lead this country. And I think that's me.\\n\\n\\n\\nCOOPER: All right.\\n\\n\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\n\\n\\nCOOPER: I want you to meet -- this is Heather Gooze. She's a bartender, a server in Las Vegas. She was working at the Route 91 Harvest Music Festival the night of the mass shooting that killed 58 people, wounded hundreds of others. She right now is undecided. Heather, welcome.\\n\\n\\n\\nKLOBUCHAR: OK. Hi, Heather.\\n\\n\\n\\nQUESTION: Hi, Senator. Thank you for being here. As a survivor of the October 1st, 2017, mass shooting here in Las Vegas, gun violence prevention is an incredibly important subject to me. I have seen firsthand what happens.\\n\\n\\n\\nI support the Second Amendment. But I feel like we definitely need to have better background checks and more enforcement of gun laws already on the books. How do you plan to address gun violence prevention without provoking the pro-gun versus anti-gun debate?\\n\\n\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\n\\n\\nKLOBUCHAR: What a good question. And I want to first of all tell you, Heather, I'm so glad you're here and I cannot imagine -- I don't think any of us here can imagine what that was like for you. And you must think about those moments all the time. And...\\n\\n\\n\\nQUESTION: Yes...\\n\\n\\n\\nKLOBUCHAR: What?\\n\\n\\n\\nQUESTION: Live every -- like my bracelet says, you want to live every day for those who died.\\n\\n\\n\\nKLOBUCHAR: Exactly. And you being here...\\n\\n\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\n\\n\\nKLOBUCHAR: You being here and asking that question is just pushing people to talk about this and never forget. So I'll tell you how I come to this, because you asked that question\\n\\n\\n\\nabout gun owners and the interaction with the Second Amendment. So my state actually is a pretty big hunting state. And so I look at these proposals and I always say, do they hurt my uncle Vic (ph) in the deer stand? And they don't.\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd I think that's why we see, and there was a poll last summer that showed for the majority of hunters, this was a FOX poll, and it said the majority of hunters actually supported universal background checks.\\n\\n\\n\\nQUESTION: They should.\\n\\n\\n\\nKLOBUCHAR: The majority of Trump owners support universal background checks. But let's think about why we don't have them. I think the first thing is that there are a lot of politicians out there that are afraid of the NRA.\\n\\n\\n\\n[22:05:00]\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd I saw this firsthand after the Parkland shooting because I have been working on a number of a pieces of legislation that would make things safer.\\n\\n\\n\\nOne of the bills that I have always led is a bill to close the boyfriend loophole. That basically says if someone has been convicted of domestic abuse, then they cannot go out and get an assault weapon. They can't go out and buy a gun.\\n\\n\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\n\\n\\nKLOBUCHAR: That is pretty straightforward. And yet, it is sitting right now, along with the universal background check bill and a bill that does something called close the Charleston loophole, which was the result of that incredibly sad tragedy, that murder in the church in South Carolina where a white nationalist came in and killed a bunch of worshipers in a black church in Charleston.\\n\\n\\n\\nThat bill, my bill, and the universal background check bill are sitting on Mitch McConnell's desk right now, because they passed the House of Representatives. My bill actually got some Republican support. So why aren't these things passing? Well, the NRA wields so much clout right now with some of these Republicans that we basically need to shake things up.\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd I sat across from Donald Trump in the White House after Parkland and I watched, because I came to advocate for my bill, and I watched. And nine times, I had a piece of paper and I wrote it down, he said, and I did it with hash marks, nine times that he wanted universal background checks, to the public, there's a video of this.\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd then what does he do? He meets with the NRA the next day, and he folds. And as your president, I will not fold. I know that we can do this.\\n\\n\\n\\n(APPLAUSE) KLOBUCHAR: We can -- which would have been so helpful in the Las Vegas massacre, we could permanently put in place, just like your legislature has done in Nevada, a ban on bump stocks. We can put in the assault weapon ban, the background checks, magazine limits, all of these things.\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd I just -- I think the public is with us. In 2018 we elected a bunch of House members in districts that had people who were too beholden to the NRA. And they went to Washington and helped pass these bills. So there's absolutely no reason that we can't get these done.\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd I'll just end with one last thing. One of my saddest days -- or the saddest day I had in Washington is when we were voting on that universal background check bill, because I had those Sandy Hook parents in my office. And I had to tell them that we didn't have the votes to get it done.\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd this one mom, she looked at me, she said, you know what, my kid, he had autism and he could hardly talk. And the last day that I saw him, just like he did every day, he pointed up to a picture on the refrigerator of his school aide, who was with him every day, because he loved her so much. And then he went to school. And she said hours later I'm in that firehouse and one by one the kids come in. And the parents that are left know we're never going to see our babies again.\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd she said as she was sobbing in that firehouse, she had this thought of that school aide, because she knew that that woman would never leave her son's side. And when they found them in that school, that woman had her arms around that little boy. And they were both shot to death.\\n\\n\\n\\nThose parents had the courage, just like the people in Nevada, ordinary citizens who ran into that massacre to save lives, they had the courage to do that. And there are people, including our president, that doesn't have the courage to stand up to the NRA. You have the power, Nevada, to change that and put a new leader in the White House.\\n\\n\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\n\\n\\nCOOPER: This is Alpha Nash. Alpha is a high school art teacher. And she's currently undecided. Alpha, welcome. Thanks for being here.\\n\\n\\n\\nKLOBUCHAR: Hi, Alpha.\\n\\n\\n\\nQUESTION: Hi, thank you so much.\\n\\n\\n\\nKLOBUCHAR: Sure.\\n\\n\\n\\nQUESTION: Welcome, Senator.\\n\\n\\n\\nKLOBUCHAR: Thank you.\\n\\n\\n\\nQUESTION: My question is, how do you plan to protect our under 18 population who are illegal immigrants who came to this country as young children? Do you have a plan on helping to fast-track them into citizenship? And if so, what are the steps to make this happen?\\n\\n\\n\\nKLOBUCHAR: Sure. Thank you. And thank you for being a teacher.\\n\\n\\n\\nQUESTION: Yes, thank you.\\n\\n\\n\\nKLOBUCHAR: My mom actually taught second grade until she was 70 years old. Hopefully you can retire sooner than that, but...\\n\\n\\n\\nQUESTION: We'll see.\\n\\n\\n\\nKLOBUCHAR: But I can tell you love your kids even beyond the work that you do in the classroom.\\n\\n\\n\\nSo as we know, what she's talking about here are DREAMers. And there are so many young people here who only know one country or only know one state. And I have been taking this on for a while. I kept trying to think about how I can get people to understand what this is.\\n\\n\\n\\n[22:10:00]\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd I finally found a -- this a few years ago, a 99-year-old DREAMer.\\n\\n\\n\\nHe had been brought over when he was five years old. He didn't know it. He thought he was born in our country. And I see one of our Navy veterans out there with the hat. He signed up to serve in World War II. And when he signed up to serve, that was when he found out that he was a DREAMer, that he had not been born in our country. And so then you couldn't serve.\\n\\n\\n\\nSo what they did back then, get this, is they would say, OK, just come and live in Canada for one day. Stay over night in Canada, the Army did this. And then you can come back and you're a citizen. Because they needed people to serve. This is during World War II. And he said, I stayed in a hotel and I came back and I was a citizen.\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd then he served under General MacArthur. He served bravely. He came back to Minnesota. he got married. They had a son. That son served in the Vietnam War. And I finally thought, OK, I brought him to stand in front of the World War II Memorial when he was now at this point over 100 years old with two DREAMers from the suburbs of my state who wanted to serve in the Air Force but couldn't under the current rules.\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd there's no way under the current rules they could just go to Canada for a day. So I wanted to make that point. And the answer, of course, is comprehensive immigration reform, which would help not only DREAMers with a fast track to citizenship, but also a track to citizenship for many others.\\n\\n\\n\\nThat bill passed the U.S. Senate in 2013. I was part of the Judiciary Committee who worked on that bill. I know as president I can get things done. I can get it done in the first year. I don't think we can wait because this president, we actually worked out an agreement on DREAMers with the Republicans in the Senate. And we were gut- punched by the Trump administration. This is just another reason for a change. Think about it.\\n\\n\\n\\nImmigrants, 70 of our Fortune 500 companies are headed up by people from other countries. Twenty-five percent of our U.S. Nobel Laureates were born in other countries. Immigrants don't diminish America, they are America.\\n\\n\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\n\\n\\nCOOPER: Let me just follow up with you. You have been in the Senate for 10 years, you have seen a lot of people try this and fail. In 2007 it didn't work under George Bush. Obviously under Obama 2013. Why would it be different with you as president?\\n\\n\\n\\nKLOBUCHAR: I think the need has become clearer and clearer. And we were so close in 2013. George Bush worked valiantly, actually, to try to get that done. And back then they had -- it was right-wing talk radio defeated it. Then you go to 2013 and President Obama had come in in the middle of the downturn. He tried it in his second term and he worked really hard as well.\\n\\n\\n\\nA number of those senators that voted for it, Republicans, are still there today. And that bill back in 2013 got stopped, I think it ended up in John Boehner's freezer when he was speaker of the House next to the frozen peas. And the point of it is Nancy Pelosi is now the speaker. I believe that if I am our candidate for the president, we are going to be able to win big and make sure we keep the House and win in these Senate districts like in Arizona, right, and in Colorado, and make a change.\\n\\n\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\n\\n\\nKLOBUCHAR: But there are Republicans in the Senate that will still vote for comprehensive immigration reform. And you just need to do it in your first year. I have made that very clear that's what I will do. And I think we can get it done.\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd one other argument I would make for people that when you're talking to your friends and neighbors that people don't always think about this. It brings the deficit down, this was a non-partisan budget office assessment, by $158 billion in 10 years. Comprehensive immigration -- why?\\n\\n\\n\\nWhy is that? Because people come out of the shadows and they start paying taxes. The AFL-CIO supported the bill because wages will go up. The private sector, of course, the Chamber of Commerce supported the comprehensive immigration bill. So there's a lot of good arguments for it that bring in people of different backgrounds.\\n\\n\\n\\nCOOPER: I wanted to ask you about something that happened recently. You were asked to give the name of president of Mexico. You couldn't at the time. Mayor Buttigieg did know the name and he says it helps his argument that Washington experience isn't necessary to be president. Does it?\\n\\n\\n\\nKLOBUCHAR: Oh my. OK, well, first of all, I would like to give my greetings to President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador. (APPLAUSE)\\n\\n\\n\\nKLOBUCHAR: The president of Mexico.\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd I -- when that happened,\\n\\n\\n\\n[22:15:00]\\n\\n\\n\\nfor what it's worth, I had been in the Senate all day. We had six votes and including a resolution to be a check on the president so he doesn't go pell-mell into war with Iran. And I got on a plane and got there, I think, at midnight my time and had a fast interview and then did two forums after that, I think, ending at about two or three in the morning.\\n\\n\\n\\nSo, you know, such is life. And -- and I would say to the mayor, this isn't like a game of Jeopardy. This is about, to me, experience. And I have so much respect for him and his experience. But my experience is different. I have been in the Senate. I have passed over 100 bills as the lead Democrat. I think that matters.\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd, most importantly, I have been able to win in rural and suburban districts. I have been able to win with independents and Republicans, not once, not twice but three times, and bring people with me.\\n\\n\\n\\nI think that's really important right now, that we build this coalition, that we not shut people out. And I know he agrees with me on that. But I am the one that actually has the receipts of anyone that you'll see on the debate stage tomorrow night, that's done it. So it's just a different experience that I bring to this and to the job.\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd as far as Mexico in general, I think I was the first one on the stage, yes, who gave my support to the United States-Mexican-Canadian Trade Agreement, which I think got much better because of the hard work of people like my friend Sherrod Brown, in terms of some labor provisions, and earned the support of the president of the AFL-CIO Richard Trumka.\\n\\n\\n\\nI think that implementing that is going to be the job of the new president, making sure that those provisions are strong and that we enforce the trade agreement to help our workers. And I also think having a president, unlike this president, who's going to reach out to our allies immediately -- in my first 100 days I will be meeting with the president of Mexico, the president -- the prime minister of Canada, Justin Trudeau, as well as so many of our allies around the world. I think that has to immediately happen with the new president.\\n\\n\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\n\\n\\nCOOPER: I want to introduce you to Natalie Galvan. She's a retired registered nurse from Henderson. She's supporting you.\\n\\n\\n\\nNatalie, welcome.\\n\\n\\n\\nKLOBUCHAR: Hi, Natalie. QUESTION: Good evening.\\n\\n\\n\\nKLOBUCHAR: I was just in Henderson.\\n\\n\\n\\nQUESTION: Oh, good evening, Senator. As the first woman president, what will be the first thing you do -- you will do for the women in this country pertaining to equality?\\n\\n\\n\\nKLOBUCHAR: OK, well, very good. Well, I think there's a lot we should do. But I think...\\n\\n\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\n\\n\\n... actually, passing the ERA would be a nice thing to do.\\n\\n\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\n\\n\\nI don't know if it will be the first thing that I get done, but it's been waiting for a while.\\n\\n\\n\\nI also think that economic issues for women and men are key. Getting an increase to the minimum wage, the federal minimum wage, that has not happened for literally nearly a decade would be really important for a lot of women workers.\\n\\n\\n\\nGetting child care, universal child care, would be so key for so many workers; making sure that we keep strong women's right to choose would be so good, when we have a -- when we have a president that is trying to literally tear apart women's right to reproductive freedom.\\n\\n\\n\\nThere is so much we can do. But I think one of the amazing things about being the first woman president would be to basically have every little girl in America and really around the world think anything and everything is possible. And you think about...\\n\\n\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\n\\n\\nI was just with some of the culinary workers, the housekeepers, today. I just left there, a big group of women, and a number of them, because they had just gotten off work, had their little kids, girls and boys, on their laps.\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd you look at those kids and you think, they could grow up in a different world, where maybe they won't even remember when Donald Trump was president.\\n\\n\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\n\\n\\nCOOPER: If I could just follow up briefly, other countries -- other countries have had women presidents before. What do you think it says about our country that -- that we haven't?\\n\\n\\n\\nKLOBUCHAR: You know, actually, Hillary Clinton did get the most votes.\\n\\n\\n\\n[22:20:00] Let us remember that.\\n\\n\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\n\\n\\nSo I think that -- you know, I think people are ready for it. I think it is -- I've thought about this a lot because, actually, in my races, I was the first woman in both jobs I had, as the county attorney and then as the woman senator from my state. And I didn't really talk about it much back then because women had tried to run for the U.S. Senate in my state twice, and they were both really qualified, and they didn't make it. And there had been a lot of emphasis on Put the first woman in.\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd so when I ran, I made very clear I was running on my merits, that I was honored to be -- would be honored to be the first woman senator, but that wasn't enough of a reason, that I had to show I had the experience and I had a plan of what I wanted to get done. And I made that really clear throughout the campaign. And I think that's really important in this race as well.\\n\\n\\n\\nI know it would be cool to be the first woman president, believe me. And I think a lot of women out there know exactly what I'm talking about. But I think that the story that we tell and the campaign that we run have to be more than about that. It's got to be about people's dreams. It's got to be about the fact that we have a president that can't seem to put himself into the shoes of other people.\\n\\n\\n\\nI was saying this the other day in the last debate, that he literally seems to lack empathy. Because, if he had empathy, he wouldn't be talking about immigrants the way he did. If he had empathy, he wouldn't be belittling people like my friend who I miss so much, John McCain.\\n\\n\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\n\\n\\nIf he had empathy -- if he had empathy, he would be working on things like childcare. And so, as I've made it so clear, my pitch to the people of this state and across the country is that, if you are having trouble deciding between filling your refrigerator with food or your insulin prescription, I know you and I'll fight for you. And if you can't figure out if you're going to pay for childcare for your kids or long-term care for your parents, which I'm dealing with right now for my dad, I know you and I'll fight for you. And if you can't figure out how to make your paycheck stretch to pay your mortgage or your rent, I know you, and I'll fight for you.\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd there is such a big difference between me and Donald Trump.\\n\\n\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\n\\n\\nOne of them -- one of them is a -- I loved when the president went after Michael Bloomberg and the president said that Michael Bloomberg was 5'4 and Michael Bloomberg's like, No, I'm not; I'm taller than that.\\n\\n\\n\\nI'm the only one that has a claim to be 5'4. I want to be very clear.\\n\\n\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\n\\n\\nBut, you know, he got $413 million over the course of his life from his dad. That's great. Me, my grandpa was an iron ore miner. My dad was a newspaper man. My mom was a teacher. And my grandpa saved money in a coffee can in the basement to send my dad to a two-year community college. That's my family's trust. And you cannot fit $413 million in a coffee can.\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd I figure, if someone gives you opportunity, whether it's a parent or a grandparent or whether it is someone you work with or a teacher, you do not go into the world with a sense of entitlement. You go into the world with a sense of obligation, to lift people up instead of shoving them down.\\n\\n\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\n\\n\\nCOOPER: We're going to be right back with Amy Klobuchar, right after this.\\n\\n\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\n\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\n\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\n\\n\\n[22:28:00]\\n\\n\\n\\nCOOPER: And welcome back. We're live from Sahara, Las Vegas, for a Democratic presidential town hall with Senator Amy Klobuchar. Let's get back to our questions.\\n\\n\\n\\nThis is Pam Whitfield Jacobson, a dietitian from Las Vegas. She's currently undecided.\\n\\n\\n\\nPam?\\n\\n\\n\\nQUESTION: Question: Senator, we love how even and reasonable you are, but how would you compete with the bombast of Trump? Would you be lost in the shuffle?\\n\\n\\n\\nKLOBUCHAR: I don't think so, no. If anyone has seen me on the debate stage, I don't think so, no.\\n\\n\\n\\nI think that, actually, having someone very different than he is, as I just described my background, I think that's really important. And I think the other thing is to have an optimistic economic agenda that you keep pushing. That's going to be important. People want to have something to vote for and someone to vote for and not just someone to vote against.\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd then I think the other piece of it is how, when you put yourself -- I was just talking about, before the break, putting yourself in the shoes of other people. You know, not everyone agrees with everything that's said on the Democratic debate stage. I don't agree with everything that's said there. And there are a lot of people out there who are independents or moderate Republicans, or people who maybe stayed home in 2016, who see this as a patriotism check on this president.\\n\\n\\n\\nYou know, they don't like that we have a president that stood next to a ruthless dictator in Vladimir Putin, and when asked about Russian interference in the election, made a joke about it. Think about it. Hundreds of thousands of Americans have lost their lives on the battlefield standing up for democracy. That's what World War II was about. Four little girls at the height of the Civil Rights movement lost their life because they were innocent, trying to be part of that democracy and other people were trying to shove them out of that democracy.\\n\\n\\n\\nSo I think it's important -- or they think of it as a decency check. I have met so many people that see it in those eyes.\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd you have others that feel like there have\\n\\n\\n\\n[22:30:00]\\n\\n\\n\\nbeen promises that haven't been kept to them, that -- you know, he keeps talking about the economy. Well, look at their prescription drug prices. Or what's he done when it comes to childcare? Or what he's done when it comes to rural broadband in northern Nevada or the like?\\n\\n\\n\\nI think you have a lot of things that people are thinking. And then the last thing, I think it's important to take him on and be aggressive, of course. But I also think you've got to point out how absurd he is at times, right? You do.\\n\\n\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd you have to -- you have to be nimble -- you have to be nimble in the moment to be able to do that. So when I announced my candidacy in the middle of that blizzard, and he made fun of me for talking about climate change in a blizzard and called me Snow Woman, which I kind of liked, actually, I -- I sent out a tweet and said the science is on my side, Donald Trump, when it comes to climate change. And I'd like to see how your hair would fair in a blizzard. Or...\\n\\n\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\n\\n\\nOr, like, you look at the absurdity of when -- other people when things go wrong for them and they can't afford stuff, they've got to get out a loan or they've got to work extra hours or find another different job or their spouse has to go work. With him, when anything goes wrong, what he does he do? He blames other people. That's what he does, he blames other people.\\n\\n\\n\\nPicture him going by that helicopter, it's whirring, and he's, like, yelling about stuff. He blames Barack Obama. He loves blaming Barack Obama. He does that all the time. The president who had so much dignity, right, he -- I'm talking about President Obama. He...\\n\\n\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\n\\n\\nHe blames -- he blames the generals he commands. He's done that. He blames the Federal Reserve head that he appointed. He blames the entire kingdom of Denmark. Who does that? He does that. I kept saying that throughout New Hampshire, and I had this cult of Danish people following me that would wave flags.\\n\\n\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd then my favorite one recently is that he blamed the prime minister of Canada for cutting him out of the Canadian version of Home Alone 2. Like, who does that?\\n\\n\\n\\nSo I think, you know, you have to be able -- and I am not at one moment making light of what he has done to so many people, how immigrants feel in this society, how people of color feel when he says there are two sides after Charlottesville, when one side is the Ku Klux Klan. There is only one side, and that's the American side. But...\\n\\n\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\n\\n\\nBut when we take this guy on, we have got to remember what he does and how he does it and have someone that's able to take him on in his own arena.\\n\\n\\n\\nCOOPER: I want you to meet Brandon Cromer. He's a law student at UNLV. He's currently undecided. Brandon?\\n\\n\\n\\nKLOBUCHAR: OK, Brandon, thank you. And congratulations for being a law student.\\n\\n\\n\\nQUESTION: Thank you, Senator. And thank you for being here. Currently, there is a movement to push for marijuana legalization. As you may know, men and women of color were disproportionately prosecuted for small marijuana possession. If marijuana is legalized, would you consider a pardon or encourage states to seal or expunge those records?\\n\\n\\n\\nKLOBUCHAR: Yes, I would.\\n\\n\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd by the way, I'm well aware of what this state has done, in Nevada...\\n\\n\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\n\\n\\n... where you legalized marijuana and where you actually put in place, I think, medical marijuana, and you did that when you made some changes to the legislation and a new governor and the like. And so I think it's really important to look at it as a way of making changes to our drug policy and doing the right thing.\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd I think there's other things that we should be doing, as well. We just passed the First Step Act, which is a bipartisan effort in the Congress that reduced the federal sentences for non-violent offenders, some of them way too long. And I actually was a cosponsor of that bill.\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd now I think we need to have the Second Step Act, which is to look at fact that 90 percent of people incarcerated are in state and local jails. And when you look at some of these non-violent offenders, you see that these sentences are too long and you make changes. So I think there's still so much more work that needs to be done when it comes to criminal justice reform. So, thank you.\\n\\n\\n\\nCOOPER: I want to just follow up on that. I want to ask you about your -- a study from your first year as a prosecutor. This was a study from the Council on Crime and Justice. [22:35:00]\\n\\n\\n\\nIt found that black men ages 18 to 30 in Hennepin County were 15 times more likely to be arrested for narcotics offenses than white men, 12 times more likely to be arrested for serious violent crimes, 5 times more likely for serious property crimes. Were you aware of those disparities at the time?\\n\\n\\n\\nKLOBUCHAR: I think anyone that's worked in the criminal justice system knows there's institutional racism. And over the years, I think we've seen just how devastating that is.\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd when I was there, I worked hard on, for instance, doing more when it came to white-collar crime, doing more with drug courts. And while there were still disparities in our system like there were any, we at least managed in those eight years to reduce the African-American incarceration rate by 12 percent.\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd -- but there's still more to be done. We just talked about sentencing reform. I think there needs to be more done when it comes to grand jury reform. When I was there, I worked on eyewitness identification and making sure that when police showed witnesses pictures, that they showed them one at a time, instead of all at once, because it's been proven there's mostly racially involved misidentifications when you do it that way.\\n\\n\\n\\nAlso making sure the officers showing the picture doesn't know who it is, that can make a big difference. Using everything from DNA reviews to making sure that both our police departments and our prosecutors' offices are diverse makes a big difference. And I just think we have to come to grips with the fact that while we must keep our communities safe, you can do that at the same time you get at the institutional racism that we have in the criminal justice system.\\n\\n\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\n\\n\\nCOOPER: This is Paula Zinko. She's a maintenance dispatcher from Las Vegas. She's an undecided caucus-goer. Paula?\\n\\n\\n\\nKLOBUCHAR: Hi, Paula.\\n\\n\\n\\nQUESTION: Good evening, Senator. As a Jewish woman, I would like to know, what do you plan on doing to improve the anti-Semitic attitude that has been on the rise in this country?\\n\\n\\n\\nKLOBUCHAR: Well, thank you. And I think we know, if you didn't know it was going on, when you look at what just happened in New York City, the rabbi's home, where this stabbing occurred. Can you imagine, at a time that was supposed to be joyful, of a holiday, and you have this madman, anti-Semitic, coming in and stabbing people in the rabbi's home? We've seen that time and time again in this country.\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd I actually go back to my days that I mentioned when I was the head county attorney in our biggest county. And I took on hate crimes in a big way then. And it was everything from an African-American kid, a guy literally told people, I'm going to go and shoot a black kid on Martin Luther King Day. And he did it. It was just a miracle that this young man wasn't killed, but we went after that guy, of course, for attempted murder.\\n\\n\\n\\nOr a manager at a -- a floor manager at a manufacturing floor who literally hit an employee over the head with a two-by-four for speaking Spanish. That case happened.\\n\\n\\n\\nSince I've been in the Senate, we have a mosque that was bombed in Minneapolis by -- a suburb of Minneapolis by white nationalists. And that's why, when you look at this, we have seen this increase in hate crimes in this country, many of them involving synagogues, like we saw at the Tree of Life Synagogue, and many involving other religious centers.\\n\\n\\n\\nSo the first thing you do is you make sure you have an attorney general in place that is going to make this a priority. That's number one.\\n\\n\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\n\\n\\nNumber two, you work with local law enforcement and you have major coordination with local law enforcement, local DAs, state attorney generals, because so much of the work on this is done on the front end.\\n\\n\\n\\nYou look at how you can look for the signs, right? Some of this is everything from schools to social media and, by the way, having enough counselors and other people in the schools to identify this, which, as you know, as we talked about gun violence, is not just about mass shootings. It's also about everyday violence and what we can see.\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd then the third thing is education and making sure that people understand this right to worship and how fundamental it is.\\n\\n\\n\\n[22:40:00]\\n\\n\\n\\nOne of the more endearing stories that I heard from our Jewish community in Minnesota was that they had a threat phoned in to their community center and everyone had to leave. It wasn't just people who were there for meetings. It was people -- little kids in swimming pools and seniors that were there.\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd they were all -- it was a cold day, and they had to wander outside, and when they came in, and they checked their messages, the first message -- and we'd worked hard on this in our community -- saying, do you need a meeting space? It was from the Islamic Center of Minnesota.\\n\\n\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd so those kinds of stories and making sure that people know that kind of interfaith alliances that still exist and are so strong and having a president that wants to talk about it, I think that makes a big difference, too. It's knowing how you enforce the laws. It's putting people in place that will do it. But it is also having the heart to actually make it a priority.\\n\\n\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\n\\n\\nCOOPER: I want you to meet Tommy Sheahan. He's from Stateline, Nevada. He's the founder and CEO of a software company. He's currently undecided. Tommy, welcome.\\n\\n\\n\\nKLOBUCHAR: Hi, Tommy.\\n\\n\\n\\nQUESTION: Hi, Senator Klobuchar. Thank you for your service.\\n\\n\\n\\nKLOBUCHAR: Thank you.\\n\\n\\n\\nQUESTION: Vladimir Putin and his regime have attacked Western democracies throughout the world with fake information, Facebook, Instagram accounts, and attacked our election in 2016. Putin seems to have a disproportional influence over Trump and several actors in Washington. What are your views on regime change in Moscow?\\n\\n\\n\\nKLOBUCHAR: OK. So I think the way that you get people in other countries to want to believe in actually having a democracy is by having strong leaders in your own democracies -- I will start with that -- that respect democracies.\\n\\n\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\n\\n\\nSo they have something to look to. When you look at what happened with the fall of the Iron Curtain and other moments in history, a lot of people in those countries who were desperate for examples of beacons of democracy would look to our own country. So making sure that our democracy is working and that we have a president that actually believes in democracy is key.\\n\\n\\n\\nI think the second thing is to be very firm in our relationships with Vladimir Putin. We know that this isn't just about interfering in our election. We know that under his regime that they have done things like poisoned dissidents, like went after and killed journalists, like brought down planes, like invading Ukraine, which I'll never forget being there with the Ukrainians on the front line on New Year's Eve with my friend, John McCain, one of the last trips that he took.\\n\\n\\n\\nNow, why did he take that trip? Right after Donald Trump was elected, he took me and Senator Graham on this trip to Lithuania and Latvia and Estonia and Georgia and, of course, Ukraine, because he wanted to make that point loud and clear to our allies that we stood with them against Russian aggression and that America stood with them.\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd literally every country we went to, the leader of that country would be on one podium and the three of us would be on the other podium. So I learned a lot with John McCain.\\n\\n\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd I learned the importance of those things. And one last thing I would add as we go into this election and we think about what we can do here at home to stand up for our own elections, because you brought up some of the things that they had done in our election. And, by the way, the same thing in other countries. I still remember that trip, Estonia, they moved a statue of a Russian fighter away from a public square into another location, in a cemetery. And so they got all their internet shut down. You know everything. You're like -- and like people would have to, like, try to go onto a hill to get service.\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd another country that we were in, they had allowed Ukrainian dissidents who in exile, they had allowed them to come to a celebration in their country, and then those people got their computers hacked into. This is a long, long history.\\n\\n\\n\\nOr one of the stories I heard from one of the Scandinavia prime ministers, and she said that they were mad at their country, Russia, so they started running things on Russian TV that would get into their countries that said that they had run out of fruits and vegetables.\\n\\n\\n\\n[22:45:00]\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd all these well-meaning Russians would cross over to see their friends with carrots and apples, because they -- I mean, it just is endless.\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd so for our country's sake, what we should do, I think we never thought this would happen to us, but it did. We have to, one, safeguard our democracies. I lead the bill for backup paper ballots.\\n\\n\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\n\\n\\nWe still have a number of states that don't have backup paper ballots, and we need those.\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd then, secondly, when it comes to social media -- and I make a plea out there to help. This is a bill that actually Senator Graham and I now have that says to the social media companies, you've got to follow the same rules for political ads that TV and radio and newspapers do.\\n\\n\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\n\\n\\nWhich is that you have to say who paid for things, right, on the ads. And then you have to keep those ads in an archive so people know what they are so other campaigns can check them out.\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd if you think this doesn't matter, I use an example of an image -- this wasn't a paid ad, but an image that went out to African-American Facebook pages in the 2016 election. And we had it and displayed it in the Judiciary Committee. It was an innocent woman, innocent African-American woman from Chicago. They put her face on an image with a fake Hillary logo. And it said, Why wait in line to vote? This is in 2016. You can text your vote to 86513. Made up some number.\\n\\n\\n\\nThink about that. They were suppressing the vote, whoever did that, by putting those images up. They were trying to get people not to go to the voting booths because they would think they could just text their vote in. To me, that's a crime.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut that is what we are talking about when we talk about social media.\\n\\n\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\n\\n\\nSo that is why the name of the bill is the Honest Ads Act. Mitch McConnell won't let it come forward. The citizens of this country should demand it.\\n\\n\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\n\\n\\nCOOPER: I want to -- as president, in your first phone call with Vladimir Putin, what would you say to him?\\n\\n\\n\\nKLOBUCHAR: I would say hello.\\n\\n\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd I would say -- I would, first of all, make very clear that I will stand up for our democracy and stand up for human rights, and go through exactly everything I think that has not been good.\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd then, then, I would say we should start talking about negotiating the nuclear agreements that we have for nuclear arms with Russia. One of them, unfortunately, Donald Trump has already gotten us out of, which has not made the world safer. The other one is called the New START Treaty. And it's going to end during a new president's term. And I would immediately start negotiating things.\\n\\n\\n\\nI think you can do two things at once. And the most important thing that we have to do is stand with our allies when it comes to Vladimir Putin.\\n\\n\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\n\\n\\nCOOPER: Also, I assume you'd allow your national security staff to listen in to the call?\\n\\n\\n\\nKLOBUCHAR: Yes, I would allow my national security staff to listen into the call. That is correct, Anderson.\\n\\n\\n\\nCOOPER: All right. Stay there. We have more questions for Senator Klobuchar right after this.\\n\\n\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\n\\n\\n[22:50:00] COOPER: And welcome back. We are live in Las Vegas with Senator Amy Klobuchar.\\n\\n\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\n\\n\\nI want to bring in Reverend James Kosko. He's a pastor from Reno, he's currently undecided. Reverend, welcome.\\n\\n\\n\\nKLOBUCHAR: OK. Hi, Reverend.\\n\\n\\n\\nQUESTION: Good afternoon, and, Senator Klobuchar, I want to welcome you back to Nevada.\\n\\n\\n\\nKLOBUCHAR: Thank you.\\n\\n\\n\\nQUESTION: It's good to have you here.\\n\\n\\n\\nKLOBUCHAR: Yes, I was just in Reno. it was great.\\n\\n\\n\\nQUESTION: Yes. I have a three-part question.\\n\\n\\n\\nKLOBUCHAR: Oh, I'd better stand up. OK.\\n\\n\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\n\\n\\nQUESTION: The good news is, they are kind of related.\\n\\n\\n\\nKLOBUCHAR: OK. Phew.\\n\\n\\n\\nQUESTION: As president, first of all, what joy can you bring back to this country? And, secondly, what will you do to make each of us proud to be an American? And, lastly, how will you reestablish our dignity and standing in the world community?\\n\\n\\n\\nKLOBUCHAR: OK.\\n\\n\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\n\\n\\nAll right. So the joy I will bring is the joy of loving people. And I really think that that kind of zest for enjoying being with people, even if you don't agree with everything they say, seems to be missing right now with this president.\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd you feel it, when you want to have a president -- I remember the old days, you look about being proud, your second part, being proud to be an American, you remember -- I do -- when my parents would put the TV on because the president was giving an address. And it might not be a president that they had voted for, or that they even terribly liked, but they felt it was important to watch the president because they wanted to teach that to me, but they also wanted to know what the president was saying, because they wanted to, as a citizen, understand that, so that they could have discussions with people and the like.\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd I think we've lost that right now. I think people are afraid when they see him at a rally, they need to mute the volume because they don't know what he's going to say. There are teachers that they want to teach in a neutral way about -- and they don't know, because the things that he says and does isn't what they're teaching the kids at school.\\n\\n\\n\\nI just think we need to bring that sense of decency back. And I know it's going to be boring when I don't send out a mean tweet at 5:00 in the morning. I know that, OK.\\n\\n\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\n\\n\\nI know that. And it's going to be really boring for the media. They're going to be like, oh, we've got to find something else. Because I just think that has become such a negative thing.\\n\\n\\n\\n[22:55:00]\\n\\n\\n\\nAt the beginning, people were shocked, and he always finds ways to distract us every single day. And then that makes it harder, right, to work on these long-term challenges, some of which we talked about, and things like bringing health care premiums down and doing something about climate change and all of those things. It makes it harder to do, because those are really hard things to work on, because you've got to have -- meet with people and you've got to draft a bill and do all these things. And he's just out there tweeting all the time. So I think that is -- that's the first thing.\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd then as far as our standing in the world -- so I did a speech to the Council on Foreign Relations. You can see it on our website at amyklobuchar.com, where you can also help us out. And the speech was about foreign relations and the five R's that I would bring to foreign policy. It's not reading, writing, and 'rithmetic.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt's, first of all, renewing American leadership in the world. It's secondly -- don't worry, I won't go through them that long -- the second one is to repair our relationships with our allies, something we've talked about tonight. The third one is to renegotiate back into international agreements. I mentioned the Russian nuclear arms agreements, but also the Iranian nuclear agreement, which this president got us out of, which I didn't think was the right thing.\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd the fourth thing would be to respond appropriately when things come up around the world, instead of doing tweets in the bathrobe at 5:00 in the morning. And then the fifth thing is to reassert American values around the world. And it really comes down to one R, and that would be to renew sanity. Return to sanity in our foreign policy.\\n\\n\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\n\\n\\nCOOPER: Senator Amy Klobuchar.

{"original": "Joe Biden's campaign distributed talking points to surrogates ahead of the Iowa caucuses this week that signal a campaign concerned about spinning a recent spat with Bernie Sanders as the former vice president defending himself and not attacking the Vermont senator.\\n\\nThe 20-page document, which was provided to CNN, was sent ahead of an influx of Biden surrogates headed to Iowa this weekend, days ahead of the state's critical caucuses. The guide includes details on all of Biden's policy positions but leads with key questions that surrogates could be confronted with, including former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, impeachment and the tense back-and-forth between Biden and Sanders over Social Security.\\n\\nThe Biden campaign declined to comment on the content of the talking points.\\n\\nThe guide argues that Biden didn't go negative on Bernie and was just responding to attacks on his record.\\n\\nThe truth is – Bernie and his allies have viciously distorted Joe's record on Social Security in robocalls, digital ads, and email blasts, the talking points argue. Fact checkers called his attack false. New York Times columnist Paul Krugman called it a flat-out lie.\\n\\nThey add:\\n\\nJoe's campaign is correcting the record to clarify his position on Social Security, not attacking Bernie. It's is making clear what Joe has committed: as president, he'll not only protect and defend Social Security, but boost benefits for the most vulnerable.\\n\\nBiden and Sanders, ahead of the caucuses, have been in a heated back-and-forth that began with their positions on Social Security but devolved into Biden questioning Sanders' allegiance to the Democratic Party, an accusation he later walked back.\\n\\nBiden's campaign is also seeking to downplay the growing operation that Bloomberg has built in key Super Tuesday states that will vote on March 3.\\n\\nMike Bloomberg has spent nearly a quarter of a billion dollars on ads alone, and Joe Biden is still in the lead, nationally and in Super Tuesday states, the document reads. After the first four states vote, Joe will have demonstrated that he has the broadest, most diverse coalition, and that he's the strongest candidate to beat Donald Trump.\\n\\nThe talking points also directed surrogates on how to talk about Biden's son, Hunter, and the possibility of him testifying before the Senate impeachment trial. That possibility is now moot given Republicans won a vote in the Senate on Friday to have no witnesses during the trial."}

Bluntly, Brexit has shone a light on the fact that the foundations holding up the UK had been crumbling for some time.\\n\\nThe current deadlock in Westminster – and what it might mean for the union between England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland – is spooking politicians from all over the political divide.\\n\\nJacob Rees-Mogg, a longstanding Conservative Euroskeptic, told me earlier this week: The two greatest risks to the union are splitting Northern Ireland from Great Britain, as the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement with the EU proposes, and a second referendum, which would legitimize the calls for a second independence vote in Scotland.\\n\\nThe movement in the UK's politics and resulting divisions is nicely illustrated by the last eight years of its voting history.\\n\\nThe two greatest risks to the union are splitting Northern Ireland from Great Britain, as the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement with the EU proposes, and a second referendum, which would legitimize the calls for a second independence vote in Scotland. Jacob Rees-Mogg\\n\\nLet's take the 2010 general election as a starting point, in which voters opted for a coalition between David Cameron's Conservative Party and Nick Clegg's Liberal Democrats. These two centrists looked like a safe pair of hands at a time of turmoil in the immediate aftermath of the 2008 global financial crisis.\\n\\nOver the five years of the coalition, austerity measures were introduced that made most politics junkies certain that Labour would win back power under its then leader, Ed Miliband.\\n\\nBut a shock result in 2015 saw Cameron win a majority in Parliament. Scotland voted for the pro-independence Scottish Nationalist Party in huge numbers. After the failed Scottish independence referendum a year earlier, the general election result was a clear sign of just how wide the gap between England and Scotland had become.\\n\\nFast forward past the Brexit referendum and Cameron's own exit to Theresa May's 2017 snap election for more clues. Many voters in pro-Brexit areas of England snubbed her in favor of Labour's Jeremy Corbyn – who at the time had an unclear position on Brexit, though much of his party is pro-Europe. She lost her majority, but strangely picked up votes in Remain-supporting Scotland, despite her party backing the very definition of a so-called hard Brexit.\\n\\nPHOTO: TOLGA AKMEN/AFP/Getty Images Britain's Prime Minister Theresa May leaves from 10 Downing Street on December 17, 2018.\\n\\nClearly, the British public is divided – and that division is especially acute in the politics of the four nations.\\n\\nIn England, the UK's wealthiest and most populous city, London, stands in contrast to the rest of the country.\\n\\nIt is from London that the campaign for a second vote that could ultimately stop Brexit is being driven. But it was English votes that carried the victory for Leave. This creates tension not just in England, but in the union at large – the politics of the English are the most influential in the union and can often dictate policy that affects everyone.\\n\\nIn the case of Brexit, that means Scottish remainers feeling as though the English are dragging them out of the EU against their will. Alarmingly for unionists, recent polling showed that English Conservative voters (officially called the Conservative and Unionist Party) would be happy with the union breaking up in exchange for a good Brexit.\\n\\nThe division is more obvious in Scotland. The SNP would clearly like to push for a second independence referendum and rejoin the EU as an independent nation. Meanwhile, Scottish Conservatives would clearly prefer a softer form of Brexit to protect Scotland's economy while keeping the union together – something about which they disagree with their English counterparts.\\n\\nIn Northern Ireland, the devolved National Assembly has not sat in nearly two years after the power-sharing agreement that allows both unionists and republicans to be involved in government collapsed.\\n\\nDespite this, the Democratic Unionist Party holds the balance of power in Westminster and is currently one of the biggest obstacles to May getting her Brexit deal through Parliament.\\n\\nThey believe the deal ignores their most important demand: no friction between Northern Ireland and Great Britain. We do not want a hard border, we believe there are many ways of resolving it, the DUP's Emma Little-Pengelly said to me of the Irish border issue. Instead, she believes that May and the EU's solution aims to ensure no checks at all on the Irish border between two sovereign states by creating 68 new checks between Great Britain and Northern Ireland.\\n\\nIt must be worrying for the DUP that both those wanting May's deal to pass and hardline Brexit voters are so happy to see their red lines rubbed out for the sake of getting the job done.\\n\\nPHOTO: PAUL FAITH/AFP/AFP/Getty Images Traffic crosses the border into Northern Ireland from the Irish Republic.\\n\\nOne thing seems to have been forgotten by politicians in all this: some people in Brussels speak English. The UK's chaos has been watched with astonishment by EU officials.\\n\\nIt's still not clear what the UK wants, Guy Verhofstadt, Brexit coordinator for the EU Parliament, told CNN. I hope the deal agreed finds a majority. If not, then MPs have to work together to find a compromise solution on a future relationship. Whatever the choice, we need a withdrawal agreement to be agreed to avoid a disastrous no-deal outcome.\\n\\nLoathe as many in Westminster will be to take advice from a former Prime Minister of Belgium, he makes a solid point. Wild politics is not a good enough reason for a nation as important as the UK to fall into a black hole of its own creation.\\n\\nIt's still not clear what the UK wants. Guy Verhofstadt\\n\\nThe good news is that as things stand, both main parties believe the union should be preserved. It shouldn't be beyond the wit of our elected officials to forge some cross-party unity on a matter they claim to care so much about.\\n\\nAs Brexit reaches its apex, perhaps the minds of the political elite will sharpen and we will all start to see a way out of this hellscape. They need to make the public care about the union, or frankly, it's only going to crumble further.\\n\\nIf that doesn't happen, then the UK as we know it will have to continue to exist on life support.\\n\\nAnd if we don't take this moment to fix the union between the four nations, then distressingly few will be in mourning, should the switch get flipped."}

These contracts either ran out in December or are expiring this month. Another 550 contracts are set to lapse in February.\\n\\nThose contracts cover around 130,000 households, who have an average income of $12,000 a year. Many tenants are elderly or disabled.\\n\\nWith no sign of the shutdown ending soon, HUD has asked landlords to draw on their reserves to cover any shortfalls. The Washington Post first reported the development earlier this week.\\n\\nThe Trump administration is taking steps to shield some low-income Americans from the impact of the partial government shutdown, which started in late December. The Department of Agriculture on Tuesday extended the time it can provide food stamps and other nutritional assistance programs to the end of February, a month later that the agency originally announced.\\n\\nHUD officials suggested that the expiration of the rental contracts likely won't prompt landlords to begin eviction proceedings immediately.\\n\\nIt's never been our experience that people were evicted by virtue of a government shutdown, a HUD official told CNN. It would run counter to the best interests of the landlords.\\n\\nBut the building owners may have to delay repairs or suspend services they provide, such as transportation, after-school care or social programs, experts said. Eventually, they may have to raise the rent on those living in the apartments, they said.\\n\\nUnder the program, tenants pay 30% of their household income, while the federal government makes up the rest of the rent, which is based on the local market.\\n\\nWithout getting that rental assistance, owners will be forced to make very difficult choices, Ellen Lurie Hoffman, federal policy director of the National Housing Trust, told CNN's Brianna Keilar.\\n\\nLandlords will likely turn to the money they've set aside, if they have any, but they are also looking at other options to continue meeting their operating needs. These include reaching out to their lenders about getting a break on their mortgages if the shutdown continues, said Andrea Ponser, executive vice president for policy at Stewards of Affordable Housing for the Future, a collaborative of non-profit affordable housing owners.\\n\\nA longer-term concern is that the uncertainty may prompt landlords to wash their hands of the program, especially in neighborhoods with fewer low-income residents.\\n\\nSome owners, because of experiences like this, will choose not to renew their contracts, said Doug Rice, senior policy analyst at the Center on Budget & Policy Priorities. In that case, there's a permanent loss of affordable housing in those communities.\\n\\nOverall, the agency's project-based rental assistance program serves 1.2 million households. HUD has said that it has funding to make payments on active contracts through February, but the payments are set to stop after that.\\n\\nTwo other agency programs for low-income Americans are more secure – at least for the next few weeks, Rice said. The department said last week that it can continue making payments to state and local housing authorities for public housing maintenance and upkeep and for housing vouchers given to low-income residents through February. These two programs serve about 3.2 million households.\\n\\nStill, some authorities may be hesitant to issue vouchers to new applicants until Congress sets the appropriation because they won't know how much funding they'll receive, Rice said.\\n\\nCNN's Athena Jones contributed to this report."}

The Mexican government reaffirmed on January 18, 2018 that they will not pay for US President Donald Trump's controversial border wall and warned that the violence in Mexico is also the result of the heavy drug consumption in the United States. / AFP PHOTO / Herika MARTINEZ (Photo credit should read HERIKA MARTINEZ/AFP/Getty Images)\\n\\n(CNN) —\\n\\nPresident Donald Trump made a televised appeal to Americans on Tuesday for his long-promised border wall, offering familiar warnings but scant detail on how he will negotiate an end to a partial government shutdown that will cost some federal workers their paychecks this week.\\n\\nIn an address to the nation meant to convince Americans of a swelling border crisis that was at times belied by facts, the President gave little indication he is nearing a compromise that might reopen the federal government.\\n\\nIn their response minutes after Trump concluded on Tuesday, the top Democrats in Congress demonstrated an equally entrenched stance.\\n\\nWith neither side appearing to budge after a high-stakes battle of messaging, the situation appeared unchanged as some federal workers prepare for their first missed paycheck and many agencies remain dark.\\n\\nAs expected, the President used the first Oval Office address of his presidency to warn of a growing humanitarian and security crisis at our southern border.\\n\\nBut he did not declare the situation a national emergency, stopping short of a move he's openly weighed in the past days that could secure funding but would likely face a legal challenge.\\n\\nThe immigration matter, Trump intoned, is a crisis of the heart, and a crisis of the soul.\\n\\nAltogether, the President used the word crisis six times in his remarks, seeking to imbue a deadlocked debate over funding with a new sense of urgency.\\n\\nSpeaking from behind the Resolute Desk, Trump said the US could no longer accommodate immigrants who enter the country illegally and implored those who support him to contact their elected representatives.\\n\\nHow much American blood must we shed before Congress does its job? he asked. This is a choice between right and wrong, justice and injustice. This is about whether we fulfill our sacred duty to the American citizens we serve.\\n\\nHe castigated politicians who have deemed his proposed wall immoral, painting them as hypocrites.\\n\\nThe only thing that is immoral is the politicians to do nothing and to continue to allow more innocent people to be so horribly victimized, he said.\\n\\nAfter weeks of a partial government shutdown, Trump and his negotiators have made little headway in convincing Democrats a barrier is needed before agencies can reopen and federal workers can begin receiving paychecks again.\\n\\nThe administration has steadfastly refused to take steps that would restore funding to some agencies, believing the shutdown is its best leverage to secure the wall funds. Fearing he could lose a messaging battle as more Americans feel the pain of a shuttered government, Trump escalated his warnings that the country is unsafe without the border wall he promised as a candidate.\\n\\nIn making his case, Trump turned for the first time to one of the most recognizable symbols of the American presidency – an eight-minute direct-to-camera evening address from the Oval Office.\\n\\nThe idea for the shift in strategy was raised over the past week by top aides, who believed the administration's messaging was not resonating with Americans. The idea had been championed by, among others, the acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, and was a topic of discussion at a weekend senior staff retreat at Camp David.\\n\\n04:48 - Source: CNN Democratic leaders respond to Trump's address\\n\\nInside the White House, some viewed the quiet week between Christmas and New Year's Day as a lost opportunity that could have been used to drive home an urgent message about the necessity of a border wall while Congress was out of town.\\n\\nTrump was initially resistant, but was convinced by aides to adopt a new approach as it became clear his entreaties about securing funding for a wall were not gaining traction.\\n\\nTrump will continue the push in the following days, paying a visit to the Texas border town of McAllen on Thursday to highlight the situation.\\n\\nOn Wednesday, he'll join Republican senators during their weekly lunch. Later he'll return to the White House to resume talks with Democratic and Republican congressional leaders, though it wasn't yet clear whether either side would come offering new elements of a compromise.\\n\\nThis situation could be resolved in a 45-minute meeting, Trump said in his remarks.\\n\\nWhether the authoritative setting of Tuesday's remarks will convince more Americans there truly is a security crisis at the southern border remains an open question. Trump spoke to Americans while he suffers from a credibility lapse after he and his aides have repeated multiple false claims about immigration.\\n\\nFacts undercut the administration's portrait of a nation under siege by terrorists and criminals crossing the southern border; in July 2017, the State Department said there was no credible information that any member of a terrorist group has traveled through Mexico to gain access to the United States.\\n\\nThe administration's own figures show vastly more known or suspected terrorists were apprehended at airports.\\n\\nTrump and top White House officials have in recent days begun speaking more about the humanitarian crisis at the border, which Democrats say is real but of the administration's own making. A surge of families seeking asylum has strained health and child care facilities, and two children have died in US custody.\\n\\nNational emergency?\\n\\n02:42 - Source: CNN Avlon lays out the facts on border security\\n\\nIn the lead-up to the address, the President and his advisers made a public show of considering a national emergency declaration to secure funding for the border wall, a drastic step that would surely be challenged in court. Vice President Mike Pence refused in a string of morning television appearances to say whether a declaration would come during the evening speech.\\n\\nThe White House counsel's office continues to deliberate on the legality of the step. Trump has been under pressure from informal advisers and allies to take the step, which officials was still possible in the coming days.\\n\\nA source close to Trump told CNN's Jim Acosta on Tuesday that the President has been working the phones seeking advice from friends and aides in recent days about whether he should declare an emergency at the border in order to secure funding for the wall. The source said Trump has been told by several of his allies and advisers that a declaration probably won't work from a legal standpoint, though hasn't ruled one out entirely.\\n\\nAnother adviser to Trump said the President has been receiving advice telling him he should declare the state of emergency so he has something to sell to his base – and that if the step is held up in the courts, Trump can still say he tried.\\n\\nWork in progress\\n\\n02:53 - Source: CNN Brianna Keilar: Trump is pushing lies\\n\\nMidday on Tuesday, Trump was working closely with top aides, including policy adviser Stephen Miller, on drafts of the speech.\\n\\nDemocrats had a chance to rebut the President in a subsequent address on Tuesday; all the television networks that agreed to air Trump's remarks also agreed to air Democrats' response, delivered jointly by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer. The pair stood somewhat awkwardly side-by-side in a Capitol hallway for their five-minute long rebuttal.\\n\\nPresident Trump must stop holding the American people hostage, must stop manufacturing a crisis and must reopen the government, Pelosi said.\\n\\nTrump chose to deliver the address after weekend talks between administration officials and Democrats failed to generate a deal that could reopen the parts of government closed by the shutdown.\\n\\nThe closures have become more apparent this week, as more Americans return from holiday vacations to find some federal services unavailable. Most federal workers affected by the shutdown were due to receive paychecks on Friday; without an agreement, they won't be paid.\\n\\nTrump has insisted in public that unpaid workers are understanding in their plight, and that he feels their pain.\\n\\nBut in private, the President has worried an extended shutdown could erode his political support as more Americans feel the effects. Yet he's also fretted that failing to deliver on the border wall – his chief campaign vow – would hurt him with his conservative base.\\n\\nCNN's Jim Acosta and Phil Mattingly contributed to this report.\\n\\nThis story has been updated."}

Nicole Mason C. Nicole Mason\\n\\nGains in the stock market and the robust economy obscure the reality that many of the most marginalized workers, those with limited skills and education, are still struggling. Under Trump, the wealthy are doing extremely well, while the middle-class is hanging on.\\n\\nOn Friday, more than 800,000 federal workers across the country will go without a paycheck if the government fails to reopen. Trump says these workers will make adjustments as the shutdown could last months, even years. This, no doubt, will have a trickle-down effect on small businesses and others who rely on these workers to purchase goods and products.\\n\\nThe wall between Mexico and the United States, cheered by Trump's most ardent supporters as a metaphorical and political symbol of America First, has lost its appeal to some as the government shutdown has dragged on. Furloughed workers and those who sympathize with them have begun to realize the wall will not feed their families, keep their lights on or make sure their mortgage is paid.\\n\\nBut there are other reasons American workers may be disenchanted with the President. Trump campaigned on a promise to bring back coal mining jobs. Yet, as Bloomberg reported, analysts say that Trump's plan for the coal industry is not likely to have a large effect on its fortunes.\\n\\nAt campaign rallies and in interviews, Trump likes to say that he turned the West Virginia economy around by cutting energy regulations, but over the last decade, middle-class West Virginia households have seen no overall income gains from the state's modest economic growth, and there has been no sustained surge in the state's economy under Trump. These kinds of results will continue unless we are able to turn away from the divisive politics and rhetoric, and focus on building an economy that works for the majority of Americans – not just the few.\\n\\nWorking-class black and Latino Americans are also losing under Trump. In his address to the nation Tuesday night, President Trump asserted that illegal migration hurts all Americans by driving down jobs and wages, specifically impacting African-Americans and Hispanics. This is a bid to whip up support among both groups for the wall and his nativist immigration policies.\\n\\nWhile it is true that African-Americans and Hispanics tend to be employed in lower wage jobs than white and Asian workers, and compete in the labor market with undocumented immigrants for those jobs, it cannot be ignored that some US employers and corporations often exploit immigrant labor for their gain, by paying them less, forcing them to work in deplorable conditions, or threatening to deport them if they complain.\\n\\nThese habits not only harm undocumented immigrants, but American middle-class workers as well by suppressing wages and making it nearly impossible to demand safer working conditions or benefits without the fear of being fired. If Trump is concerned about the well-being of these black and Hispanic American workers, he should do more than suggest a wall to address the income disparity.\\n\\nCome March, if the government fails to reopen, tens of millions of Americans could lose their Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits, putting their families at risk of food insecurity. According to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, in 2017, 42 million Americans participated in the SNAP program – and more than 44% of them were in working families. It is hard to accept that this protracted and partisan skirmish over a wall could soon bring real hardship to the lives of the most vulnerable Americans.\\n\\nGet our free weekly newsletter Sign up for CNN Opinion's new newsletter.\\n\\nJoin us on Twitter and Facebook\\n\\nIn 2016, the white working class was cautiously optimistic, while others of us held our breath for the deal-maker and mega-businessman Donald Trump to work his magic to bring back jobs and revive struggling industries.

Sydney Airport is pictured here.\\n\\nMeanwhile, to its west will stand the Central River City. This is where Parramatta, a suburb of Sydney with a population of just under 26,000, is located.

The most populous city in Australia has announced that it wants to split into three cities – in as little as 20 years' time.\\n\\nThe radical Greater Sydney Region Plan: a Metropolis of Three Cities plan was released last month by the Greater Sydney Commission, a government agency responsible for land use.\\n\\nThe divide aims to tackle problems such as major population growth, sky-high housing prices and increasingly congested commutes. Splitting one city into three, the commission says, will give residents better access to housing, jobs and services across the board.\\n\\nWe want quality of life for all Sydneysiders, a spokesman from the commission tells CNN.\\n\\nThe Sydney triplets would be called the Eastern Harbour City, Central River City and Western Parkland City. But how do you split a city of millions of people into three?\\n\\nA tale of three cities\\n\\nSydney's population is set to double over the next 40 years, from 4.8 million in 2016 to eight million by 2056. With almost half of that population residing in the Eastern Harbour district, home to world famous landmarks such as Bondi Beach and the Sydney Opera House, as well as key amenities including Sydney Airport and the Central Business District, Sydney faces a huge problem of overcrowding in a concentrated area.\\n\\nRead: The urban farms greening Paris\\n\\nBy creating three cities out of one, officials are hoping to persuade residents to live in a more diverse range of locations.\\n\\nThe cornerstone of this strategy is creating 30-minute cities: those where all residents will live within a half-an-hour commute of the nearest metropolitan center. Different modes of transport will be introduced to make this happen, including new motorways and train lines.\\n\\nFurthermore, each of Sydney's three cities would be connected with each other through new transport links, turning Sydney into three unique but connected cities.\\n\\nIt's not going to be a quick fix, however.\\n\\nI think the railways and motorways are going to take a long time to get off the ground, because the railways need subsidies for a start, says Glen Searle, an associate professor in planning at the University of Sydney and the University of Queensland, who formerly worked in planning policy for the New South Wales government.\\n\\nBut that work needs to be done most people can agree.\\n\\nSydney is a city that has never really invested deeply in a cohesive plan for being congruent – at least until now, says Amadou Doumbia, a New Yorker who moved to Sydney eight months ago. You look at the city center and it's towering with soaring corporate buildings or incredible colonial era buildings. But the minute you leave these areas, you're faced with a 'city' that feels half metropolis and half suburban.\\n\\nThe government has not yet said how much will be invested in creating new transport or where it will come from.\\n\\nRead: Is this the world's worst city for traffic?\\n\\nSydney as we know it\\n\\nCurrently, there is a high preference for living in the Eastern Harbour City, which is home to iconic landmarks such as the Sydney Opera House, says Searle.\\n\\nGreater density gives you greater vibrancy around the central area, he says. Also, the climate in eastern Sydney is much better than the climate in western Sydney. Eastern Sydney has a sea breeze in the summer heat.\\n\\nBut with that popularity comes high housing prices in eastern Sydney, he adds. It's partly because of access to jobs and cultural facilities.\\n\\nThe median price of a house in Sydney is $914,000, while the national median price is $630,000, as of December 2017.\\n\\nUnder the new plan, the Eastern Harbour City will build on its recognized economic strength – but also support the other two cities to ensure growth isn't concentrated in this region.\\n\\nA new CBD?\\n\\nIn the Central River City, about 30 kilometers from Sydney's current Central Business District sits the suburbian town of Parramatta. With a population of about 25,800, Parramatta is widely seen as Sydney's second central business district.\\n\\nIf you can really build up Parramatta … a lot of people in western Sydney would probably commute to Parramatta rather than to our current Central Business District, says Peter Phibbs, a professor of urban and regional planning and policy at the University of Sydney.\\n\\nRead: Could gentrification save some cities?\\n\\nUnder the proposal, an economic corridor will be formed that runs through Parramatta focusing on world-class health, education and research institutions as well as finance, business services and administration. New rail links will improve growth prospects of the area.\\n\\nAn 'aerotropolis'\\n\\nBut perhaps the most important – an interesting – part of the plan is to transform western Sydney into an aerotropolis – a metropolitan sub-region where the layout, infrastructure, and economy are centered on an airport.\\n\\nWestern Sydney is traditionally associated with the underprivileged and high rates of crime. But with Western Sydney Airport due to open there in 2026, an estimated 28,000 jobs are set to be created in the area. The three cities in total will create 817,000 jobs, the report says.\\n\\nPhotos: The world's worst cities for rush hour traffic PHOTO: FREDERIC J.

But I pointed out, there are places where we agree on a whole series of policy fronts. But there are places that I think the President can, if you will, elevate his game and do a better job to help bring us together as a nation.\\n\\nOn Tuesday, The Washington Post published an op-ed written by Romney, where he said the Trump presidency made a deep descent in December – referencing the several high-profile departures from the administration, including Defense Secretary Mattis and White House chief of staff John Kelly.\\n\\nIn his interview on CNN's The Lead with Jake Tapper, Romney said the departure of Mattis as well as Trump's abrupt move to exit Syria were precipitating events in deciding to pen a scathing op-ed earlier this week slamming Trump's character.\\n\\nI think it's important, as I begin this new job, to make it very clear where I stand, Romney said. And I also note that the departure of Secretary Mattis and the decision to pull out of Syria and the abrupt way it was done was a precipitating event for my finally going on this record.\\n\\nRomney did say he planned to side with Trump and other Republicans on the border wall.\\n\\nI would vote for the border wall. I've made that part of my platform for many, many years, he said. I think we should have a border wall on our southern border, and whether it's a wall or fence or technology and perhaps in some cases the natural landscape prevents people from coming in, but we've got to secure our border.\\n\\nRomney also noted that there were several times he split with the current administration's handling of situations.\\n\\nWell, over the course of the last two years, I have put out a number of statements that relate to things that were of great concern to me. The Charlottesville response by the President was something that gave me great concern. The support for Roy Moore in the senate race was something I was very, very concerned about. His attack on the media, Romney told Tapper.\\n\\nAlthough Romney notes in his op-ed there are areas that he agrees with the Trump administration's policies, like appointing conservative judges and remove excessive regulations, the New Year's Day piece was also a detailed critique of Trump's character.\\n\\nA president should demonstrate the essential qualities of honesty and integrity, and elevate the national discourse with comity and mutual respect, Romney wrote.\\n\\nAs a nation, we have been blessed with presidents who have called on the greatness of the American spirit. With the nation so divided, resentful and angry, presidential leadership in qualities of character is indispensable. And it is in this province where the incumbent's shortfall has been most glaring.\\n\\nRomney, although an incoming senator for Utah, also served as governor of Massachusetts and was the 2012 Republican nominee for president. He will be sworn in as a new member of Congress on Thursday, a role that Trump endorsed him for during the midterm election.\\n\\nWhen asked by Tapper if he regretted accepting Trump's endorsement, Romney said, He was endorsing me, I wasn't endorsing him.\\n\\nRomney, who was also floated as a potential choice to serve as secretary of state when Trump was initially building his administration, said he didn't think Trump followed through on his promise to act more presidential after the election.\\n\\nWell, you know, after he was elected president, it was very much my hope that he would rise to the occasion, rise to the mantle of the office, Romney said. After all, becoming President of the United States is quite an elevation for anybody. And he has said during the campaign that he could be extraordinary presidential.\\n\\nHe later added: I think that while he spoke of that, and while that was my hope, I don't think he's followed through on that front the way he's followed through on some of his other promises.\\n\\nTrump responded to Romney's op-ed on Twitter Wednesday morning, calling on Romney to be united with the party and focus on border security.\\n\\nHere we go with Mitt Romney, but so fast! Question will be, is he a Flake? I hope not. Would much prefer that Mitt focus on Border Security and so many other things where he can be helpful. I won big, and he didn't. He should be happy for all Republicans. Be a TEAM player & WIN! Trump tweeted on Wednesday, also referencing outgoing Republican Sen. Jeff Flake from Arizona, who became a notable Trump critic during his final term.\\n\\nFlake told CNN late Wednesday he wasn't surprised by Trump's tweet, and that he thought Romney's op-ed was great and a good thing.\\n\\nI think it said things that need to continually be said, and so I applaud Mitt Romney for saying that, Flake told CNN's Anderson Cooper on Anderson Cooper 360.\\n\\nTrump reiterated his message for Romney during a cabinet meeting on Wednesday, saying that he wished Romney could be more of a team player.\\n\\nI will say this, if he fought really hard against President Obama like he does against me, he would have won the election, Trump said. Does that make sense to you? If he fought the way he fights me, I'm telling you, he would have won the election. But I think he's going to end up being a team player.\\n\\nTrump firing back against Romney was met with support from Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel, who is also Romney's niece.\\n\\nPOTUS is attacked and obstructed by the MSM media and Democrats 24/7. For an incoming Republican freshman senator to attack @realdonaldtrump as their first act feeds into what the Democrats and media want and is disappointing and unproductive, McDaniel tweeted in support of Trump on Wednesday.\\n\\nFormer FBI Director James Comey, whom Trump fired in May 2017, also weighed in on Twitter, posting Wednesday night: Looks like the Republican tent is too small to fit integrity.

Prev Next\\n\\nNovek, a Connecticut native, is blunt in his assessment of current methods.\\n\\nPresent technologies for capturing CO2, or separating emissions into pure CO2, are fundamentally flawed, he argues. They are prohibitively expensive, Novek says, and due to being energy-intensive, somewhat counterproductive.\\n\\nHe claims his solution can capture over 90% of CO2 emitted by coal or natural gas power plants while operating at $5-8 per ton of carbon dioxide – substantially cheaper than other carbon capture technologies, he argues.\\n\\nI've discovered a very different approach that enables the technology to be entirely powered by waste heat from a power plant – not just any waste heat, but the ultra-low temperature, worthless waste heat, he says, referring to the thermal pollution we see evaporating from cooling towers.\\n\\nNovek's method pumps flue gas emissions through a mixture of water and aqueous ammonia. CO2 in the flue gas binds to the ammonia forming a salt, while inert gases are released. The salt is then separated with a solvent and the carbon dioxide is captured. Finally, the mixture is separated using waste heat from the power plant to render the two components insoluble, allowing the ammonia and the solvent to be decanted for re-use.\\n\\nThe entire process uses non-toxic, non-volatile reagents, Novek adds. They're all commodity chemicals, so very inexpensive.\\n\\nIt's fantastic that people are innovating in this space, says Mac Dowell, but offers the caveat that while low operating costs are a positive, any method would need to be very quantitatively demonstrated that (it) also significantly reduces the capital cost of the CCS (carbon capture and storage) process.\\n\\nNonetheless, he describes the work as a small but important contribution in the field.\\n\\nHeading to market\\n\\nNovek's idea has won prizes at state and national science competitions. As a research fellow at the Elimelech Lab at Yale University, his method was peer-reviewed in 2016 and a US patent granted in April 2017. Now it's the cornerstone of Novek's company Innovator Energy.\\n\\nThe global demand for CO2 was estimated at 80 million metric tons in 2011, rising to a predicted 140 million metric tons in 2020 according to the Global Carbon Capture and Storage Institute. It's a tiny fraction of the 36 billion metric tons emitted in 2016, per the Global Carbon Project. Many academics, including Mac Dowell, advocate pumping captured carbon dioxide underground into saline aquifers; the best way, he says, to ensure it is locked away from the climate forever.\\n\\nPhotos: Solving the carbon problem PHOTO: All Canada Photos/Alamy Boundary Dam, Saskatchewan, Canada — Boundary Dam Carbon Capture and Storage Project in Estevan, Saskatchewan, captures approximately one million tons of CO2 per year according to the Global Carbon Capture and Storage Institute (GCCSI).

(Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images) (Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)\\n\\n(CNN) —\\n\\nAfter three years of decline, climate-change-causing carbon emissions rose sharply in the United States last year, according to new research.\\n\\nCarbon emissions increased 3.4% in 2018, marking the second-largest annual gain in more than two decades, according to preliminary power generation data analyzed by the Rhodium Group, an independent economic policy research provider.\\n\\nThis follows a Global Carbon Project report in December that said global carbon emissions were estimated to rise by 2.7% for all of 2018.\\n\\nThe new research indicated that US power sector emissions as a whole rose by 1.9% and that the transportation sector held its title as the largest source of US emissions for the third year running, due to a growth in demand for diesel and jet fuel offsetting a modest decline in gasoline use.\\n\\nThe construction and industry sectors also saw sizable emission increases.\\n\\nMost of the increase last year was directly attributable to an increase in economic growth, said Trevor Houser, who leads Rhodium Group's Energy and Climate team, but he added that it does not have to be the case that a rising economy results in rising emissions.\\n\\nHouser said affordable technology exists to grow the economy while reducing emissions, but that requires policy to deploy those technologies in the market. And we've seen a freeze in that kind of policy at the federal level over the past few years.\\n\\nThe lack of strategy in the country's decarbonization efforts, the research says, has contributed to the gap in meeting the goal set in the Paris Agreement on climate change, a landmark 2015 accord that the US Trump administration has promised to abandon.\\n\\nPresident Trump has at times denied the basic science of climate change, which states that burning coal, oil and natural gas produces emissions that trap heat in the atmosphere, warming the planet. But it has become increasingly clear that warming is happening faster than previously thought and with worse results.\\n\\nIn November, the administration released its fourth national climate assessment outlining the dire environmental and economic impacts of climate change, stating that thousands of Americans could die and gross domestic product could take a 10% hit by century's end.\\n\\nTrump, who has called climate change a hoax, has rejected the report's conclusion that climate change could be devastating for the economy, saying, I don't believe it.\\n\\nHis administration has since made a series of policy and diplomatic decisions or statements that appear to run counter to all of the warnings in the report. None is designed to reduce fossil fuel emissions, as the report said is needed to combat extreme climate change.\\n\\nIn December, the Environmental Protection Agency proposed relaxing regulations for newly built coal-fueled power plants, which, combined with another proposal to replace the Obama-era Clean Power Plan, would overhaul the way coal-fired plants are built and regulated.\\n\\nThe move sent a political signal that the Trump administration is intent on shoring up the coal industry and other energy interests, and environmentalists worry that the proposed rule suggests the EPA will set new standards that would weaken the requirements that the agency uses to regulate other types of pollution.\\n\\nAt the G20 meeting in Argentina, just days after the release of that dire climate report, US diplomats insisted on noting that the United States reaffirmed its intention to withdraw from the Paris accord.\\n\\nWhen the US Geological Survey announced a major discovery of oil and natural gas underneath Texas and New Mexico in December, Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke called it a gift.\\n\\nThe Interior Department then proposed to cut protections that benefited the sage grouse, a grassland bird that lives in the Great Plains and Western states, which could allow for expanded oil and drilling.

{"original": "(CNN) Republican Sen. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee said late Thursday he would oppose calling witnesses in the Senate impeachment trial of President Donald Trump, a decision that means the trial is all but certain to come to a swift end without hearing from witnesses or subpoenaing documents.\\n\\nI worked with other senators to make sure that we have the right to ask for more documents and witnesses, but there is no need for more evidence to prove something that has already been proven and that does not meet the United States Constitution's high bar for an impeachable offense, Alexander said in a statement shortly after the Senate gaveled out of session Thursday evening.\\n\\nAlexander's decision makes it highly likely that Friday's vote on whether to seek additional witnesses will fail, with Republican senators coalescing around Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's argument that allowing witnesses would lead to an indefinite delay in the trial, prompt executive privilege concerns and have no impact on the outcome of the trial. A vote to end the trial could come as soon as Friday as well.\\n\\nMoments before Alexander's statement, Sen. Susan Collins of Maine became the first Republican to support calling witnesses, announcing in a statement she would support Friday's Senate vote for witnesses and documents, which she had pushed for before the trial began.\\n\\nI believe hearing from certain witnesses would give each side the opportunity to more fully and fairly make their case, resolve any ambiguities, and provide additional clarity. Therefore, I will vote in support of the motion to allow witnesses and documents to be subpoenaed, Collins said in a statement.\\n\\nSen. Mitt Romney of Utah will also vote for the motion Friday, an aide said, while Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska has not said how she'll vote, telling reporters as she left the Senate late Thursday night that she would read back through the two volumes of notes she's taken during the trial.\\n\\nI'm going to go back to my office, put some eye drops in so I can keep reading, she said, adding that she plans to announce her decision on Friday morning.\\n\\nBut even if Murkowski joins Collins and Romney to back witnesses, the Senate vote would end in a 50-50 tie, and Chief Justice John Roberts is seen as highly unlikely to intervene , meaning the vote would fail.\\n\\nDemocrats had hoped Alexander and a handful of other GOP senators would join them in calling for witnesses in the wake of former national security adviser John Bolton's revelations in his draft book manuscript about Trump conditioning US aid to Ukraine on investigations into Democrats. But Democrats' options for a fourth Republican to join them in Friday's witness vote appear to have evaporated.\\n\\nAlexander had been careful not to tip his hand before his statement, saying little as the witness vote approached. Halfway through the second day of questions, he spoke up for the first time in the trial, submitting a question for the House managers to compare the bipartisanship level of the Trump impeachment to the proceedings of Presidents Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton.\\n\\nKey clues from Senate questions\\n\\nOne sign of Alexander's vote came in the final hour of senator questions Thursday to the House impeachment managers and the President's legal team. Alexander and Murkowski both joined a question from Sen. Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican, asking the President's counsel whether the allegations from Bolton, if true, still would not rise to the level of an impeachable offense?\\n\\nIt was the last of several hints that emerged from the 180 questions that senators asked over two days. While it turned out to be a signal of how Alexander would vote, Murkowski remains a mystery. Earlier in the evening, she asked a pointed question of the President's team that cut in the other direction: raising the contradiction between the testimony of US Ambassador Gordon Sondland and statements from GOP Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin compared to the reporting about Bolton's book.\\n\\nThis dispute about material facts weighs in favor of calling additional witnesses with direct knowledge. Why should this body not call Ambassador Bolton? Murkowski asked.\\n\\nWhen Alexander asked his first question Thursday evening, it stirred activity from both Senate leaders. Rep. Zoe Lofgren, a California Democrat who was a staffer during the Nixon impeachment inquiry and a House member in the Clinton impeachment, responded that the Nixon impeachment effort wasn't always bipartisan -- it shifted only at the end, she said -- and that she was disappointed Republicans haven't joined with Democrats up to this point. You have an opportunity here, she said.\\n\\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, followed up the question by asking the House managers to explain how requesting witnesses could be done in a limited fashion. House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff, a California Democrat who is the lead impeachment manager, responded by arguing for a one-week period for closed-door depositions and a limited time for witness testimony for the trial, an effort to address Republican criticisms that witnesses would lead to endless delays.\\n\\nMcConnell, a Kentucky Republican, then asked his first question in the two days that senators have queried the House managers and the President's team, giving the defense counsel a chance to respond to the House's assertions about bipartisanship and impeachment.\\n\\nShortly after that question was asked, Alexander met with Murkowski during the dinner break, and told CNN leaving the meeting the two weren't coordinating.\\n\\nWe were just talking, Alexander said, adding that the group of swing senators are all doing things independently.\\n\\nLisa and I often talk about what we are doing, Alexander said.\\n\\nLike Wednesday's session, in which more than 90 questions were asked , many of the questions asked on Thursday were lobbed as friendly queries -- Democrats giving the managers the chance to make a point, and Republicans responding with the same tactic for the defense counsel. But key questions were interspersed both from undecided senators and to challenge the opposing side, which led to some illuminating and insightful -- and sometimes less than insightful -- responses.\\n\\nSenators on the fence\\n\\nOn Thursday, there were even a handful of bipartisan questions with the senators considered on the fence. Collins and Murkowski joined with Democratic Sens. Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona to the President's team: would the President adhere to the Logan Act and guarantee that private citizens would not be directed to conduct foreign policy unless they have been designated by the government.\\n\\nPatrick Philbin, a member of Trump's legal team, responded there was nothing wrong with the President directing his personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, to deal with Ukraine, but he also maintained that the former New York mayor was not conducting any policy with the country.\\n\\nAnother bipartisan question followed not long after from Murkowski and Democratic Sen. Brian Schatz of Hawaii, who asked where was the line between political actions and impeachable conduct.\\n\\nThe House managers often turned their attention to the key Republican senators.\\n\\nHouse Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler invoked Collins and Murkowski by name to circle back to their question from Wednesday about mixed motives with regard to the withholding of US aid and the push for investigations, charging that the defense team's argument was nonsense that mixed motives would exonerate the President.\\n\\nOnce you prove a corrupt act, that's it, Nadler said.\\n\\nCollins' later asked another question with several Republican colleagues about whether there were legitimate circumstances for a President to ask a foreign government to investigate a US citizen, including a political rival. Schiff answered that question, but the lead impeachment manager also pivoted back to the same mixed motives, question, making eye contact with Collins in his response as she took notes.\\n\\nSchiff made his pitch for the Senate to call witnesses.\\n\\nIf you have any question about whether the motive was mixed or not mixed, ask John Bolton, he said.\\n\\nPaul question rejected by Roberts\\n\\nThe Senate trial began Thursday with a quick and quiet ending to a behind-the-scenes fight that simmered throughout the day on Wednesday, as Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky pushed to ask a question that would have named the alleged whistleblower . Roberts signaled to senators earlier this week he would not read any questions that included the alleged name of the whistleblower, and GOP leaders tried to come to a resolution with Paul on Wednesday.\\n\\nMcConnell indirectly referenced the dispute at the start of Thursday's session. We've been respectful of the chief justice's unique position in reading our questions, I want to be able to continue to assure him that that level of consideration for him will continue, McConnell said.\\n\\nBut Paul insisted on asking the question, and he submitted it as the first GOP question. Roberts was handed Paul's tan card and read the question to himself for a moment. The presiding officer declines to read the question as submitted, Roberts said, moving onto the next question.\\n\\nPaul went to the Senate television studio right after the question was rejected, and read it there to reporters, which included the alleged name of the whistleblower and asked about connections with a member of Schiff's staff.\\n\\nLater in the day, a group of Republicans asked another question about the member of Schiff's staff and the alleged whistleblower that named only the committee aide. Roberts read that question.\\n\\nSchiff responded that he was appalled at the attacks on his staff, saying he would not respond to the smears coming from a newspaper article. Members of this body used to care about the protection of whistleblower identities. They didn't use to gratuitously attack members of committee staff. But now they do, Schiff said.\\n\\nThe President's personal attorney, Jay Sekulow, responded that the whistleblower has protection from retribution, but not complete anonymity.\\n\\nWe can't just say it's not a relevant inquiry to know who on the staff that conducted the primary investigation here was in communication with that whistleblower, especially after Mr. Schiff denied that he or his staff had even had any conversations with the whistleblower, Sekulow said.\\n\\nArguing about witnesses\\n\\nDemocrats, meanwhile, were incensed with several answers the President's team offered. Sen. Mark Warner, the top Senate Intelligence Committee Democrat, slammed the President's team for arguing foreign interference, in a sense, is OK if it doesn't fall into the classic definition of a campaign contribution.\\n\\nAnd numerous Democrats criticized Harvard law professor emeritus Alan Dershowitz for arguing the President cannot be impeached for a quid quo pro if he thinks he's acting in the national interest. If a President does something which he believes will help him get elected in the public interest, that cannot be the kind of quid pro quo that results in impeachment, Dershowitz said.\\n\\nRepublicans have gone from denying what the President did, to normalizing it by claiming every President does it, to now saying there's nothing wrong with it even if he did it, Schumer said Thursday.\\n\\nDershowitz tried to clean up the response on Twitter Thursday, saying: They characterized my argument as if I had said that if a president believes that his re-election was in the national interest, he can do anything. I said nothing like that, as anyone who actually heard what I said can attest.\\n\\nRepublicans defended the President's attorney. He makes a lot of very extreme examples to make his point, said GOP Sen. Kevin Cramer of North Dakota. I have a tendency to do the same thing from time to time and sometimes that can be misconstrued.\\n\\nWhile much of the focus is on the Republicans, some moderate Democrats have yet to say how they will vote on the outcome of the trial. Am I wrestling with it? Every minute of every day, Manchin said Thursday, adding he was still in shock over Dershowitz's comments.\\n\\nThis story has been updated with additional developments Thursday."}
{"original": "(CNN) —\\n\\nTwo House millennials on opposite sides of the political spectrum have proved it's possible to find common ground, at least when it comes to cannabis policy.\\n\\nDemocratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York recently tapped Dan Riffle, a former federal policy director at the Marijuana Policy Project, as a senior counsel and policy adviser. When she tweeted out a story about the hire from High Times, she added, #LegalizeIt, and demand justice for communities ravaged by the War on Drugs.\\n\\nRepublican Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida retweeted her and added, You had me at hello.\\n\\nYou had me at hello. https://t.co/LqgYnl6rHl — Matt Gaetz (@mattgaetz) January 10, 2019\\n\\nThat a self-described democratic socialist can share a drug policy stance with a man once called the Trumpiest congressman in Trump's Washington by GQ might have something to do with their ages. Millennials are more supportive of legalizing marijuana than older generations, with 74% backing it in a 2018 Pew poll. Ocasio-Cortez, 29, and Gaetz, 36, are in line with their peers.\\n\\nAnd although Democrats have led Republicans when it comes to backing legalization, Republican support has grown. In 2017 a Gallup poll found a majority of Republicans supported legalization for the first time. As of October 2018, 75% of Democrats, 71% of independents and 53% of Republicans supported legalization, per Gallup.\\n\\nGaetz represents the shift in his party. In 2018, he and Democratic Rep. Seth Moulton of Massachusetts teamed up on legislation that would require the Veterans Affairs Department to survey veterans on marijuana use and protect the benefits of veterans who disclose their marijuana use to VA doctors.\\n\\nGaetz also backed the Medical Cannabis Research Act, the first such legislation related to marijuana ever considered by a Republican-led Judiciary Committee, his office said.\\n\\nThis drug should not be in the same category as heroin and LSD, and we do not need to continue with a policy that turns thousands of young people into felons every year, Gaetz said in 2017. Nor do we need to punish the millions of people who are sick and seeking medical help – from pain, from muscle wasting, from chemotherapy-induced nausea.\\n\\nFormer House Speaker John Boehner also came out in support of weed. The Ohio Republican was opposed while he was the speaker, but last April he took a role on the board of advisers for Acreage Holdings, a cannabis company, and has spoken at cannabis investment events.\\n\\nThough Republicans like Gaetz might be rare in Congress now, should his party continue to evolve on cannabis policy, issues like medical marijuana, the war on drugs and legalization could one day become more bipartisan."}

Nicole Mason C. Nicole Mason\\n\\nGains in the stock market and the robust economy obscure the reality that many of the most marginalized workers, those with limited skills and education, are still struggling. Under Trump, the wealthy are doing extremely well, while the middle-class is hanging on.\\n\\nOn Friday, more than 800,000 federal workers across the country will go without a paycheck if the government fails to reopen. Trump says these workers will make adjustments as the shutdown could last months, even years. This, no doubt, will have a trickle-down effect on small businesses and others who rely on these workers to purchase goods and products.\\n\\nThe wall between Mexico and the United States, cheered by Trump's most ardent supporters as a metaphorical and political symbol of America First, has lost its appeal to some as the government shutdown has dragged on. Furloughed workers and those who sympathize with them have begun to realize the wall will not feed their families, keep their lights on or make sure their mortgage is paid.\\n\\nBut there are other reasons American workers may be disenchanted with the President. Trump campaigned on a promise to bring back coal mining jobs. Yet, as Bloomberg reported, analysts say that Trump's plan for the coal industry is not likely to have a large effect on its fortunes.\\n\\nAt campaign rallies and in interviews, Trump likes to say that he turned the West Virginia economy around by cutting energy regulations, but over the last decade, middle-class West Virginia households have seen no overall income gains from the state's modest economic growth, and there has been no sustained surge in the state's economy under Trump. These kinds of results will continue unless we are able to turn away from the divisive politics and rhetoric, and focus on building an economy that works for the majority of Americans – not just the few.\\n\\nWorking-class black and Latino Americans are also losing under Trump. In his address to the nation Tuesday night, President Trump asserted that illegal migration hurts all Americans by driving down jobs and wages, specifically impacting African-Americans and Hispanics. This is a bid to whip up support among both groups for the wall and his nativist immigration policies.\\n\\nWhile it is true that African-Americans and Hispanics tend to be employed in lower wage jobs than white and Asian workers, and compete in the labor market with undocumented immigrants for those jobs, it cannot be ignored that some US employers and corporations often exploit immigrant labor for their gain, by paying them less, forcing them to work in deplorable conditions, or threatening to deport them if they complain.\\n\\nThese habits not only harm undocumented immigrants, but American middle-class workers as well by suppressing wages and making it nearly impossible to demand safer working conditions or benefits without the fear of being fired. If Trump is concerned about the well-being of these black and Hispanic American workers, he should do more than suggest a wall to address the income disparity.\\n\\nCome March, if the government fails to reopen, tens of millions of Americans could lose their Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits, putting their families at risk of food insecurity. According to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, in 2017, 42 million Americans participated in the SNAP program – and more than 44% of them were in working families. It is hard to accept that this protracted and partisan skirmish over a wall could soon bring real hardship to the lives of the most vulnerable Americans.\\n\\nGet our free weekly newsletter Sign up for CNN Opinion's new newsletter.\\n\\nJoin us on Twitter and Facebook\\n\\nIn 2016, the white working class was cautiously optimistic, while others of us held our breath for the deal-maker and mega-businessman Donald Trump to work his magic to bring back jobs and revive struggling industries.

{"original": "(CNN) As I wrote this, the US Capitol building was being stormed by violent right-wing protestors trying to stop the peaceful transfer of power.\\n\\nThis was an attempted coup, encouraged by the President of the United States, in an attempt to derail today's congressional certification of the electoral vote that will lead to Joe Biden's inauguration in two weeks.\\n\\nDonald Trump's legacy is American carnage. Our country is far more divided and violent and deluded than before he entered office. His misrule has led to this moment, but it is not his responsibility alone. Trump's fear-fueled lies and extremism and conspiracy theories have been indulged for too long by partisans. His rhetoric has directly led to death threats against election officials who have done their job honestly and independently. Now we are all reaping what they've sown, as the President watches it all burn from within the White House. But then, there are some men who want to ruin if they cannot rule.\\n\\nMake no mistake: this is sedition. And it's coming at the hands of self-styled super-patriots who have been amped up by the President's lies about non-existent mass voter fraud to excuse losing a free and fair election by a large margin.\\n\\nThey are not conservatives -- they are radicals. Because patriots don't break the windows of the US Capitol building and storm inside when they lose an election. No hostile foreign power has done more damage to what President-elect Joe Biden called  the citadel of our democracy  since an invading British army burned down the Capitol in the War of 1812 . But certainly, the enemies of democracy have taken great comfort from their actions today.\\n\\nWe are still in the fog of war. But some things are clear. The politicians and hyper-partisans who have coddled this President's autocratic impulses have enabled this assault to our democracy. The Republican members of Congress -- like Senators Ted Cruz and Josh Hawley -- who have tried to benefit politically from contesting the election results without any concrete evidence of fraud are culpable in this violence because they have stoked its fears. So is Trump's attorney, Rudy Giuliani, who demanded  trial by combat  to resolve the election dispute at a Save America rally this morning, after his legal team lost some 60 cases in court because of an absence of evidence.\\n\\nThere is no reasoning with conspiracy theorists. There is no negotiating with extremists. The President's lies unleashed this mob. Responsible Republicans need to condemn it clearly -- or own it forever.\\n\\nIt's stunning but not surprising to see some self-styled constitutional conservatives -- who warned about mob violence and demanded law and order when it came to Black Lives Matter protests - immediately default to rationalizing this violence through a flurry of whataboutism . Folks who proclaimed facts don't care about your feelings suddenly seem to care about understanding the feelings of people who commit political violence. That's usually a definition of terrorism -- but these attackers were not contained or confronted or even arrested in large numbers. If they'd been Black or left wing or Muslim the reaction and calls for violent retribution by the President and his allies would have been deafening.\\n\\nThe mask has come off. The calls for law and order were really about race. The calls for respecting our democratic traditions apparently apply only to elections that Republicans win. The partisan divisions in our country are not about policy or even ideology anymore. It's now about whether you believe in facts and science and even democracy itself. This is what happens when hyper-partisans indulge extremism, lies and conspiracy theories for political expediency.\\n\\nWhile the Capitol building has been ransacked, left undiscussed is the fact that we just marked the deadliest day of the Covid-19 pandemic -- adding to the more than 350,000 Americans who have died because of Trump's denialism and misrule. This is also a mark of Trump's American carnage. He is unable to discharge the duties of the presidency without always thinking about himself first. That's why he couldn't bring himself to clearly and immediately condemn this violence. No wonder there are renewed calls -- even from some conservatives like John Podhoretz at Commentary -- to impeach and remove President Trump from office. There is certainly cause even if there is not time.\\n\\nGet our free weekly newsletter Sign up for CNN Opinion's new newsletter.

Did we mention Deez Nuts?\\n\\nTo say an election was the craziest or most controversial simply isn't objective. Sure, Trump has claimed victory despite Biden's projected win, questioned the voting system's integrity and suggested he might not step down, but is that more controversial than Congress picking a president? That's happened a few times.\\n\\nWe'll let you decide.

Whoever garnered the most votes was president, and second place took the vice presidency.\\n\\nThough problems with the system were apparent in 1796, the election of 1800 saw Jefferson tie with his Democratic-Republican running mate Aaron Burr. Both had 73 votes to Adams'$2 65.\\n\\nCongress would be called upon to break the tie. Enter Alexander Hamilton, the nation's first treasury secretary, founder of the Federalist Party and a man who did not care for Adams, Jefferson or Burr.\\n\\nNonetheless, Hamilton engaged in a campaign to convince the Federalists to vote for Jefferson, his lesser of three evils, writing in a letter that Mr. Burr loves nothing but himself – thinks of nothing but his own aggrandizement.\\n\\nThe House of Representatives didn't easily arrive at its decision, casting 35 ballots in a week before finally voting to name Jefferson the victor and Burr the veep on February 7, 1801.\\n\\nMaking the election all the zanier, the rivalry between Burr and Hamilton would continue for more than three years before Burr, still the sitting vice president, killed Hamilton in a duel.\\n\\n1824: 'Corrupt bargain'\\n\\nPHOTO: Getty Images Andrew Jackson called the 1824 election the corrupt bargain and promised to win in 1828.\\n\\nThis one was odd from the get-go, if only for the fact that the Federalist Party was on the cusp of extinction and all four candidates were Democratic-Republicans.\\n\\nAndrew Jackson, a war hero and statesman, won the popular vote by fewer than 39,000 ballots and took 99 Electoral College votes. Secretary of State John Quincy Adams secured 84, Treasury Secretary William Crawford won 41 and House Speaker Henry Clay had 37.\\n\\nWith no candidate earning a majority of the votes, the House again had to settle the deadlock, and Jackson was confident he would win the presidency given that he had won the popular vote and Electoral College. Because the House could choose among only three candidates, Clay got the boot.\\n\\nWe mentioned Clay was speaker, yes?\\n\\nWell, after a month of horse trading, many of Clay's supporters shifted their support to Adams, who would go on to win the majority of the House vote. Maryland, Illinois and Louisiana, which had cast most of their Electoral College votes for Jackson, as well as Kentucky, where Adams did not receive a single ballot in the popular vote, decided to back Adams.\\n\\nAfter his inauguration, Adams selected Clay as his secretary of state. Jackson was furious and accused Adams and Clay of a corrupt bargain. He vacated his Senate seat and vowed to win the 1828 election as a Washington outsider.\\n\\nBacked by his new party, the Democrats, Jackson made good on the promise, besting Adams, who by then was a leader in the National Republican Party.\\n\\n1860: Nation divided\\n\\nPHOTO: N. Spindler/Library of Congress A crowd gathers for the inauguration of Abraham Lincoln on March 4, 1861.\\n\\nThis election wasn't particularly close. Abraham Lincoln trounced John Breckinridge in an election that had one of the highest voter turnouts of all time.\\n\\nNo, the 1860 election was notable because it ripped the long-dominant Democratic Party – and thereby, the nation – in half.\\n\\nThe Supreme Court's Dred Scott decision of 1857, essentially legalizing slavery in all U.S. territories, had laid the battleground: The Republican Party largely opposed slavery but was reluctant to push for its prohibition in states that already had it, and the Democrats were unable at their 1860 convention to establish an official party line on slavery.\\n\\nAt a second convention that year, the Democrats nominated Sen. Stephen Douglas of Illinois, but many Southerners in the party defected and selected Breckinridge, who was vice president, as their man. Both would claim to be the official Democratic candidate.\\n\\nThe Constitutional Union Party, which had formed the year before and staged a campaign that basically ignored the issue of slavery, selected Sen. John Bell of Tennessee.\\n\\nThe Electoral College vote told the story. Lincoln snared only 40% of the popular vote, but in the Electoral College took most of the North, along with California and Oregon. Douglas came in second in the popular vote but took only Missouri (and three votes in New Jersey). Breckinridge took most of the South, along with Maryland and Delaware, and Bell's middle-of-the-road policies earned him the middle of the road: Tennessee, Kentucky and Virginia.\\n\\nWeeks after the election, South Carolina voted to secede, followed by six more Southern states. In February 1861, delegates from those states formed the Confederate States of America and selected Jefferson Davis as their president.\\n\\nIn April, a South Carolina militia would take Fort Sumter, and four more states would join the Confederacy.\\n\\n1872: Death of a candidate\\n\\nPHOTO: MPI/Getty Images Ulysses S. Grant attended Horace Greeley's funeral after his rival died before the Electoral College vote.\\n\\nSet aside that 1872 was the year suffragette Victoria Woodhull of the People's Party became the first woman to run for president. Also, forget that writer and abolitionist Frederick Douglass, her running mate, was the first African-American to be considered for the vice presidency. And never mind this was the year Susan B. Anthony would be arrested for illegal voting.\\n\\nNo, 1872 was strange because one of the primary candidates never saw the final Electoral College vote.\\n\\nHorace Greeley wasn't supposed to put up much of a fight in his bid to unseat President Ulysses S. Grant, but a schism in Grant's Republican Party made things a little more interesting.\\n\\nGrant, who led the Union armies that defeated the Confederacy, had not been so convincing in the Oval Office. The White House website describes him as out of his element and quotes one visitor who spoke of his puzzled pathos, as of a man with a problem before him of which he does not understand the terms.\\n\\nSome Republicans defected, becoming Liberal Republicans, and cast their lot with Greeley, a Democrat who would go on to snare 44% of the popular vote, almost 3 million ballots, despite ending his campaigning to tend to his sick wife, who died a week before the election.\\n\\nBefore the Electoral College could cast its votes, the newspaper founder died November 29, 1872, and 63 of his 66 votes were dispersed among Thomas Hendricks, who would later become vice president, and other Democrats.\\n\\nGrant attended his rival's funeral.\\n\\n1876: Not-so-independent tiebreaker\\n\\nPHOTO: Hulton Archive/Getty Images Rutherford B. Hayes' election as president also marked the end of Reconstruction in the South.\\n\\nDemocrat Samuel Tilden had beaten Republican Rutherford Hayes. He snared a quarter-million more ballots in the popular vote, and he had 19 more votes in the Electoral College.\\n\\nProblem was, Tilden was one Electoral College vote away from a majority of 185 votes, and four states composing a total of 20 votes – Florida, Louisiana, South Carolina and Oregon – were disputing the results. In the Southern states, each party was accusing the other of fraud.\\n\\nWith no precedent to lean on, the two parties agreed to establish a 15-member commission made up of seven Republicans, seven Democrats and an independent.\\n\\nThe independent, Supreme Court Justice David Davis, however, was unexpectedly selected by the Illinois Legislature to serve in the U.S. Senate. He was replaced by Justice Joseph Bradley, a diehard Republican who would cast every vote for Hayes, providing him the 20 votes he needed for a majority.\\n\\nDemocrats initially threatened to block the decision, but in a backroom deal they agreed to drop their opposition if Hayes, among other provisions, removed federal troops that had been in the South under Reconstruction.\\n\\nHayes was sworn in March 5, 1877, and within weeks, he removed the troops. Reconstruction formally came to an end, halting the progress African Americans had made. It would be decades before civil rights would see serious discussion again in Congress.\\n\\n1920: Prison campaign\\n\\nPHOTO: Getty Images Eugene Debs ran for president five times, the final time from the most unlikely of headquarters.\\n\\nIt was a battle between two newspaper publishers, but the election wasn't terribly exciting. Republican Warren G. Harding handed Democrat James Cox a historic beatdown, taking more than 60% of the popular vote along with 37 of the 48 states.\\n\\nThird place is where it got interesting.\\n\\nLong before Bernie Sanders faced jabs for his liberal politics, the Socialist Party of America enjoyed a modicum of support at the outset of the 20th century. That union leader Eugene Debs ran for president in 1900, 1904, 1908 and 1912 is somewhat unremarkable, as is the fact he secured roughly 6% of the popular vote in 1912, more than 900,000 ballots.\\n\\nIn 1920, though, Debs had to run his fifth campaign from the most unlikely of headquarters: prison.\\n\\nNo stranger to incarceration – he'd served time in connection with an 1894 railroad strike – Debs again drew the government's ire in 1918 when he gave an anti-war speech in Canton, Ohio, in which he pilloried the ruling class who made all the decisions to send the working class to war.\\n\\nYours not to reason why. Yours but to do and die, he said.\\n\\nHe was convicted under an espionage law and sentenced to 10 years in prison. Demonstrations protesting his imprisonment evolved into the May Day riots of 1919, and Debs was later moved to the Atlanta Federal Penitentiary, from where he conducted his presidential campaign.\\n\\nHe would again secure more than 900,000 votes – an impressive tally, but not nearly enough to compete with Harding, who snared more than 16 million.\\n\\nThe following year, on Christmas, Harding commuted Debs' sentence to time served.\\n\\n1948: Ultimate 'whoops' moment\\n\\nPHOTO: Underwood Archives/Getty Images Harry Truman holds up the Chicago Daily Tribune with a headline of his defeat to Thomas Dewey in 1948.\\n\\nPresident Harry S. Truman was done before the election began. You could stick a fork in him, to hear the pundits tell it. The election was New York Gov. Thomas Dewey's. Period.\\n\\nThe 1946 midterms had handed both houses to Republicans for the first time in almost 20 years, and opinion polls showed that just one in three Americans approved of Truman's handling of the presidency.\\n\\nMaking matters worse, Truman's commerce secretary, Henry Wallace, had revolted over the administration's foreign policy toward the Soviet Union and declared his intention to run as a third-party candidate.\\n\\nSouthern Democrats also jumped ship over his stance on civil rights, forming the States' Rights Party – aka the Dixiecrats – and electing segregationist South Carolina Gov. Strom Thurmond as their candidate.\\n\\nThe final pre-election Gallup poll – interestingly, taken in mid-October and not released until the day before Election Day – showed Dewey beating Truman by 5 percentage points.\\n\\nEven on Election Day, Truman recalled an NBC report predicting he would lose. It wasn't until 4 a.m. that his Secret Service agents woke him to say he had won.\\n\\nThe Chicago Daily Tribune had referred to Truman as a nincompoop on its editorial page in the run-up to the election. Poetically, a printers' strike forced the newspaper to publish its morning edition hours earlier than usual, and Publisher J. Loy Maloney took the pollsters' word and signed off on one of the most famous headlines in history.\\n\\nDewey defeats Truman.\\n\\n1960: Dawn of televised debates\\n\\nPHOTO: Getty Images Candidates John F. Kennedy, left, and Richard Nixon exchange smiles ahead of their first TV debate.\\n\\nJohn F. Kennedy set a lot of precedents when he was elected in 1960. He was the youngest president elected to office, the first at the time to be born in the 20th century. He was also the first Catholic president.\\n\\nThe contest between Kennedy and Richard Nixon, pitting a relatively unknown senator against a two-term sitting vice president, marked another precedent: the first time that presidential debates would be pumped into American living rooms.\\n\\nThis was important to the vote's outcome because televisions were increasingly part of the American household. Eighty-eight percent of homes had them, compared with 11% in 1950.\\n\\nNixon had recently been hospitalized. He refused to wear makeup, which served to highlight his thin, sickly appearance. He had a 5 o'clock shadow. He wore a gray suit that blended into the background. His appearance left much to be desired, historians would note.\\n\\nKennedy, on the other hand, was tanned and wore a blue suit and shirt, so he stood out against the studio backdrop. Unlike Nixon, he spoke to the cameras rather than to his opponent.\\n\\nThe estimated 70 million people who watched the first of four televised debates, on September 26, 1960, felt Kennedy won, whereas the much smaller audience listening on the radio felt Nixon was the victor.\\n\\nOn November 8, Kennedy edged out Nixon by 119,000 votes (out of a total of almost 69 million).\\n\\nThough it's arguable that the debate alone won Kennedy the election (he also secured the African-American vote by offering his assistance in getting the Rev. Martin Luther Jr. out of prison just weeks before the election), politicians and historians concur this changed the face of campaigns.\\n\\nTelevised debates made image and appearance primary considerations, and it raised such an unsettling specter for some candidates that it would be 16 years before another presidential hopeful agreed to a televised debate.\\n\\n1964: Mandate on race\\n\\nPHOTO: National Archives/Newsmakers Lyndon B. Johnson prevailed in the 1964 presidential election, a contest dominated by race\\n\\nThis is the election that brought us the Daisy ad – an attempt to paint Republican Barry Goldwater as too reckless to be put in charge of the country's nuclear arsenal. The ad remains haunting even amid today's supercharged mudslinging.\\n\\nThe summer of 1964 brought the Civil Rights Act. Angry Whites protested the legislation across the South, while Blacks enraged by police treatment erupted into demonstrations in New York, Philadelphia, Chicago and other cities.\\n\\nThe stage was set for extremes, but the election would not hinge on whether Goldwater or President Lyndon Johnson was a more capable commander in chief. Race would not only shape 1964's ballot, but it would affect elections for decades to come.\\n\\nAlabama's fiery segregationist Gov. George Wallace took on Johnson for the Democratic nomination, and despite the sentiment that white backlash against the Civil Rights Act was a Southern thing, Wallace received more than 30% of the vote in Wisconsin and Indiana and more than 40% in Maryland in the primaries.\\n\\nWallace would eventually drop out of the race, but not before causing both Goldwater and Johnson substantial concerns. Goldwater feared Wallace would run on a third-party ticket, sinking his campaign, and Johnson worried about Wallace's strong showing in non-Southern states.\\n\\nWhile Goldwater, who had cast his vote against the Civil Rights Act, was painted as a racist, something he had always denied, Johnson tried to please everyone.\\n\\nThat was most evident when the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party, Black activists organized by the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, showed up at the national convention demanding to be seated because Mississippi had run a segregated primary.\\n\\nJohnson would have to broker a deal in which the segregationists were seated at the convention, along with two members of the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party. He would later anger many in the South by selecting Hubert Humphrey, a staunch civil rights advocate, as his running mate.\\n\\nJohnson would go on to win one of the most lopsided elections ever. Goldwater won only his home state of Arizona and Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi and South Carolina. Republicans still enjoy a great deal of political dominance in the South to this day.\\n\\n1972: Death (of a campaign) by electroshock therapy\\n\\nPHOTO: Photo by Anthony Korody/Getty Images Sen. George McGovern, right, and running mate Sen. Thomas Eagleton during the 1972 campaign.\\n\\nIt happened in a hasty two-minute phone call.\\n\\nSen. George McGovern of South Dakota had just won the Democratic nomination for president and phoned Sen. Thomas Eagleton to ask him to be his running mate. Several high-profile Democrats had declined to join McGovern on the ticket, so he picked Eagleton, in part, because he hoped he would help him shore up the Catholic vote.\\n\\nTo say Eagleton didn't undergo the intense vetting of, say, Sarah Palin or Paul Ryan would be an understatement.\\n\\nHad McGovern grilled Eagleton according to today's standards, he might've learned Eagleton's secret: that the senator from Missouri had been hospitalized three times for depression and had undergone electroshock therapy on two of those occasions.\\n\\nWhen rumors first began to surface, McGovern stood by his running mate but eventually decided that Eagleton posed a liability.\\n\\nDuring a news conference at a South Dakota state park, where McGovern was supposed to be relaxing, not campaigning, Eagleton revealed his medical history to reporters and explained that he had only recently divulged the matter to McGovern.\\n\\nOn August 1 – 18 days after he was selected – Eagleton officially dropped out of the campaign.\\n\\nRichard Nixon would go on to obliterate McGovern, carrying 49 states and outpacing the Democrat by about 18 million votes – thereby striking fear into would-be presidents for decades about who they choose to join them on the ticket."}

{"original": "(CNN) —\\n\\nLike most successful candidates, President Donald Trump's rhetoric from the campaign trail now runs up awkwardly against the often dense and arcane language that fills more formal executive actions and memos.\\n\\nThe impenetrable, physical, tall, powerful, beautiful southern border wall he pledged to build on the Mexican border has been reduced, on White House stationery, to a physical wall on the southern border. Trump has kicked off his administration with a slew of aggressive actions, but it might be hard to tell from the reading.\\n\\nHere are a few examples of campaign technicolor translated into the black and white of legalistic, government documentation:\\n\\n1. In February 2016, Trump made this promise to a voter in New Hampshire.\\n\\nObamacare is a disaster and we're going to repeal it and we're going to replace it with something great.\\n\\nAs the administration and congressional Republicans now grapple with doing just that, Trump on his first day in office issued an executive order directing federal agencies to back off enforcing the law's mandate. Here's what it said:\\n\\nSec. 2. To the maximum extent permitted by law, the Secretary of Health and Human Services (Secretary) and the heads of all other executive departments and agencies (agencies) with authorities and responsibilities under the Act shall exercise all authority and discretion available to them to waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay the implementation of any provision or requirement of the Act that would impose a fiscal burden on any State or a cost, fee, tax, penalty, or regulatory burden on individuals, families, healthcare providers, health insurers, patients, recipients of healthcare services, purchasers of health insurance, or makers of medical devices, products, or medications.\\n\\n2. The construction of a wall – not a fence – on the US-Mexico border was a cornerstone of the Trump presidential bid. Appealing to voters, he led chants of build the wall and described the coming barrier like this during first rally:\\n\\nI will build a great wall – and nobody builds walls better than me, believe me – and I'll build them very inexpensively. I will build a great, great wall on our southern border, and I will make Mexico pay for that wall. Mark my words.\\n\\nIn the executive order Trump signed on Wednesday, he delivered the following, rather soberer instructions to the secretary of the Department of Homeland Security:\\n\\n(a) In accordance with existing law, including the Secure Fence Act and IIRIRA, take all appropriate steps to immediately plan, design, and construct a physical wall along the southern border, using appropriate materials and technology to most effectively achieve complete operational control of the southern border;\\n\\n(b) Identify and, to the extent permitted by law, allocate all sources of Federal funds for the planning, designing, and constructing of a physical wall along the southern border;\\n\\n(c) Project and develop long-term funding requirements for the wall, including preparing Congressional budget requests for the current and upcoming fiscal years; and\\n\\n(d) Produce a comprehensive study of the security of the southern border, to be completed within 180 days of this order, that shall include the current state of southern border security, all geophysical and topographical aspects of the southern border, the availability of Federal and State resources necessary to achieve complete operational control of the southern border, and a strategy to obtain and maintain complete operational control of the southern border.\\n\\n3. Trump has also issued an executive order aimed at sanctuary cities. Back in September 2015, he told a rally in Dallas: We have to end this sanctuary cities crap. Later in the campaign, he made this declaration:\\n\\nBlock funding for sanctuary cities. We block the funding. No more funds. We will end the sanctuary cities that have resulted in so many needless deaths. Cities that refuse to cooperate with federal authorities will not receive taxpayer dollars, and we will work with Congress to pass legislation to protect those jurisdictions that do assist federal authorities.\\n\\nAnd this is what it looked like on paper this week:\\n\\nSec. 2. Policy. It is the policy of the executive branch to:\\n\\n(a) Ensure the faithful execution of the immigration laws of the United States, including the INA, against all removable aliens, consistent with Article II, Section 3 of the United States Constitution and section 3331 of title 5, United States Code;\\n\\n(b) Make use of all available systems and resources to ensure the efficient and faithful execution of the immigration laws of the United States;\\n\\n(c) Ensure that jurisdictions that fail to comply with applicable Federal law do not receive Federal funds, except as mandated by law;\\n\\n(d) Ensure that aliens ordered removed from the United States are promptly removed; and\\n\\n(e) Support victims, and the families of victims, of crimes committed by removable aliens.\\n\\nHere's how his opposition to the deal sounded on the stump, at a rally in St. Clairsville, Ohio, in June 2016:\\n\\nThe Trans-Pacific Partnership is another disaster done and pushed by special interests who want to rape our country – just a continuing rape of our country.\\n\\nAnd this is what the formal departure looked like in a presidential memorandum from January 23. This, after a preamble on the importance of trade and American jobs:\\n\\nBased on these principles, and by the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, I hereby direct you to withdraw the United States as a signatory to the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), to permanently withdraw the United States from TPP negotiations, and to begin pursuing, wherever possible, bilateral trade negotiations to promote American industry, protect American workers, and raise American wages.\\n\\n5. The Keystone XL pipeline, which would deliver more than 800,000 barrels of petroleum daily from the Canadian oil sands to refineries on the US Gulf Coast, was blocked by the Obama administration in 2015. Trump did not agree with that decision and made it a bone of contention during the campaign. Here's what he said last January in Iowa:\\n\\nWhen they do the Keystone Pipeline – I want it approved, I want all those jobs – I like a lot of oil flow, because right now we're low.\\n\\nAnd here's what the announcement that Trump would re-open the process looked like in a presidential memo issued this week:"}

Read her blog, So About What I Said, and follow her on Twitter. The views expressed in this commentary are solely hers.\\n\\n(CNN) —\\n\\nThe next time you report a Twitter troll for polluting your timeline, you might notice an additional word on the reporting form.\\n\\nDisability.\\n\\nPHOTO: Courtesy Melissa Blake Melissa Blake\\n\\nIt's just one word. One we've seen thousands of times before. In fact, if you weren't looking closely at the form in the frenetic moments of reporting a tweet, you might not even notice it.\\n\\nBut make no mistake: This change is no small feat. It's a long overdue win in what seemed like a never-ending battle, one that people with disabilities like myself have been fighting online for years. Thankfully, Twitter joined that fight earlier this month when it revised its reporting form to include hate directed at people with disabilities.\\n\\nIt's against our rules to directly attack or threaten someone based on their protected category, including disability, Twitter said in a tweet posted April 2. You asked us to clarify this in our reporting flow, and we've updated it to be more specific.\\n\\nThe change is thanks to Natalie Weaver, who called on Twitter to revise its reporting form after her daughter's photo was used in an offensive tweet promoting eugenics. Her daughter, Sophia, has Rett syndrome, a genetic brain disorder that affects such things as language, walking and coordination. At first, Weaver told the website The Mighty, Twitter refused to take down the tweet, but eventually changed course, removing the offending account entirely.\\n\\nThe message rang loud and clear: This sort of hateful, ableist content will not be tolerated; in fact, it has no place on the social media platform.\\n\\nAs Weaver told The Mighty: Many people with medical conditions and/or disabilities receive hate and harassment every day on Twitter and no violations are found. I am hopeful that this change will create a safer environment for people with medical conditions and disabilities.\\n\\nI've been on the receiving end of this damaging and destructive hate speech for years. I was born with Freeman-Sheldon syndrome, a rare genetic bone and muscular disorder; it affects everything from my joints to my physical appearance. I've been called ugly, a monster, compared to a blob (picture of said blob included next to my profile picture) and in one particular tweet, which was the most stinging of all, one user suggested I was a thing and should be euthanized.\\n\\nThe only user to get the ban hammer? The one who said I should be euthanized. All the other accounts, Twitter told me, didn't violate the Twitter rules.\\n\\nI'm an accomplished freelance writer and blogger. But online, and especially on Twitter, I'm reduced to an object – literally, a thing to be mocked, ridiculed and shamed. My physical appearance is what those Twitter trolls pounce on. Immediately.\\n\\nMaybe they can sense that I've struggled with self-confidence surrounding my disability in the past? Maybe they figure it took me a while to come to terms with my disability (spoiler alert: It did)? Maybe they just know where to hit me to make it hurt just a little bit more? Or maybe they're just sad, pathetic people unhappy with themselves and their own life?\\n\\nI've asked myself these questions a lot, and, honestly, I'm not sure of the answers. But here's what I do know: All too often, people with disabilities are overlooked when it comes to these kinds of conversations about hate speech online.\\n\\nWhen we think of hate speech and what sorts of things constitute hate speech, we automatically think of racism and LGBTQ issues. What we don't automatically think of are things like ableism and discrimination against people with disabilities, which are rampant in society, to be sure, but sometimes get overlooked. Consider the flippant use of the R word – and even a seemingly less offensive word like cripple. Even Disney villains usually have some sort of facial deformity, which sends the message to children from a young age that disabilities are bad and that people with disabilities are evil or monstrous.\\n\\nThankfully, though, society's views about people with disabilities are changing, as evidenced not only by Twitter's change in policy, but also by Apple's plans to add 13 new disability-related emojis to its lineup. Everything from a cane to a hearing aid to a person zooming along in a wheelchair is just a starting point, Apple hinted recently, saying, Currently, emoji provide a wide range of options, but may not represent the experiences of those with disabilities.\\n\\nGet our free weekly newsletter Sign up for CNN Opinion's new newsletter.\\n\\nJoin us on Twitter and Facebook\\n\\nDisabilities may make people uncomfortable. I'm sure my disability and my wheelchair has made people uncomfortable in the past. But that doesn't give people the right to use it against me and vilify me for it. Twitter's change in policy gives me hope. Hope that perhaps, finally, we've moved the needle of dismantling centuries of negative misconceptions surrounding people with disabilities. We're not monsters. We're people. And we're not going anywhere – on Twitter and in real life."}

The deficit – or the difference between what the government spends and what it takes in over any one year – jumped to 3.8% of GDP in 2018, up from 3.5% in 2017.\\n\\nThat's particularly unusual in such a strong economy without major new expenditures. If no changes are made, the CBO projects that public debt will rise to 96% of GDP by 2028. A big chunk of that – $1.9 trillion between 2018 and 2028 – will be due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the CBO reported last April.\\n\\nAsked about the rising debt on Thursday morning, Council of Economic Advisers chairman Kevin Hassett said Trump is absolutely concerned about it, which is why he demanded a 5% budget cut from each Cabinet agency for the coming budget cycle.\\n\\nWe can disagree about a lot of things but we can agree maybe now is the time to get serious about the deficit, Hassett said.\\n\\nA congressionally-imposed cap on national debt kicks back in on March 2. According to an analysis by the Bipartisan Policy Center, the Treasury will be able to finance the government's operations until at least mid-summer by moving money around from different pots."}

Though much of North Korea is without electricity, the portraits of the supreme leaders are illuminated brightly.\\n\\nThis may look like an ordinary scene in any country, Huniewicz explains, but in North Korea, he feels it challenges a local song about no mother's love being greater than that of the Communist Party.\\n\\nThese settlements, captured from a speeding van, appear to be slums outside of Pyongyang, according to Huniewicz. He speculates that the tourist transport vans slow down when passing what the authorities are proud of showing and speed past less desirable sights.\\n\\nA woman sells postcards, stamps and posters, many featuring themes focused on defeating the U.S. and destroying the White House. Huniewicz says he did send one such postcard from North Korea to the U.S. and it arrived with no problems.\\n\\nWho's American here? the museum guide asks.

It's a bit too perfect.\\n\\nStory highlights A North Korean senior intelligence officer has become the highest-ranking military official to defect to South Korea Terence Roehrig: North Korea seems determined to grow its missile capabilities\\n\\n(CNN) —\\n\\nEditor's note: Terence Roehrig is professor of national security affairs and director of the Asia-Pacific Studies Group at the U.S. Naval War College. These views expressed here are the author's alone and do not represent the official position of the Navy, the U.S. Department of Defense, or the U.S. government.\\n\\nA report Tuesday that North Korea could be preparing to launch a ballistic missile with the potential to hit parts of the United States is just the latest reminder of the continuing tensions on the Korean Peninsula. The news comes amid a flurry of North Korean launches and threats in recent weeks, and amid rumors that Pyongyang might be preparing for another nuclear test.\\n\\nHow seriously should such threats be taken? In many respects, much of this is not a surprise; North Korea seems determined to grow its missile capabilities. The difficulty, of course, has always been separating rhetoric and reality with a nation from which it is notoriously difficult to secure concrete information.\\n\\nTerence Roehrig\\n\\nBut a series of defections – including one by what is believed to be the highest ranking military officer so far – could offer some useful insights into what is going on there.\\n\\nOver the past few days, the South Korean government has taken the highly unusual action of announcing the arrival of a number of high-profile North Korean defectors to the South. The defectors include a group of 13 workers from a North Korea-owned restaurant in China.\\n\\nThe North Korean government operates more than 130 restaurants in a dozen countries to earn hard currency that is sent back to Pyongyang. In addition, government officials also confirmed the defections of two North Korea diplomats. One reportedly worked on economic matters in the embassy of an African country and defected in May 2015 with his family, while another diplomat was reported to have defected from an Asian nation in February.\\n\\nMost interesting, though, was the revelation on Monday that a high-level military officer who held the rank of colonel defected in 2015. The South Korea Defense Ministry offered few details, but confirmed that he was from the Reconnaissance General Bureau, or RGB, which was created in 2009 with the merger of several military and party organizations.\\n\\nThe organization reports directly to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and is responsible for intelligence gathering and espionage, along with the recent addition of cyberoperations under Bureau 121. Bureau 121 has itself been responsible for hack attacks on several South Korean media outlets, government institutions and banks, and is believed by U.S. officials to have been behind the 2014 attack on Sony Pictures.\\n\\nSecurity issues\\n\\nMedia reports indicate the officer may have been in charge of espionage operations in South Korea, and he is believed to be the highest-ranking military leader to have ever defected to the South. With all this in mind, it is clear why he could prove to be valuable.\\n\\nIt is difficult to obtain reliable insights information into the inner workings of the North Korean government given the opaque nature of the regime. Access to a high-level military official familiar with the North Korean system and leadership will therefore be an important asset on military and intelligence matters. In short, the defection of such a high-level member of the regime is both a serious security breach and an embarrassment for Pyongyang.\\n\\nBut the announcement of the colonel's defection is part of a larger story. The public acknowledgment of defections is unusual, and government policy has typically been to keep these events quiet so as not to endanger remaining family members in the North (or other defectors that might be en route or considering such a move).\\n\\nThe South Korean government has made the case that these defections are a sign that the economic sanctions imposed in the wake of North Korean weapons testing are working, and that people are voting with their feet. Conservative media sources, meanwhile, are also making the argument these defections are a sign of serious elite discontent that may lead to instability in North Korea.\\n\\nMORE: North Korea sentences U.S. student to 15 years hard labor\\n\\nInstability on the horizon?\\n\\nCritics say the revelations are political and intended to influence the upcoming National Assembly elections by highlighting security issues. They argue that by highlighting the supposed success of recent sanctions, the government is hoping to energize conservative support for the ruling Saenuri Party.\\n\\nAdding an additional layer of intrigue is a report by the progressive Hankyoreh newspaper, which reported that the Unification Ministry did not want to release information on the defectors, but was forced to do so by the Park Geun-hye administration. The government has for its part denied there were political motives in announcing the defections, maintaining the high-level nature of these examples and their links to U.N. sanctions and elite discontent were important to reveal.\\n\\nStill, whatever the truth behind the debate over the release of information, the escape of such a prominent military and intelligence official is important. The colonel will not only be able to furnish valuable information on military operations and tactics, but may also provide better clarity into the strategic thinking of North Korea's leadership. Moreover, these defections might start to reveal more about elite behavior in North Korea. Could such defections, for example, be early indicators of political instability?\\n\\nThe North Korean regime will undoubtedly remain a serious security and intelligence challenge for the U.S. and regional allies like South Korea, and the information provided by defectors of all levels cannot be taken at face value – it must be examined carefully. But the type of information that could potentially be gleaned from the sources revealed this past week may be one of the few windows we have to improving our understanding of one of the most isolated nations in the world.\\n\\nJoin us on Facebook.com/CNNOpinion.\\n\\nRead CNNOpinion's Flipboard magazine."}

We need to hit the reset and adopt a new strategy in trying to get that out to patients.\\n\\nMore people, sites and online resources for vaccines\\n\\nAs the surge ratchets up infection, hospitalization and fatality numbers across the country, officials are working to make it easier to access vaccinations.\\n\\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom promised Monday to have one million state health care workers, nursing home residents and staff vaccinated by week's end. This all hands on deck push to get the vaccine to more vulnerable residents comes as the state continues to see an unrelenting surge of coronavirus hospitalizations and deaths.\\n\\nAs of Monday, the state has received more than 2.9 million vaccine doses, but administered about 783,000 of them, amounting to just 27% given.\\n\\nThe announcement came the same day California surpassed 30,000 Covid-19 deaths since the start of the pandemic, according to Johns Hopkins University data. California is one of only three states to reach the milestone.\\n\\nIn order to loosen the backlog, California plans to use Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles, Padres Stadium in San Diego and CalExpo in Sacramento as mass vaccination sites, and Newsom said more large-scale sites will be announced in the coming days.\\n\\nIn New York, more vaccination sites have opened, including more 24/7 sites in New York City. Mayor Bill de Blasio said that he's confident the city will reach its goal of administering 1 million doses by the end of January.\\n\\nOn Monday, New York state expanded the people eligible for the vaccine to include those 75 and older, first responders, teachers and school workers, public-facing grocery store workers, transit workers and people living and working in homeless shelters.\\n\\nNew Jersey will have a network of about 300 vaccination sites across the state to assist with its Covid-19 vaccination plan, state officials said at a news conference.\\n\\nOur objective and aspiration is 70% of the adult population in the state within six months, that's 4.7 million New Jerseyans, said Gov. Phil Murphy, speaking at Rowan College at Gloucester County, one of six mega-site vaccination locations.\\n\\nThe Georgia Department of Public Health launched a Covid vaccine locator website in hopes of increasing access in the state that has administered the fewest vaccines per capita, according to the CDC Covid Data Tracker.\\n\\nThe website will not allow for scheduling but will provide contact information for people to schedule vaccinations once available, according to a news release.\\n\\nThe CDC updated its guidance Monday, saying there's no maximum time between a first and second coronavirus shot.\\n\\nYou should get your second shot: for the Pfizer-BioNTech 3 weeks (or 21 days) after your first shot; for the Moderna 1 month (or 28 days) after your first shot, the CDC said.\\n\\nYou should get your second shot as close to the recommended 3-week or 1-month interval as possible. However, there is no maximum interval between the first and second doses for either vaccine. You should not get the second dose earlier than the recommended interval. \\n\\nThe World Health Organization said last week that people can wait for as long as six weeks between doses. However, Pfizer and Moderna say they don't have any data on how long people can wait between doses and still get good protection.\\n\\nA deadlier pace than 2020\\n\\nMore than 28,400 new Covid-19 deaths have been reported in just the first 11 days of 2021, according to data from Johns Hopkins.\\n\\nAt this rate, more people could die from Covid-19 in January than in any other month of this pandemic. December had a record high of 77,431 deaths due to Covid-19.\\n\\nIn hard-hit Arizona, the crisis will get worse, said Joe K. Gerald, associate professor at the University of Arizona's Zuckerman College of Public Health.\\n\\nWe should expect to set new records for cases, hospitalizations, and deaths over the coming weeks. Policy action is urgently needed to mitigate the worst possible outcome, Gerald wrote.\\n\\nHe also expressed concern about the inevitable arrival of the more highly transmissible strain of coronavirus that was first detected in the United Kingdom and has spread to at least 10 US states\\n\\nAs of Monday, there have been 72 cases of the new variant, including at least 32 in California, 22 in Florida, five in Minnesota, four in New York, three in Colorado, two in Connecticut, and one case each in Texas, Pennsylvania, Indiana and Georgia.\\n\\nIf it gathers a foothold, it will accelerate, lengthen, and deepen Arizona's outbreak, Gerald said.\\n\\nOn Monday, Arizona set a record with 4,997 people hospitalized for coronavirus-related reasons, according to the state's data dashboard. Before the winter, the state's record for hospitalizations was 3,517 on July 13, 2020. The state surpassed that record December 11 and the tally of patients has, with a few exceptions, risen every day since then.\\n\\nArizona recently opened a 24/7 site to administer vaccines.

{"original": "General Electric's 110-year run in the Dow could be nearing its end.\\n\\nThe company's unending list of problems led Deutsche Bank analyst John Inch to predict that GE is likely to be dropped from the Dow.\\n\\nInch, a frequent critic of GE, appears to be the first major analyst to make such a call. In his report on Wednesday, he cited GE's substantial challenges, including a serious cash crisis, badly slumping power division and efforts to dramatically shrink the sprawling conglomerate. There's also the SEC investigation that GE disclosed last week.\\n\\nGE's (GE) cratering stock price, which is hovering near six-year lows, is another issue. While the Dow has soared 32% over the past year, GE has lost nearly half its value.\\n\\nThe committee that runs the Dow prefers to have no more than a 10-to-1 ratio between the high and low stock on the index. But the ratio between GE and Boeing (BA) is more than twice that today.\\n\\nThat's important because the Dow is weighted by its stock price. Most other market indexes are weighted by market cap. So a 1% move in a $350 stock like Boeing would move the Dow significantly more than a 1% move in $16 stock like GE.\\n\\nNo decisions about booting GE have been announced. It's possible that the committee in charge of the Dow's membership may opt to stick with GE.\\n\\nA spokesman at S&P Global, which controls the Dow, declined to weigh in due to company policy. We do not provide comment on potential adds or drops to our indices as we consider this information to be market moving and material, he said.\\n\\nRelated: GE is under SEC investigation\\n\\nGE is an original member of the Dow, the index born in 1896 that is perhaps the most recognizable market metric in the world. But the company was removed and invited back several times, before returning in 1907 where it has remained ever since.\\n\\nDespite GE's current crisis, there is a case to be made for keeping the stock in the Dow. While GE's stock price has cratered, it still boasts a very large market valuation of about $140 billion. That's bigger than seven Dow stocks, including McDonald's (MCD), Caterpillar (CAT), Nike (NKE) and American Express (AXP).\\n\\nGE is also still a massive company, with its fingers in everything from aviation and power plants to healthcare and railroads. Corporate filings indicate GE employed about 295,000 people as of the end of 2016, though recent layoffs have reduced its headcount.\\n\\nHowever, GE is in retreat mode. It long ago parted ways with NBC, Universal Studios and much of GE Capital. Now it's planning to jettison its light bulb and railroad divisions. GE is even considering an outright breakup of the company.\\n\\nIt's possible that GE may not be as representative of the broad American economy as it once was.\\n\\nConsider that GE's stock is plunging even as the U.S. economy gathers momentum and rival industrial companies like Honeywell (HON), 3M (MMM) and United Technologies (UTX) are booming.\\n\\nIt's a great time for industrials, said Cowen analyst Gautam Khanna. The divergent performance for GE is simply egregious.\\n\\nRelated: GE's $31 billion pension nightmare\\n\\nGE's downfall has been caused in large part by bad decisions under former CEO Jeff Immelt about where to deploy the company's cash. Some acquisitions, like the 2015 purchase of Alstom, have backfired badly. Instead of shoring up its underfunded pension, GE aggressively bought back stock and paid out a fat dividend that last year had to be halved.\\n\\nGetting kicked out of the prestigious 30-stock index would be the cherry atop an embarrassment sundae.\\n\\nIf GE were kicked out of the Dow, there's no guarantee it would be replaced by another industrial company.\\n\\nWhen AT&T (T) was removed from the Dow in 2015, it was substituted by Apple (AAPL). (AT&T has agreed to acquire CNN parent Time Warner). Honeywell (HON) and Altria (MO) were replaced in 2008 with Bank of America (BAC) and Chevron (CVX).\\n\\nThis time, a tech titan like Amazon (AMZN), Facebook (FB) and Google owner Alphabet (GOOGL) could be swapped in. Then again, Amazon and Alphabet sport stock prices above $1,100, making their inclusion potentially problematic.\\n\\n--CNNMoney's Paul R. La Monica contributed to this report."}

{"original": "WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Sens. John McCain and Barack Obama showed Thursday night that they have more common ground than differences when it comes to making national service a priority in their presidential administrations.\\n\\nThe presidential canidates put aside partisan politics as the nation remembers the terrorist attacks.\\n\\nThe candidates took the stage separately in a forum sponsored by TIME at Columbia University in New York.\\n\\nA coin toss determined who took questions first from moderators TIME Managing Editor Rick Stengel and PBS's Judy Woodruff.\\n\\nAsked why it seems the terror attacks of September 11, 2001, are fading in the minds of many Americans, McCain said:\\n\\nWe needed at that time [September 11, 2001] to take advantage of the unity in the United States of America.\\n\\nMcCain criticized the Bush administration for not taking advantage of that sense of unity and instead imploring the American public to live their lives as usual and go shopping.\\n\\nI would have called them to serve, said McCain.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe GOP candidate said he suspects people feel uninspired by leaders in Washington and that Americans want change in federal government.\\n\\nThey understand the challenges that we have in this world. They see the Russian invasion of the little country called Georgia. They see the problems in Afghanistan growing larger. They see a whole lot of things happening in the world that's going to require us to serve, and that opportunity has to be provided to them. Watch McCain talk about service »\\n\\nMcCain praised the Peace Corps and AmeriCorps, saying they and similar organizations don't receive sufficient recognition from Washington. But McCain was careful to say government should limit its involvement. Asked about compensation for service McCain said:\\n\\nI'd be glad to reward [volunteers] them as much as possible. But you want to be careful that the reason is not the reward of financial or other reasons, but the reward is the satisfaction of serving a cause greater than yourself. ... Finding new ways to serve. That's what this next few years should be all about.\\n\\nMcCain also fielded a question about his running mate Gov. Sarah Palin's dismissive comments about Sen. Barack Obama's community service in Illinois.\\n\\nLook, Gov. Palin was responding to the criticism of her inexperience and her job as a mayor in a small town. That's what she was responding to. Of course I respect community organizers. Of course I respect people who serve their community. And Sen. Obama's record there is outstanding.\\n\\nMcCain also said that politics is tough business, and that Obama set the tone of the whole campaign when he refused to take part in town hall meetings with McCain across America.\\n\\nObama said his views don't necessarily differ from McCain's on national service.\\n\\nHe said creating opportunities for national service would be a priority for his administration as well.\\n\\nPart of what makes America work is the fact that we believe in individual responsibility and self-reliance, but we also believe in mutual responsibility, in neighborliness, in a sense that we are committed to something larger than ourselves.\\n\\nObama cited a plan to provide college tuition aid in return for student community service.\\n\\nOne of my central platforms in this campaign is we're going to provide a $4,000 tuition credit every student, every year, but in exchange for giving something back. And so, young people of modest means, who are interested in going to college, this gives them an opportunity to serve and at the same time, pay for their college education. I think there are a lot of creative ways where we can provide opportunities than exist right now.\\n\\nObama also said he wants to attract more young people into civil service careers.\\n\\nThe fact is that we have to have government. When a hurricane strikes, as it did with Katrina, we have to have a FEMA that works, which by the way, means that we should be encouraging young people, the best and the brightest, to get involved as civil servants, to pursue careers of public service so we've got people who are trained in federal emergency management who are able to take on the job. Watch Obama talk about service »\\n\\nNow, that does not crowd out the Red Cross. That doesn't crowd out the thousands of church groups that went down there. What it means is that each area has a role to play.\\n\\nThe forum is part of a two-day summit meant to promote national service. Nearly 500 leaders from business, foundations, universities and politics are meeting to celebrate the power and potential of citizen service and lay out a plan to address America's greatest social challenges through expanded opportunities for volunteer and national service, according to the organizers' Web site.\\n\\nEach presidential candidate has served his nation in different ways. McCain was a Navy officer for over two decades and often encourages Americans to serve a cause greater than oneself.\\n\\nObama served as a community organizer on the South Side of Chicago after he graduated from college. In a speech in December, the Illinois Democrat said he would ask Americans to serve if he becomes president. This will be the cause of my presidency, he said.\\n\\nToday's joint appearance came amid recent sniping between the campaigns.\\n\\nMcCain's campaign recently attacked Obama for lipstick remarks made during a campaign stop in Virginia on Tuesday.\\n\\nJohn McCain says he's about change too, and so I guess his whole angle is, 'Watch out George Bush -- except for economic policy, health care policy, tax policy, education policy, foreign policy and Karl Rove-style politics -- we're really going to shake things up in Washington,'  he said.\\n\\nThat's not change. That's just calling ... the same thing something different. You know you can put lipstick on a pig, but it's still a pig. You know you can wrap an old fish in a piece of paper called change, it's still going to stink after eight years. We've had enough of the same old thing. Watch how tensions are rising on the trail »\\n\\nThe crowd erupted in applause when Obama delivered the line. McCain's campaign said Obama's remarks were offensive and a slap at vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, despite the fact that the Arizona senator himself used the phrase last year to describe a policy proposal of Hillary Clinton's.\\n\\nObama shot back Wednesday and accused the McCain campaign of engaging in lies and swift boat politics.\\n\\nI don't care what they say about me. But I love this country too much to let them take over another election with lies and phony outrage and swift boat politics, he said in Norfolk, Virginia. Enough is enough. Watch Obama deliver his harsh words »\\n\\nThe phrase swift boat comes from the 2004 presidential election, when the group Swift Boat Veterans for Truth launched an attack ad campaign against Democratic candidate John Kerry that was said by some to be false.\\n\\nBut the two presidential candidates agreed to put aside partisan politics on Thursday. They appeared together in New York to lay a wreath at ground zero, where the World Trade Center towers collapsed after two airliners hijacked by al Qaeda operatives plowed into them on September 11, 2001.\\n\\nThe two met with families of victims as well as state and local officials.\\n\\nEarlier in the day, McCain attended a ceremony in Shanksville, Pennsylvania, to remember those who lost their lives when United Airlines Flight 93 crashed in a field there on September 11, 2001. Many believe that the hijackers intended to crash Flight 93 into the U.S. Capitol in Washington.\\n\\nHundreds, if not thousands, of people at work in that building, when that fateful moment occurred, could have been destroyed along with a beautiful symbol of our freedom, McCain said. They -- and possibly I -- owe our lives to the passengers who summoned the courage and love necessary to deprive our depraved and hateful enemies their terrible triumph.\\n\\nI've had the great honor and privilege to witness great courage and sacrifice for America's sake, he said.\\n\\nThe Obama campaign released a statement earlier Thursday for its candidate in which he said, We will never forget those who died.\\n\\nOn 9/11, Americans across our great country came together to stand with the families of the victims, to donate blood, to give to charity, and to say a prayer for our country, Obama said. Let us renew that spirit of service and that sense of common purpose.\\n\\nMeanwhile, a CNN poll out Thursday suggests that voters view McCain as the better presidential candidate to handle terrorism but do not consider terrorism their primary concern in voting.\\n\\nNearly two-thirds of those surveyed, 62 percent, believe that the Republican presidential nominee would be the better candidate to handle the issue of terrorism, compared with 34 percent who believe that his Democratic rival, Obama, would be better on the issue.\\n\\nThe poll's margin of error is plus-or-minus 3 percentage points.\\n\\nOpinion Research Corp. conducted telephone interviews with 1,022 adults from September 5-7 for the poll.\\n\\nTime's Michael Duffy contributed to this report.\\n\\nAll About Barack Obama • John McCain • Terrorism • September 11 Attacks"}

The dance is intended to promote inclusion and kindness, and students have traditionally been told by their teachers to say yes when a classmate asks them to dance.\\n\\nBut times have changed, and some parents were angry when they got wind of the dance's protocol this year.\\n\\nNatalie Richard was shocked when her sixth-grade daughter told her she couldn't refuse a dance with a boy at the upcoming dance.\\n\\nThe teacher said she can't. She has to say yes. She has to accept and I said, 'Excuse me?,' Richard told CNN affiliate KSTU.\\n\\nAt a time when parents are teaching kids they don't need to hug a friend or even kiss their grandparents, there's been a movement toward children maintaining control of their own bodies.\\n\\nTo many parents, not being able to turn down a dance partner goes against that.\\n\\nIt sends a bad message to girls that girls have to say 'yes' – sends a bad message to boys that girls can't say 'no,' Richard said.\\n\\nPsychologically, my daughter keeps coming to me and saying I can't say 'no' to a boy. That's the message kids are getting.\\n\\nThe Weber School District got the message, too. In a statement sent to CNN Monday night, community relations specialist Lane Findlay said the instructions for the dance have been changed.\\n\\nAccording to the statement, attendance at the dance has typically been voluntary but encouraged. Students are asked to fill out a dance card with names of classmates they'd like to dance with. Half the dancer selections are the girl's choice and the other half are the boy's choice, and students can't dance with the same person more than once.\\n\\nPHOTO: Weber School District Students are encouraged to write the names of classmates they'd like to dance with.\\n\\nBut now students will be free to say no.\\n\\nIn the best interest of our students, we are re-examining the procedures surrounding these dances and will make any necessary changes to promote a positive environment where all students feel included and empowered in their choices, the statement said.\\n\\nWe have advised our schools to eliminate any sort of language in the instructions surrounding these dances that would suggest a student must dance with another student.\\n\\nThe announcement will no doubt please some parents who had posted messages on Facebook criticizing the school's dance policy.\\n\\nRespectfully decline to dance… Children should learn to say no thanks in uncomfortable situations, wrote one.\\n\\nGirls should not have to feel obligated to say yes to anyone. Especially when it involves physical contact, wrote another. I would rather keep my daughter home instead of making that environment acceptable."}

Nicole Mason C. Nicole Mason\\n\\nGains in the stock market and the robust economy obscure the reality that many of the most marginalized workers, those with limited skills and education, are still struggling. Under Trump, the wealthy are doing extremely well, while the middle-class is hanging on.\\n\\nOn Friday, more than 800,000 federal workers across the country will go without a paycheck if the government fails to reopen. Trump says these workers will make adjustments as the shutdown could last months, even years. This, no doubt, will have a trickle-down effect on small businesses and others who rely on these workers to purchase goods and products.\\n\\nThe wall between Mexico and the United States, cheered by Trump's most ardent supporters as a metaphorical and political symbol of America First, has lost its appeal to some as the government shutdown has dragged on. Furloughed workers and those who sympathize with them have begun to realize the wall will not feed their families, keep their lights on or make sure their mortgage is paid.\\n\\nBut there are other reasons American workers may be disenchanted with the President. Trump campaigned on a promise to bring back coal mining jobs. Yet, as Bloomberg reported, analysts say that Trump's plan for the coal industry is not likely to have a large effect on its fortunes.\\n\\nAt campaign rallies and in interviews, Trump likes to say that he turned the West Virginia economy around by cutting energy regulations, but over the last decade, middle-class West Virginia households have seen no overall income gains from the state's modest economic growth, and there has been no sustained surge in the state's economy under Trump. These kinds of results will continue unless we are able to turn away from the divisive politics and rhetoric, and focus on building an economy that works for the majority of Americans – not just the few.\\n\\nWorking-class black and Latino Americans are also losing under Trump. In his address to the nation Tuesday night, President Trump asserted that illegal migration hurts all Americans by driving down jobs and wages, specifically impacting African-Americans and Hispanics. This is a bid to whip up support among both groups for the wall and his nativist immigration policies.\\n\\nWhile it is true that African-Americans and Hispanics tend to be employed in lower wage jobs than white and Asian workers, and compete in the labor market with undocumented immigrants for those jobs, it cannot be ignored that some US employers and corporations often exploit immigrant labor for their gain, by paying them less, forcing them to work in deplorable conditions, or threatening to deport them if they complain.\\n\\nThese habits not only harm undocumented immigrants, but American middle-class workers as well by suppressing wages and making it nearly impossible to demand safer working conditions or benefits without the fear of being fired. If Trump is concerned about the well-being of these black and Hispanic American workers, he should do more than suggest a wall to address the income disparity.\\n\\nCome March, if the government fails to reopen, tens of millions of Americans could lose their Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits, putting their families at risk of food insecurity. According to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, in 2017, 42 million Americans participated in the SNAP program – and more than 44% of them were in working families.

{"original": "Trump has used past addresses to highlight his administration's victories, target his political enemies and push forward on efforts to fulfill his vision for the country.\\n\\nThe President is banking on the strong US economy and trade deal victories to carry his reelection campaign to a win in November, and he's sure to highlight his wins on Tuesday.\\n\\nHis approval rating among voters stands at 45% according to a recent CNN poll conducted by SSRS -- no worse than his approval rating in December and the highest it's been since July. And in December, 76% of individuals polled said they rated the economy very or somewhat good, indicating a shifting tide in Americans' economic outlook, which had remained tepid in the wake of the recession.\\n\\nHere's what to watch for during Tuesday's State of the Union:\\n\\nImpeachment\\n\\nTrump aides had once hoped the address would be an opportunity for vindication following a Senate acquittal, but the Senate won't hold its final vote on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress until Wednesday -- the day after the President is scheduled to deliver his speech.\\n\\nWhite House deputy press secretary Hogan Gidley said Tuesday that the word impeachment is not in the President's State of the Union speech, but suggested that it could be added to a later draft.\\n\\nI've read through the speech, and I've not seen the word impeachment. As he likes to say, 'We'll see what happens,'  he told reporters.\\n\\nUnlike President Bill Clinton, who apologized to the country after he was acquitted, people close to Trump said they anticipated he will continue to proclaim his complete and total innocence\\n\\nI don't see the President making a big statement one way or another that would indicate anything different than what he's been saying for many months, one Republican close to Trump said.\\n\\nA senior administration official laying out plans for the speech wouldn't divulge whether the President would bring up impeachment during his remarks, but they did say the speech isn't being written in a vacuum and it wouldn't be out of the ordinary for the speech to evolve before it's delivered.\\n\\nMeanwhile, a handful of Republican senators said they hope Trump steers clear of impeachment talk during his address to the bipartisan audience.\\n\\nStaunch ally Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina said it would be smart to focus on other issues, encouraged Trump to be positive and posited that most people are ready to move on from impeachment.\\n\\nI hope he is, too, because I am, said Graham.\\n\\nCampaign pitch\\n\\nThe overall theme of Trump's speech will be the Great American Comeback, the senior administration official said. The President is expected to focus on what he sees as victories for his administration through the lens of election issues, such as the economy, health care and national security.\\n\\nThe official said Trump is expected to focus on five areas: blue-collar workers, promoting and supporting families, lowering health care costs, immigration and protecting American families.\\n\\nThe President is also expected to draw contrast between his beliefs and the proposed policies of Democrats.\\n\\nSpecifically, the official said Trump is expected to contrast his health care policies with those on the socialist left, presenting a sharp difference with policies such as Medicare for All, which has been touted by some Democratic presidential candidates.\\n\\nA mixed crowd\\n\\nTrump's speech is, of course, expected to be delivered in the presence of several members of Congress who are often at odds with the administration's policies. However, this year's speech will be a markedly more contentious year between the President and Democrats.\\n\\nIt will likely mark the first time Trump and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi have been in the same room in months. Their relationship became more tense after Pelosi began the impeachment proceedings, and, according to a Pelosi spokesman, the two have not spoken since the October 16 meeting in which Trump insulted Pelosi, including calling her a third-grade politician, before she and other top Democrats walked out and later accused the President of having a meltdown.\\n\\nIt will also likely mark the first time Trump will be in the same room as some of his Democratic opponents running for president. He's used recent interviews and speeches to unleash a litany of insults and attacks on his potential opponents, but the official previewing Trump's address wouldn't say whether he would do the same while speaking in the Senate chamber.\\n\\nI won't preview if he's going to call anybody out but I think the President would be entirely comfortable with that, the official said.\\n\\nCoverage of the Democrats' Iowa caucuses dominated televisions Tuesday morning, potentially increasing the odds that Trump will use his high-profile speech to swipe at potential rivals.\\n\\nChecking in on past promises\\n\\nThe President has used past State of the Union addresses to push new policy proposals, such as tax cuts, an infrastructure plan and health care revisions. Some of these proposals have been successful, while others have not.\\n\\nDuring the 2019 State of the Union, Trump called for the great rebuilding of America's crumbling infrastructure. But he held off on moving ahead, saying he would move on it only after the US-Mexico-Canada trade agreement was passed by Congress. He signed the pact into law last week.\\n\\nIn 2018, Trump touted the success of his new tax cuts, calling them the biggest tax cuts and reforms in American history and claiming they would be a boon to the economy. However, a combination of the reduced revenues due to the tax cuts and record-setting defense spending helped balloon the federal budget deficit to $1 trillion last year. More recently, the President has said he is considering cuts to entitlement programs as a means of debt reduction."}

We may receive a commission through the LendingTree affiliate network if you apply and are approved for a card, but our reporting is always independent and objective.\\n\\nThe old saying Cash is king might never have been as true as it is right now. While many people like to use their credit card to earn travel points or miles that they can redeem for a once-in-a-lifetime trip, those plans are on hold for many at the moment thanks to the pandemic.\\n\\nSo, instead of sticking with a credit card that earns rewards for a vacation that isn't happening in the near future, why not consider a credit card that earns you cash back almost instantly? Having money in your pocket today allows you to use that cash on anything you desire — or save it for the future.\\n\\nInterested? Then check out our list of the best cash back credit cards to decide which one will best fit your needs.\\n\\nThe best cash back credit cards of 2021\\n\\nCiti® Double Cash Card: Best overall card for cash back\\n\\nBlue Cash Preferred® Card from American Express: Best for US supermarkets\\n\\nChase Freedom Flex: Best for restaurants, including takeout and delivery\\n\\nCostco Anywhere Visa® Card by Citi: Best for gas purchases\\n\\nChase Freedom Unlimited: Best for flexibility\\n\\nInk Business Unlimited Credit Card: Best for small businesses\\n\\nDiscover it® Cash Back: Best sign-up bonus\\n\\nU.S. Bank Cash+™ Visa Signature® Card: Best for streaming\\n\\nBank of America® Cash Rewards credit card: Best for travel\\n\\nThe information for the Discover it Cash Back, U.S. Bank Cash+ and Bank of America Cash Rewards cards has been collected independently by CNN Underscored. The card details on this page have not been reviewed or provided by the card issuers.\\n\\nWhy did we select these cards as our best cash back credit cards for 2021? CNN Underscored's comprehensive credit card methodology compares every aspect of each cash back credit card to our benchmark credit card to determine which cards can potentially earn you the most cash. So let's dive into the details of each card and see how they stack up.\\n\\nCiti Double Cash\\n\\nBest overall card for cash back\\n\\nWhy it's great in one sentence: The Citi Double Cash Card is extremely simple, since you earn 2% cash back on every purchase — 1% when you buy and 1% when you pay your statement — all for no annual fee.\\n\\nThis card is right for: People looking for an easy and straightforward way to earn cash back without having to worry about category bonuses.\\n\\nHighlights:\\n\\nEarn 2% cash back on everything — 1% when you make a purchase and another 1% when you pay it off.\\n\\n18-month 0% introductory rate on balance transfers (13.99% to 23.99% variable afterward).\\n\\nExpert users can convert the cash back to Citi ThankYou travel points at a ratio of 1 cent per point when combined with the Citi Prestige® Card or Citi Premier℠ Card.\\n\\nNo annual fee.\\n\\nSign-up bonus: None.\\n\\nWhat we like about the Citi Double Cash: When compared to all of the other major no-annual-fee credit cards, the Citi Double Cash offers the highest ongoing flat-rate return on every single purchase. With this card you'll earn 2% in cash back — 1% when you buy something and another 1% when you pay it off — on every purchase you make. There's no maximum on the cash back you can earn, and you don't need to worry about tracking category bonuses.\\n\\nThe Citi Double Cash also offers a relatively long 18-month introductory 0% interest rate period for balance transfers — a great way to pay off your debt (though make sure you pay it off, because the rate jumps to a variable 13.99% to 23.99% after the introductory offer ends). And you have up to four months after you open the account to make your first balance transfer and still have it qualify for the introductory offer.\\n\\nRelated: Read CNN Underscored's list of the best balance transfer credit cards.\\n\\nExperts will enjoy pairing this card with one of the premium Citi ThankYou credit cards, such as the Citi Premier or Citi Prestige. That's because if you also have a premium ThankYou card, you can actually convert your cash back from the Citi Double Cash to Citi ThankYou points and then transfer those points to one of Citi's airline partners or redeem them for airfare at 1.25 cents per point when going through the Citi travel portal with the Citi Premier (though this rate will drop to 1 cent per point after April 21, 2021).\\n\\nOne thing that could be better: Although the Citi Double Cash card will earn you the most cash back on your everyday purchases, it doesn't have any category bonuses. This can be a downside if you routinely make a large number of purchases in a particular category.\\n\\nYou'll also find that the Citi Double Cash doesn't come with many perks, such as travel or purchase protections. This is also not the card to use for international purchases, as you'll be charged a 3% foreign transaction fee when you're overseas, which more than offsets the rewards you'd earn.\\n\\nWhy it's our benchmark card: The ease of use and straightforward top-of-market cash back earning rate of the Citi Double Cash are why CNN Underscored currently uses the Double Cash as our benchmark credit card to compare the features of other credit cards and determine if they're better or worse overall.\\n\\nYou can read more about our benchmark credit card concept in our credit card methodology guide or dig into our complete review of the Citi Double Cash.\\n\\nLearn more and apply for the Citi Double Cash Card.\\n\\nBlue Cash Preferred by American Express\\n\\nBest for US supermarkets\\n\\nPHOTO: iStock Earn bonus cash back at US supermarkets with the Blue Cash Preferred credit card.\\n\\nWhy it's great in one sentence: The Blue Cash Preferred Card from American Express earns 6% cash back at US supermarkets (up to $6,000 per year in purchases, then 1%), making it one of the best credit cards year after year for buying groceries.\\n\\nThis card is right for: People who spend a significant amount of money at US supermarkets but who also want to avoid high interest rates on their purchases for their first year as a card member.\\n\\nHighlights:\\n\\nEarn 6% cash back at US supermarkets on up to $6,000 per year in purchases (then 1%) and on select US streaming subscriptions.\\n\\nEarn 3% cash back at US gas stations and on transit (including taxis/ride-shares, parking, tolls, trains, buses and more).\\n\\nEarn 1% cash back on everything else.\\n\\n0% interest on all purchases for the first 12 months (13.99% to 23.99% variable afterward).\\n\\nPurchase protection and return protection.\\n\\nCar rental loss and damage insurance.\\n\\nTerms apply.\\n\\nWelcome bonus: Earn a $300 statement credit after you spend $3,000 in purchases on your new card within the first six months after opening the account, plus get a $0 introductory annual fee for the first year ($95 thereafter).\\n\\nWhat we like about the Blue Cash Preferred: For many Americans, a significant portion of the monthly family budget goes to supermarket and gas station expenses. The Blue Cash Preferred card dials up the bonus cash back on those two categories, creating a go-to in your wallet for these routine purchases.\\n\\nNot only will you earn extra cash back in the grocery and gas departments, but you'll also earn a significant amount of cash back on all your US streaming subscriptions. This includes over 20 different providers, such as Disney+, HBO, Netflix, Spotify and YouTube TV, among others. And when transit starts to make a comeback, you'll also get a nice return there as well, with 3% cash back on those transactions.\\n\\nRelated: Earn more rewards on your groceries with these credit cards.\\n\\nThe Blue Cash Preferred also comes with a solid return protection policy, which can come in handy during the upcoming holiday season. Return protection allows you to return an eligible item within 90 days from the day of purchase if the merchant won't take it back. As long as you used your Blue Cash Preferred to pay for it, American Express will refund the full purchase price (excluding shipping and handling). Claims are capped at $300 per item, up to a maximum of $1,000 per card account per calendar year.\\n\\nOne thing that could be better: Many of the bonus categories on the Blue Cash Preferred are limited to purchases made within the United States. There's also a 2.7% foreign transaction fee on the card, which doesn't make this an ideal choice for international travel. And the card has a $95 annual fee, which is significantly higher than many other credit cards offering cash back.\\n\\nThe Blue Cash Preferred currently comes with a $0 introductory annual fee for the first year, then $95 thereafter. But if you prefer a card that never has an annual fee and also offers a strong return on groceries, you might consider the Blue Cash Everyday® Card from American Express instead.\\n\\nWhile the Blue Cash Everyday earns a lower 3% cash back at US supermarkets (up to $6,000 per year, then 1%), it has no annual fee. That means if you spend less than $3,166 in grocery purchases annually, it could be a better choice.\\n\\nRelated: Amex Blue Cash Preferred vs. Amex Blue Cash Everyday.\\n\\nWhere it beats our benchmark card: Welcome bonus, an introductory interest rate on purchases, return protection and car rental damage coverage.\\n\\nWhere our benchmark card is better: The Citi Double Cash has an introductory interest rate on balance transfers, and its cash back can be converted to Citi ThankYou travel points when combined with the Citi Prestige Card or Citi Premier Card.\\n\\nLearn more and apply for the Blue Cash Preferred Card.\\n\\nChase Freedom Flex\\n\\nBest for restaurants, including takeout and delivery\\n\\nPHOTO: Chase The Chase Freedom Flex has both fixed and rotating bonus categories.\\n\\nWhy it's great in one sentence: The new Chase Freedom Flex credit card offers both fixed category bonuses — including one specifically for dining — and a set of rotating category bonuses, plus cell phone protection as well.\\n\\nThis card is right for: People who are looking for a no-annual-fee card that earns bonus cash back at restaurants, even if they're just getting delivery or takeout, as well as in several other categories.\\n\\nHighlights:\\n\\nEarn 5% cash back on travel purchased through Chase Ultimate Rewards.\\n\\nEarn 3% cash back on dining at restaurants, including takeout and eligible delivery services.\\n\\nEarn 3% cash back on drugstore purchases.\\n\\nEarn 5% cash back on quarterly bonuses categories (up to $1,500 on combined purchases).\\n\\nEarn 1% cash back on all other purchases.\\n\\nCash back can be transferred to airline and hotel travel programs when combined with select Chase Ultimate Rewards cards, such as the Chase Sapphire Preferred Card\\n\\nCell phone protection.\\n\\nNo annual fee.\\n\\nSign-up bonus: Earn $200 bonus cash back after you spend $500 on purchases in the first three months after opening the account.\\n\\nWhat we like about the Chase Freedom Flex: While you might sign up for the Chase Freedom Flex for its sign-up bonus, it'll likely become one of your long-term go-to cards, thanks to its rotating 5% bonus categories and ongoing 3% category bonuses at restaurants and drugstores.\\n\\nThe Chase Freedom Flex earns 5% on travel booked through Chase Ultimate Rewards, 3% at drugstores and 3% at restaurants. And even if you're not physically eating out at restaurants right now, you'll still receive the increased cash back on takeout and eligible delivery orders.\\n\\nBut in addition to those three fixed bonus categories, the card offers a set of 5% bonus categories that rotate each quarter. For the current quarter from January through March, the categories are wholesale clubs, internet, cable and phone services, and select streaming services, The rotating categories are capped at $1,500 in purchases per quarter, so you can earn as much as $75 in bonus cash.\\n\\nAside from the bonus categories, this card also comes with many unique benefits that differ from most other Chase cards. One of our favorites is cell phone protection. As long as you use your Chase Freedom Flex to pay your monthly cell phone bill, you'll be covered against theft or damage to your phone, up to $800 per claim and $1,000 per year, with a $50 deductible per claim and a maximum of two claims in a 12-month period. This is currently the only no-annual-fee Chase credit card that offers this highly sought-after benefit.\\n\\nOne thing that could be better: While there's no maximum on how much cash back you can earn in the three fixed bonus categories, the rotating 5% cash back categories do have that $1,500 cap in purchases — after that, you'll only earn 1% cash back in those categories for the rest of the quarter. And you'll need to remember to activate the rotating categories each quarter in order to earn bonus cash back in them.\\n\\nWhere it beats our benchmark card: Sign-up bonus, category bonuses and cell phone protection.\\n\\nWhere our benchmark card is better: The Citi Double Cash has an introductory rate on balance transfers.\\n\\nLearn more and apply for the Chase Freedom Flex.\\n\\nCostco Anywhere Visa\\n\\nBest for gas purchases\\n\\nPHOTO: iStock Earn bonus cash back on gasoline purchases, both at Costco and other gas stations.\\n\\nWhy it's great in one sentence: The Costco Anywhere Visa Card by Citi offers big rewards on many practical purchases, such as 4% cash back on eligible gas purchases worldwide (capped at the first $7,000 in purchases per year, then 1% thereafter), 3% cash back at restaurants and on eligible travel purchases and 2% cash back on all Costco and costco.com purchases.\\n\\nThis card is right for: Costco members who want strong rewards when buying at Costco and filling up their gas tank.\\n\\nHighlights:\\n\\nEarn 4% cash back on eligible gas purchases worldwide, including Costco gas (capped at the first $7,000 in purchases per year, then 1% thereafter).\\n\\nEarn 3% cash back at restaurants and on eligible travel purchases.\\n\\nEarn 2% cash back on all Costco and costco.com purchases (other than Costco gas).\\n\\nEarn 1% cash back on all other purchases.\\n\\nPurchase protection and extended warranty coverage.\\n\\nNo foreign transaction fees.\\n\\nNo annual fee.\\n\\nSign-up bonus: None.\\n\\nWhat we like about the Costco Anywhere Visa: For those looking to fill up their vehicle's gas tank, the Costco Anywhere Visa offers the most cash back when compared to other top-earning credit cards.\\n\\nEarning 4% cash back on all gas purchases worldwide for the first $7,000 per year (1% thereafter) can add up quickly and save you some serious money over the course of the year. And aside from the earning potential on gas, earning 3% cash back at restaurants and eligible travel purchases is on par — and many times better — than what you'll see with other cash back credit cards.\\n\\nThe Costco Anywhere Visa also offers purchase protection, which is a great benefit for all purchases, especially during the holiday season. You'll be covered if your item is damaged or stolen within 120 days of purchase (90 days for New York residents). The coverage is good for up to $10,000 per item and $50,000 annually.\\n\\nThe purchase protection applies to items you buy anywhere, not just at Costco. But even while Costco has a favorable return policy for most of its products, electronics and major appliances only have a 90-day return window, which makes the benefits of this credit card extra useful.\\n\\nAlso, with the card's extended warranty coverage, you'll receive an additional two years of warranty on top of the normal manufacturer's warranty for any products you purchase with the card. Again, this extended warranty benefit applies not only to purchases made at Costco, but also to any other retailer as long as you use your Costco Anywhere Visa as your payment method.\\n\\nOne thing that could be better: One big disadvantage of the Costco Anywhere Visa is that you have to wait a full year to receive your rewards, which are sent in the form of an annual certificate after your February billing statement closes each year. The certificate can be redeemed for Costco purchases or exchanged for cash at your local Costco store, and will expire if it's not redeemed by December 31 of that calendar year.\\n\\nAlso, although this card doesn't carry an annual fee, to be a card member, you must have a Costco membership, which starts at $60 per year.\\n\\nWhere it beats our benchmark card: Extended warranty, purchase protection and no foreign transaction fees. Also, the Costco card is a Visa credit card, which is accepted at Costco in-store and at costco.com — Mastercards like the Citi Double Cash are not accepted in-store.\\n\\nWhere our benchmark card is better: With the Citi Double Cash, you receive your cash back on a monthly basis instead of once a year, and you don't have to physically go into a store to exchange your rewards for cash.\\n\\nRead our complete Costco Anywhere Visa credit card review.\\n\\nLearn more and apply for the Costco Anywhere Visa Card by Citi.\\n\\nChase Freedom Unlimited\\n\\nBest for flexibility\\n\\nPHOTO: iStock Cash back earned with the Chase Freedom Unlimited can also be used as points for travel, and at a greater value, when combined with a premium Chase Ultimate Rewards card.\\n\\nWhy it's great in one sentence: If you want to earn bonus rewards on all your purchases but aren't sure whether you'd prefer cash back or travel rewards, the Chase Freedom Unlimited allows you to do both when paired with the Chase Sapphire Preferred or Chase Sapphire Reserve card.\\n\\nThis card is right for: People who want maximum flexibility in a no-annual-fee credit card.\\n\\nHighlights:\\n\\nEarn 5% cash back on travel purchased through Chase Ultimate Rewards.\\n\\nEarn 3% cash back on dining at restaurants, including takeout and eligible delivery services.\\n\\nEarn 3% cash back on drugstore purchases.\\n\\nEarn 1.5% cash back on all other purchases.\\n\\nExpert users can convert the cash back to flexible travel points when pairing the Freedom Unlimited with a Chase Sapphire Preferred or Reserve card.\\n\\n15-month 0% introductory rate on purchases (14.99% to 23.74% variable afterward).\\n\\nNo annual fee.\\n\\nSign-up bonus: Earn $200 bonus cash back after you spend $500 on purchases in the first three months after opening the account.\\n\\nWhat we like about the Chase Freedom Unlimited: If you prefer cash back now but think that a dose of adventure is in your future once travel returns to normal, the Chase Freedom Unlimited can give you the best of both worlds.\\n\\nWhen you pair the Freedom Unlimited with a premium Chase Ultimate Rewards credit card, such as the Chase Sapphire Preferred or Chase Sapphire Reserve, you can convert your cash back to travel points at a rate of 1 cent per point. Then, you're able to redeem those points for travel at an increased value of 1.25 to 1.5 cents apiece via the Chase travel portal.\\n\\nEven better, once you've converted the cash back to points, you can transfer them to any of Chase's 13 airline and hotel loyalty partners. This amazing flexibility is why frequent flyer website The Points Guy values Ultimate Rewards points at 2 cents apiece. At that rate, since you're earning 1.5% cash back in all non-bonus categories with the Freedom Unlimited, you could effectively end up with a 3% return on your everyday purchases.\\n\\nOne thing that could be better: The Citi Double Cash comes with a higher cash back earning rate on everyday purchases, and you can also convert its cash back to travel points in conjunction with a premium Citi card.\\n\\nBut Citi's travel partners aren't as impressive as Chase's, and while the Double Cash doesn't have any bonus categories, the Freedom Unlimited has the same trio of bonus categories as the Chase Freedom Flex (though you won't receive cell phone protection with the Chase Freedom Unlimited).\\n\\nWhere it beats our benchmark card: Sign-up bonus, bonus categories, purchase protection, extended warranty protection and an introductory rate on purchases for 15 months.\\n\\nWhere our benchmark card is better: If you're solely looking to earn flat-rate cash back on every purchase you make, the Citi Double Cash will earn you more on your everyday purchases.\\n\\nLearn more and apply for the Chase Freedom Unlimited.\\n\\nInk Business Unlimited\\n\\nBest for small businesses\\n\\nPHOTO: iStock Small businesses can earn $750 in bonus cash back when opening a new Ink Business Unlimited credit card.\\n\\nWhy it's great in one sentence: Small business owners can earn 1.5% cash back on all their purchases with the Ink Business Unlimited for no annual fee, and also have the option to convert their cash back to travel rewards down the line.\\n\\nThis card is right for: Businesses who want flexible cash back rewards from a no-annual-fee credit card.\\n\\nHighlights:\\n\\nEarn 1.5% cash back on all purchases.\\n\\nExpert business users can convert the cash back to flexible travel points when pairing the Ink Business Unlimited with an Ink Business Preferred Credit Card , or a personal Sapphire card.\\n\\n12-month 0% introductory rate on purchases (13.24% to 19.24% variable afterward).\\n\\nPrimary rental car insurance.\\n\\nPurchase protection and extended warranty coverage.\\n\\nNo annual fee.\\n\\nSign-up bonus: Earn $750 bonus cash back after you spend $7,500 on purchases in the first three months after opening the account.\\n\\nWhat we like about the Ink Business Unlimited: If your business is looking for a simple easy-to-understand cash back card, the Ink Business Unlimited is a great, straightforward option. It earns 1.5% cash back on everything your business buys with it, 365 days a year.\\n\\nAnd if you decide down the line that you'd prefer travel rewards to cash back, you can pair the Ink Business Unlimited with the premium Ink Business Preferred (or alternately, the personal Chase Sapphire Preferred or Chase Sapphire Reserve) and convert your cash back to travel points, then redeem the points for travel or transfer them to any of Chase's 13 airline and hotel loyalty partners.\\n\\nPlus, right now is a fantastic time to get the Ink Business Unlimited. That's because the card currently comes with the highest sign-up bonus we've ever seen on this card. New card holders can earn $750 in bonus cash back after spending $7,500 in purchases in the first three months after opening the account. That's an unbelievable sign-up bonus for a card that has no annual fee.\\n\\nOne thing that could be better: You won't want to use the Ink Business Unlimited on overseas purchases, as it charges a 3% foreign transaction fee. And the $7,500 minimum spend requirement to earn the $750 sign-up bonus isn't small, but it should be feasible for any small business that has regular expenses that can be charged to a credit card.\\n\\nWhere it beats our benchmark card: Sign-up bonus, primary rental car insurance, purchase protection, extended warranty protection and an introductory rate on purchases for 12 months.\\n\\nWhere our benchmark card is better: If you're solely looking to earn flat-rate cash back on every purchase you make, the Citi Double Cash will earn you more on your everyday purchases.\\n\\nLearn more and apply for the Ink Business Unlimited.\\n\\nDiscover it Cash Back\\n\\nBest sign-up bonus\\n\\nPHOTO: iStock For its sign-up bonus, the Discover it Cash Back card matches all cash back earned in the first year.\\n\\nWhy it's great in one sentence: The rotating categories and cash back match bonus on the Discover it Cash Back card mean you can earn a ton of cash back in the first year you have the card.\\n\\nThis card is right for: People looking for a card with a great sign-up bonus and who routinely spend money on popular rotating categories — such as groceries, gas stations, restaurants, Amazon.com and more.\\n\\nHighlights:\\n\\nEarn 5% cash back in rotating quarterly bonus categories up to $1,500 each quarter (must enroll each quarter to earn 5% cash back).\\n\\nEarn 1% cash back on all other purchases.\\n\\n0% interest on all purchases for the first 14 months (11.99% to 22.99% variable afterward).\\n\\n0% introductory APR for 14 months on balance transfers (11.99% to 22.99% variable APR after that) with a 3% intro balance transfer fee, up to 5% fee on future balance transfers (see terms).\\n\\nNo foreign transaction fees.\\n\\nNo annual fee.\\n\\nSign-up bonus: Receive a match of all cash back earned at the end of your first year.\\n\\nWhat we like about the Discover it Cash Back: Earning 5% cash back on a quarterly basis, up to $1,500 per quarter, allows the cash back to really add up. The current quarterly categories on the Discover it Cash Back card are grocery stores, Walgreens and CVS, while other categories later on the 2021 bonus categories calendar includes gas stations, streaming services, restaurants and more.\\n\\nOn top of that, all the cash back you earn on the Discover it Cash Back will be matched at the end of the first year for new card holders, making this an ideal card to have if you know you'll be spending a lot on your credit card over the next year. This means those rotating bonus categories are worth 10% in the first year, and all your purchases outside of the bonus categories earn a solid 2% return the first year.\\n\\nIn addition to a great cash back rewards program, new card holders can also take advantage of a 0% introductory interest on all purchases and balance transfers for the first 14 months from the date of the first transfer, though the rate increases to a variable 11.99% to 2.99% at the end of the 14-month period. There's a 3% intro balance transfer fee that goes up to 5% on future balance transfers (see terms)\\n\\nRelated: Tight on cash? These credit cards charge 0% interest on purchases.\\n\\nOne thing that could be better: You won't get paid out on your sign-up bonus until you've had the card for an entire year, whereas many other credit card welcome offers are paid out as soon as you meet the minimum spend requirement. You also need to pay close attention to the cash back calendar and manually activate the categories on the Discover it Cash Back each quarter, online or by phone, before you make purchases in order to earn the bonus cash back.\\n\\nWhere it beats our benchmark card: No foreign transaction fees or introductory interest on purchases, and the cash back match in the first year equals the earning rate of the Citi Double Cash for everyday purchases and significantly beats it in the bonus categories.\\n\\nWhere our benchmark card is better: After the first year when the cash back match bonus ends, the Citi Double Cash earns a higher return on everyday purchases.\\n\\nU.S. Bank Cash+ Visa\\n\\nBest for streaming\\n\\nPHOTO: iStock Choose streaming as one of your 5% bonus categories on the U.S. Bank Cash+ Visa.\\n\\nWhy it's great in one sentence: Card holders earn 5% cash back in two categories they select from a list — including options like streaming services — every quarter throughout the year, up to $2,000 in purchases per quarter.\\n\\nThis card is right for: People who want a no-annual-fee credit card that offers the flexibility to earn cash back in the categories that work best for them based on their personal spending habits.\\n\\nHighlights:\\n\\nEarn 5% cash back on your first $2,000 in combined credit card purchases each quarter on two categories you choose.\\n\\nEarn 2% cash back on one other category of your choice.\\n\\nEarn 1% cash back on all other purchases.\\n\\n0% interest on all purchases for the first 14 months (11.99% to 22.99% variable afterward).\\n\\n0% introductory APR for 12 billing cycles on balance transfers (13.99% to 23.99% variable APR after that).\\n\\nNo annual fee.\\n\\nSign-up bonus: Earn a $150 rewards bonus after you apply online and spend $500 in eligible purchases within the first 90 days of account opening.\\n\\nWhat we like about the U.S. Bank Cash+ Visa: When compared to the other 5% rotating category cards, the U.S. Bank Cash+ Visa Signature Card is the only one that allows you to customize your cash back categories to select two that work best for your quarterly spending habits. With the other cards, the increased quarterly categories are selected by the issuer and can't be changed by the card holder.\\n\\nWith roughly a dozen category options to choose from, the 5% cash back categories on the U.S. Bank Cash+ Visa include:\\n\\nTV, Internet & Streaming Services\\n\\nCell Phone Providers\\n\\nDepartment Stores\\n\\nElectronics Stores\\n\\nHome Utilities\\n\\nFurniture Stores\\n\\nSince streaming services are popular these days, you can select this as one of your two options. And while the Blue Cash Preferred Card by American Express earns slightly more cash back for US streaming services, it comes with a $95 annual fee after the first year, which you won't have to worry about with the U.S. Bank Cash+ Visa.\\n\\nWith the U.S. Bank Cash+ Visa, you'll also earn 5% cash back on up to $2,000 in purchases in your two chosen categories during each quarter, where other similar cards cap your cash back at $1,500 during the same time frame. That means you can earn up to an extra $100 cash back per quarter or up to $400 per year.\\n\\nOn top of the 5% cash back options, you'll also be able to select one category to earn 2% cash back each quarter, with no cap on the amount you can earn. These 2% categories typically includes popular choices such as:\\n\\nGrocery Stores\\n\\nGas Stations\\n\\nRestaurants\\n\\nOne thing that could be better: You need to activate the cash back categories every quarter on the U.S. Bank Cash+ Visa, and you'll only earn the increased 2% or 5% cash back after activation — rewards can't be retroactively applied. This means you truly need to be on top of your credit card and remember the categories that you select on a quarterly basis.\\n\\nThe 5% cash back options also don't include some more mainstream categories. Instead, everyday purchases, such as buying groceries and filling up your gas tank, are in the inferior 2% cash back bucket.\\n\\nWhere it beats our benchmark card: Sign-up bonus, selectable bonus categories and an introductory offer on balance transfers.\\n\\nWhere our benchmark card is better: The Citi Double Cash has a longer introductory offer on balance transfers and earns a higher 2% flat-rate cash back on all your everyday purchases for those who don't want to worry about category bonuses and a maximum cap.\\n\\nBank of America Cash Rewards\\n\\nBest for travel\\n\\nPHOTO: iStock Choose travel as your 3% cash back bonus category on the Bank of America Cash Rewards card.\\n\\nWhy it's great in one sentence: The Bank of America Cash Rewards credit card allows card holders to select one cash back category — including travel — to earn an increased 3% cash back, but they can change their option on a monthly basis.\\n\\nThis card is right for: Those looking to increase their cash back for all travel-related purchases without having to pay for an annual fee.\\n\\nHighlights:\\n\\nEarn 3% cash back in the category of your choice: gas, online shopping, dining, travel, drugstores or home improvement/furnishings.\\n\\nEarn 2% cash back at grocery stores and wholesale clubs.\\n\\nEarn 1% cash back on all other purchases.\\n\\nBank of America Preferred Rewards members earn 25% to 75% more cash back on every purchase.\\n\\n0% interest on all purchases for the first 12 billing cycles (13.99% to 23.99% variable afterward).\\n\\nNo annual fee.\\n\\nSign-up bonus: Earn $200 cash rewards bonus after making at least $1,000 in purchases in the first 90 days of account opening.\\n\\nWhat we like about the Bank of America Cash Rewards: The Bank of America Cash Rewards card is the only card that allows you to select a category of your choice to earn bonus cash back but where you can change your selection every single month. This allows you to plan ahead and truly maximize your earnings based on upcoming purchases.\\n\\nThis is also the only no-annual-fee cash back card that will earn you 3% cash back on travel. This includes anything from air travel and hotel stays to car rentals, train travel, tolls and more. While there are other cards that allow you to earn 3x points on travel — such as the Chase Sapphire Reserve card — you're usually looking at a significant annual fee.\\n\\nWith the Bank of America Cash Rewards, you're capped at a higher $2,500 per quarter to receive the 2% and 3% cash back categories. If you're able to max out the bonus on a quarterly basis on the 3% cash back categories alone, you'll earn you an extra $75 every quarter.\\n\\nBank of America Preferred Rewards members, which are customers who have at least $20,000 in combined qualifying balances in their Bank of America and/or Merrill investment accounts, can earn an additional 25% to 75% on their rewards earned on the Bank of America Cash Rewards. There are three different tiers, with Gold members earning a 25% bonus, Platinum members a 50% bonus and Platinum Honors members a 75% bonus.\\n\\nThat means if you're a Preferred Rewards member, you're looking at an increased 3.75% to 5.25% cash back in the 3% cash back categories. Of course, this requires parking a significant amount of money in your Bank of America bank or investment account, but it can pay out extremely well for loyal Bank of America customers.\\n\\nOn the benefits front, one of the most unique perks of the Bank of America Cash Rewards card is Bank of America's Museums on Us program. Flash your Bank of America Cash Rewards credit card at a participating museum and you'll receive complimentary general admission to more than 225 cultural institutions across the United States on the first full weekend of every month. For museum lovers, this allows you to visit different museums in your city or while traveling for absolutely no cost.\\n\\nOne thing that could be better: Although the Bank of America Cash Rewards card can earn bonus cash back on your travel purchases, there are very few travel perks that come with this card. If you travel a lot throughout the year and are looking for a card that offers you travel credits, lounge access, complimentary Global Entry or TSA PreCheck and travel protections, you might want to instead consider another travel rewards card, such as the Bank of America®️ Premium Rewards®️ credit card — although it carries a $95 annual fee.\\n\\nWhere it beats our benchmark card: Sign-up bonus, bonus categories, an introductory offer on purchases and complimentary museum access.\\n\\nWhere our benchmark card is better: The Citi Double Cash has an introductory offer on balance transfers and earns a higher 2% flat-rate cash back on all your everyday purchases for those who don't want to worry about category bonuses and a maximum cap.\\n\\nLooking for a credit card that earns travel rewards?

{"original": "We hear a lot about how college is expensive, but many folks don't realize quite how costly a degree can be these days. According to the College Board, the average cost of tuition and fees for the 2016-2017 school year looked something like this:\\n\\n$9,650 for in-state public colleges\\n\\n$24,930 for out-of-state public colleges\\n\\n$33,480 for private colleges\\n\\nOf course, that's just one piece of the puzzle. Room and board -- an oft-necessary component of college attendance -- averages $10,440 at public colleges and $11,890 at private ones.\\n\\nWhen we look at these costs, it's easy to see why so many low- and middle-income families struggle to pay for college.\\n\\nBut for a large number of higher earners, most universities are out of reach as well. According to research by the Institute for Higher Education Policy (IHEP), even families earning over $100,000 a year can't afford nearly 60% of U.S. colleges.\\n\\nNow IHEP defines affordability as the means to pay for college after saving 10% of one's discretionary income for the 10-year period leading up to college, combined with earnings from a student working 10 hours per week during college.\\n\\nGiven that most folks are advised to save 10% of their income for retirement, setting aside another 10% for college is a pretty tall order. It's therefore demoralizing to learn that even those who manage to hit that threshold still wind up falling short in terms of being able to afford most learning institutions.\\n\\nThat said, just because some folks might very well be saving 10% of their income for college doesn't mean that they're saving in the most efficient manner possible.\\n\\nAnd that could spell the difference between affording college or winding up with a ridiculous pile of debt for privilege of having a child attend the university of his or her choice.\\n\\nFind a smarter way to save\\n\\nWhile setting aside money for college is a smart move off the bat, where you put that cash could have a huge impact on your eventual ability, or lack thereof, to pay those bills.\\n\\nFidelity Investments reports that about 40% of families are now saving for college via a 529 plan, which represents an increase from previous years. And while 529s are by no means the only option for saving for college, they're a far more efficient route than savings and traditional brokerage accounts.\\n\\nThough you don't get an immediate federal tax break for contributing to a 529, once you fund an account, that money gets to grow tax-free. As long as you use that money for qualified higher education purposes, you'll get to keep your ending balance in full.\\n\\nTraditional brokerage accounts, by contrast, require you to pay taxes on your gains year after year. This means that if you sell anything in your account at a profit, you'll lose a chunk of those proceeds to taxes, leaving you less money to reinvest. Along these lines, if you leave your investments alone during your college savings period and only sell them off once the time comes to start tacking those tuition bills, you'll lose a portion of your eventual earnings to taxes as well.\\n\\nThen there are savings accounts, which not only impose taxes on interest income but offer very little in the way of returns to begin with. These days, you'll be lucky to get a solid 1% per year out of your savings account, making it a rather inefficient tool.\\n\\nRelated: How should I save for my kid's college education?\\n\\nImagine you earn $100,000 a year, and sock away 10% of that, or $10,000 annually, for 10 years. With a regular old savings account, you'll grow your college fund to roughly $104,000 -- not all too impressive considering that $100,000 of that stems from principal contributions.\\n\\nOn the other hand, if you save in a traditional brokerage account or 529, your investments might very well generate an average annual 7% return, which would leave you with $138,000 after 10 years' time.\\n\\nHere's the catch though -- if you have a traditional brokerage account whose investments you sell off to access that cash, you'll lose a portion of your earnings to capital gains taxes. Assuming you're in the 25% bracket, those taxes will knock a good $10,000 off your $38,000 in gains. With a 529, however, you'll get to use that $138,000 in full, as long as it's applied to qualified college costs.\\n\\nNow one major drawback of opening a 529 is that if you don't end up using that money for qualified purposes, you'll face a 10% penalty on the gains portion of your account. It's for this reason that you might consider other college savings avenues, like a Roth IRA, if you're eligible to open one. (Even if you can't fund one directly, you can always convert a traditional IRA to a Roth.)\\n\\nRelated links:\\n\\n• Motley Fool Issues Rare Triple-Buy Alert\\n\\n• This Stock Could Be Like Buying Amazon in 1997\\n\\n• 7 of 8 People Are Clueless About This Trillion-Dollar Market\\n\\nNo matter how you decide to save for college, you should do so in a manner that lets you maximize your gains and minimize your taxes. Even if you're a relatively high earner, covering the cost of college is likely to be a challenge, so the smarter you are about how you save, the better your chances of meeting your ultimate goals."}

{"original": "(CNN) —\\n\\nA national fraternity and four men are expected to be sentenced Monday for charges related to the 2013 hazing death of Baruch College student and fraternity pledge Chun Michael Deng. Experts say the punishment could influence other cases that involve hazing deaths.\\n\\nPi Delta Psi Inc. was found guilty in November on a felony count of involuntary manslaughter, among other charges, though it was acquitted of the more serious charges of third-degree murder and voluntary manslaughter.\\n\\nPHOTO: WNEP Chun Michael Deng\\n\\nIn May, four Pi Delta Psi members – Kenny Kwan, Raymond Lam, Charles Lai and Sheldon Wong – pleaded guilty to felony charges of voluntary manslaughter and hindering apprehension in Deng's death, which was the result of a hazing ritual.\\n\\nThe case bears numerous similarities to the February death of Timothy Piazza, a fraternity pledge at Penn State University who died after consuming an excessive amount of alcohol then engaging in a hazing ritual similar to the one that killed Deng. Legal experts wonder if the Pi Delta Psi case could have an impact on the Piazza case.\\n\\nAt the time of Deng's death, Baruch College said that Deng died participating in an unsanctioned fraternity pledging event that the school had no knowledge of, adding it had a zero tolerance policy regarding hazing.\\n\\nPi Delta Psi ended its affiliation with its Baruch College colony, saying it had violated the values and rules of our organization. Individual members involved also had their fraternity memberships revoked.\\n\\nAccording to its website, the Asian-American fraternity has a presence on at least 25 college campuses across the country, most of which are based in the Northeast.\\n\\nPi Delta Psi Inc. and its lawyer did not respond to CNN's requests for comment.\\n\\nThere can be no question that the death of Michael Deng was tragic, said Todd Greenberg, an attorney for Lam.\\n\\nTo a lesser extent it's also a tragedy for Mr. Lam and the other young men. They never intended for this to happen, he said, adding Lam had been guilt ridden for his conduct since the day it happened.\\n\\nAn attorney for Wong told CNN, Sheldon remains, and will always be, deeply saddened and devastated by Michael Deng's death.\\n\\nLawyers for the two other individuals could not be reached for comment Sunday.\\n\\nPHOTO: Monroe County DA/Monroe County DA's office Four men pleaded guilty in May in connection to the death of Michael Deng in 2013.\\n\\nDeadly ritual and coverup\\n\\nDeng, an 18-year-old freshman at the New York City college, died in December 2013 during Pi Delta Psi's crossing over weekend for pledges, according to a criminal complaint. The fraternity chapter held the event at a rented house in Pennsylvania's Pocono Mountains.\\n\\nIt was there Deng ultimately suffered and died from a traumatic brain injury while participating in the glass ceiling, a ritual that required pledges to run through a line of fraternity brothers who shoved, pushed and tackled the aspiring members to the ground.\\n\\nPHOTO: WNEP The house rented by the Baruch College colony of Pi Delta Psi in December 2013.\\n\\nAt some point, Deng, who was blindfolded and wearing a weighted backpack, fell, struck his head and was immediately unconscious, according to police. Some fraternity members placed Deng by a fire while others searched the internet for his symptoms and tried to wake the pledge.\\n\\nMeanwhile, the criminal complaint said, other fraternity members were told by a member and the national fraternity president to protect the fraternity and hide all the memorabilia from police – including clothes, fraternity paddles, banners and signs. They were also instructed to conceal cellphones, marijuana and mushrooms, the complaint said.\\n\\nDeng arrived at a nearby hospital for treatment 2 hours after he was injured – a delay that a forensic pathologist concluded significantly contributed to the death of Mr. Deng, the complaint said.\\n\\nDeng's death was ruled a homicide, with forensic analysis revealing at least three clear impacts to the head, rendered by forces considered significant and severe.\\n\\nIt would take hundreds of pounds of impulsive loads and/or hundreds of G forces in order to cause the damage to the interior of the brain, the criminal complaint said.\\n\\nSetting precedent\\n\\nFour fraternity pledge deaths in 2017 overshadowed the case against Pi Delta Psi and its members. However, experts say university communities across the United States will be paying close attention to Monday's sentencing for indications of how other cases may be handled.\\n\\nPledge deaths are being investigated on the campuses of Louisiana State University, Florida State University and Texas State University.\\n\\nProsecutors in the February death of Penn State Beta Theta Pi pledge Timothy Piazza, in particular, will be watching the Deng case closely. The similarities in the two cases could mean that the Deng outcome effects the course of the Piazza prosecution.\\n\\nPiazza died as the result of a hazing ritual called the gauntlet, which involved pledges drinking excessive amounts of alcohol. Afterward, Piazza fell several times, resulting in a traumatic brain injury and a laceration in his spleen that ultimately proved fatal.\\n\\nEven after it was clear he needed medical attention, fraternity members didn't call for help for at least 12 hours. A criminal presentment in the case detailed an alleged coverup, in which pledges were told to clean up evidence of alcohol and keep quiet about what happened. One member allegedly deleted video evidence from inside the house as police came to collect it.\\n\\nStill, there are crucial differences – particularly the role of alcohol. Whereas Piazza consumed at least 18 drinks in 82 minutes, according to video surveillance, Deng's toxicology report revealed no alcohol or other substances of abuse.\\n\\nPHOTO: Patrick Carns Photography Timothy Piazza, center, and his parents\\n\\nDoug Fierberg, an attorney for Deng's family, said prosecutors in the Piazza case could learn from the outcome of the Deng case and Pi Delta Psi case sentencing.\\n\\nThese are two of the higher-profile circumstances involving the prosecution of hazing, said Fierberg. Prosecutors in the Piazza case, he said, might as well learn from the outcome of the Deng case.\\n\\nFierberg said he expects the Deng case will help clarify some things ahead of the Piazza case and could set a number of precedents.\\n\\nNumber one, Fierberg said, national fraternities can and should be held criminal and civilly responsible for the injury and death caused by their members. The criminal prosecutions shows that can happen and should proceed that way and they can be convicted.\\n\\nIn regard to civil responsibility, Fierberg said the Deng case will show fraternities can carry the blame, and not just individual students who were involved.\\n\\nThere are reasons why young men die year in and year out at fraternities, Fierberg said. And the ability to reduce those incidents rests within the control of the national fraternities and universities, not solely in the lap of the men who are on the ground.\\n\\nNot all legal experts believe the Pi Delta Psi case will impact the Piazza case.\\n\\nMonroe County Assistant District Attorney Kimberly Metzger, the prosecutor in the Deng case, said on Friday the two cases are very different and that it would be inappropriate to comment on what (prosecutors in the Piazza case) might learn from our case.\\n\\nA 'chilling effect'\\n\\nThe outcome of the Pi Delta Psi case could also have an impact beyond Pennsylvania, said CNN legal analyst Joey Jackson, who predicted a chilling effect on universities and fraternities nationwide.\\n\\nI think there's a reckoning here, Jackson said, comparing the attention placed on recent hazing deaths to last year's #MeToo movement, which became a tipping point in how the public addresses sexual misconduct.\\n\\nFor whatever reason, this has reached a crescendo, and we're focused on it now, Jackson said. I think you will see forceful prosecutions in other jurisdictions and I think they can learn a lot from prosecutions in Pennsylvania. Universities, he said, will pay attention.\\n\\nHank Nuwer, a journalist and professor at Franklin College in Indiana who has been tracking and writing about hazing deaths since the 1970s, agreed with Jackson's assessment.\\n\\nNuwer said the verdict against Pi Delta Psi and looming sentence strengthens the arsenal for cases like Piazza's and others involving hazing.\\n\\nParents of victims and activists don't think there's enough being done in these cases, Nuwer said, and are pressuring courts to take a harder look at hazing deaths than they have in the past.\\n\\n03:40 - Source: CNN Parents open up on son's hazing death\\n\\nJudges are taking it more seriously, said Nuwer, adding that lawyers who didn't know how to bring a case against fraternities in the past now have greater understanding of how to handle such cases.\\n\\nI'm seeing huge changes from 1978 when my first article appeared, he said. These are important cases right now. That's going to be interesting to see how magistrates and juries look at fraternities now.\\n\\nHopefully, Jackson said, whatever sentence Pi Delta Psi receives, it deters other fraternities and ensures they enact policies to protect members and pledges.\\n\\nThey'll learn from the lessons of Pennsylvania, Jackson said. You're going to see aggressive prosecutions until this stops and that's the way it is.\\n\\nCNN's Sara Ganim contributed to this report."}
{"original": "This story contains images and descriptions of extremist groups and their beliefs.\\n\\n(CNN) Flags, signs and symbols of racist, white supremacist and extremist groups were displayed along with Trump 2020 banners and American flags at Wednesday's riot at the US Capitol.\\n\\nThe pictures tell part of the story of the beliefs of some of those who chose to show up on that day -- from passionate and peaceful Trump supporters to extremists who showed their hate with their symbols as well as their actions.\\n\\nThe mixing of the groups is one issue that experts who track extremism and hate have long been concerned about.\\n\\nThe certification of the election results proved to be exactly the type of event that brought together various groups and could have led to radical ideas being shared, they say. The initial event, which was heavily promoted and encouraged by President Trump, gave all of these groups something to rally around.\\n\\nThis was an event designed to oppose the results of a free and fair democratic election and the transition of power that would naturally follow, Mark Pitcavage, a historian and expert in extremism with the Anti-Defamation League said.\\n\\nCNN spoke with him to identify the symbols and understand the chilling messages of tyranny, white supremacy, anarchy, racism, anti-Semitism and hatred they portray.\\n\\nNoose and gallows\\n\\nWhile a noose on its own is often used as a form of racial intimidation, Pitcavage says he believes in this context the gallows were to suggest punishment for committing treason. It is suggesting that representatives and senators who vote to certify the election results, and possibly Vice President Pence, are committing treason and should be tried and hanged, he explains.\\n\\nThat treason rhetoric was seen on right-wing message boards in days leading up to the event.\\n\\nThree Percenters flag\\n\\nThe Three Percenters (also known as III%ers, 3%ers or Threepers) are part of the militia movement in the United States and are anti-government extremists, according to the ADL.\\n\\nLike others in the militia movement, Three Percenters view themselves as defending the American people against government tyranny.\\n\\nBecause many adherents to the militia movement strongly support President Trump, in recent years, Three Percenters have not been as active in opposing the federal government, directing their ire at other perceived foes, including leftists/antifa, Muslims and immigrants, according to the ADL.\\n\\nThe group's name comes from an inaccurate claim that only three percent of the people in the colonies armed themselves and fought against the British during the Revolutionary War.\\n\\nThe flag seen above is their logo on the traditional Betsy Ross flag. Pitcavage says right-wing groups (mainstream or extreme), which think of themselves as patriotic, sometimes co-opt America's first flag.\\n\\nRelease the Kraken flag\\n\\nThe flag references former Trump lawyer Sidney Powell's comments that she was going to release the Kraken. Powell falsely said she had evidence that would destroy the idea that Joe Biden won the presidency.\\n\\nThe Kraken, a mammoth sea creature from Scandavian folklore, has turned into a meme in circles that believe the election was stolen. The Kraken, they say, is a cache of evidence that there was widespread fraud. On social media, QAnon conspiracy and fringe sites #ReleaseTheKraken has been widely shared along with false theories of fraud.\\n\\nThe Proud Boys and the OK sign\\n\\nThe far right has co-opted the OK sign as a trolling gesture and, for some, as a symbol of white power. The ADL added that symbol to its long-standing database of slogans and symbols used by extremists.\\n\\nA photo from the riot at the US Capitol shows several people making the OK hand gesture.\\n\\nSome of the people in the photo are also seen in a livestream from the rally, where they identify themselves as members of the Proud Boys, specifically the Arizona chapter.\\n\\nThe man livestreaming the event moves through the crowd at the Capitol saying support your local Proud Boys.\\n\\nIn the video, he goes up to a group wearing orange hats and says, They wanna know what the orange hats stand for.\\n\\nOne man replies that it's a way to keep their group together before another chimes in: It stands for the best f*cking chapter in the best f*cking organization in the world.\\n\\nAsked what that organization is, the man in an orange hat declares: The Proud Boys.\\n\\nThe Proud Boys has been supportive of President Trump and present in large numbers at Stop The Steal rallies in Washington, DC. The Proud Boys' leader, Henry Tarrio, who goes by Enrique Tarrio, was released from police custody Tuesday on charges related to allegedly burning a Black Lives Matter banner taken from a Black church last month during protests in the city after a Stop the Steal event. Tarrio has admitted to CNN he did burn the banner. He was ordered by a local judge to stay out of DC as he awaits trial, including during this week's protests.\\n\\nKekistan flags\\n\\nThe green, white and black flag was created by some members of the 4chan online community to represent a made-up joke country named for Kek, a fictional god they also created. It has long been present at right-wing and far-right rallies.\\n\\nThe Kekistan flag is controversial because its design was partially derived from a Nazi-era flag; this was apparently done on purpose as a joke, Pitcavage explained. Younger right-wingers coming from the 4chan subculture (both mainstream right and extreme right) often like to display the Kekistan flag at rallies and events.\\n\\nAltered historic flags\\n\\nAltered Confederate and Gadsden flags were seen throughout the crowds at the Capitol. One Confederate battle flag variation included an image of assault rifle and the slogan Come and take it to convey an anti-gun control message. The phrase come and take it paraphrases the come and take them retort uttered by Spartan King Leonidas at the Battle of Thermopylae when the Persian King Xerxes told him and his people to lay down their spears in return for their lives, Pitcavage said.\\n\\nThe Gadsden flag, which is known to many as the Don't Tread on Me flag, is a traditional and historical patriotic flag dating to the American Revolution. The flag and symbol are also popular among Libertarians. But it also has been co-opted by right wing groups. Pitcavage explains that while some fly it as a symbol for patriotism, others use it as a symbol of resistance to perceived tyranny.\\n\\nOath Keepers\\n\\nA man is seen wearing an Oath Keepers hat inside the Capitol after it was breached. The Oath Keepers is a pro-Trump, far-right, anti-government group that considers itself part of the militia movement charged to protect the country and defend the constitution. The group tries to recruit members from among active or retired military, first responders, or police.\\n\\nTheir leader has spouted vast conspiracy theories on his blog, accused Democrats of stealing the election, previously threatened violence if it was necessary on Election Day during an interview with far-right conspiracist Alex Jones and said his group would be armed to protect the White House if necessary, according to the ADL.\\n\\nThe Confederate flag\\n\\nDuring the United States' long Civil War, no Confederate battle flag came within the shadow of the US Capitol, but on Wednesday, an insurrectionist carried one right through its halls.\\n\\nPhotographers captured a man carrying it past the portraits of abolitionist Charles Sumner and slaveholder John Calhoun.\\n\\nThe flag was always a symbol of support for slavery. After World War II, it became a prominent symbol of Jim Crow and segregation, Pitcavage says not surprisingly, it is a popular symbol among white supremacists -- even outside the United States.\\n\\nAmerica First flag\\n\\nA rioter cloaks himself in an America First flag with the logo of the podcast by far-right commentator Nick Fuentes. Fuentes attended the event at the Capitol, but was photographed remaining outside the Capitol building.\\n\\nAmerica First was also a slogan President Trump used in describing his foreign policy . Its adoption was criticized by the ADL, which said it had an anti-Semitic use seeking to keep the US out of World War II.\\n\\nThe ADL says Fuentes is part of the groyper army, which the ADL calls a white supremacist group.\\n\\nWhile the group and leadership's views align with those held by the white supremacist alt right, groypers attempt to normalize their ideology by aligning themselves with 'Christianity' and 'traditional' values ostensibly championed by the church, including marriage and family, the ADL explains. Like the alt right and other white supremacists, groypers believe they are working to defend against demographic and cultural changes that are destroying the 'true America' -- a white, Christian nation.\\n\\nCamp Auschwitz\\n\\nA rioter inside the Capitol wore a Camp Auschwitz sweatshirt. The bottom of the shirt reads Work brings freedom, which is the rough translation of the words Arbeit macht frei on the gates of the Nazi concentration camp. Auschwitz was the largest and most infamous Nazi concentration camp, where about 1.1 million people were killed during World War II.\\n\\nPitcavage says he believes the shirt came from the now-defunct website Aryanwear. The design, which has been around for about 10 years according to Pitcavage, has been popping up on differing websites in recent weeks, though it is often taken down when a complaint is made.\\n\\nNationalist Social Club stickers\\n\\nA social media image shows Nationalist Social Club stickers on what appears to be US Capitol Police equipment It's unclear when the photo was taken, but it was posted Wednesday in a Telegram chat the group uses, which includes a Nazi symbol as part of their name.\\n\\nNSC, apparently a word play on the National Socialists or Nazi party, is a neo-Nazi group that has regional chapters in both the United States and across the globe, according to the ADL . It is unclear if the sticker on the right refers to a New England chapter, or because the group originally called itself the New England Nationalists Club.\\n\\nNSC members see themselves as soldiers at war with a hostile, Jewish-controlled system that is deliberately plotting the extinction of the white race, according to the ADL. Their goal is to form an underground network of white men who are willing to fight against their perceived enemies through localized direct actions.\\n\\nMAGA Civil War January 6, 2021 shirts\\n\\nThere are still many questions about how exactly the attack on the Capitol happened and who led the charge. But the calls for overthrowing the government and for a civil or race war have long been rallying cries in far-right circles.\\n\\nThe shirts worn by these men on the Capitol grounds on Wednesday show there was at least an intention to commemorate the day. They wore pre-printed shirts, referencing Trump's signature Make America Great Again slogan, alongside the words Civil war and the date of the event that turned into insurrection.\\n\\nMany commenters in far-right forums have written since the attack, that this is just the beginning of that civil war that many of them have long desired.\\n\\nUpdate note: This story has been updated with new CNN reporting on the men pictured in orange hats who say they are affiliated with the Proud boys."}

{"original": "There were just two words I uttered after job offers early in my career: Thank you.\\n\\nI never negotiated for more money. If I did think about it, I quickly worried that I would anger my future employer if I even asked.\\n\\nTo prevent women from making that mistake and to help narrow the gender pay gap (women still make around 80 cents for every dollar a man makes), the American Association of University Women (AAUW) is providing free salary negotiation workshops. Over 30,000 women have completed them since 2015, according to the AAUW.\\n\\nNow the goal is to train as many as 10 million women by 2022, by bringing workshops to more cities and states, and releasing a free online training tool, which will be available this summer.

It's a muscle and it takes practice to learn negotiation skills and if you're not already in a sales job, that becomes even more trying.\\n\\nBased on a study conducted in Boston, where AAUW first started doing the workshops in collaboration with the Boston mayor's office, the extra training helps.

During the two hours, she learned how to define the values she brings to a company, conduct research to understand her value in the marketplace and practice asking for more in role play sessions.\\n\\nThe biggest piece about negotiating your salary for women particularly is that there is a sense of 'I am not enough' and so ... a lot of the training was around feeling comfortable taking the extra mile, said Antoine, who is an account manager in a nonprofit working with banks.\\n\\nShortly after the training, Antoine entered into negotiations for a new position in her organization. But first, she practiced by looking in the mirror, and doing a role play with a trusted colleague. She pushed for 40% more than she was currently making and then ended her pitch.\\n\\nThat's what they teach you in the training is 'say your piece and stop talking.' You don't have to fill the silence, said Antoine, who ended up getting the 40% increase she asked for.\\n\\nRelated: Equality at work sounds great but how do we get there?\\n\\nA new survey shows how critical this training can be. Forty percent of women have received salary increases of 5% or less in the past five years, which is below the cost of living increases during the same time frame, according to the SheKnows Media survey of nearly 1,500 working women in the US. Nearly half of the women surveyed said women are less likely to ask for raises and promotions than men.\\n\\nTo help women overcome their fears about negotiating, Ashley Pare, founder and chief executive officer of Own Your Worth, which helps women grow and manage their careers, turns the tables and has them focus on what they are giving up.\\n\\nI flip it and I ask 'well what are the consequences if you don't ask? How much money are you leaving on the table? Will you be able to pay your bills? Will you have the life that you desire?'  said Pare, who attended one of the workshops in 2015.\\n\\nPare said she sometimes asked for more during her career in corporate human resources but that the workshop convinced her to stay in the game longer as she negotiated a new position.\\n\\nIn the past, I would ask but I didn't persist, so after that first workshop I went to, it definitely gave me the confidence to ask for everything that I wanted and go back and forth a couple of times to land at a happy medium.\\n\\nShe now volunteers as a facilitator at AAUW workshops in Boston.\\n\\nEmployers expect you to negotiate so it's ... knowing that you can and it's OK and you should because it's one way that we can help make a difference, said Pare."}

The Mexican government reaffirmed on January 18, 2018 that they will not pay for US President Donald Trump's controversial border wall and warned that the violence in Mexico is also the result of the heavy drug consumption in the United States. / AFP PHOTO / Herika MARTINEZ (Photo credit should read HERIKA MARTINEZ/AFP/Getty Images)\\n\\n(CNN) —\\n\\nPresident Donald Trump made a televised appeal to Americans on Tuesday for his long-promised border wall, offering familiar warnings but scant detail on how he will negotiate an end to a partial government shutdown that will cost some federal workers their paychecks this week.\\n\\nIn an address to the nation meant to convince Americans of a swelling border crisis that was at times belied by facts, the President gave little indication he is nearing a compromise that might reopen the federal government.\\n\\nIn their response minutes after Trump concluded on Tuesday, the top Democrats in Congress demonstrated an equally entrenched stance.\\n\\nWith neither side appearing to budge after a high-stakes battle of messaging, the situation appeared unchanged as some federal workers prepare for their first missed paycheck and many agencies remain dark.\\n\\nAs expected, the President used the first Oval Office address of his presidency to warn of a growing humanitarian and security crisis at our southern border.\\n\\nBut he did not declare the situation a national emergency, stopping short of a move he's openly weighed in the past days that could secure funding but would likely face a legal challenge.\\n\\nThe immigration matter, Trump intoned, is a crisis of the heart, and a crisis of the soul.\\n\\nAltogether, the President used the word crisis six times in his remarks, seeking to imbue a deadlocked debate over funding with a new sense of urgency.\\n\\nSpeaking from behind the Resolute Desk, Trump said the US could no longer accommodate immigrants who enter the country illegally and implored those who support him to contact their elected representatives.\\n\\nHow much American blood must we shed before Congress does its job? he asked. This is a choice between right and wrong, justice and injustice. This is about whether we fulfill our sacred duty to the American citizens we serve.\\n\\nHe castigated politicians who have deemed his proposed wall immoral, painting them as hypocrites.\\n\\nThe only thing that is immoral is the politicians to do nothing and to continue to allow more innocent people to be so horribly victimized, he said.\\n\\nAfter weeks of a partial government shutdown, Trump and his negotiators have made little headway in convincing Democrats a barrier is needed before agencies can reopen and federal workers can begin receiving paychecks again.\\n\\nThe administration has steadfastly refused to take steps that would restore funding to some agencies, believing the shutdown is its best leverage to secure the wall funds. Fearing he could lose a messaging battle as more Americans feel the pain of a shuttered government, Trump escalated his warnings that the country is unsafe without the border wall he promised as a candidate.\\n\\nIn making his case, Trump turned for the first time to one of the most recognizable symbols of the American presidency – an eight-minute direct-to-camera evening address from the Oval Office.\\n\\nThe idea for the shift in strategy was raised over the past week by top aides, who believed the administration's messaging was not resonating with Americans. The idea had been championed by, among others, the acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, and was a topic of discussion at a weekend senior staff retreat at Camp David.\\n\\n04:48 - Source: CNN Democratic leaders respond to Trump's address\\n\\nInside the White House, some viewed the quiet week between Christmas and New Year's Day as a lost opportunity that could have been used to drive home an urgent message about the necessity of a border wall while Congress was out of town.\\n\\nTrump was initially resistant, but was convinced by aides to adopt a new approach as it became clear his entreaties about securing funding for a wall were not gaining traction.\\n\\nTrump will continue the push in the following days, paying a visit to the Texas border town of McAllen on Thursday to highlight the situation.\\n\\nOn Wednesday, he'll join Republican senators during their weekly lunch. Later he'll return to the White House to resume talks with Democratic and Republican congressional leaders, though it wasn't yet clear whether either side would come offering new elements of a compromise.\\n\\nThis situation could be resolved in a 45-minute meeting, Trump said in his remarks.\\n\\nWhether the authoritative setting of Tuesday's remarks will convince more Americans there truly is a security crisis at the southern border remains an open question. Trump spoke to Americans while he suffers from a credibility lapse after he and his aides have repeated multiple false claims about immigration.\\n\\nFacts undercut the administration's portrait of a nation under siege by terrorists and criminals crossing the southern border; in July 2017, the State Department said there was no credible information that any member of a terrorist group has traveled through Mexico to gain access to the United States.\\n\\nThe administration's own figures show vastly more known or suspected terrorists were apprehended at airports.\\n\\nTrump and top White House officials have in recent days begun speaking more about the humanitarian crisis at the border, which Democrats say is real but of the administration's own making. A surge of families seeking asylum has strained health and child care facilities, and two children have died in US custody.\\n\\nNational emergency?\\n\\n02:42 - Source: CNN Avlon lays out the facts on border security\\n\\nIn the lead-up to the address, the President and his advisers made a public show of considering a national emergency declaration to secure funding for the border wall, a drastic step that would surely be challenged in court. Vice President Mike Pence refused in a string of morning television appearances to say whether a declaration would come during the evening speech.\\n\\nThe White House counsel's office continues to deliberate on the legality of the step. Trump has been under pressure from informal advisers and allies to take the step, which officials was still possible in the coming days.\\n\\nA source close to Trump told CNN's Jim Acosta on Tuesday that the President has been working the phones seeking advice from friends and aides in recent days about whether he should declare an emergency at the border in order to secure funding for the wall. The source said Trump has been told by several of his allies and advisers that a declaration probably won't work from a legal standpoint, though hasn't ruled one out entirely.\\n\\nAnother adviser to Trump said the President has been receiving advice telling him he should declare the state of emergency so he has something to sell to his base – and that if the step is held up in the courts, Trump can still say he tried.\\n\\nWork in progress\\n\\n02:53 - Source: CNN Brianna Keilar: Trump is pushing lies\\n\\nMidday on Tuesday, Trump was working closely with top aides, including policy adviser Stephen Miller, on drafts of the speech.\\n\\nDemocrats had a chance to rebut the President in a subsequent address on Tuesday; all the television networks that agreed to air Trump's remarks also agreed to air Democrats' response, delivered jointly by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer. The pair stood somewhat awkwardly side-by-side in a Capitol hallway for their five-minute long rebuttal.\\n\\nPresident Trump must stop holding the American people hostage, must stop manufacturing a crisis and must reopen the government, Pelosi said.\\n\\nTrump chose to deliver the address after weekend talks between administration officials and Democrats failed to generate a deal that could reopen the parts of government closed by the shutdown.\\n\\nThe closures have become more apparent this week, as more Americans return from holiday vacations to find some federal services unavailable. Most federal workers affected by the shutdown were due to receive paychecks on Friday; without an agreement, they won't be paid.\\n\\nTrump has insisted in public that unpaid workers are understanding in their plight, and that he feels their pain.\\n\\nBut in private, the President has worried an extended shutdown could erode his political support as more Americans feel the effects. Yet he's also fretted that failing to deliver on the border wall – his chief campaign vow – would hurt him with his conservative base.\\n\\nCNN's Jim Acosta and Phil Mattingly contributed to this report.\\n\\nThis story has been updated."}

He has quarantined four times in the past seven months, spending 56 days at home without the possibility of going out.\\n\\nThat kind of time investment, along with the confusion around requirements -- both going and coming home -- are big deterrents for people who might otherwise be willing to travel.

WILLIAM WEST/AFP/Getty Images\\n\\nA test-out mechanism is needed to avoid quarantines, says Tori Emerson Barnes, executive vice president of public affairs and policy at the national nonprofit U.S. Travel Association, which has been advocating for a science-driven, risk-based approach to reopening international travel in particular looking at the elimination of quarantines if you have the right testing protocol in place.\\n\\nWhile vaccines will be critical, de Oliveira and others say the travel industry absolutely cannot afford to wait to ramp up until vaccinations are fully administered globally, making testing an essential part of the equation for safer travel in the near-term.\\n\\nRelated content How risky is flying during a pandemic? What we know and how to make it safer\\n\\nBarnes mentioned a two-tiered regimen of testing 72 hours before departure and again upon arrival as one possible standard, and she cited a testing pilot program in Hawaii -- where a 10-day quarantine can be bypassed on most islands with negative test results -- as an example of where testing out of quarantine has generated demand.\\n\\nWhile U.S. Travel would encourage people to get vaccinated and to test out in places that require quarantines, the association isn't looking for blanket requirements for access, Barnes said. We wouldn't say that you have to have a vaccine to travel.\\n\\nShe acknowledges that determining who is responsible for creating and implementing consistent protocols is a challenge. The government doesn't necessarily want to, she said, and I don't know that the private sector should have that responsibility.\\n\\nYet countries and organizations around the world are making progress in coordinating common approaches, says Alessandra Priante, regional director for Europe at the World Tourism Organization (UNWTO), a specialized agency of the United Nations.\\n\\nA coordinated way of testing is already being implemented in numerous cases, and the next step at a global level is tracing, Priante says, to make sure that we're able to share a certain amount of data, because if we don't share the data, then we are not really able to have all the information that we should have.\\n\\nThe travel industry can't afford to wait until vaccines have been distributed globally to ramp up.

The International Air Transport Association (IATA) is also working on a digital Travel Pass platform\\n\\nEven when vaccines do become widely available, not everyone will take them and researchers are looking at whether the virus could be still be transmitted by vaccinated people.

{"original": "Washington (CNN) -- The U.S. Supreme Court ruled Monday the federal government has the power to keep some sex offenders behind bars indefinitely after they have served their sentences if officials determine those inmates may prove sexually dangerous in the future.\\n\\nThe federal government, as custodian of its prisoners, has the constitutional power to act in order to protect nearby (and other) communities from the danger such prisoners may pose, Justice Stephen Breyer wrote for the 7-2 majority.\\n\\nAt issue was the constitutionality of federal civil commitment for sex offenders who are nearing the end of their confinement or who are considered too mentally incompetent to stand trial.\\n\\nThe main plaintiff in the case, Graydon Comstock, was certified as dangerous six days before his 37-month federal prison term for processing child pornography was to end. Comstock and the others filing suit remain confined at Butner Federal Correctional Complex near Raleigh, North Carolina.\\n\\nThree other inmates who filed suit served prison terms of three to eight years for offenses ranging from child pornography to sexual abuse of a minor. Another was charged with child sex abuse but was declared mentally incompetent to face trial.\\n\\nAll were set to be released nearly three years ago, but government appeals have blocked their freedom. The government says about 83 people are being held under the civil commitment program.\\n\\nCorrections officials and prosecutors determined the men remained a risk for further sexually deviant behavior if freed. The inmates' attorneys maintain the continued imprisonment violates their constitutional right of due process and argue Congress overstepped its power by allowing inmates to be held for certain crimes that normally would fall under the jurisdiction of state courts.\\n\\nThe law in question is the 2006 Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act, which includes a provision allowing indefinite confinement of sex offenders. A federal appeals court in Richmond, Virginia, ruled lawmakers had overstepped their authority by passing it, prompting the current high court appeal.\\n\\nThe statute is a 'necessary and proper' means of exercising the federal authority that permits Congress to create federal criminal laws, to punish their violation, to imprison violators, to provide appropriately for those imprisoned and to maintain the security of those who are not imprisoned but who may be affected by the federal imprisonment of others, Breyer wrote.\\n\\nBreyer equated the federal civil commitment law to Congress' long-standing authority to provide mental health care to prisoners in its custody, if they might prove dangerous, whether sexually or otherwise.\\n\\nIn dissent, Justice Clarence Thomas said the federal government overstepped its bounds.\\n\\nCongress' power, however, is fixed by the Constitution, Thomas wrote. It does not expand merely to suit the states' policy preferences, or to allow state officials to avoid difficult choices regarding the allocation of state funds. He was joined by Justice Antonin Scalia.\\n\\nThe case represented a victory for the federal government and the woman who argued the case on its behalf, Solicitor General Elena Kagan. President Obama nominated Kagan last week to serve on the Supreme Court.\\n\\nA key lawmaker behind the Adam Walsh act applauded the ruling.\\n\\nThe court's holding today is a victory on behalf of the American people, said Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vermont, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee.\\n\\nThe process to enact this law to protect our children from those who would do them harm was difficult. I am heartened to see an overwhelming majority of the Supreme Court uphold this important child protection law.\\n\\nThe justices in April 2009 had blocked the imminent release of dozens of sex offenders who had served their federal sentences after the Obama administration claimed many of them remain sexually dangerous. Chief Justice John Roberts ordered the men be kept in custody while the case worked its way to the high court.\\n\\nMost violent sex offenses are handled at the state level, and at least 20 states run programs in which sexual predators are held indefinitely or until they are no longer considered dangerous. The federal government's civil commitment program is relatively new.\\n\\nThe Adam Walsh act was named after the son of John Walsh, host of TV's America's Most Wanted.Adam Walsh was kidnapped and murdered by a suspected child molester in 1981.\\n\\nThe act also increased punishments for certain federal crimes against children and created a national registry for sex offenders. Those aspects of the bill were not being challenged in this case."}

We're going to be serving breakfast and brunch both to hotel guests and the community, we'll have an afternoon tea and smoothies. It matters what yogurt we serve. I will be curating everything, Brown says. It's a small hotel, so it's about customer experience and accommodating.\\n\\nAnd customer-friendly service doesn't just extend to guests of the human persuasion. Brown, a dog lover, has made The George extremely animal-friendly. Not only are there special doggie treats and beds, but travelers can pick out their pup's accessories (such as a food bowl) ahead of time when they make their reservation so that everything in the room will be ready to go upon arrival.\\n\\nAnother challenge for Brown and Plofker was negotiating Montclair's quirky local laws. The town has a very small number of liquor licenses, which can make it tough for a new bar or restaurant to open.\\n\\nWhile The George does not have one of those licenses, Brown has come up with creative ways to bring booze onto the property, such as having a favorite local wine store host on-site tastings. (The licenses are portable, which works out nicely.) Her team can also arrange for deliveries to individual guest rooms.\\n\\nThe hotel's small size also makes it easy to accommodate specific dietary needs, from gluten-free to diabetic-friendly.\\n\\nThe one thing The George will never have, though?

{"original": "J. Scott Applewhite/AP\\n\\nHarvard professor Alan Dershowitz, a member of President Trump's legal team, offered a new defense of the President's actions with Ukraine, while answering senators' questions.\\n\\nIn a nutshell, Dershowitz argued that a US president is allowed to orchestrate a quid pro quo with a foreign leader to benefit their own re-election campaign, if they also believe that their re-election is in the national interests of the United States.\\n\\nDershowitz said: Every public official that I know believes that his election is in the public interest. And mostly you're right — your election is in the public interest. And if a president did something that he believes will help him get elected, in the public interest, that cannot be the kind of quid pro quo that results in impeachment.\\n\\nThese comments could normalize the type of behavior that landed Trump in the middle of an impeachment scandal, and which Democrats say constitutes an improper solicitation of foreign influence into a US election.\\n\\nDershowitz offered this argument in response to a question from Republican Sen. Ted Cruz about the legality of a quid pro quo. Dershowitz said all elected officials make decisions through a political lens, and often hire pollsters to see how their decisions would play out.\\n\\nTrump's legal team does not concede that he attempted a quid pro quo. Dershowitz was speaking hypothetically. In his defense of Trump this week, Dershowitz has relied on controversial theories that are rejected by a wide cross-section of legal scholars.\\n\\nHow Democrats responded: Democrats later criticized Dershowitz, saying his theory would open the door to rampant abuses from future presidents.\\n\\nThey also rebutted Dershowitz's claims that presidents oversee this-for-that deals with foreign leaders all the time, in furtherance of their personal interests. When Vice President Joe Biden pushed for the dismissal of a top Ukrainian prosecutor, he was acting in accordance with established US policy, and promoting the views of international organizations like the IMF. Trump's team has argued, without providing credible evidence, that Biden actually did this to protect his son's corruption in Ukraine.\\n\\nWhat sets Trump's behavior apart is that there is substantial evidence that withholding the Ukraine aid was not in accordance with official US policy toward Ukraine. Defense Secretary Mark Esper and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, along with then-national security adviser John Bolton, all lobbied Trump to release the aid before he relented in September. Additionally, the nonpartisan Government Accountability Office determined Trump's decision to withhold the appropriate funds violated the law.\\n\\nTrump's lawyers argued that only the President sets foreign policy, not his advisers or lower-level diplomats"}
{"original": "Story highlights Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is a chronic, progressive lung disease with poor prognosis Of nine patients, seven died during the reported 16-year period\\n\\n(CNN) —\\n\\nA cluster of cases of a progressive lung disease occurred among dentists and other dental workers treated at one Virginia care center, according to Thursday's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\\n\\nOf nine patients, referred to as a cluster, seven died during the reported 16-year period. The disease, called idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, is a chronic, progressive lung disease with a poor prognosis. The cause is unknown.\\n\\nA cluster is a term used to define a collection of cases grouped in place and time that are suspected to be greater than the number expected, Dr. Randall J. Nett, lead author of the study and medical officer with the US Public Health Service, explained in an email.\\n\\nIn this case, among 894 patients treated for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis at the Virginia hospital, nine patients – or 1% – were identified as dentists or dental technicians. This number was about 23 times higher than expected, Nett said.\\n\\nAll the cluster patients – eight dentists and one dental technician – were men, with an average age of 64. Though the reason for illness has not been identified, occupational exposures are possible, Nett and his colleagues wrote.\\n\\nDentists and other dental personnel have unique exposures at work, Nett said. These exposures include bacteria, viruses, dusts, gases, radiation, and other respiratory hazards.\\n\\nOne of the surviving cluster patients reported polishing dental appliances and preparing impressions without using a mask or other protection, according to the report. During these tasks, a dental worker would have been exposed to silica and other compounds with known or potential respiratory toxicity.\\n\\nAt this time, we do not know what caused this cluster of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis cases in dental personnel, said Nett, who recommended that workers wear certified respiratory protection if the ability to improve ventilation is not practical or effective.\\n\\nMore work has to be done before we can make any conclusions about the risk dentists or other dental personnel have, Nett said. CDC will follow up on this newly recognized cluster.\\n\\nAbout 650,000 dental personnel work throughout the nation, he said.\\n\\nDr. Paul Casamassimo, chief policy officer of the American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry's Pediatric Oral Health & Research Center, said the new report is not surprising.\\n\\nFor years, dentists have been exposed to plaster and dust from drilling, in addition to the toxic substances listed in the report. The cluster patients were all older, so they may not have been using the most up-to-date practices for personal protection and safety, he noted.\\n\\nWe do work with materials and with human bioproducts that are potentially damaging to our bodies if we inhale them, Casamassimo said. Younger dentists are taught differently than in the past, so they know to delegate certain work or procedures to laboratories that meet more safe and stringent ventilation requirements, he said.\\n\\nFollow CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\\n\\nToday, dental personnel also have required protections from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, he said.\\n\\nHis own father was an old-school dentist.\\n\\nMy father passed away at 79, Casamassimo said. Though his father did not die of pulmonary fibrosis, he had respiratory problems.\\n\\nThis probably has been more common than we have known in the past, he said."}

The card details on this page have not been reviewed or provided by the card issuers.\\n\\nWhy did we select these cards as our best cash back credit cards for 2021? CNN Underscored's comprehensive credit card methodology compares every aspect of each cash back credit card to our benchmark credit card to determine which cards can potentially earn you the most cash. So let's dive into the details of each card and see how they stack up.\\n\\nCiti Double Cash\\n\\nBest overall card for cash back\\n\\nWhy it's great in one sentence: The Citi Double Cash Card is extremely simple, since you earn 2% cash back on every purchase — 1% when you buy and 1% when you pay your statement — all for no annual fee.\\n\\nThis card is right for: People looking for an easy and straightforward way to earn cash back without having to worry about category bonuses.\\n\\nHighlights:\\n\\nEarn 2% cash back on everything — 1% when you make a purchase and another 1% when you pay it off.\\n\\n18-month 0% introductory rate on balance transfers (13.99% to 23.99% variable afterward).\\n\\nExpert users can convert the cash back to Citi ThankYou travel points at a ratio of 1 cent per point when combined with the Citi Prestige® Card or Citi Premier℠ Card.\\n\\nNo annual fee.\\n\\nSign-up bonus: None.\\n\\nWhat we like about the Citi Double Cash: When compared to all of the other major no-annual-fee credit cards, the Citi Double Cash offers the highest ongoing flat-rate return on every single purchase. With this card you'll earn 2% in cash back — 1% when you buy something and another 1% when you pay it off — on every purchase you make. There's no maximum on the cash back you can earn, and you don't need to worry about tracking category bonuses.\\n\\nThe Citi Double Cash also offers a relatively long 18-month introductory 0% interest rate period for balance transfers — a great way to pay off your debt (though make sure you pay it off, because the rate jumps to a variable 13.99% to 23.99% after the introductory offer ends). And you have up to four months after you open the account to make your first balance transfer and still have it qualify for the introductory offer.\\n\\nRelated: Read CNN Underscored's list of the best balance transfer credit cards.\\n\\nExperts will enjoy pairing this card with one of the premium Citi ThankYou credit cards, such as the Citi Premier or Citi Prestige. That's because if you also have a premium ThankYou card, you can actually convert your cash back from the Citi Double Cash to Citi ThankYou points and then transfer those points to one of Citi's airline partners or redeem them for airfare at 1.25 cents per point when going through the Citi travel portal with the Citi Premier (though this rate will drop to 1 cent per point after April 21, 2021).\\n\\nOne thing that could be better: Although the Citi Double Cash card will earn you the most cash back on your everyday purchases, it doesn't have any category bonuses. This can be a downside if you routinely make a large number of purchases in a particular category.\\n\\nYou'll also find that the Citi Double Cash doesn't come with many perks, such as travel or purchase protections. This is also not the card to use for international purchases, as you'll be charged a 3% foreign transaction fee when you're overseas, which more than offsets the rewards you'd earn.\\n\\nWhy it's our benchmark card: The ease of use and straightforward top-of-market cash back earning rate of the Citi Double Cash are why CNN Underscored currently uses the Double Cash as our benchmark credit card to compare the features of other credit cards and determine if they're better or worse overall.\\n\\nYou can read more about our benchmark credit card concept in our credit card methodology guide or dig into our complete review of the Citi Double Cash.\\n\\nLearn more and apply for the Citi Double Cash Card.\\n\\nBlue Cash Preferred by American Express\\n\\nBest for US supermarkets\\n\\nPHOTO: iStock Earn bonus cash back at US supermarkets with the Blue Cash Preferred credit card.\\n\\nWhy it's great in one sentence: The Blue Cash Preferred Card from American Express earns 6% cash back at US supermarkets (up to $6,000 per year in purchases, then 1%), making it one of the best credit cards year after year for buying groceries.\\n\\nThis card is right for: People who spend a significant amount of money at US supermarkets but who also want to avoid high interest rates on their purchases for their first year as a card member.\\n\\nHighlights:\\n\\nEarn 6% cash back at US supermarkets on up to $6,000 per year in purchases (then 1%) and on select US streaming subscriptions.\\n\\nEarn 3% cash back at US gas stations and on transit (including taxis/ride-shares, parking, tolls, trains, buses and more).\\n\\nEarn 1% cash back on everything else.\\n\\n0% interest on all purchases for the first 12 months (13.99% to 23.99% variable afterward).\\n\\nPurchase protection and return protection.\\n\\nCar rental loss and damage insurance.\\n\\nTerms apply.\\n\\nWelcome bonus: Earn a $300 statement credit after you spend $3,000 in purchases on your new card within the first six months after opening the account, plus get a $0 introductory annual fee for the first year ($95 thereafter).\\n\\nWhat we like about the Blue Cash Preferred: For many Americans, a significant portion of the monthly family budget goes to supermarket and gas station expenses. The Blue Cash Preferred card dials up the bonus cash back on those two categories, creating a go-to in your wallet for these routine purchases.\\n\\nNot only will you earn extra cash back in the grocery and gas departments, but you'll also earn a significant amount of cash back on all your US streaming subscriptions. This includes over 20 different providers, such as Disney+, HBO, Netflix, Spotify and YouTube TV, among others. And when transit starts to make a comeback, you'll also get a nice return there as well, with 3% cash back on those transactions.\\n\\nRelated: Earn more rewards on your groceries with these credit cards.\\n\\nThe Blue Cash Preferred also comes with a solid return protection policy, which can come in handy during the upcoming holiday season. Return protection allows you to return an eligible item within 90 days from the day of purchase if the merchant won't take it back. As long as you used your Blue Cash Preferred to pay for it, American Express will refund the full purchase price (excluding shipping and handling). Claims are capped at $300 per item, up to a maximum of $1,000 per card account per calendar year.\\n\\nOne thing that could be better: Many of the bonus categories on the Blue Cash Preferred are limited to purchases made within the United States. There's also a 2.7% foreign transaction fee on the card, which doesn't make this an ideal choice for international travel. And the card has a $95 annual fee, which is significantly higher than many other credit cards offering cash back.\\n\\nThe Blue Cash Preferred currently comes with a $0 introductory annual fee for the first year, then $95 thereafter. But if you prefer a card that never has an annual fee and also offers a strong return on groceries, you might consider the Blue Cash Everyday® Card from American Express instead.\\n\\nWhile the Blue Cash Everyday earns a lower 3% cash back at US supermarkets (up to $6,000 per year, then 1%), it has no annual fee. That means if you spend less than $3,166 in grocery purchases annually, it could be a better choice.\\n\\nRelated: Amex Blue Cash Preferred vs. Amex Blue Cash Everyday.\\n\\nWhere it beats our benchmark card: Welcome bonus, an introductory interest rate on purchases, return protection and car rental damage coverage.\\n\\nWhere our benchmark card is better: The Citi Double Cash has an introductory interest rate on balance transfers, and its cash back can be converted to Citi ThankYou travel points when combined with the Citi Prestige Card or Citi Premier Card.\\n\\nLearn more and apply for the Blue Cash Preferred Card.\\n\\nChase Freedom Flex\\n\\nBest for restaurants, including takeout and delivery\\n\\nPHOTO: Chase The Chase Freedom Flex has both fixed and rotating bonus categories.\\n\\nWhy it's great in one sentence: The new Chase Freedom Flex credit card offers both fixed category bonuses — including one specifically for dining — and a set of rotating category bonuses, plus cell phone protection as well.\\n\\nThis card is right for: People who are looking for a no-annual-fee card that earns bonus cash back at restaurants, even if they're just getting delivery or takeout, as well as in several other categories.\\n\\nHighlights:\\n\\nEarn 5% cash back on travel purchased through Chase Ultimate Rewards.\\n\\nEarn 3% cash back on dining at restaurants, including takeout and eligible delivery services.\\n\\nEarn 3% cash back on drugstore purchases.\\n\\nEarn 5% cash back on quarterly bonuses categories (up to $1,500 on combined purchases).\\n\\nEarn 1% cash back on all other purchases.\\n\\nCash back can be transferred to airline and hotel travel programs when combined with select Chase Ultimate Rewards cards, such as the Chase Sapphire Preferred Card\\n\\nCell phone protection.\\n\\nNo annual fee.\\n\\nSign-up bonus: Earn $200 bonus cash back after you spend $500 on purchases in the first three months after opening the account.\\n\\nWhat we like about the Chase Freedom Flex: While you might sign up for the Chase Freedom Flex for its sign-up bonus, it'll likely become one of your long-term go-to cards, thanks to its rotating 5% bonus categories and ongoing 3% category bonuses at restaurants and drugstores.\\n\\nThe Chase Freedom Flex earns 5% on travel booked through Chase Ultimate Rewards, 3% at drugstores and 3% at restaurants. And even if you're not physically eating out at restaurants right now, you'll still receive the increased cash back on takeout and eligible delivery orders.\\n\\nBut in addition to those three fixed bonus categories, the card offers a set of 5% bonus categories that rotate each quarter. For the current quarter from January through March, the categories are wholesale clubs, internet, cable and phone services, and select streaming services, The rotating categories are capped at $1,500 in purchases per quarter, so you can earn as much as $75 in bonus cash.\\n\\nAside from the bonus categories, this card also comes with many unique benefits that differ from most other Chase cards. One of our favorites is cell phone protection. As long as you use your Chase Freedom Flex to pay your monthly cell phone bill, you'll be covered against theft or damage to your phone, up to $800 per claim and $1,000 per year, with a $50 deductible per claim and a maximum of two claims in a 12-month period. This is currently the only no-annual-fee Chase credit card that offers this highly sought-after benefit.\\n\\nOne thing that could be better: While there's no maximum on how much cash back you can earn in the three fixed bonus categories, the rotating 5% cash back categories do have that $1,500 cap in purchases — after that, you'll only earn 1% cash back in those categories for the rest of the quarter. And you'll need to remember to activate the rotating categories each quarter in order to earn bonus cash back in them.\\n\\nWhere it beats our benchmark card: Sign-up bonus, category bonuses and cell phone protection.\\n\\nWhere our benchmark card is better: The Citi Double Cash has an introductory rate on balance transfers.\\n\\nLearn more and apply for the Chase Freedom Flex.\\n\\nCostco Anywhere Visa\\n\\nBest for gas purchases\\n\\nPHOTO: iStock Earn bonus cash back on gasoline purchases, both at Costco and other gas stations.\\n\\nWhy it's great in one sentence: The Costco Anywhere Visa Card by Citi offers big rewards on many practical purchases, such as 4% cash back on eligible gas purchases worldwide (capped at the first $7,000 in purchases per year, then 1% thereafter), 3% cash back at restaurants and on eligible travel purchases and 2% cash back on all Costco and costco.com purchases.\\n\\nThis card is right for: Costco members who want strong rewards when buying at Costco and filling up their gas tank.\\n\\nHighlights:\\n\\nEarn 4% cash back on eligible gas purchases worldwide, including Costco gas (capped at the first $7,000 in purchases per year, then 1% thereafter).\\n\\nEarn 3% cash back at restaurants and on eligible travel purchases.\\n\\nEarn 2% cash back on all Costco and costco.com purchases (other than Costco gas).\\n\\nEarn 1% cash back on all other purchases.\\n\\nPurchase protection and extended warranty coverage.\\n\\nNo foreign transaction fees.\\n\\nNo annual fee.\\n\\nSign-up bonus: None.\\n\\nWhat we like about the Costco Anywhere Visa: For those looking to fill up their vehicle's gas tank, the Costco Anywhere Visa offers the most cash back when compared to other top-earning credit cards.\\n\\nEarning 4% cash back on all gas purchases worldwide for the first $7,000 per year (1% thereafter) can add up quickly and save you some serious money over the course of the year. And aside from the earning potential on gas, earning 3% cash back at restaurants and eligible travel purchases is on par — and many times better — than what you'll see with other cash back credit cards.\\n\\nThe Costco Anywhere Visa also offers purchase protection, which is a great benefit for all purchases, especially during the holiday season. You'll be covered if your item is damaged or stolen within 120 days of purchase (90 days for New York residents). The coverage is good for up to $10,000 per item and $50,000 annually.\\n\\nThe purchase protection applies to items you buy anywhere, not just at Costco. But even while Costco has a favorable return policy for most of its products, electronics and major appliances only have a 90-day return window, which makes the benefits of this credit card extra useful.\\n\\nAlso, with the card's extended warranty coverage, you'll receive an additional two years of warranty on top of the normal manufacturer's warranty for any products you purchase with the card. Again, this extended warranty benefit applies not only to purchases made at Costco, but also to any other retailer as long as you use your Costco Anywhere Visa as your payment method.\\n\\nOne thing that could be better: One big disadvantage of the Costco Anywhere Visa is that you have to wait a full year to receive your rewards, which are sent in the form of an annual certificate after your February billing statement closes each year. The certificate can be redeemed for Costco purchases or exchanged for cash at your local Costco store, and will expire if it's not redeemed by December 31 of that calendar year.\\n\\nAlso, although this card doesn't carry an annual fee, to be a card member, you must have a Costco membership, which starts at $60 per year.\\n\\nWhere it beats our benchmark card: Extended warranty, purchase protection and no foreign transaction fees. Also, the Costco card is a Visa credit card, which is accepted at Costco in-store and at costco.com — Mastercards like the Citi Double Cash are not accepted in-store.\\n\\nWhere our benchmark card is better: With the Citi Double Cash, you receive your cash back on a monthly basis instead of once a year, and you don't have to physically go into a store to exchange your rewards for cash.\\n\\nRead our complete Costco Anywhere Visa credit card review.\\n\\nLearn more and apply for the Costco Anywhere Visa Card by Citi.\\n\\nChase Freedom Unlimited\\n\\nBest for flexibility\\n\\nPHOTO: iStock Cash back earned with the Chase Freedom Unlimited can also be used as points for travel, and at a greater value, when combined with a premium Chase Ultimate Rewards card.\\n\\nWhy it's great in one sentence: If you want to earn bonus rewards on all your purchases but aren't sure whether you'd prefer cash back or travel rewards, the Chase Freedom Unlimited allows you to do both when paired with the Chase Sapphire Preferred or Chase Sapphire Reserve card.\\n\\nThis card is right for: People who want maximum flexibility in a no-annual-fee credit card.\\n\\nHighlights:\\n\\nEarn 5% cash back on travel purchased through Chase Ultimate Rewards.\\n\\nEarn 3% cash back on dining at restaurants, including takeout and eligible delivery services.\\n\\nEarn 3% cash back on drugstore purchases.\\n\\nEarn 1.5% cash back on all other purchases.\\n\\nExpert users can convert the cash back to flexible travel points when pairing the Freedom Unlimited with a Chase Sapphire Preferred or Reserve card.\\n\\n15-month 0% introductory rate on purchases (14.99% to 23.74% variable afterward).\\n\\nNo annual fee.\\n\\nSign-up bonus: Earn $200 bonus cash back after you spend $500 on purchases in the first three months after opening the account.\\n\\nWhat we like about the Chase Freedom Unlimited: If you prefer cash back now but think that a dose of adventure is in your future once travel returns to normal, the Chase Freedom Unlimited can give you the best of both worlds.\\n\\nWhen you pair the Freedom Unlimited with a premium Chase Ultimate Rewards credit card, such as the Chase Sapphire Preferred or Chase Sapphire Reserve, you can convert your cash back to travel points at a rate of 1 cent per point. Then, you're able to redeem those points for travel at an increased value of 1.25 to 1.5 cents apiece via the Chase travel portal.\\n\\nEven better, once you've converted the cash back to points, you can transfer them to any of Chase's 13 airline and hotel loyalty partners. This amazing flexibility is why frequent flyer website The Points Guy values Ultimate Rewards points at 2 cents apiece. At that rate, since you're earning 1.5% cash back in all non-bonus categories with the Freedom Unlimited, you could effectively end up with a 3% return on your everyday purchases.\\n\\nOne thing that could be better: The Citi Double Cash comes with a higher cash back earning rate on everyday purchases, and you can also convert its cash back to travel points in conjunction with a premium Citi card.\\n\\nBut Citi's travel partners aren't as impressive as Chase's, and while the Double Cash doesn't have any bonus categories, the Freedom Unlimited has the same trio of bonus categories as the Chase Freedom Flex (though you won't receive cell phone protection with the Chase Freedom Unlimited).\\n\\nWhere it beats our benchmark card: Sign-up bonus, bonus categories, purchase protection, extended warranty protection and an introductory rate on purchases for 15 months.\\n\\nWhere our benchmark card is better: If you're solely looking to earn flat-rate cash back on every purchase you make, the Citi Double Cash will earn you more on your everyday purchases.\\n\\nLearn more and apply for the Chase Freedom Unlimited.\\n\\nInk Business Unlimited\\n\\nBest for small businesses\\n\\nPHOTO: iStock Small businesses can earn $750 in bonus cash back when opening a new Ink Business Unlimited credit card.\\n\\nWhy it's great in one sentence: Small business owners can earn 1.5% cash back on all their purchases with the Ink Business Unlimited for no annual fee, and also have the option to convert their cash back to travel rewards down the line.\\n\\nThis card is right for: Businesses who want flexible cash back rewards from a no-annual-fee credit card.\\n\\nHighlights:\\n\\nEarn 1.5% cash back on all purchases.\\n\\nExpert business users can convert the cash back to flexible travel points when pairing the Ink Business Unlimited with an Ink Business Preferred Credit Card , or a personal Sapphire card.\\n\\n12-month 0% introductory rate on purchases (13.24% to 19.24% variable afterward).\\n\\nPrimary rental car insurance.\\n\\nPurchase protection and extended warranty coverage.\\n\\nNo annual fee.\\n\\nSign-up bonus: Earn $750 bonus cash back after you spend $7,500 on purchases in the first three months after opening the account.\\n\\nWhat we like about the Ink Business Unlimited: If your business is looking for a simple easy-to-understand cash back card, the Ink Business Unlimited is a great, straightforward option. It earns 1.5% cash back on everything your business buys with it, 365 days a year.\\n\\nAnd if you decide down the line that you'd prefer travel rewards to cash back, you can pair the Ink Business Unlimited with the premium Ink Business Preferred (or alternately, the personal Chase Sapphire Preferred or Chase Sapphire Reserve) and convert your cash back to travel points, then redeem the points for travel or transfer them to any of Chase's 13 airline and hotel loyalty partners.\\n\\nPlus, right now is a fantastic time to get the Ink Business Unlimited. That's because the card currently comes with the highest sign-up bonus we've ever seen on this card. New card holders can earn $750 in bonus cash back after spending $7,500 in purchases in the first three months after opening the account. That's an unbelievable sign-up bonus for a card that has no annual fee.\\n\\nOne thing that could be better: You won't want to use the Ink Business Unlimited on overseas purchases, as it charges a 3% foreign transaction fee. And the $7,500 minimum spend requirement to earn the $750 sign-up bonus isn't small, but it should be feasible for any small business that has regular expenses that can be charged to a credit card.\\n\\nWhere it beats our benchmark card: Sign-up bonus, primary rental car insurance, purchase protection, extended warranty protection and an introductory rate on purchases for 12 months.\\n\\nWhere our benchmark card is better: If you're solely looking to earn flat-rate cash back on every purchase you make, the Citi Double Cash will earn you more on your everyday purchases.\\n\\nLearn more and apply for the Ink Business Unlimited.\\n\\nDiscover it Cash Back\\n\\nBest sign-up bonus\\n\\nPHOTO: iStock For its sign-up bonus, the Discover it Cash Back card matches all cash back earned in the first year.\\n\\nWhy it's great in one sentence: The rotating categories and cash back match bonus on the Discover it Cash Back card mean you can earn a ton of cash back in the first year you have the card.\\n\\nThis card is right for: People looking for a card with a great sign-up bonus and who routinely spend money on popular rotating categories — such as groceries, gas stations, restaurants, Amazon.com and more.\\n\\nHighlights:\\n\\nEarn 5% cash back in rotating quarterly bonus categories up to $1,500 each quarter (must enroll each quarter to earn 5% cash back).\\n\\nEarn 1% cash back on all other purchases.\\n\\n0% interest on all purchases for the first 14 months (11.99% to 22.99% variable afterward).\\n\\n0% introductory APR for 14 months on balance transfers (11.99% to 22.99% variable APR after that) with a 3% intro balance transfer fee, up to 5% fee on future balance transfers (see terms).\\n\\nNo foreign transaction fees.\\n\\nNo annual fee.\\n\\nSign-up bonus: Receive a match of all cash back earned at the end of your first year.\\n\\nWhat we like about the Discover it Cash Back: Earning 5% cash back on a quarterly basis, up to $1,500 per quarter, allows the cash back to really add up. The current quarterly categories on the Discover it Cash Back card are grocery stores, Walgreens and CVS, while other categories later on the 2021 bonus categories calendar includes gas stations, streaming services, restaurants and more.\\n\\nOn top of that, all the cash back you earn on the Discover it Cash Back will be matched at the end of the first year for new card holders, making this an ideal card to have if you know you'll be spending a lot on your credit card over the next year. This means those rotating bonus categories are worth 10% in the first year, and all your purchases outside of the bonus categories earn a solid 2% return the first year.\\n\\nIn addition to a great cash back rewards program, new card holders can also take advantage of a 0% introductory interest on all purchases and balance transfers for the first 14 months from the date of the first transfer, though the rate increases to a variable 11.99% to 2.99% at the end of the 14-month period. There's a 3% intro balance transfer fee that goes up to 5% on future balance transfers (see terms)\\n\\nRelated: Tight on cash? These credit cards charge 0% interest on purchases.\\n\\nOne thing that could be better: You won't get paid out on your sign-up bonus until you've had the card for an entire year, whereas many other credit card welcome offers are paid out as soon as you meet the minimum spend requirement. You also need to pay close attention to the cash back calendar and manually activate the categories on the Discover it Cash Back each quarter, online or by phone, before you make purchases in order to earn the bonus cash back.\\n\\nWhere it beats our benchmark card: No foreign transaction fees or introductory interest on purchases, and the cash back match in the first year equals the earning rate of the Citi Double Cash for everyday purchases and significantly beats it in the bonus categories.\\n\\nWhere our benchmark card is better: After the first year when the cash back match bonus ends, the Citi Double Cash earns a higher return on everyday purchases.\\n\\nU.S. Bank Cash+ Visa\\n\\nBest for streaming\\n\\nPHOTO: iStock Choose streaming as one of your 5% bonus categories on the U.S. Bank Cash+ Visa.\\n\\nWhy it's great in one sentence: Card holders earn 5% cash back in two categories they select from a list — including options like streaming services — every quarter throughout the year, up to $2,000 in purchases per quarter.\\n\\nThis card is right for: People who want a no-annual-fee credit card that offers the flexibility to earn cash back in the categories that work best for them based on their personal spending habits.\\n\\nHighlights:\\n\\nEarn 5% cash back on your first $2,000 in combined credit card purchases each quarter on two categories you choose.\\n\\nEarn 2% cash back on one other category of your choice.\\n\\nEarn 1% cash back on all other purchases.\\n\\n0% interest on all purchases for the first 14 months (11.99% to 22.99% variable afterward).\\n\\n0% introductory APR for 12 billing cycles on balance transfers (13.99% to 23.99% variable APR after that).\\n\\nNo annual fee.\\n\\nSign-up bonus: Earn a $150 rewards bonus after you apply online and spend $500 in eligible purchases within the first 90 days of account opening.\\n\\nWhat we like about the U.S. Bank Cash+ Visa: When compared to the other 5% rotating category cards, the U.S. Bank Cash+ Visa Signature Card is the only one that allows you to customize your cash back categories to select two that work best for your quarterly spending habits. With the other cards, the increased quarterly categories are selected by the issuer and can't be changed by the card holder.\\n\\nWith roughly a dozen category options to choose from, the 5% cash back categories on the U.S. Bank Cash+ Visa include:\\n\\nTV, Internet & Streaming Services\\n\\nCell Phone Providers\\n\\nDepartment Stores\\n\\nElectronics Stores\\n\\nHome Utilities\\n\\nFurniture Stores\\n\\nSince streaming services are popular these days, you can select this as one of your two options. And while the Blue Cash Preferred Card by American Express earns slightly more cash back for US streaming services, it comes with a $95 annual fee after the first year, which you won't have to worry about with the U.S. Bank Cash+ Visa.\\n\\nWith the U.S. Bank Cash+ Visa, you'll also earn 5% cash back on up to $2,000 in purchases in your two chosen categories during each quarter, where other similar cards cap your cash back at $1,500 during the same time frame. That means you can earn up to an extra $100 cash back per quarter or up to $400 per year.\\n\\nOn top of the 5% cash back options, you'll also be able to select one category to earn 2% cash back each quarter, with no cap on the amount you can earn. These 2% categories typically includes popular choices such as:\\n\\nGrocery Stores\\n\\nGas Stations\\n\\nRestaurants\\n\\nOne thing that could be better: You need to activate the cash back categories every quarter on the U.S. Bank Cash+ Visa, and you'll only earn the increased 2% or 5% cash back after activation — rewards can't be retroactively applied. This means you truly need to be on top of your credit card and remember the categories that you select on a quarterly basis.\\n\\nThe 5% cash back options also don't include some more mainstream categories. Instead, everyday purchases, such as buying groceries and filling up your gas tank, are in the inferior 2% cash back bucket.\\n\\nWhere it beats our benchmark card: Sign-up bonus, selectable bonus categories and an introductory offer on balance transfers.\\n\\nWhere our benchmark card is better: The Citi Double Cash has a longer introductory offer on balance transfers and earns a higher 2% flat-rate cash back on all your everyday purchases for those who don't want to worry about category bonuses and a maximum cap.\\n\\nBank of America Cash Rewards\\n\\nBest for travel\\n\\nPHOTO: iStock Choose travel as your 3% cash back bonus category on the Bank of America Cash Rewards card.\\n\\nWhy it's great in one sentence: The Bank of America Cash Rewards credit card allows card holders to select one cash back category — including travel — to earn an increased 3% cash back, but they can change their option on a monthly basis.\\n\\nThis card is right for: Those looking to increase their cash back for all travel-related purchases without having to pay for an annual fee.\\n\\nHighlights:\\n\\nEarn 3% cash back in the category of your choice: gas, online shopping, dining, travel, drugstores or home improvement/furnishings.\\n\\nEarn 2% cash back at grocery stores and wholesale clubs.\\n\\nEarn 1% cash back on all other purchases.\\n\\nBank of America Preferred Rewards members earn 25% to 75% more cash back on every purchase.\\n\\n0% interest on all purchases for the first 12 billing cycles (13.99% to 23.99% variable afterward).\\n\\nNo annual fee.\\n\\nSign-up bonus: Earn $200 cash rewards bonus after making at least $1,000 in purchases in the first 90 days of account opening.\\n\\nWhat we like about the Bank of America Cash Rewards: The Bank of America Cash Rewards card is the only card that allows you to select a category of your choice to earn bonus cash back but where you can change your selection every single month. This allows you to plan ahead and truly maximize your earnings based on upcoming purchases.\\n\\nThis is also the only no-annual-fee cash back card that will earn you 3% cash back on travel. This includes anything from air travel and hotel stays to car rentals, train travel, tolls and more. While there are other cards that allow you to earn 3x points on travel — such as the Chase Sapphire Reserve card — you're usually looking at a significant annual fee.\\n\\nWith the Bank of America Cash Rewards, you're capped at a higher $2,500 per quarter to receive the 2% and 3% cash back categories. If you're able to max out the bonus on a quarterly basis on the 3% cash back categories alone, you'll earn you an extra $75 every quarter.\\n\\nBank of America Preferred Rewards members, which are customers who have at least $20,000 in combined qualifying balances in their Bank of America and/or Merrill investment accounts, can earn an additional 25% to 75% on their rewards earned on the Bank of America Cash Rewards. There are three different tiers, with Gold members earning a 25% bonus, Platinum members a 50% bonus and Platinum Honors members a 75% bonus.\\n\\nThat means if you're a Preferred Rewards member, you're looking at an increased 3.75% to 5.25% cash back in the 3% cash back categories. Of course, this requires parking a significant amount of money in your Bank of America bank or investment account, but it can pay out extremely well for loyal Bank of America customers.\\n\\nOn the benefits front, one of the most unique perks of the Bank of America Cash Rewards card is Bank of America's Museums on Us program. Flash your Bank of America Cash Rewards credit card at a participating museum and you'll receive complimentary general admission to more than 225 cultural institutions across the United States on the first full weekend of every month. For museum lovers, this allows you to visit different museums in your city or while traveling for absolutely no cost.\\n\\nOne thing that could be better: Although the Bank of America Cash Rewards card can earn bonus cash back on your travel purchases, there are very few travel perks that come with this card. If you travel a lot throughout the year and are looking for a card that offers you travel credits, lounge access, complimentary Global Entry or TSA PreCheck and travel protections, you might want to instead consider another travel rewards card, such as the Bank of America®️ Premium Rewards®️ credit card — although it carries a $95 annual fee.\\n\\nWhere it beats our benchmark card: Sign-up bonus, bonus categories, an introductory offer on purchases and complimentary museum access.\\n\\nWhere our benchmark card is better: The Citi Double Cash has an introductory offer on balance transfers and earns a higher 2% flat-rate cash back on all your everyday purchases for those who don't want to worry about category bonuses and a maximum cap.\\n\\nLooking for a credit card that earns travel rewards?

{"original": "(CNN) —\\n\\nMichigan State University fostered a culture that was more focused on protecting the school than the survivors of serial abuser Larry Nassar, a report released Thursday by the Michigan House of Representatives said.\\n\\nState lawmakers conducted their own investigation of MSU's handling of complaints against the former sports doctor to identify possible policy solutions. The House sent their findings to law enforcement for consideration in the Michigan Attorney General's investigation of MSU's handling of the Nassar case.\\n\\nPHOTO: JEFF KOWALSKY/AFP/AFP/Getty Images Larry Nassar\\n\\nThe Attorney General appreciates the work done by the Michigan House of Representatives, the attorney general's office said in a statement. The investigative team will be reviewing the report.\\n\\nThe report marks the first time the state legislature has commented publicly on the Nassar case. It is one of many steps taken by lawmakers and law enforcement to figure out how multiple institutions failed hundreds of Nassar's victims – many of them minors – for over 30 years. Nassar was sentenced to 40 to 125 years in prison for his crimes in both Ingham and Eaton counties.\\n\\nMichigan State spokeswoman Emily Guerrant said the university will continue cooperating with lawmakers to create improvements and changes with the hopes of preventing tragedies like this from ever happening again.\\n\\nThese are some of the report's findings:\\n\\n243 people have reported Nassar to MSU since 2014\\n\\nFrom 2014 to the present, 243 people reported abuse to the Michigan State University Police Department, according to the report. Most of those who reported abuse were minors at the time.\\n\\nThe House report also noted that 91 other Title IX complaints were filed against Nassar since Rachel Denhollander filed a Title IX complaint against him in 2016. Denhollander spoke to the Indianoplis Star in 2016, and, after her interview, many others came forward to tell their own stories of sexual assault and harassment at the hands of Nassar.\\n\\nMSU 'failed to properly investigate'\\n\\nAmanda Thomashow, a former MSU student, filed a Title IX complaint against Nassar in 2014. The school conducted an investigation and determined that Nassar's conduct did not violate the school's sexual harassment policy.\\n\\nBut the House report states that MSU failed to properly investigate Thomashow's complaint for a number of reasons.\\n\\nFor one, the investigation was based on flawed testimony from biased medical experts, the report said. Each expert worked with Nassar or knew him personally, and Nassar handpicked one of them, according to the report.\\n\\nMoreover, the experts' explanations were fallacious at best and only provided circular justifications for what Nassar claimed were legitimate medical treatments, the report states.\\n\\nThe report also points out that Thomashow received a different final report than Nassar. Thomashow's report did not include the new requirements Nassar would need to follow when practicing similar procedures on patients. Nassar's did. The discrepancy demonstrates an office culture more focused on protecting the institution than survivors, the report states.\\n\\nMSU 'defiantly' stands by its 2014 investigation\\n\\nThe report notes that MSU continues to defiantly and wrongfully maintain it did not mishandle the 2014 Title IX investigation. MSU still defends the conclusions of their 2014 investigation, arguing that the facts of Thomashow's case were materially different from a later investigation, which reached the opposite conclusion, the report states.\\n\\nNassar didn't keep medical records on everything\\n\\nMedical records for many of what Nassar called his treatments were not kept, the report found. In the medical records that were kept, they didn't include any mention of or reference to the more sensitive parts of his treatments, like intravaginal penetration.\\n\\nIn other cases, MSU destroyed medical records of people who reported abuse or harassment to MSU police later, but they were all destroyed in accordance with state law and MSU's record retention policy, according to the report.\\n\\nNassar grew more comfortable with abuse over time\\n\\nWhile Nassar initially took more care to make his treatments seem medically appropriate when he began these treatments in the 1990s, as time went on, he grew more comfortable with his conduct. Initially, Nassar would explain the procedure and demonstrate on a pelvic model.\\n\\nBy the 2000s, he would only mention to victims that he was going to adjust the pelvic bones. By 2014, he felt comfortable enough to abuse his patients without any prior explanation when performing the treatment, according to the report.\\n\\nBy 2016, he was self-assured enough to readily admit to investigators that he 'does not get written consent from the patient before treatment' and even testified that 'unless the patient stops him, he is assuming the patient understand.' \\n\\nMSU sexual assault and harassment policies are changing\\n\\nMSU has changed a number of policies and procedures regarding sexual harassment and assault since Nassar was suspended from MSU in 2016. The Office of Institutional Equity, the office within the university that handles Title IX complaints, only had three staff members in the 2014-2015 academic year, the staff increased to seven the following year. The office now has ten full time staff members, according to the report.\\n\\nCNN's Linh Tran and Jean Casarez contributed to this report."}
{"original": "Repealing and replacing Obamacare not only would change health coverage and costs for tens of millions of Americans, it would also give a juicy tax gift to the rich.\\n\\nRolling back Obamacare would provide a nearly $1 trillion tax cut that would disproportionately benefit the wealthy and businesses.\\n\\nBut if Republican repeal efforts fail, House Speaker Paul Ryan signaled Tuesday that no one should expect lawmakers to include those tax cuts in tax reform.\\n\\nIf the health care bill doesn't pass, then that trillion dollars of Obamacare taxes ... we won't incorporate those in tax reform, Ryan said on CNBC's Power Lunch.We will have to put those off to the side and they will have to be gotten to when we get to health care reform.\\n\\nGiven how hard repealing Obamacare has been so far, there's little reason to assume it will get much easier. So for all intents and purposes those taxes will stand indefinitely. They include a high-income Medicare surtax on investment income and on wages over $200,000 ($250,000 if married).\\n\\nThe likely reason why tax writers have decided to leave Obamacare tax cuts off the agenda is cost, plain and simple. It would make their efforts to reform the tax code that much more expensive and therefore harder to pay for. And they will need to pay for it as a condition for passing it with a simple majority in the Senate.\\n\\nAdding $1 trillion to the cost of the tax bill would make it even harder to make it revenue neutral. As it is, it's a heavy lift, said Roberton Williams, a senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center.\\n\\nRelated: Who pays if Congress kills the state and local tax deduction\\n\\nTax reform will be a heavy lift for many reasons. For starters, there are still big disagreements within the Republican party itself as to how low tax rates should be and whether it's even necessary to pay for tax cuts.\\n\\nIf they're not paid for, not only would tax reform add substantially to deficits, but under Senate rules, they would expire at the end of the budget window instead of becoming permanent, which is what Ryan wants.\\n\\nThe White House has been in regular talks with leaders and top tax writers in the House and Senate to come up with a framework for a tax reform bill they can all agree on.\\n\\nDespite what many skeptics believe, Ryan on Tuesday said after a speech before the National Association of Manufacturers that he's confident there will be a tax reform bill on the floor this fall and passage by the end of the year."}

{"original": "(CNN) The Rev. Raphael Warnock , the senior pastor of Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta, will be the first Black senator from Georgia, CNN projected early Wednesday, a repudiation of Republican Sen. Kelly Loeffler and her adherence to President Donald Trump.\\n\\nThe Democratic Party appears closer to retaking the US Senate, as Georgia Republican David Perdue narrowly trails in his fight to keep his seat against Democratic candidate Jon Ossoff. Both candidates claimed they would win after all the ballots had been counted, but CNN has not yet called the race.\\n\\nWarnock is the first Georgia Democrat elected to the Senate in 20 years, and his election is the culmination of years of voter registration drives conducted by former state House Democratic leader Stacey Abrams and other activists. President-elect Joe Biden also won Georgia, the first time for a Democratic presidential candidate since the 1990s.\\n\\nI am an iteration and an example of the American dream, the senator-elect told CNN's John Berman Wednesday morning on New Day. He added, When I think about the arc of our history, what Georgia did last night is its own message in the midst of a moment in which so many people are trying to divide our country, at a time we can least afford to be divided.\\n\\nAfter no Georgia Senate candidate received 50% of the vote in November, the races turned to two runoffs. While Ossoff and Warnock ran on a unity ticket, Trump refused to concede his own loss, sparking a fight within the Republican Party and disenchanting some of his supporters, who believed his false claims that the vote was rigged.\\n\\nTrump's ongoing onslaught against the Republican officials in charge of the elections pressured the two GOP senators to make a choice: Join the President in seeking to overturn the democratic outcome or risk losing Trump supporters, some of whom have become disenchanted with the electoral process. Trump recently appeared to pressure Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger on a private call, urging him to find enough votes to reverse the results. Raffensperger refused.\\n\\nBut despite three recounts and no evidence of widespread fraud, Loeffler and Perdue decided to join the President in objecting to Congress' certification of the Electoral College's results in a final, deluded display of devotion to Trump supporters.\\n\\nThe American people deserve a platform in Congress, permitted under the Constitution, to have election issues presented so that they can be addressed, said Loeffler in a statement on Monday.\\n\\nAsked if it was appropriate for her to vote against certification of the electoral votes, Warnock told CNN Wednesday that his opponent has consistently put what she perceives to be her own short-term political interests over the concerns of ordinary people.\\n\\nWhat is unfolding in the Senate today or in the House, what's unfolding in this moment is a distraction. It's a distraction, he told Berman. These senators know better and the people that I'm talking to all across Georgia are concerned about their lives.\\n\\nWhile Georgia is a rapidly diversifying state, the Republican candidates came into the Senate runoff elections with an advantage.\\n\\nIn November, Perdue received over 88,000 more votes than Ossoff, while Loeffler and the other Republican candidates received more votes than Warnock and the other Democratic candidates in the special election (Warnock received most of the vote -- 33% -- overall).\\n\\nRepublicans hoped their message that Georgia should be a check on Washington would prove successful, noting that if Warnock and Ossoff win, Biden, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer will be in charge.\\n\\nWe're talking about the future of the country, and we can't just turn it all over to one party, said Eric Tanenblatt, who served as chief of staff to former Republican Georgia Gov. Sonny Perdue, before Election Day. That could be wishful thinking on my part. But I do think that that's going to be a big motivator.\\n\\nBut Republicans are worried that Trump's unwillingness to concede jeopardizes the party's hold on the Senate, even though the state has not elected a Democrat to the chamber since 2000.\\n\\nHeath Garrett, a campaign manager for former Georgia Republican Sen. Johnny Isakson, told CNN that Trump's attacks on Gov. Brian Kemp and Raffensperger were counterproductive for trying to motivate grassroots, base Republicans to go vote, and said they've threw Perdue and Loeffler off message in the final days of the campaign.\\n\\nSenator Perdue and Senator Loeffler are being whipsawed by the President on one side and by the Democratic money on the other side, he said.\\n\\nPerdue and Loeffler had attempted to avoid the intraparty feud sparked by Trump by focusing on Ossoff and Warnock.\\n\\nPerdue's closing message in a recent video was littered with attacks, saying that if Republicans lose, undocumented immigrants will vote, Americans' private health insurance will be taken away, and Democrats will pack the Supreme Court and defund the police.\\n\\nWe win Georgia, we save America, Perdue told the camera.\\n\\nThe Democratic candidates counter that they would demilitarize rather than defund the police, create a legal pathway for undocumented immigrants and support a public option to decrease the number of uninsured. Neither Democratic candidate has advocated adding justices to the court.\\n\\nThey argued they would do a better job ending the health care crisis over the coronavirus, which has infected more than 20.8 million Americans and killed at least 354,000, in order to reopen the economy. They've pushed policy goals, including debt-free public college and a new Voting Rights Act. And they've attacked the Republican senators for their multi-million dollar stock transactions during the pandemic, alleging that they profited off it. The senators have denied any wrongdoing.\\n\\nWarnock told CNN Wednesday that he believes tackling the pandemic by effectively distributing the vaccine and passing $2,000 stimulus checks should be the new Senate's top priority.\\n\\nThe special election was particularly brutal, starting last year when GOP Rep. Doug Collins forced Loeffler, who Kemp appointed to the role in 2019, into a race to the right.\\n\\nAfter no candidate received 50% of the vote, the runoffs turned even more vicious, as Loeffler portrayed Warnock an anti-police Marxist who would destroy America in the Senate.\\n\\nWe have to have Georgians come out and vote because we know that Chuck Schumer's radical agents of change are Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff, said Loeffler on the campaign trail Monday. They would defund the police. They would lock down our economy. And we have to make sure that we hold the line right here in Georgia.\\n\\nWarnock has in turn promoted his background from the Savannah projects to the pulpit of Martin Luther King Jr.'s historic church, while firing back at Loeffler.\\n\\nKelly Loeffler spends tens of millions of dollars to scare you, said Warnock in an ad. She's trying to make you afraid of me because she's afraid of you. Afraid that you understand how she's used her position in the Senate to enrich herself and others like her. Afraid that you'll realize that we can do better.\\n\\nPerdue, a 71-year-old former Fortune 500 CEO, has dismissed Ossoff, a 33-year-old media executive, saying the Democrat does not know how to create a job. At their debate in the fall, Ossoff called the senator a crook who was fending off multiple federal investigations for insider trading while attacking the health of the people who he represents. Perdue snapped back that the Democrat had worked for the mouthpiece of terrorism and Communist China -- claims Ossoff called ridiculous.\\n\\nThe Georgia US Senate races have attracted enormous attention due to the stakes for the first years of the Biden administration and the state's shift from red to purple. Dr. Charles Bullock, a University of Georgia political science professor, told CNN that the Senate elections could be the first in which urban Georgia casts more votes than rural Georgia.\\n\\nWe've seen tremendous enthusiasm in the early voting numbers, both in person and by mail, and we know that while Democrats will have a lead when polls open ... Republicans are expected to have a strong Election Day, said Seth Bringman, a spokesman for Fair Fight Action, a voting rights organization founded by Abrams.\\n\\nPolitical groups spent about $520 million to advertise in the two runoff races, according to Kantar Media/CMAG, averaging more than $8 million per day. Republicans outspent Democrats by tens of millions of dollars.\\n\\nWith the Senate on the line, Trump rallied his supporters in northwest Georgia on Monday, while President-elect Joe Biden held an event in Atlanta.\\n\\nBiden said electing Ossoff and Warnock would end the gridlock in Washington and allow Congress to provide $2,000 stimulus checks to Americans. Trump urged the state to elect Perdue and Loeffler, and claimed that Biden would not take the White House.\\n\\nWe're going to fight like hell, said the President.\\n\\nThis story has been updated with additional developments Wednesday."}

The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own.\\n\\n(CNN) —\\n\\nLast September, when President Trump moved to phase out the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, Congress was given until March 5 to pass a permanent, legislative solution. This week, that deadline passed. Were it not for a federal judge's ruling that the program must at least temporarily continue, 800,000 DACA recipients would be at risk of deportation.\\n\\nPHOTO: Sheryl Lanzel Fernand Fernandez\\n\\nThough the termination of DACA has been delayed by the federal court, the legal stability of DACA status is not guaranteed. The ruling that is protecting DACA recipients could be overturned by an appeal process, just as the executive order that created the program was subsequently overturned with a change in presidential administration. In order to permanently secure the legal status of Dreamers, DACA or a similar act must be enacted as law.\\n\\nOur leaders in Congress have an excellent opportunity to pass a bipartisan solution that has the overwhelming support of the American public. In fact, a poll last September by ABC/Washington Post shows that 86% of Americans want Dreamers to stay. Instead of wrongfully conflating the fate of Dreamers with totally separate issues such as national security, our elected officials should be jumping at the chance to create substantive, meaningful change just before the 2018 midterm elections.\\n\\nDACA has long been framed as a humanitarian issue. The moral case is clear. The individuals who immigrated to the United States as children did not intentionally violate immigration law and should not be punished for the actions of their parents. They have grown up in American schools, pledged allegiance to the American flag and are contributing to the American workforce. The United States is the only home they know.\\n\\nAt the United States Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, we recognize that DACA is also an economic issue. The contributions of Dreamers to our economy cannot be overstated. They contribute over $40 billion each year to our gross domestic product (GDP), according to a report from the American Action Forum.\\n\\nDACA-eligible immigrants pay $2 billion each year in state and local taxes, according to a report from the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy. One study indicates that 97% of DACA recipients are in school or employed.\\n\\nAmerica depends on Dreamers, many of whom give back to their communities. Approximately 9,000 DACA recipients are serving as teachers. An additional 14,000 work in health care services. To threaten the legal status of DACA recipients is not only a disservice to the individuals contributing to our economy and society, but also to the greater United States.\\n\\nThe state of Arizona, for example, has approximately 27,000 DACA recipients. If Arizona's DACA recipients were forced to leave, the state's GDP would drop by $1.3 billion. If Texas's 124,300 DACA recipients were deported, Texas GDP would drop by nearly $6.3 billion. California – the state with the largest DACA population of 222,795 –would suffer a GDP loss of over $11 billion without its DACA recipients.\\n\\nA DACA solution is the path forward for a prosperous American future. While March 5 no longer marks the official end of DACA, it should remain a call to action for the White House and members of Congress. We ask that our leaders in government save the partisan fighting for actual partisan issues and take this opportunity to show the American people that our elected officials are willing to come together to craft legislation that supports the shared interests of all Americans.\\n\\nGet our free weekly newsletter Sign up for CNN Opinion's new newsletter.\\n\\nJoin us on Twitter and Facebook\\n\\nThis is a crucial moment for Washington – a chance to demonstrate to the American people that our government still works and that our leaders can still lead.\\n\\nBut, most importantly, this is a crucial moment for Dreamers, the bright, young individuals who do not wish to live in the shadows. Their futures rest in the hands of our elected officials, and we ask that they be granted the security to permanently live, work and learn in the United States – their only home."}

That's up 3.6% from last year.\\n\\nTicket sales account for a big chunk of those earnings, and another championship title will probably mean even stronger ticket sales for next season.\\n\\nMerchandise revenue will also get a big boost -- Alabama has a lucrative deal with Collegiate Licensing Company. It's netted $98 million in royalties since the company was founded in 1981 by Alabama's current athletic director, Bill Battle. Alabama was the company's first client and is its top seller, with licensing fees skyrocketing 250% since 2005. Battle no longer runs the company.\\n\\nRelated: Clemson is covered -- win or lose\\n\\nTicket prices for Monday night's game hit a record high. The average resale ticket price was $3,053 as of Saturday, according to TicketIQ. The cheapest ticket to get into the game on the Alabama side was $1,794. On Clemson's side, the cheapest tickets cost $2,600.\\n\\nWhile these prices won't affect 2016 profits, they'll translate into more money for the program going forward.\\n\\nAs a Division I school, Alabama also gets a cut of ESPN's 12-year deal for the rights to broadcast the playoffs, which is worth $7.3 billion.\\n\\nWith all the money Alabama makes, it can afford to pay its head football coach well. Nick Saban, the second-highest paid college coach in the country, made $6.9 million in 2016. Michigan's Jim Harbaugh made $9 million.\\n\\nIn addition to his CEO-like salary, Saban has postseason bonuses built into his contract, which he'll receive whether the team wins or loses. Other coaches and select staff members will also receive bonuses.\\n\\nRelated: Ticket prices for Alabama-Clemson championship game hit a record\\n\\nStaff bonuses are just part of the expenses of playing in a championship game. Clemson, which narrowly lost to Alabama in the 2016 title game, took out an insurance policy this year to help cover the cost of what it hoped would be a rematch.\\n\\nAlabama, which has won four national championships in the last seven years, didn't need insurance.\\n\\nIn the words of Battle, Alabama feels like self-insuring is a better bet.\\n\\nBattle said Alabama budgets for postseason expenses like bowl and championship games so spending on insurance doesn't make sense."}

He asked why she's opposed to a bill that would allow the Government Accountability Office, a unit of Congress, to audit the Fed, and, more controversially, review its decisions on interest rates.\\n\\nPosey said the bill, known as Audit the Fed, would provide more transparency for the central bank and its decisions. Fed leaders say it would ruin the central bank's credibility by eliminating its independence.\\n\\nIn January 2017 a version of the Audit the Fed bill was introduced in both chambers. It passed out of committees in both the House and the Senate, but neither version has received a full vote in either the House or the Senate. Few think it will pass the Senate.\\n\\nRelated: Fed Chief: Trump policies are a source of uncertainty\\n\\nFor the life of me, I can't understand what the Fed fears. Can you give me an example that would justify the lack of transparency? Posey asked at a hearing of the House Financial Services Committee.\\n\\nWe don't have a lack of transparency, Yellen quickly replied.\\n\\nYou do if you can't audit it -- that's a lack of transparency, Posey shot back.\\n\\nFed leaders do make their decisions behind closed doors. But the central bank is audited twice a year -- once by the government through the Fed's inspector general and once by a private auditor. Critics of the bill question the point of a third audit.\\n\\nRight now, GAO officials don't attend Fed meetings and are unable to second-guess its decisions. Yellen argues that the proposed law would give them that power.\\n\\nRelated: Fed raises rates in June\\n\\nPosey pressed on.\\n\\nWhat do you fear about the audit? Can you give me a real-time example? he said.\\n\\nYellen replied that central bank leaders need privacy to discuss monetary policy without being second-guessed in real time by officials representing lawmakers.\\n\\nPosey wasn't satisfied. Just give me an example -- give me an example -- of how transparency could hurt the Fed? Just give me one example, he asked, holding up his index finger.\\n\\nYellen started: Because what you're talking about with the GAO are policy reviews ...\\n\\nPosey cut her off. No, just give me an example.\\n\\nShe did: I would envision a situation where the GAO, at the request of members of Congress, might come in and say at our meeting a week ago ... they believe the decision we made was the wrong one at that particular meeting, and I would say that's an extreme interference into monetary policy.\\n\\nPosey replied: So you're telling me we shouldn't be transparent for the fear of being second-guessed or somebody criticizing you because they thought you were wrong?\\n\\nWhat we're talking about is political interference in decision-making by the [Fed's] committee, Yellen said.\\n\\nI don't see that, Posey said.\\n\\nI do, Yellen shot back.\\n\\nWell, give me an example, Posey asked again.\\n\\nI gave you an example, Yellen said, sharply.\\n\\nPosey ran out of time, and the hearing moved on.\\n\\nYellen's testimony before the House on Wednesday may have been her last. Her term ends in February, and it's unclear whether President Trump will reappoint her. House leaders repeatedly asked Yellen whether she wants to say on, and she declined to comment."}
{"original": "The U.S. tax code overhaul will result in a tax cut for nearly two-thirds of U.S. households in 2018, according to the Tax Policy Center.\\n\\nBut the average tax cut will vary by state depending on economic and demographic characteristics, and whether residents pay high state and local taxes, which are now capped as a deduction on one's federal return.\\n\\nThe map below indicates the average tax cut in each state as measured across all filers in that state – those getting a tax cut, those facing a tax increase and those who will see no change at all. Only a small minority of filers will owe more in federal taxes, ranging from a low of 2.8% of residents in West Virginia to a high of 10.2% in New Jersey.\\n\\nWhile a tax cut may represent a notable drop in average tax burden, it doesn't necessarily represent a big jump in one's after-tax income, which is a better measure of how a tax cut changes someone's economic situation. For example, Mississippi residents will see their average federal tax burden drop by $1,040, or 9.5% on average. But that only represents a jump of 1.8% in after-tax income."}

A radicalized band of loyalist lawmakers also tries to deny voters' verdict . The wannabe autocrat leans on a party subordinate to find enough votes to let him win. Propagandistic media organs spew misinformation to support the his lies. Meanwhile the real crisis — a once-in-a-century pandemic that kills 3,000 citizens each day — is ignored in a gross display of negligence.\\n\\nWere this anywhere else, the US State Department would issue a statement calling for the restoration of democratic principles and good governance. The President might make a disapproving comment in a press conference, and legislators might call for sanctions. But they can't, because the turmoil is here at home, wracking world's oldest democracy and undermining America's claim to be a moral example and advocate for free people worldwide.\\n\\nWhen Congress meets on Wednesday to certify the presidential election results, more than half of the elected Republicans in the House and a quarter of their number in the Senate are expected to support an effort to raise baseless claims of mass voter fraud. They won't stop President-elect Joe Biden from becoming President. But they will cement a false belief among millions of Trump voters that the election was stolen.\\n\\nBefore that, two Senate runoffs in Georgia Tuesday will decide whether Democrats can achieve a 50-50 split in the chamber. If so, Biden's party will have the advantage of Vice President-to-be Kamala Harris's tie-breaking vote. But a thin Republican majority would create huge friction on Biden's administration, complicating efforts to confirm cabinet nominees, secure a new stimulus plan and money to fix a botched vaccine rollout, and to advance big goals in climate policy, health care and rebuilding US infrastructure.\\n\\nRead More"}
