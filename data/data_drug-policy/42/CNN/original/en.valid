(cnn) —\n\ntwo house millennials on opposite sides of the political spectrum have proved it's possible to find common ground, at least when it comes to cannabis policy.\n\ndemocratic rep. alexandria ocasio-cortez of new york recently tapped dan riffle, a former federal policy director at the marijuana policy project, as a senior counsel and policy adviser. when she tweeted out a story about the hire from high times, she added, #legalizeit, and demand justice for communities ravaged by the war on drugs.\n\nrepublican rep. matt gaetz of florida retweeted her and added, you had me at hello.\n\nyou had me at hello. https://t.co/lqgynl6rhl — matt gaetz (@mattgaetz) january 10, 2019\n\nthat a self-described democratic socialist can share a drug policy stance with a man once called the trumpiest congressman in trump's washington by gq might have something to do with their ages. millennials are more supportive of legalizing marijuana than older generations, with 74% backing it in a 2018 pew poll. ocasio-cortez, 29, and gaetz, 36, are in line with their peers.\n\nand although democrats have led republicans when it comes to backing legalization, republican support has grown. in 2017 a gallup poll found a majority of republicans supported legalization for the first time. as of october 2018, 75% of democrats, 71% of independents and 53% of republicans supported legalization, per gallup.\n\ngaetz represents the shift in his party. in 2018, he and democratic rep. seth moulton of massachusetts teamed up on legislation that would require the veterans affairs department to survey veterans on marijuana use and protect the benefits of veterans who disclose their marijuana use to va doctors.\n\ngaetz also backed the medical cannabis research act, the first such legislation related to marijuana ever considered by a republican-led judiciary committee, his office said.\n\nthis drug should not be in the same category as heroin and lsd, and we do not need to continue with a policy that turns thousands of young people into felons every year, gaetz said in 2017. nor do we need to punish the millions of people who are sick and seeking medical help – from pain, from muscle wasting, from chemotherapy-induced nausea.\n\nformer house speaker john boehner also came out in support of weed. the ohio republican was opposed while he was the speaker, but last april he took a role on the board of advisers for acreage holdings, a cannabis company, and has spoken at cannabis investment events.\n\nthough republicans like gaetz might be rare in congress now, should his party continue to evolve on cannabis policy, issues like medical marijuana, the war on drugs and legalization could one day become more bipartisan.

rep. alexandria ocasio-cortez.\n\nin another new low for american politics, someone on twitter pounced on a video of her as student at boston university dancing on a rooftop. in a smoking gun of absolutely nothing, the anonymous poster suggested that the clip showed something untoward about one of america's newest members of congress. here is america's favorite commie know-it-all acting like the clueless nitwit she is, explained the person who posted the clip.\n\nthis followed a long line of attacks that the new york democrat has faced in the right-wing social media vortex since her surprise victory in the primary and her general election win. soon after her victory, republican ron desantis, the new governor of florida, dismissed her as this girl. fox news channel host sean hannity called her policy views downright scary. washington examiner writer eddie scarry tweeted out a screenshot of her walking down a hallway to say she was not wearing the clothes of a girl who struggles.\n\nrepublicans took solace when some democrats dismissed ocasio-cortez as a flash-in-the-pan who will not be a long-term force in party politics once her 15 minutes of fame is over.\n\nclaire mccaskill, the former missouri democratic senator, described her in a cnn interview as a shiny object for democrats. she took a shot at ocasio-cortez in her exit interview with the daily podcast, when she warned, i hope she listens to people who defeated republicans, because it's the people who defeated republicans, in this election, that we need to be emulating, not the people who defeated democrats in primaries.\n\nbut all of these attacks will likely backfire. they will only help to accelerate her rise to power, making her one of the most prominent voices on the national scene.\n\nperhaps one of the most pointed moments in the opening of congress occurred when the congresswoman stood up to vote for nancy pelosi as house speaker. since the november election there had been endless speculation about whether she and other incoming members would vote against the speaker. when republicans booed her, she turned to them with the cameras covering the action and mouthed: sorry. with republicans hoping that ocasio-cortez and other first-termers would cause problems for the incoming speaker, it turned out that the party is pretty united on one thing: the need to stop president trump's dangerous agenda and style of governance.\n\nby vilifying ocasio-cortez, the gop is helping to turn her into one of the political superstars of 2019. they are giving her more time in the spotlight and unifying democrats around someone who does come from a left-of-center perspective. extraordinarily savvy in her use of social media, ocasio-cortez is seizing the chance to make a name for herself as a democrat with a strongly progressive point of view who will not remain passive about the right-wing extremism that now shapes her opponents.\n\nironically, the ongoing attacks might overshadow real points of division that exist between her and pelosi, such as the pushback that the speaker has given on her approach to achieving a green new deal.\n\nocasio-cortez has a massive opportunity to emerge as one of the most important figures in the democratic party. when the congresswoman voted for pelosi she made an important statement. she intends to serve as a bridge between house speaker pelosi and the progressive wing of the democratic party despite their disagreements.. rather than being an obstructionist who will do anything to defend her particular views — the tea party model of legislating — ocasio-cortez wants to use her clout to ensure that her generation maintains a place at the table.\n\nof course, it's not inevitable that such an alliance will work.\n\nbut there is a precedent for this kind of intraparty bridge-building. during the 1950s, us sen. hubert humphrey – the minnesota democrat who was elected as a committed liberal in 1948 and a contrast to the anti-civil rights southern democrats – forged an important relationship with senator majority leader lyndon johnson, the texas democrat.\n\nthough johnson thought that humphrey and his cohort of young northern liberals were too extreme for the party and that they were forcing him to deal with divisive issues, the two ended up working closely together in the latter half of the 1950s.\n\njohnson depended on humphrey to serve as his point of communication with younger democrats who wanted the party to deal with issues like civil rights, health care and urban renewal. humphrey was willing to work with johnson — who many younger liberals didn't trust — because he made sure their concerns were being heard by the leadership. the relationship paved a path to the great democratic landslide of 1964, the passage of civil rights legislation and the great society social innovations.\n\nthough it is true that there are many democrats in middle america who would never support ocasio-cortez's basic agenda, republicans and moderate democrats should not underestimate what she brings to the table.\n\nbesides the important function she can serve for pelosi as a bridge to the left, her biography — her youth, her ethnicity, her economic background – embodies why democrats now represent the party of the future as republicans are doubling down on championing a narrowing portion of the population in white, rural america.\n\nget our free weekly newsletter sign up for cnn opinion's new newsletter.\n\njoin us on twitter and facebook\n\nher assertive and confrontational posture to the republicans, grounded in a sophisticated reliance on social media tools like instagram and twitter, offers a refreshing antidote to the previous generation of democrats who were terrified to take on their opponents for fear of looking too extreme. she has enabled her supporters to follow her activities almost every day, bringing congress fully into the age of instagram, according to jessica mendoza of the christian science monitor.\n\nat the same time, if there is anyone who can figure out how to negotiate the different factions within their party it is pelosi, who has repeatedly proven herself to be one of the most formidable legislative leaders in recent political history.\n\nrepublicans can attack ocasio-cortez all they want, dismissing her and mocking her as a lightweight, but they might very well be looking at a major power broker in the new era of capitol hill.
(cnn) as i wrote this, the us capitol building was being stormed by violent right-wing protestors trying to stop the peaceful transfer of power.\n\nthis was an attempted coup, encouraged by the president of the united states, in an attempt to derail today's congressional certification of the electoral vote that will lead to joe biden's inauguration in two weeks.\n\ndonald trump's legacy is american carnage. our country is far more divided and violent and deluded than before he entered office. his misrule has led to this moment, but it is not his responsibility alone. trump's fear-fueled lies and extremism and conspiracy theories have been indulged for too long by partisans. his rhetoric has directly led to death threats against election officials who have done their job honestly and independently. now we are all reaping what they've sown, as the president watches it all burn from within the white house. but then, there are some men who want to ruin if they cannot rule.\n\nmake no mistake: this is sedition. and it's coming at the hands of self-styled super-patriots who have been amped up by the president's lies about non-existent mass voter fraud to excuse losing a free and fair election by a large margin.\n\nthey are not conservatives -- they are radicals. because patriots don't break the windows of the us capitol building and storm inside when they lose an election. no hostile foreign power has done more damage to what president-elect joe biden called  the citadel of our democracy  since an invading british army burned down the capitol in the war of 1812 . but certainly, the enemies of democracy have taken great comfort from their actions today.\n\nwe are still in the fog of war. but some things are clear. the politicians and hyper-partisans who have coddled this president's autocratic impulses have enabled this assault to our democracy. the republican members of congress -- like senators ted cruz and josh hawley -- who have tried to benefit politically from contesting the election results without any concrete evidence of fraud are culpable in this violence because they have stoked its fears. so is trump's attorney, rudy giuliani, who demanded  trial by combat  to resolve the election dispute at a save america rally this morning, after his legal team lost some 60 cases in court because of an absence of evidence.\n\nthere is no reasoning with conspiracy theorists. there is no negotiating with extremists. the president's lies unleashed this mob. responsible republicans need to condemn it clearly -- or own it forever.\n\nit's stunning but not surprising to see some self-styled constitutional conservatives -- who warned about mob violence and demanded law and order when it came to black lives matter protests - immediately default to rationalizing this violence through a flurry of whataboutism . folks who proclaimed facts don't care about your feelings suddenly seem to care about understanding the feelings of people who commit political violence. that's usually a definition of terrorism -- but these attackers were not contained or confronted or even arrested in large numbers. if they'd been black or left wing or muslim the reaction and calls for violent retribution by the president and his allies would have been deafening.\n\nthe mask has come off. the calls for law and order were really about race. the calls for respecting our democratic traditions apparently apply only to elections that republicans win. the partisan divisions in our country are not about policy or even ideology anymore. it's now about whether you believe in facts and science and even democracy itself. this is what happens when hyper-partisans indulge extremism, lies and conspiracy theories for political expediency.\n\nwhile the capitol building has been ransacked, left undiscussed is the fact that we just marked the deadliest day of the covid-19 pandemic -- adding to the more than 350,000 americans who have died because of trump's denialism and misrule. this is also a mark of trump's american carnage. he is unable to discharge the duties of the presidency without always thinking about himself first. that's why he couldn't bring himself to clearly and immediately condemn this violence. no wonder there are renewed calls -- even from some conservatives like john podhoretz at commentary -- to impeach and remove president trump from office. there is certainly cause even if there is not time.\n\nget our free weekly newsletter sign up for cnn opinion's new newsletter. join us on twitter and facebook\n\nwhat's clear even in this fog of war is that donald trump will be remembered as the worst president in american history. character is indeed destiny: his years of divisive lies, corruption and incompetence have led to sedition and violence. it is an urgent reminder that hate can never be channeled into something constructive. golem always ultimately turns on its creator.

craziest, most controversial election in us history.\n\nwe say perhaps because we don't want to bog you down with superlatives when there have been so many truly zany moments in american elections.\n\nwho could forget howard dean screaming like he'd lost a limb, or rick perry forgetting one of the three federal agencies he'd cut if elected?\n\nthen there's the bevy of oh-so-colorful characters, from jello biafra, joan jett blakk and wavy gravy to lee mercer, jack shepard and lyndon larouche. did we mention deez nuts?\n\nto say an election was the craziest or most controversial simply isn't objective. sure, trump has claimed victory despite biden's projected win, questioned the voting system's integrity and suggested he might not step down, but is that more controversial than congress picking a president? that's happened a few times.\n\nwe'll let you decide. so, without any superlatives, here are 11 fascinating elections in american history:\n\n1800: prelude to a duel\n\nphoto: getty images vice president aaron burr killed alexander hamilton in a duel in 1804.\n\nthe outcome of the 1800 contest between thomas jefferson and john adams was so bizarre, the united states had to amend the constitution.\n\npre-12th amendment, electoral college members each had two votes for president, and there were no official tickets. whoever garnered the most votes was president, and second place took the vice presidency.\n\nthough problems with the system were apparent in 1796, the election of 1800 saw jefferson tie with his democratic-republican running mate aaron burr. both had 73 votes to adams'$2 65.\n\ncongress would be called upon to break the tie. enter alexander hamilton, the nation's first treasury secretary, founder of the federalist party and a man who did not care for adams, jefferson or burr.\n\nnonetheless, hamilton engaged in a campaign to convince the federalists to vote for jefferson, his lesser of three evils, writing in a letter that mr. burr loves nothing but himself – thinks of nothing but his own aggrandizement.\n\nthe house of representatives didn't easily arrive at its decision, casting 35 ballots in a week before finally voting to name jefferson the victor and burr the veep on february 7, 1801.\n\nmaking the election all the zanier, the rivalry between burr and hamilton would continue for more than three years before burr, still the sitting vice president, killed hamilton in a duel.\n\n1824: 'corrupt bargain'\n\nphoto: getty images andrew jackson called the 1824 election the corrupt bargain and promised to win in 1828.\n\nthis one was odd from the get-go, if only for the fact that the federalist party was on the cusp of extinction and all four candidates were democratic-republicans.\n\nandrew jackson, a war hero and statesman, won the popular vote by fewer than 39,000 ballots and took 99 electoral college votes. secretary of state john quincy adams secured 84, treasury secretary william crawford won 41 and house speaker henry clay had 37.\n\nwith no candidate earning a majority of the votes, the house again had to settle the deadlock, and jackson was confident he would win the presidency given that he had won the popular vote and electoral college. because the house could choose among only three candidates, clay got the boot.\n\nwe mentioned clay was speaker, yes?\n\nwell, after a month of horse trading, many of clay's supporters shifted their support to adams, who would go on to win the majority of the house vote. maryland, illinois and louisiana, which had cast most of their electoral college votes for jackson, as well as kentucky, where adams did not receive a single ballot in the popular vote, decided to back adams.\n\nafter his inauguration, adams selected clay as his secretary of state. jackson was furious and accused adams and clay of a corrupt bargain. he vacated his senate seat and vowed to win the 1828 election as a washington outsider.\n\nbacked by his new party, the democrats, jackson made good on the promise, besting adams, who by then was a leader in the national republican party.\n\n1860: nation divided\n\nphoto: n. spindler/library of congress a crowd gathers for the inauguration of abraham lincoln on march 4, 1861.\n\nthis election wasn't particularly close. abraham lincoln trounced john breckinridge in an election that had one of the highest voter turnouts of all time.\n\nno, the 1860 election was notable because it ripped the long-dominant democratic party – and thereby, the nation – in half.\n\nthe supreme court's dred scott decision of 1857, essentially legalizing slavery in all u.s. territories, had laid the battleground: the republican party largely opposed slavery but was reluctant to push for its prohibition in states that already had it, and the democrats were unable at their 1860 convention to establish an official party line on slavery.\n\nat a second convention that year, the democrats nominated sen. stephen douglas of illinois, but many southerners in the party defected and selected breckinridge, who was vice president, as their man. both would claim to be the official democratic candidate.\n\nthe constitutional union party, which had formed the year before and staged a campaign that basically ignored the issue of slavery, selected sen. john bell of tennessee.\n\nthe electoral college vote told the story. lincoln snared only 40% of the popular vote, but in the electoral college took most of the north, along with california and oregon. douglas came in second in the popular vote but took only missouri (and three votes in new jersey). breckinridge took most of the south, along with maryland and delaware, and bell's middle-of-the-road policies earned him the middle of the road: tennessee, kentucky and virginia.\n\nweeks after the election, south carolina voted to secede, followed by six more southern states. in february 1861, delegates from those states formed the confederate states of america and selected jefferson davis as their president.\n\nin april, a south carolina militia would take fort sumter, and four more states would join the confederacy.\n\n1872: death of a candidate\n\nphoto: mpi/getty images ulysses s. grant attended horace greeley's funeral after his rival died before the electoral college vote.\n\nset aside that 1872 was the year suffragette victoria woodhull of the people's party became the first woman to run for president. also, forget that writer and abolitionist frederick douglass, her running mate, was the first african-american to be considered for the vice presidency. and never mind this was the year susan b. anthony would be arrested for illegal voting.\n\nno, 1872 was strange because one of the primary candidates never saw the final electoral college vote.\n\nhorace greeley wasn't supposed to put up much of a fight in his bid to unseat president ulysses s. grant, but a schism in grant's republican party made things a little more interesting.\n\ngrant, who led the union armies that defeated the confederacy, had not been so convincing in the oval office. the white house website describes him as out of his element and quotes one visitor who spoke of his puzzled pathos, as of a man with a problem before him of which he does not understand the terms.\n\nsome republicans defected, becoming liberal republicans, and cast their lot with greeley, a democrat who would go on to snare 44% of the popular vote, almost 3 million ballots, despite ending his campaigning to tend to his sick wife, who died a week before the election.\n\nbefore the electoral college could cast its votes, the newspaper founder died november 29, 1872, and 63 of his 66 votes were dispersed among thomas hendricks, who would later become vice president, and other democrats.\n\ngrant attended his rival's funeral.\n\n1876: not-so-independent tiebreaker\n\nphoto: hulton archive/getty images rutherford b. hayes' election as president also marked the end of reconstruction in the south.\n\ndemocrat samuel tilden had beaten republican rutherford hayes. he snared a quarter-million more ballots in the popular vote, and he had 19 more votes in the electoral college.\n\nproblem was, tilden was one electoral college vote away from a majority of 185 votes, and four states composing a total of 20 votes – florida, louisiana, south carolina and oregon – were disputing the results. in the southern states, each party was accusing the other of fraud.\n\nwith no precedent to lean on, the two parties agreed to establish a 15-member commission made up of seven republicans, seven democrats and an independent.\n\nthe independent, supreme court justice david davis, however, was unexpectedly selected by the illinois legislature to serve in the u.s. senate. he was replaced by justice joseph bradley, a diehard republican who would cast every vote for hayes, providing him the 20 votes he needed for a majority.\n\ndemocrats initially threatened to block the decision, but in a backroom deal they agreed to drop their opposition if hayes, among other provisions, removed federal troops that had been in the south under reconstruction.\n\nhayes was sworn in march 5, 1877, and within weeks, he removed the troops. reconstruction formally came to an end, halting the progress african americans had made. it would be decades before civil rights would see serious discussion again in congress.\n\n1920: prison campaign\n\nphoto: getty images eugene debs ran for president five times, the final time from the most unlikely of headquarters.\n\nit was a battle between two newspaper publishers, but the election wasn't terribly exciting. republican warren g. harding handed democrat james cox a historic beatdown, taking more than 60% of the popular vote along with 37 of the 48 states.\n\nthird place is where it got interesting.\n\nlong before bernie sanders faced jabs for his liberal politics, the socialist party of america enjoyed a modicum of support at the outset of the 20th century. that union leader eugene debs ran for president in 1900, 1904, 1908 and 1912 is somewhat unremarkable, as is the fact he secured roughly 6% of the popular vote in 1912, more than 900,000 ballots.\n\nin 1920, though, debs had to run his fifth campaign from the most unlikely of headquarters: prison.\n\nno stranger to incarceration – he'd served time in connection with an 1894 railroad strike – debs again drew the government's ire in 1918 when he gave an anti-war speech in canton, ohio, in which he pilloried the ruling class who made all the decisions to send the working class to war.\n\nyours not to reason why. yours but to do and die, he said.\n\nhe was convicted under an espionage law and sentenced to 10 years in prison. demonstrations protesting his imprisonment evolved into the may day riots of 1919, and debs was later moved to the atlanta federal penitentiary, from where he conducted his presidential campaign.\n\nhe would again secure more than 900,000 votes – an impressive tally, but not nearly enough to compete with harding, who snared more than 16 million.\n\nthe following year, on christmas, harding commuted debs' sentence to time served.\n\n1948: ultimate 'whoops' moment\n\nphoto: underwood archives/getty images harry truman holds up the chicago daily tribune with a headline of his defeat to thomas dewey in 1948.\n\npresident harry s. truman was done before the election began. you could stick a fork in him, to hear the pundits tell it. the election was new york gov. thomas dewey's. period.\n\nthe 1946 midterms had handed both houses to republicans for the first time in almost 20 years, and opinion polls showed that just one in three americans approved of truman's handling of the presidency.\n\nmaking matters worse, truman's commerce secretary, henry wallace, had revolted over the administration's foreign policy toward the soviet union and declared his intention to run as a third-party candidate.\n\nsouthern democrats also jumped ship over his stance on civil rights, forming the states' rights party – aka the dixiecrats – and electing segregationist south carolina gov. strom thurmond as their candidate.\n\nthe final pre-election gallup poll – interestingly, taken in mid-october and not released until the day before election day – showed dewey beating truman by 5 percentage points.\n\neven on election day, truman recalled an nbc report predicting he would lose. it wasn't until 4 a.m. that his secret service agents woke him to say he had won.\n\nthe chicago daily tribune had referred to truman as a nincompoop on its editorial page in the run-up to the election. poetically, a printers' strike forced the newspaper to publish its morning edition hours earlier than usual, and publisher j. loy maloney took the pollsters' word and signed off on one of the most famous headlines in history.\n\ndewey defeats truman.\n\n1960: dawn of televised debates\n\nphoto: getty images candidates john f. kennedy, left, and richard nixon exchange smiles ahead of their first tv debate.\n\njohn f. kennedy set a lot of precedents when he was elected in 1960. he was the youngest president elected to office, the first at the time to be born in the 20th century. he was also the first catholic president.\n\nthe contest between kennedy and richard nixon, pitting a relatively unknown senator against a two-term sitting vice president, marked another precedent: the first time that presidential debates would be pumped into american living rooms.\n\nthis was important to the vote's outcome because televisions were increasingly part of the american household. eighty-eight percent of homes had them, compared with 11% in 1950.\n\nnixon had recently been hospitalized. he refused to wear makeup, which served to highlight his thin, sickly appearance. he had a 5 o'clock shadow. he wore a gray suit that blended into the background. his appearance left much to be desired, historians would note.\n\nkennedy, on the other hand, was tanned and wore a blue suit and shirt, so he stood out against the studio backdrop. unlike nixon, he spoke to the cameras rather than to his opponent.\n\nthe estimated 70 million people who watched the first of four televised debates, on september 26, 1960, felt kennedy won, whereas the much smaller audience listening on the radio felt nixon was the victor.\n\non november 8, kennedy edged out nixon by 119,000 votes (out of a total of almost 69 million).\n\nthough it's arguable that the debate alone won kennedy the election (he also secured the african-american vote by offering his assistance in getting the rev. martin luther jr. out of prison just weeks before the election), politicians and historians concur this changed the face of campaigns.\n\ntelevised debates made image and appearance primary considerations, and it raised such an unsettling specter for some candidates that it would be 16 years before another presidential hopeful agreed to a televised debate.\n\n1964: mandate on race\n\nphoto: national archives/newsmakers lyndon b. johnson prevailed in the 1964 presidential election, a contest dominated by race\n\nthis is the election that brought us the daisy ad – an attempt to paint republican barry goldwater as too reckless to be put in charge of the country's nuclear arsenal. the ad remains haunting even amid today's supercharged mudslinging.\n\nthe summer of 1964 brought the civil rights act. angry whites protested the legislation across the south, while blacks enraged by police treatment erupted into demonstrations in new york, philadelphia, chicago and other cities.\n\nthe stage was set for extremes, but the election would not hinge on whether goldwater or president lyndon johnson was a more capable commander in chief. race would not only shape 1964's ballot, but it would affect elections for decades to come.\n\nalabama's fiery segregationist gov. george wallace took on johnson for the democratic nomination, and despite the sentiment that white backlash against the civil rights act was a southern thing, wallace received more than 30% of the vote in wisconsin and indiana and more than 40% in maryland in the primaries.\n\nwallace would eventually drop out of the race, but not before causing both goldwater and johnson substantial concerns. goldwater feared wallace would run on a third-party ticket, sinking his campaign, and johnson worried about wallace's strong showing in non-southern states.\n\nwhile goldwater, who had cast his vote against the civil rights act, was painted as a racist, something he had always denied, johnson tried to please everyone.\n\nthat was most evident when the mississippi freedom democratic party, black activists organized by the student nonviolent coordinating committee, showed up at the national convention demanding to be seated because mississippi had run a segregated primary.\n\njohnson would have to broker a deal in which the segregationists were seated at the convention, along with two members of the mississippi freedom democratic party. he would later anger many in the south by selecting hubert humphrey, a staunch civil rights advocate, as his running mate.\n\njohnson would go on to win one of the most lopsided elections ever. goldwater won only his home state of arizona and alabama, georgia, louisiana, mississippi and south carolina. republicans still enjoy a great deal of political dominance in the south to this day.\n\n1972: death (of a campaign) by electroshock therapy\n\nphoto: photo by anthony korody/getty images sen. george mcgovern, right, and running mate sen. thomas eagleton during the 1972 campaign.\n\nit happened in a hasty two-minute phone call.\n\nsen. george mcgovern of south dakota had just won the democratic nomination for president and phoned sen. thomas eagleton to ask him to be his running mate. several high-profile democrats had declined to join mcgovern on the ticket, so he picked eagleton, in part, because he hoped he would help him shore up the catholic vote.\n\nto say eagleton didn't undergo the intense vetting of, say, sarah palin or paul ryan would be an understatement.\n\nhad mcgovern grilled eagleton according to today's standards, he might've learned eagleton's secret: that the senator from missouri had been hospitalized three times for depression and had undergone electroshock therapy on two of those occasions.\n\nwhen rumors first began to surface, mcgovern stood by his running mate but eventually decided that eagleton posed a liability.\n\nduring a news conference at a south dakota state park, where mcgovern was supposed to be relaxing, not campaigning, eagleton revealed his medical history to reporters and explained that he had only recently divulged the matter to mcgovern.\n\non august 1 – 18 days after he was selected – eagleton officially dropped out of the campaign.\n\nrichard nixon would go on to obliterate mcgovern, carrying 49 states and outpacing the democrat by about 18 million votes – thereby striking fear into would-be presidents for decades about who they choose to join them on the ticket.

(cnn) —\n\nlike most successful candidates, president donald trump's rhetoric from the campaign trail now runs up awkwardly against the often dense and arcane language that fills more formal executive actions and memos.\n\nthe impenetrable, physical, tall, powerful, beautiful southern border wall he pledged to build on the mexican border has been reduced, on white house stationery, to a physical wall on the southern border. trump has kicked off his administration with a slew of aggressive actions, but it might be hard to tell from the reading.\n\nhere are a few examples of campaign technicolor translated into the black and white of legalistic, government documentation:\n\n1. in february 2016, trump made this promise to a voter in new hampshire.\n\nobamacare is a disaster and we're going to repeal it and we're going to replace it with something great.\n\nas the administration and congressional republicans now grapple with doing just that, trump on his first day in office issued an executive order directing federal agencies to back off enforcing the law's mandate. here's what it said:\n\nsec. 2. to the maximum extent permitted by law, the secretary of health and human services (secretary) and the heads of all other executive departments and agencies (agencies) with authorities and responsibilities under the act shall exercise all authority and discretion available to them to waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay the implementation of any provision or requirement of the act that would impose a fiscal burden on any state or a cost, fee, tax, penalty, or regulatory burden on individuals, families, healthcare providers, health insurers, patients, recipients of healthcare services, purchasers of health insurance, or makers of medical devices, products, or medications.\n\n2. the construction of a wall – not a fence – on the us-mexico border was a cornerstone of the trump presidential bid. appealing to voters, he led chants of build the wall and described the coming barrier like this during first rally:\n\ni will build a great wall – and nobody builds walls better than me, believe me – and i'll build them very inexpensively. i will build a great, great wall on our southern border, and i will make mexico pay for that wall. mark my words.\n\nin the executive order trump signed on wednesday, he delivered the following, rather soberer instructions to the secretary of the department of homeland security:\n\n(a) in accordance with existing law, including the secure fence act and iirira, take all appropriate steps to immediately plan, design, and construct a physical wall along the southern border, using appropriate materials and technology to most effectively achieve complete operational control of the southern border;\n\n(b) identify and, to the extent permitted by law, allocate all sources of federal funds for the planning, designing, and constructing of a physical wall along the southern border;\n\n(c) project and develop long-term funding requirements for the wall, including preparing congressional budget requests for the current and upcoming fiscal years; and\n\n(d) produce a comprehensive study of the security of the southern border, to be completed within 180 days of this order, that shall include the current state of southern border security, all geophysical and topographical aspects of the southern border, the availability of federal and state resources necessary to achieve complete operational control of the southern border, and a strategy to obtain and maintain complete operational control of the southern border.\n\n3. trump has also issued an executive order aimed at sanctuary cities. back in september 2015, he told a rally in dallas: we have to end this sanctuary cities crap. later in the campaign, he made this declaration:\n\nblock funding for sanctuary cities. we block the funding. no more funds. we will end the sanctuary cities that have resulted in so many needless deaths. cities that refuse to cooperate with federal authorities will not receive taxpayer dollars, and we will work with congress to pass legislation to protect those jurisdictions that do assist federal authorities.\n\nand this is what it looked like on paper this week:\n\nsec. 2. policy. it is the policy of the executive branch to:\n\n(a) ensure the faithful execution of the immigration laws of the united states, including the ina, against all removable aliens, consistent with article ii, section 3 of the united states constitution and section 3331 of title 5, united states code;\n\n(b) make use of all available systems and resources to ensure the efficient and faithful execution of the immigration laws of the united states;\n\n(c) ensure that jurisdictions that fail to comply with applicable federal law do not receive federal funds, except as mandated by law;\n\n(d) ensure that aliens ordered removed from the united states are promptly removed; and\n\n(e) support victims, and the families of victims, of crimes committed by removable aliens.\n\nhere's how his opposition to the deal sounded on the stump, at a rally in st. clairsville, ohio, in june 2016:\n\nthe trans-pacific partnership is another disaster done and pushed by special interests who want to rape our country – just a continuing rape of our country.\n\nand this is what the formal departure looked like in a presidential memorandum from january 23. this, after a preamble on the importance of trade and american jobs:\n\nbased on these principles, and by the authority vested in me as president by the constitution and the laws of the united states of america, i hereby direct you to withdraw the united states as a signatory to the trans-pacific partnership (tpp), to permanently withdraw the united states from tpp negotiations, and to begin pursuing, wherever possible, bilateral trade negotiations to promote american industry, protect american workers, and raise american wages.\n\n5. the keystone xl pipeline, which would deliver more than 800,000 barrels of petroleum daily from the canadian oil sands to refineries on the us gulf coast, was blocked by the obama administration in 2015. trump did not agree with that decision and made it a bone of contention during the campaign. here's what he said last january in iowa:\n\nwhen they do the keystone pipeline – i want it approved, i want all those jobs – i like a lot of oil flow, because right now we're low.\n\nand here's what the announcement that trump would re-open the process looked like in a presidential memo issued this week:
(cnn) lebron james and the nba community have expressed their disappointment after prosecutors decided not to charge any police officer in connection with the shooting of jacob blake.\n\njames, who has consistently used his platform to call for the end of police brutality, said the prosecutor's decision was a blow to the heart and to the gut.\n\nnot only to that community, but to us and to every black person that has been a part of this process and seeing these outcomes for so long, he told reporters after the la lakers' win over the memphis grizzlies in tennessee on tuesday.\n\nkenosha county district attorney michael graveley announced tuesday that no kenosha law enforcement officer in this case will be charged with any criminal offense based on the facts and laws.\n\nrusten sheskey, a white officer, shot blake, a 29-year-old black man, seven times in the back while responding to a domestic incident on august 23, 2020. blake survived the shooting but was left paralyzed from the waist down.\n\nread more

the one who said i should be euthanized. all the other accounts, twitter told me, didn't violate the twitter rules.\n\ni'm an accomplished freelance writer and blogger. but online, and especially on twitter, i'm reduced to an object – literally, a thing to be mocked, ridiculed and shamed. my physical appearance is what those twitter trolls pounce on. immediately.\n\nmaybe they can sense that i've struggled with self-confidence surrounding my disability in the past? maybe they figure it took me a while to come to terms with my disability (spoiler alert: it did)? maybe they just know where to hit me to make it hurt just a little bit more? or maybe they're just sad, pathetic people unhappy with themselves and their own life?\n\ni've asked myself these questions a lot, and, honestly, i'm not sure of the answers. but here's what i do know: all too often, people with disabilities are overlooked when it comes to these kinds of conversations about hate speech online.\n\nwhen we think of hate speech and what sorts of things constitute hate speech, we automatically think of racism and lgbtq issues. what we don't automatically think of are things like ableism and discrimination against people with disabilities, which are rampant in society, to be sure, but sometimes get overlooked. consider the flippant use of the r word – and even a seemingly less offensive word like cripple. even disney villains usually have some sort of facial deformity, which sends the message to children from a young age that disabilities are bad and that people with disabilities are evil or monstrous.\n\nthankfully, though, society's views about people with disabilities are changing, as evidenced not only by twitter's change in policy, but also by apple's plans to add 13 new disability-related emojis to its lineup. everything from a cane to a hearing aid to a person zooming along in a wheelchair is just a starting point, apple hinted recently, saying, currently, emoji provide a wide range of options, but may not represent the experiences of those with disabilities.\n\nget our free weekly newsletter sign up for cnn opinion's new newsletter.\n\njoin us on twitter and facebook\n\ndisabilities may make people uncomfortable. i'm sure my disability and my wheelchair has made people uncomfortable in the past. but that doesn't give people the right to use it against me and vilify me for it. twitter's change in policy gives me hope. hope that perhaps, finally, we've moved the needle of dismantling centuries of negative misconceptions surrounding people with disabilities. we're not monsters. we're people. and we're not going anywhere – on twitter and in real life.

(photo by joe raedle/getty images)\n\n(cnn) —\n\npresident donald trump walked out of discussions to end a partial government shutdown, now in its third week, calling the talks with congressional democrats a total waste of time.\n\njust left a meeting with chuck and nancy, a total waste of time. i asked what is going to happen in 30 days if i quickly open things up, are you going to approve border security which includes a wall or steel barrier? nancy said, no. i said bye-bye, nothing else works! trump said.\n\ntop congressional democrats blasted trump after the meeting wednesday afternoon, accusing him of indifference to struggling federal workers and not trying to negotiate as the government shutdown drags on.\n\nunfortunately, the president just got up and walked out, said senate minority leader chuck schumer of new york. he asked speaker (nancy) pelosi, 'will you agree to my wall?' she said no. and he just got up and said, 'then we have nothing to discuss,' and he just walked out. again, we saw a temper tantrum because he couldn't get his way, and he just walked out of the meeting.\n\nmeeting sours after candy\n\ntrump was in a chummy mood when he entered the situation room, according to a source familiar with how things unfolded. the president passed out candy to attendees – butterfinger and baby ruth bars as well as m&m's.\n\ntrump told congressional leaders they would find a letter at each of their chairs – a copy of the budget request the office of management and budget had put together for congressional staff in sunday's meeting that laid out the administration's shutdown priorities.\n\nthen, with the letters stating their position in front of them, white house officials asked democrats where their position stood.\n\npelosi informed the president she was concerned about ports of entry, something which he agreed with. trump said there was money allotted in the administration's priority list that beefed up the ports of entry. but homeland security secretary kirstjen nielsen, also seated at the table, interjected to say that even if the ports of entry eliminated all drug smuggling, smugglers would find another way in, which is why the barrier structure is important, sparking the most heated exchange of the meeting between pelosi and trump.\n\nschumer jumped in to stress the importance of opening up the government and then negotiating on border security funding from there.\n\nhe at one point asked trump, why won't you open the government and stop hurting people?\n\ntrump responded bluntly, because then you won't give me what i want.\n\na white house official disputes that the president replied with those words. the official claims that trump answered, i gotta get you to do the right thing.\n\ntrump then asked democrats whether, if he opened up the parts of the government that are shut down, pelosi would be willing to build a barrier. she declined.\n\na source familiar with what happened inside the room said trump ended the meeting by standing up and announcing bye-bye before turning and walking out.\n\nafter trump left the room, pelosi and schumer got up to leave. vice president mike pence then asked for a counteroffer from democrats – asking what they are willing to work on, so the white house would have a better idea to move forward. they didn't offer one, something that has frustrated white house officials since they first privately offered less than $5.6 billion the day after the government shut down.\n\nimmigration proposal considered\n\nstaring at a prolonged shutdown, republican senators are privately planning to court democratic senators on an immigration deal that would give trump money for his border wall and include several measures long-sought by democrats, according to sources familiar with the matter.\n\nfollowing trump's meeting, gop senators privately gathered in sen. lindsey graham's office wednesday to discuss a way out of the logjam. the long-shot idea: propose an immigration deal that would include money for the wall along with several provisions that could entice democrats. those items include changes to help those who are a part of the deferred action childhood arrival program as well as immigrants from el salvador and other countries impacted by the temporary protected status program – as well as modifications to h2b visas.\n\ngop senators pitched the idea to senior white house adviser jared kushner, who said if they came up with a proposal that got trump his border wall money and could pass the senate, the white house would be open to more discussions on the matter, the source said. he did not say trump would endorse such a plan.\n\nthe gop senators – who include graham of south carolina, susan collins of maine, thom tillis of north carolina, lamar alexander of tennessee, rob portman of ohio and lisa murkowksi of alaska – discussed the plan in a hastily arranged meeting wednesday, with several of them now planning to propose the idea to democrats to see if there's a enough support to break the logjam.\n\nbreakdown in talks leads to fiery rhetoric\n\na white house official says no other meeting with pelosi has been scheduled at this time, and a national emergency declaration is still on the table.\n\nthe meeting at the white house came just hours before the house of representatives was expected to vote on individual bills to help reopen the government. the bills aren't expected to go anywhere in the gop-controlled senate at this time but the maneuver is aimed at putting pressure on republicans. trump promised earlier wednesday to veto that legislation if it reached his desk.\n\npelosi, speaking alongside schumer outside the white house, said trump was insensitive to federal workers missing pay during the shutdown and alluded to trump's own privileged upbringing.\n\nhe thinks maybe they could just ask their father for money, but they can't, the california democrat said.\n\nshe added, if you don't understand financial insecurity then you would have a policy that takes pride in saying, 'i'm going to keep government shut down for months or years unless you totally agree to my position.' \n\nsen. dick durbin of illinois, the senate's number two democrat, said after the meeting that it was pretty clear trump's heart was not in it.\n\nhe said today, in the middle of this meeting, 'i don't know why i'm doing this. i didn't want to do this meeting. they told me i had to do this meeting,'  durbin said.\n\ntop republicans spoke to the media after the democratic statements and took issue with their characterization of the meeting, though they did not dispute that trump left the meeting. among them were pence, house minority leader kevin mccarthy of california, house minority whip steve scalise of louisiana and sen. john thune of south dakota.\n\nnotably, senate majority leader mitch mcconnell, a kentucky republican, did not appear alongside them.\n\npence said trump told the democrats goodbye after pelosi denied his request for a wall, and the vice president contended the move made clear that trump would not end the shutdown without his border measures.\n\nwhat the president made clear today is he is going to stand firm to achieve his priorities to build a wall, a steel barrier on the southern border, add additional personnel, additional resources, additional reforms to stem the crisis that we face on our southern border, pence said.\n\nmccarthy said trump had gone back and forth with pelosi and schumer, and then eventually asked pelosi,  'ok, nancy, if we open the government up in 30 days, could we have border security?' \n\nshe raised her hand and said, 'no, not at all,'  mccarthy recalled. the president calmly said, 'i guess you're still not wanting to deal with the problem.' \n\nwednesday's meeting came a day after trump delivered an oval office address standing by his demand for congress to fund his border wall with mexico and democrats continued to refuse the request. with no apparent end in sight to the disagreement, the shutdown was due to enter its 20th day.\n\nthis story has been updated with additional developments wednesday.\n\ncnn's lauren fox contributed to this report.
women in traditional korean dress head to the dance. though much of north korea is without electricity, the portraits of the supreme leaders are illuminated brightly.\n\nthis may look like an ordinary scene in any country, huniewicz explains, but in north korea, he feels it challenges a local song about no mother's love being greater than that of the communist party.\n\nthese settlements, captured from a speeding van, appear to be slums outside of pyongyang, according to huniewicz. he speculates that the tourist transport vans slow down when passing what the authorities are proud of showing and speed past less desirable sights.\n\na woman sells postcards, stamps and posters, many featuring themes focused on defeating the u.s. and destroying the white house. huniewicz says he did send one such postcard from north korea to the u.s. and it arrived with no problems.\n\nwho's american here? the museum guide asks. grab the flowers, go to the monument, bow, and lay the flowers there. huniewicz says north koreans told him they single-handedly defeated the u.s. in the korean war.\n\nnorth koreans head down to the pyongyang metro. it's 100 meters underground thus riding the escalator down to the station takes a couple of minutes.\n\nhuniewicz says this is just one of two photos in which he was able to capture a candid smile from local residents.\n\nlondon-based amateur photographer michal huniewicz recently visited north korea as a tourist. he snapped dozens of images during his trip -- some permitted, others not. huniewicz took this photo from the window of a train as he pulled into pyongyang from dandong. it looked like something you would see in a theater, he says. it's a bit too perfect.\n\nstory highlights a north korean senior intelligence officer has become the highest-ranking military official to defect to south korea terence roehrig: north korea seems determined to grow its missile capabilities\n\n(cnn) —\n\neditor's note: terence roehrig is professor of national security affairs and director of the asia-pacific studies group at the u.s. naval war college. these views expressed here are the author's alone and do not represent the official position of the navy, the u.s. department of defense, or the u.s. government.\n\na report tuesday that north korea could be preparing to launch a ballistic missile with the potential to hit parts of the united states is just the latest reminder of the continuing tensions on the korean peninsula. the news comes amid a flurry of north korean launches and threats in recent weeks, and amid rumors that pyongyang might be preparing for another nuclear test.\n\nhow seriously should such threats be taken? in many respects, much of this is not a surprise; north korea seems determined to grow its missile capabilities. the difficulty, of course, has always been separating rhetoric and reality with a nation from which it is notoriously difficult to secure concrete information.\n\nterence roehrig\n\nbut a series of defections – including one by what is believed to be the highest ranking military officer so far – could offer some useful insights into what is going on there.\n\nover the past few days, the south korean government has taken the highly unusual action of announcing the arrival of a number of high-profile north korean defectors to the south. the defectors include a group of 13 workers from a north korea-owned restaurant in china.\n\nthe north korean government operates more than 130 restaurants in a dozen countries to earn hard currency that is sent back to pyongyang. in addition, government officials also confirmed the defections of two north korea diplomats. one reportedly worked on economic matters in the embassy of an african country and defected in may 2015 with his family, while another diplomat was reported to have defected from an asian nation in february.\n\nmost interesting, though, was the revelation on monday that a high-level military officer who held the rank of colonel defected in 2015. the south korea defense ministry offered few details, but confirmed that he was from the reconnaissance general bureau, or rgb, which was created in 2009 with the merger of several military and party organizations.\n\nthe organization reports directly to north korean leader kim jong un and is responsible for intelligence gathering and espionage, along with the recent addition of cyberoperations under bureau 121. bureau 121 has itself been responsible for hack attacks on several south korean media outlets, government institutions and banks, and is believed by u.s. officials to have been behind the 2014 attack on sony pictures.\n\nsecurity issues\n\nmedia reports indicate the officer may have been in charge of espionage operations in south korea, and he is believed to be the highest-ranking military leader to have ever defected to the south. with all this in mind, it is clear why he could prove to be valuable.\n\nit is difficult to obtain reliable insights information into the inner workings of the north korean government given the opaque nature of the regime. access to a high-level military official familiar with the north korean system and leadership will therefore be an important asset on military and intelligence matters. in short, the defection of such a high-level member of the regime is both a serious security breach and an embarrassment for pyongyang.\n\nbut the announcement of the colonel's defection is part of a larger story. the public acknowledgment of defections is unusual, and government policy has typically been to keep these events quiet so as not to endanger remaining family members in the north (or other defectors that might be en route or considering such a move).\n\nthe south korean government has made the case that these defections are a sign that the economic sanctions imposed in the wake of north korean weapons testing are working, and that people are voting with their feet. conservative media sources, meanwhile, are also making the argument these defections are a sign of serious elite discontent that may lead to instability in north korea.\n\nmore: north korea sentences u.s. student to 15 years hard labor\n\ninstability on the horizon?\n\ncritics say the revelations are political and intended to influence the upcoming national assembly elections by highlighting security issues. they argue that by highlighting the supposed success of recent sanctions, the government is hoping to energize conservative support for the ruling saenuri party.\n\nadding an additional layer of intrigue is a report by the progressive hankyoreh newspaper, which reported that the unification ministry did not want to release information on the defectors, but was forced to do so by the park geun-hye administration. the government has for its part denied there were political motives in announcing the defections, maintaining the high-level nature of these examples and their links to u.n. sanctions and elite discontent were important to reveal.\n\nstill, whatever the truth behind the debate over the release of information, the escape of such a prominent military and intelligence official is important. the colonel will not only be able to furnish valuable information on military operations and tactics, but may also provide better clarity into the strategic thinking of north korea's leadership. moreover, these defections might start to reveal more about elite behavior in north korea. could such defections, for example, be early indicators of political instability?\n\nthe north korean regime will undoubtedly remain a serious security and intelligence challenge for the u.s. and regional allies like south korea, and the information provided by defectors of all levels cannot be taken at face value – it must be examined carefully. but the type of information that could potentially be gleaned from the sources revealed this past week may be one of the few windows we have to improving our understanding of one of the most isolated nations in the world.\n\njoin us on facebook.com/cnnopinion.\n\nread cnnopinion's flipboard magazine.
(cnn) the us set a grim milestone monday as the country recorded over 200,000 new covid-19 cases for seven straight days, according to john hopkins university.\n\nthe nation has never hit this milestone before, jhu data shows. over the last week, the us has tallied over 1.7 million total covid-19 cases and over 20,000 deaths.\n\non top of that, covid-19 hospitalizations have surpassed 100,000 for the last 40 straight days and officials are trying to ramp up the pace of vaccinations across the country.\n\nwe really need to get this vaccine out more quickly, because this is really our only tool, dr. scott gottlieb, former commissioner of the us food and drug administration, said on cbs' face the nation.\n\nexperts have long said the best combined defense against surging cases includes preventative measures such as masks and social distancing -- as well as widespread vaccination.\n\nnearly 9 million people have received their first doses of vaccine against coronavirus in the us and nearly 25.5 million doses of vaccine have been distributed, the centers for disease control and prevention said.\n\nwe don't have a public health infrastructure for mass vaccination, said dr. paul offit, a member of the fda's vaccines and related biological products advisory committee.\n\nmany states are diverging from vaccine prioritization guidelines set by the cdc, according to a report issued monday by the non-profit kaiser family foundation, which studies health care policy.\n\non some level it's understandable and on some level, the more people that are getting vaccine, especially two doses of vaccine -- that's more people who then aren't going to transmit this virus, and we get a greater and greater level of herd immunity, offit said.\n\nas of monday morning, 35.3% of doses distributed had been administered, compared with 30.2% on friday.\n\nhealth officials had hoped to get 20 million people vaccinated by the start of the new year, but the administration of vaccines has met with delays and roadblocks.\n\nwe need to acknowledge that it's not working, gottlieb said sunday of the vaccination plan. we need to hit the reset and adopt a new strategy in trying to get that out to patients.\n\nmore people, sites and online resources for vaccines\n\nas the surge ratchets up infection, hospitalization and fatality numbers across the country, officials are working to make it easier to access vaccinations.\n\ncalifornia gov. gavin newsom promised monday to have one million state health care workers, nursing home residents and staff vaccinated by week's end. this all hands on deck push to get the vaccine to more vulnerable residents comes as the state continues to see an unrelenting surge of coronavirus hospitalizations and deaths.\n\nas of monday, the state has received more than 2.9 million vaccine doses, but administered about 783,000 of them, amounting to just 27% given.\n\nthe announcement came the same day california surpassed 30,000 covid-19 deaths since the start of the pandemic, according to johns hopkins university data. california is one of only three states to reach the milestone.\n\nin order to loosen the backlog, california plans to use dodger stadium in los angeles, padres stadium in san diego and calexpo in sacramento as mass vaccination sites, and newsom said more large-scale sites will be announced in the coming days.\n\nin new york, more vaccination sites have opened, including more 24/7 sites in new york city. mayor bill de blasio said that he's confident the city will reach its goal of administering 1 million doses by the end of january.\n\non monday, new york state expanded the people eligible for the vaccine to include those 75 and older, first responders, teachers and school workers, public-facing grocery store workers, transit workers and people living and working in homeless shelters.\n\nnew jersey will have a network of about 300 vaccination sites across the state to assist with its covid-19 vaccination plan, state officials said at a news conference.\n\nour objective and aspiration is 70% of the adult population in the state within six months, that's 4.7 million new jerseyans, said gov. phil murphy, speaking at rowan college at gloucester county, one of six mega-site vaccination locations.\n\nthe georgia department of public health launched a covid vaccine locator website in hopes of increasing access in the state that has administered the fewest vaccines per capita, according to the cdc covid data tracker.\n\nthe website will not allow for scheduling but will provide contact information for people to schedule vaccinations once available, according to a news release.\n\nthe cdc updated its guidance monday, saying there's no maximum time between a first and second coronavirus shot.\n\nyou should get your second shot: for the pfizer-biontech 3 weeks (or 21 days) after your first shot; for the moderna 1 month (or 28 days) after your first shot, the cdc said.\n\nyou should get your second shot as close to the recommended 3-week or 1-month interval as possible. however, there is no maximum interval between the first and second doses for either vaccine. you should not get the second dose earlier than the recommended interval. \n\nthe world health organization said last week that people can wait for as long as six weeks between doses. however, pfizer and moderna say they don't have any data on how long people can wait between doses and still get good protection.\n\na deadlier pace than 2020\n\nmore than 28,400 new covid-19 deaths have been reported in just the first 11 days of 2021, according to data from johns hopkins.\n\nat this rate, more people could die from covid-19 in january than in any other month of this pandemic. december had a record high of 77,431 deaths due to covid-19.\n\nin hard-hit arizona, the crisis will get worse, said joe k. gerald, associate professor at the university of arizona's zuckerman college of public health.\n\nwe should expect to set new records for cases, hospitalizations, and deaths over the coming weeks. policy action is urgently needed to mitigate the worst possible outcome, gerald wrote.\n\nhe also expressed concern about the inevitable arrival of the more highly transmissible strain of coronavirus that was first detected in the united kingdom and has spread to at least 10 us states\n\nas of monday, there have been 72 cases of the new variant, including at least 32 in california, 22 in florida, five in minnesota, four in new york, three in colorado, two in connecticut, and one case each in texas, pennsylvania, indiana and georgia.\n\nif it gathers a foothold, it will accelerate, lengthen, and deepen arizona's outbreak, gerald said.\n\non monday, arizona set a record with 4,997 people hospitalized for coronavirus-related reasons, according to the state's data dashboard. before the winter, the state's record for hospitalizations was 3,517 on july 13, 2020. the state surpassed that record december 11 and the tally of patients has, with a few exceptions, risen every day since then.\n\narizona recently opened a 24/7 site to administer vaccines. the operation at the home of the arizona cardinals nfl team is being overseen by the national guard. adjutant maj. gen. michael mcguire said at a news conference more resources are needed to implement the idea across the state.\n\nbiden gets second shot\n\npresident-elect joe biden received the second dose of the pfizer/biontech coronavirus vaccine on monday at christiana hospital in newark, delaware.\n\nhe received the first dose last month live on national television as part of an effort by his incoming administration to reassure the country of the vaccine's safety.\n\njust watched 100 million vaccine doses in biden's first 100 days 'realistic' replay more videos ... must watch 100 million vaccine doses in biden's first 100 days 'realistic' 02:21\n\nthe president-elect expressed his confidence in the vaccine and encouraged americans to receive one as soon as it becomes available to them.\n\nthe incoming administration is planning to carefully ensure people get their second covid-19 vaccine doses, according to michael osterholm, a member of biden's covid-19 advisory board and director of the center for infectious disease research and policy at the university of minnesota.\n\nthe incoming administration is planning very carefully to make sure that that second shot is delivered on time, osterholm said in a washington post live event.\n\nmeanwhile, a new analysis found that states are increasingly abandoning guidelines from the cdc and taking their own approaches to giving people coronavirus vaccine.\n\noverall, we find states are increasingly diverging from cdc guidance and from each other, suggesting that access to covid-19 vaccines in these first months of the u.s. vaccine campaign may depend a great deal on where one lives, the non-profit kaiser family foundation, which studies health care policy, said in a report.\n\nin addition, timelines vary significantly across states, regardless of priority group, resulting in a vaccine roll-out labyrinth across the country.\n\ncongresswoman tests positive\n\nus rep. bonnie watson coleman, a new jersey democrat, said monday that she has tested positive for covid-19.\n\na statement from her office said coleman believes she was exposed during protective isolation in the us capitol building as a result of insurrectionist riots. as reported by multiple news outlets, a number of members within the space ignored instructions to wear masks.\n\ncnn has previously reported that six house republicans were captured on video refusing masks offered by a colleague during the us capitol insurrection. it's unclear whether watson coleman was in the safe location with those members.
general electric's 110-year run in the dow could be nearing its end.\n\nthe company's unending list of problems led deutsche bank analyst john inch to predict that ge is likely to be dropped from the dow.\n\ninch, a frequent critic of ge, appears to be the first major analyst to make such a call. in his report on wednesday, he cited ge's substantial challenges, including a serious cash crisis, badly slumping power division and efforts to dramatically shrink the sprawling conglomerate. there's also the sec investigation that ge disclosed last week.\n\nge's (ge) cratering stock price, which is hovering near six-year lows, is another issue. while the dow has soared 32% over the past year, ge has lost nearly half its value.\n\nthe committee that runs the dow prefers to have no more than a 10-to-1 ratio between the high and low stock on the index. but the ratio between ge and boeing (ba) is more than twice that today.\n\nthat's important because the dow is weighted by its stock price. most other market indexes are weighted by market cap. so a 1% move in a $350 stock like boeing would move the dow significantly more than a 1% move in $16 stock like ge.\n\nno decisions about booting ge have been announced. it's possible that the committee in charge of the dow's membership may opt to stick with ge.\n\na spokesman at s&p global, which controls the dow, declined to weigh in due to company policy. we do not provide comment on potential adds or drops to our indices as we consider this information to be market moving and material, he said.\n\nrelated: ge is under sec investigation\n\nge is an original member of the dow, the index born in 1896 that is perhaps the most recognizable market metric in the world. but the company was removed and invited back several times, before returning in 1907 where it has remained ever since.\n\ndespite ge's current crisis, there is a case to be made for keeping the stock in the dow. while ge's stock price has cratered, it still boasts a very large market valuation of about $140 billion. that's bigger than seven dow stocks, including mcdonald's (mcd), caterpillar (cat), nike (nke) and american express (axp).\n\nge is also still a massive company, with its fingers in everything from aviation and power plants to healthcare and railroads. corporate filings indicate ge employed about 295,000 people as of the end of 2016, though recent layoffs have reduced its headcount.\n\nhowever, ge is in retreat mode. it long ago parted ways with nbc, universal studios and much of ge capital. now it's planning to jettison its light bulb and railroad divisions. ge is even considering an outright breakup of the company.\n\nit's possible that ge may not be as representative of the broad american economy as it once was.\n\nconsider that ge's stock is plunging even as the u.s. economy gathers momentum and rival industrial companies like honeywell (hon), 3m (mmm) and united technologies (utx) are booming.\n\nit's a great time for industrials, said cowen analyst gautam khanna. the divergent performance for ge is simply egregious.\n\nrelated: ge's $31 billion pension nightmare\n\nge's downfall has been caused in large part by bad decisions under former ceo jeff immelt about where to deploy the company's cash. some acquisitions, like the 2015 purchase of alstom, have backfired badly. instead of shoring up its underfunded pension, ge aggressively bought back stock and paid out a fat dividend that last year had to be halved.\n\ngetting kicked out of the prestigious 30-stock index would be the cherry atop an embarrassment sundae.\n\nif ge were kicked out of the dow, there's no guarantee it would be replaced by another industrial company.\n\nwhen at&t (t) was removed from the dow in 2015, it was substituted by apple (aapl). (at&t has agreed to acquire cnn parent time warner). honeywell (hon) and altria (mo) were replaced in 2008 with bank of america (bac) and chevron (cvx).\n\nthis time, a tech titan like amazon (amzn), facebook (fb) and google owner alphabet (googl) could be swapped in. then again, amazon and alphabet sport stock prices above $1,100, making their inclusion potentially problematic.\n\n--cnnmoney's paul r. la monica contributed to this report.
(cnn) house democrats want you to believe these two things -- at the same time:\n\n1) the threat posed by donald trump is so dire that, if vice president mike pence won't remove him from office this week, then they must immediately vote to impeach the president (again).\n\n2) in order to avoid cluttering joe biden's first days in office with an impeachment trial, they may wait for up to 100 days to send the articles of impeachment to the senate.\n\nif those two ideas seem directly contradictory to you, well, good! it means you are paying attention. because they are directly contradictory.\n\nit can't be both incredibly urgent that the house impeach trump with just more than a week left in his term and totally cool for the house to sit on the articles of impeachment until the biden administration gets off the ground.\n\nread more
washington (cnn) -- sens. john mccain and barack obama showed thursday night that they have more common ground than differences when it comes to making national service a priority in their presidential administrations.\n\nthe presidential canidates put aside partisan politics as the nation remembers the terrorist attacks.\n\nthe candidates took the stage separately in a forum sponsored by time at columbia university in new york.\n\na coin toss determined who took questions first from moderators time managing editor rick stengel and pbs's judy woodruff.\n\nasked why it seems the terror attacks of september 11, 2001, are fading in the minds of many americans, mccain said:\n\nwe needed at that time [september 11, 2001] to take advantage of the unity in the united states of america.\n\nmccain criticized the bush administration for not taking advantage of that sense of unity and instead imploring the american public to live their lives as usual and go shopping.\n\ni would have called them to serve, said mccain.\n\n\n\nthe gop candidate said he suspects people feel uninspired by leaders in washington and that americans want change in federal government.\n\nthey understand the challenges that we have in this world. they see the russian invasion of the little country called georgia. they see the problems in afghanistan growing larger. they see a whole lot of things happening in the world that's going to require us to serve, and that opportunity has to be provided to them. watch mccain talk about service »\n\nmccain praised the peace corps and americorps, saying they and similar organizations don't receive sufficient recognition from washington. but mccain was careful to say government should limit its involvement. asked about compensation for service mccain said:\n\ni'd be glad to reward [volunteers] them as much as possible. but you want to be careful that the reason is not the reward of financial or other reasons, but the reward is the satisfaction of serving a cause greater than yourself. ... finding new ways to serve. that's what this next few years should be all about.\n\nmccain also fielded a question about his running mate gov. sarah palin's dismissive comments about sen. barack obama's community service in illinois.\n\nlook, gov. palin was responding to the criticism of her inexperience and her job as a mayor in a small town. that's what she was responding to. of course i respect community organizers. of course i respect people who serve their community. and sen. obama's record there is outstanding.\n\nmccain also said that politics is tough business, and that obama set the tone of the whole campaign when he refused to take part in town hall meetings with mccain across america.\n\nobama said his views don't necessarily differ from mccain's on national service.\n\nhe said creating opportunities for national service would be a priority for his administration as well.\n\npart of what makes america work is the fact that we believe in individual responsibility and self-reliance, but we also believe in mutual responsibility, in neighborliness, in a sense that we are committed to something larger than ourselves.\n\nobama cited a plan to provide college tuition aid in return for student community service.\n\none of my central platforms in this campaign is we're going to provide a $4,000 tuition credit every student, every year, but in exchange for giving something back. and so, young people of modest means, who are interested in going to college, this gives them an opportunity to serve and at the same time, pay for their college education. i think there are a lot of creative ways where we can provide opportunities than exist right now.\n\nobama also said he wants to attract more young people into civil service careers.\n\nthe fact is that we have to have government. when a hurricane strikes, as it did with katrina, we have to have a fema that works, which by the way, means that we should be encouraging young people, the best and the brightest, to get involved as civil servants, to pursue careers of public service so we've got people who are trained in federal emergency management who are able to take on the job. watch obama talk about service »\n\nnow, that does not crowd out the red cross. that doesn't crowd out the thousands of church groups that went down there. what it means is that each area has a role to play.\n\nthe forum is part of a two-day summit meant to promote national service. nearly 500 leaders from business, foundations, universities and politics are meeting to celebrate the power and potential of citizen service and lay out a plan to address america's greatest social challenges through expanded opportunities for volunteer and national service, according to the organizers' web site.\n\neach presidential candidate has served his nation in different ways. mccain was a navy officer for over two decades and often encourages americans to serve a cause greater than oneself.\n\nobama served as a community organizer on the south side of chicago after he graduated from college. in a speech in december, the illinois democrat said he would ask americans to serve if he becomes president. this will be the cause of my presidency, he said.\n\ntoday's joint appearance came amid recent sniping between the campaigns.\n\nmccain's campaign recently attacked obama for lipstick remarks made during a campaign stop in virginia on tuesday.\n\njohn mccain says he's about change too, and so i guess his whole angle is, 'watch out george bush -- except for economic policy, health care policy, tax policy, education policy, foreign policy and karl rove-style politics -- we're really going to shake things up in washington,'  he said.\n\nthat's not change. that's just calling ... the same thing something different. you know you can put lipstick on a pig, but it's still a pig. you know you can wrap an old fish in a piece of paper called change, it's still going to stink after eight years. we've had enough of the same old thing. watch how tensions are rising on the trail »\n\nthe crowd erupted in applause when obama delivered the line. mccain's campaign said obama's remarks were offensive and a slap at vice presidential candidate sarah palin, despite the fact that the arizona senator himself used the phrase last year to describe a policy proposal of hillary clinton's.\n\nobama shot back wednesday and accused the mccain campaign of engaging in lies and swift boat politics.\n\ni don't care what they say about me. but i love this country too much to let them take over another election with lies and phony outrage and swift boat politics, he said in norfolk, virginia. enough is enough. watch obama deliver his harsh words »\n\nthe phrase swift boat comes from the 2004 presidential election, when the group swift boat veterans for truth launched an attack ad campaign against democratic candidate john kerry that was said by some to be false.\n\nbut the two presidential candidates agreed to put aside partisan politics on thursday. they appeared together in new york to lay a wreath at ground zero, where the world trade center towers collapsed after two airliners hijacked by al qaeda operatives plowed into them on september 11, 2001.\n\nthe two met with families of victims as well as state and local officials.\n\nearlier in the day, mccain attended a ceremony in shanksville, pennsylvania, to remember those who lost their lives when united airlines flight 93 crashed in a field there on september 11, 2001. many believe that the hijackers intended to crash flight 93 into the u.s. capitol in washington.\n\nhundreds, if not thousands, of people at work in that building, when that fateful moment occurred, could have been destroyed along with a beautiful symbol of our freedom, mccain said. they -- and possibly i -- owe our lives to the passengers who summoned the courage and love necessary to deprive our depraved and hateful enemies their terrible triumph.\n\ni've had the great honor and privilege to witness great courage and sacrifice for america's sake, he said.\n\nthe obama campaign released a statement earlier thursday for its candidate in which he said, we will never forget those who died.\n\non 9/11, americans across our great country came together to stand with the families of the victims, to donate blood, to give to charity, and to say a prayer for our country, obama said. let us renew that spirit of service and that sense of common purpose.\n\nmeanwhile, a cnn poll out thursday suggests that voters view mccain as the better presidential candidate to handle terrorism but do not consider terrorism their primary concern in voting.\n\nnearly two-thirds of those surveyed, 62 percent, believe that the republican presidential nominee would be the better candidate to handle the issue of terrorism, compared with 34 percent who believe that his democratic rival, obama, would be better on the issue.\n\nthe poll's margin of error is plus-or-minus 3 percentage points.\n\nopinion research corp. conducted telephone interviews with 1,022 adults from september 5-7 for the poll.\n\ntime's michael duffy contributed to this report.\n\nall about barack obama • john mccain • terrorism • september 11 attacks
nicholas kamm/afp/getty images/file\n\nambassador marie yovanovitch has retired, according to a senior state department official. it is unclear when she retired, but the official said it was sometime in the last two weeks.\n\nyovanovitch was a career foreign service officer for more than 30 years, who was pulled from her post as ambassador to ukraine at the order of president donald trump.\n\nyovanovitch is the fourth top state department official who has departed in the wake of the ukraine impeachment inquiry. the others are former us ambassador to ukraine bill taylor, former special representative for ukraine kurt volker, and michael mckinley, the former senior adviser to secretary of state mike pompeo.\n\nnpr was first to report her retirement, which comes about two months after she provided public testimony as part of the house impeachment inquiry. she said she was devastated to find out that trump had discussed her in such a negative way during his call with president volodymyr zelensky in july. she said trump's comments about her sounded like a threat.\n\nyovanovtich did meet with diplomatic security after the revelations earlier this month that robert hyde and lev parnas were discussing surveilling her while she was in kyiv. that investigation has not yet concluded.\n\npompeo has never defended yovanovitch by name. during an interview in ukraine today, when asked if he felt any moral tension about yovanvotich, pompeo said he did not.\n\nwe delivered for the president of the united states on a ukraine policy that will benefit the american people i hope for years and years to come, pompeo said in an abc news interview.\n\nmore background on yovanovitch: in may 2019, yovanovitch was recalled to washington, months earlier than expected. the state department said at the time that yovanovitch was concluding her 3-year diplomatic assignment as planned and that her departure aligned with the presidential transition in ukraine.

washington (cnn) the pentagon's top policy official who warned against withholding military aid to ukraine last year resigned on wednesday at the request of president donald trump, according to a copy of his resignation letter obtained by cnn.\n\njohn rood, under secretary of defense for policy at the pentagon, is the latest senior national security official involved in the ukraine controversy to be forced out following trump's acquittal in the senate impeachment trial, but sources told cnn that he broke with the administration on several issues, in addition to the handling of aid to ukraine, leading to a loss of support from leadership.\n\nit is my understanding from secretary esper that you requested my resignation from serving as under secretary of defense for policy. senior administration officials appointed by the president serve at the pleasure of the president, and therefore, as you have requested, i am providing my resignation effective february 28, 2020, rood wrote in his letter to president donald trump, dated wednesday.\n\ncnn was first to report rood's impending departure which was confirmed by trump in a tweet wednesday.\n\ni would like to thank john rood for his service to our country, and wish him well in his future endeavors! trump wrote, also sharing a story from bloomberg news which indicated that rood faced pressure to resign from some who lost confidence in his ability to carry out trump agenda.\n\nread more
seoul blocks beheading video\n\n\n\n\n\nseoul, south korea -- the south korean government is trying to block internet access to graphic video footage of the beheading of kim sun-il as public anger grows over his brutal slaying.\n\nthe move comes as president roh moo-hyun on thursday ordered a full investigation into the circumstances surrounding kim's kidnapping and murder in iraq by islamic militants.\n\nsouth korea's ministry of information and communication has introduced a 24-hour monitoring system in a bid to close down any web site that uploads video footage of kim's execution.\n\na tape of the beheading was first posted on an islamic web site and has subsequently made its way onto a number of other sites.\n\nthe tape shows the killing in graphic detail.\n\nthe information ministry has also asked local internet service providers to block the spread of the footage where possible, for fears it could further inflame anti-government passions sparked by the killing.\n\nthe militants believed responsible for the grisly slaying had demanded the south korean government drop plans to send 3,000 troops to iraq in exchange for kim's freedom.\n\nbut seoul was adamant it would not be blackmailed by terrorists.\n\nwhen the nation is in mourning, the ministry felt it was necessary to take strong measures, a ministry official told reuters news agency.\n\nwhen we think it's appropriate, we will take legal actions or request police investigation.\n\nthe ministry shut down a local web site showing images of the killing late wednesday, south korea's yonhap news agency reported.\n\nthe government's policy on troops in iraq is deeply unpopular with many in south korea, a sentiment that has been exacerbated by the kim murder.\n\nkim, a 33-year-old arabic-speaking interpreter, was an evangelical christian who had worked in iraq for a year for a south korean firm supplying the u.s. army.\n\nroh has asked his top advisers for an extensive review into the circumstances surrounding kim's death following media reports that south korea's foreign ministry had been notified of his kidnapping in early june.\n\nthe news of kim's slaying wednesday was met with sorrow and outrage around the world, with south koreans rallying close to the u.s. embassy in seoul, late on wednesday.\n\nkim's body was found by u.s. military police west of baghdad and appeared to have been thrown from a vehicle.\n\nthe man had been beheaded, and the head was recovered with the body,a senior coalition official in iraq said.\n\npentagon sources said the body had been booby-trapped with explosives.

it probably was not necessary to say, close aide and our revolution president nina turner told cnn earlier this week. but the main thing that he said, that i apologize and my senate campaign took steps based on what we learned from 2016, and we plan to do even more – that is what you want somebody to say.\n\nfor both sanders and his team, the spate of allegations have brought front and center both political and organizational challenges awaiting them if, as many believe is likely, he chooses to enter the democratic primary.\n\nif he decides to run again, bernie would have to have a campaign structure which is much more robust with a much bigger leadership team, weaver, slated to become a senior strategic adviser if sanders runs, said on wednesday. it would have to be much more diverse than was the case in 2016, when it was too male and too white.\n\noutside loyalists – including a number of whom are either ideological and political allies or former staffers who support sanders' agenda – who spoke to cnn were uniformly insistent that sanders takes the mistreatment faced by women on his campaign, along with the broader related issues, seriously, even if they doubted his ability to effectively convey it.\n\nin 2020, we're going to see how much bernie has grown from his own limitations in 2016, waleed shahid of the progressive justice democrats, which formed out of sanders' campaign and recruited new york rep. alexandria ocasio-cortez to run in 2018. can he speak to this constituency of democrats who really care about sexual harassment and me too, who really care about reproductive rights being under attack, that really care about police killings of black men and women and supporting athletes like colin kaepernick? it's all wrapped up in the same thing of, can you authentically speak to these identity and social movements?\n\ni think he's taken lots of steps toward doing that, shahid said, but it is always going to be something that he needs to work on.\n\nprogressive strategist rebecca katz cautioned that sanders had time to improve his posture.\n\nit's january of 2019. there is a long road ahead. his first time out after the news was known was not a good answer, she said. his tweet today was good. his actual answer showed improvement.\n\nkatz also stressed that the behavior on the sanders campaign in 2016 was not unique to bernie.\n\nmaybe the incompetence in how they handled it (on the campaign) was, but this stuff has been going on for decades. frankly, it's that more people have voices now and they are exercising their voice and that's great, she said. team sanders now has to show how the culture there has changed.\n\nbut as political matter, the concerns over sanders' capacity to win over voters outside his core of support have for some progressives come into sharper focus over the last couple weeks.\n\none progressive political strategist and consultant who has worked with our revolution and who requested anonymity to speak candidly about a sensitive subject expressed anxiety over what the strategist viewed as a rhetorical blindspot.\n\ni'm worried that there's a chance that bernie damages the social democratic cause long-term by not being conversant in gender and sexuality and race, the strategist said. i'm not saying he's bad on these issues – that critique is bs, he's actively to the left on almost every single substantive policy issue – but because our system is so individual-focused, he risks giving the people who oppose him on those issues so much ammo.
trump has used past addresses to highlight his administration's victories, target his political enemies and push forward on efforts to fulfill his vision for the country.\n\nthe president is banking on the strong us economy and trade deal victories to carry his reelection campaign to a win in november, and he's sure to highlight his wins on tuesday.\n\nhis approval rating among voters stands at 45% according to a recent cnn poll conducted by ssrs -- no worse than his approval rating in december and the highest it's been since july. and in december, 76% of individuals polled said they rated the economy very or somewhat good, indicating a shifting tide in americans' economic outlook, which had remained tepid in the wake of the recession.\n\nhere's what to watch for during tuesday's state of the union:\n\nimpeachment\n\ntrump aides had once hoped the address would be an opportunity for vindication following a senate acquittal, but the senate won't hold its final vote on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of congress until wednesday -- the day after the president is scheduled to deliver his speech.\n\nwhite house deputy press secretary hogan gidley said tuesday that the word impeachment is not in the president's state of the union speech, but suggested that it could be added to a later draft.\n\ni've read through the speech, and i've not seen the word impeachment. as he likes to say, 'we'll see what happens,'  he told reporters.\n\nunlike president bill clinton, who apologized to the country after he was acquitted, people close to trump said they anticipated he will continue to proclaim his complete and total innocence\n\ni don't see the president making a big statement one way or another that would indicate anything different than what he's been saying for many months, one republican close to trump said.\n\na senior administration official laying out plans for the speech wouldn't divulge whether the president would bring up impeachment during his remarks, but they did say the speech isn't being written in a vacuum and it wouldn't be out of the ordinary for the speech to evolve before it's delivered.\n\nmeanwhile, a handful of republican senators said they hope trump steers clear of impeachment talk during his address to the bipartisan audience.\n\nstaunch ally sen. lindsey graham of south carolina said it would be smart to focus on other issues, encouraged trump to be positive and posited that most people are ready to move on from impeachment.\n\ni hope he is, too, because i am, said graham.\n\ncampaign pitch\n\nthe overall theme of trump's speech will be the great american comeback, the senior administration official said. the president is expected to focus on what he sees as victories for his administration through the lens of election issues, such as the economy, health care and national security.\n\nthe official said trump is expected to focus on five areas: blue-collar workers, promoting and supporting families, lowering health care costs, immigration and protecting american families.\n\nthe president is also expected to draw contrast between his beliefs and the proposed policies of democrats.\n\nspecifically, the official said trump is expected to contrast his health care policies with those on the socialist left, presenting a sharp difference with policies such as medicare for all, which has been touted by some democratic presidential candidates.\n\na mixed crowd\n\ntrump's speech is, of course, expected to be delivered in the presence of several members of congress who are often at odds with the administration's policies. however, this year's speech will be a markedly more contentious year between the president and democrats.\n\nit will likely mark the first time trump and house speaker nancy pelosi have been in the same room in months. their relationship became more tense after pelosi began the impeachment proceedings, and, according to a pelosi spokesman, the two have not spoken since the october 16 meeting in which trump insulted pelosi, including calling her a third-grade politician, before she and other top democrats walked out and later accused the president of having a meltdown.\n\nit will also likely mark the first time trump will be in the same room as some of his democratic opponents running for president. he's used recent interviews and speeches to unleash a litany of insults and attacks on his potential opponents, but the official previewing trump's address wouldn't say whether he would do the same while speaking in the senate chamber.\n\ni won't preview if he's going to call anybody out but i think the president would be entirely comfortable with that, the official said.\n\ncoverage of the democrats' iowa caucuses dominated televisions tuesday morning, potentially increasing the odds that trump will use his high-profile speech to swipe at potential rivals.\n\nchecking in on past promises\n\nthe president has used past state of the union addresses to push new policy proposals, such as tax cuts, an infrastructure plan and health care revisions. some of these proposals have been successful, while others have not.\n\nduring the 2019 state of the union, trump called for the great rebuilding of america's crumbling infrastructure. but he held off on moving ahead, saying he would move on it only after the us-mexico-canada trade agreement was passed by congress. he signed the pact into law last week.\n\nin 2018, trump touted the success of his new tax cuts, calling them the biggest tax cuts and reforms in american history and claiming they would be a boon to the economy. however, a combination of the reduced revenues due to the tax cuts and record-setting defense spending helped balloon the federal budget deficit to $1 trillion last year. more recently, the president has said he is considering cuts to entitlement programs as a means of debt reduction.

(photo by joe raedle/getty images)\n\neditor's note: frida ghitis, a former cnn producer and correspondent, is a world affairs columnist. she is a frequent opinion contributor to cnn and the washington post and a columnist for world politics review. the opinions expressed in this commentary are those of the author; view more opinion articles on cnn.\n\n(cnn) —\n\nsomething has changed. president donald trump's headline-hungry governing style has never lacked for drama, but there's a new sense of aimlessness lately in trump's frenetic search for a crisis, his efforts to control the headlines, distract from other events, and keep his base satisfied that he is the muscular fighter who will stop at nothing to achieve his goals.\n\nfrida ghitis\n\nin reality, the trump administration is a vortex of incoherence.\n\nin the final weeks of 2018, trump suddenly revived his promise to build a wall with all the concentrated determination of a man fleeing a posse. the promise was never quite dead (the second stanza of the build the wall campaign chant, the part about mexico paying, has faded, drowned by the debunking of nonsensical claims) but two years into the trump administration, the urgency of building a wall exploded onto the scene only after tangible threats to trump looked imminent.\n\nafter winning control of the house of representatives, democrats prepared to launch real investigations into the endless areas of possible corruption and malfeasance in the administration, a development that coincidentally occurred just as the probe into ties between the trump campaign and russia started gushing new damning revelations, with the mueller investigation appearing to zero in on its target.\n\ntrump is flailing badly on foreign and domestic policy. at home, some of his allies are worried, and abroad there is also concern.\n\nat home, the government shutdown over a phony crisis at the border has created a very real crisis for hundreds of thousands of americans, not only the more than 800,000 federal workers at risk of going without a paycheck, or the more than 420,000 who are – incredibly – required to work without pay, but also the millions more who depend on spending by all of those people.\n\ntrump's strategy seems baffling because it is so unnecessarily harmful to individuals, to the country, and even to republicans in congress. already some republican senators have parted ways with him. sen. lisa murkowski has called for an end to the shutdown. sen. susan collins said she's looking for a compromise, something trump histrionically signaled he has no interest in when he walked out of a meeting with democratic leaders. both murkowski and collins were instrumental to ending the 2013 shutdown, conferring with colleagues across the aisle when other republicans wouldn't.\n\ntrump's claim that there's an immigration crisis at the border is refuted by experts. his demonization of immigrants treads a well-worn path of demagogues seeking to invent enemies to build support. and even people who live along the border are skeptical of his claim that a wall is a solution. and yet he has brought part of the government to a standstill over it.\n\nthe shutdown is helping trump keep the latest developments on russia off the top of the news. but it is not making them disappear. just this week, a redaction error in a court filing revealed that paul manafort, trump's campaign chief, passed confidential campaign polling data to a business associate with close links to the kremlin. it is the most powerful public evidence yet of coordination between russia and the trump campaign. separately, the russian lawyer who met at trump tower with donald trump jr. and other top campaign figures, natalia veselnitskaya, was indicted in an unrelated case that offered further proof of her close links to the russian government. the case against trump is becoming more ominous by the day. and that's just a small piece of his troubles.\n\nno wonder trump is throwing everything at the wall, trying to make us look in a different direction, threatening to cut off aid to californians who lost everything in recent fires, saying he will declare a national emergency if he doesn't get his way.\n\nrepublicans see what the rest of us do. the guy is nuts, is what some congressional republicans say about trump privately, according to former democratic sen. claire mccaskill. he doesn't have a grasp of issues, he's making rash decisions, he's not listening to people who know the subject matter.\n\na recent foreign policy example shows the destructive impact of trump's impulsiveness on the global stage, with top administration officials touring the middle east to contain the fallout from his sudden announcement that the united states is pulling out of syria. american troops, he unexpectedly announced, are coming back now. we won.\n\nthe december announcement sent shockwaves. almost every expert said it was a mistake. defense secretary james mattis, one of the administration's most respected officials, resigned in protest, with a letter that castigated trump's conduct of foreign policy. the syria plan seemed to contradict every foreign policy objective trump had claimed to embrace. it was a boon to iran, a gift to isis, a potentially deadly blow to america's kurdish allies, and a weakening of support for israel.\n\nthen started the backtracking, the meandering, the confusion so astonishingly unseemly for the world's most powerful nation. the now turned into a little later, maybe four months. national security adviser john bolton said us forces would leave, but only after isis was really defeated (never mind we won) and after guarantees that turkey would not attack the kurds.\n\nturkey was furious. when bolton traveled to turkey, president erdogan snubbed him, refusing to meet. secretary of state mike pompeo then gave yet another version of washington's plans for syria, creating even more confusion.\n\nprofessionals in government have been trying to keep a semblance of sound and coherent policygoing, but when trump becomes directly involved, rationality can disappear. trump's faith in his gut, his narcissistic belief that he knows more than people who have dedicated their lives to understanding complex issues, propelled by his compulsion to be the center of attention and his goal of obscuring reality and distracting from his growing troubles, adds up to a destructive policy muddle.\n\nthat's one reason he can't fill key positions. mattis was only one of many top figures to leave. after chief of staff john kelly (the last one of what trump called my generals) left the administration, the president went through an embarrassing spectacle trying to replace him. now many of the most important jobs in government are temporarily filled by interim or stand-in acting officials.\n\nget our free weekly newsletter sign up for cnn opinion's new newsletter.\n\njoin us on twitter and facebook\n\ntrump is trying to look tough, but his actions betray nervousness, fear. the news that michael cohen, trump's former lawyer, will testify publicly before congress in february is likely to become yet another thing from which the president will try to distract us. his apparent belief that a national border crisis protects him from his troubles represents a very real crisis of presidential leadership for the country.

compares every aspect of each cash back credit card to our benchmark credit card to determine which cards can potentially earn you the most cash. so let's dive into the details of each card and see how they stack up.\n\nciti double cash\n\nbest overall card for cash back\n\nwhy it's great in one sentence: the citi double cash card is extremely simple, since you earn 2% cash back on every purchase — 1% when you buy and 1% when you pay your statement — all for no annual fee.\n\nthis card is right for: people looking for an easy and straightforward way to earn cash back without having to worry about category bonuses.\n\nhighlights:\n\nearn 2% cash back on everything — 1% when you make a purchase and another 1% when you pay it off.\n\n18-month 0% introductory rate on balance transfers (13.99% to 23.99% variable afterward).\n\nexpert users can convert the cash back to citi thankyou travel points at a ratio of 1 cent per point when combined with the citi prestige® card or citi premier℠ card.\n\nno annual fee.\n\nsign-up bonus: none.\n\nwhat we like about the citi double cash: when compared to all of the other major no-annual-fee credit cards, the citi double cash offers the highest ongoing flat-rate return on every single purchase. with this card you'll earn 2% in cash back — 1% when you buy something and another 1% when you pay it off — on every purchase you make. there's no maximum on the cash back you can earn, and you don't need to worry about tracking category bonuses.\n\nthe citi double cash also offers a relatively long 18-month introductory 0% interest rate period for balance transfers — a great way to pay off your debt (though make sure you pay it off, because the rate jumps to a variable 13.99% to 23.99% after the introductory offer ends). and you have up to four months after you open the account to make your first balance transfer and still have it qualify for the introductory offer.\n\nrelated: read cnn underscored's list of the best balance transfer credit cards.\n\nexperts will enjoy pairing this card with one of the premium citi thankyou credit cards, such as the citi premier or citi prestige. that's because if you also have a premium thankyou card, you can actually convert your cash back from the citi double cash to citi thankyou points and then transfer those points to one of citi's airline partners or redeem them for airfare at 1.25 cents per point when going through the citi travel portal with the citi premier (though this rate will drop to 1 cent per point after april 21, 2021).\n\none thing that could be better: although the citi double cash card will earn you the most cash back on your everyday purchases, it doesn't have any category bonuses. this can be a downside if you routinely make a large number of purchases in a particular category.\n\nyou'll also find that the citi double cash doesn't come with many perks, such as travel or purchase protections. this is also not the card to use for international purchases, as you'll be charged a 3% foreign transaction fee when you're overseas, which more than offsets the rewards you'd earn.\n\nwhy it's our benchmark card: the ease of use and straightforward top-of-market cash back earning rate of the citi double cash are why cnn underscored currently uses the double cash as our benchmark credit card to compare the features of other credit cards and determine if they're better or worse overall.\n\nyou can read more about our benchmark credit card concept in our credit card methodology guide or dig into our complete review of the citi double

blue cash preferred credit card.\n\nwhy it's great in one sentence: the blue cash preferred card from american express earns 6% cash back at us supermarkets (up to $6,000 per year in purchases, then 1%), making it one of the best credit cards year after year for buying groceries.\n\nthis card is right for: people who spend a significant amount of money at us supermarkets but who also want to avoid high interest rates on their purchases for their first year as a card member.\n\nhighlights:\n\nearn 6% cash back at us supermarkets on up to $6,000 per year in purchases (then 1%) and on select us streaming subscriptions.\n\nearn 3% cash back at us gas stations and on transit (including taxis/ride-shares, parking, tolls, trains, buses and more).\n\nearn 1% cash back on everything else.\n\n0% interest on all purchases for the first 12 months (13.99% to 23.99% variable afterward).\n\npurchase protection and return protection.\n\ncar rental loss and damage insurance.\n\nterms apply.\n\nwelcome bonus: earn a $300 statement credit after you spend $3,000 in purchases on your new card within the first six months after opening the account, plus get a $0 introductory annual fee for the first year ($95 thereafter).\n\nwhat we like about the blue cash preferred: for many americans, a significant portion of the monthly family budget goes to supermarket and gas station expenses. the blue cash preferred card dials up the bonus cash back on those two categories, creating a go-to in your wallet for these routine purchases.\n\nnot only will you earn extra cash back in the grocery and gas departments, but you'll also earn a significant amount of cash back on all your us streaming subscriptions. this includes over 20 different providers, such as disney+, hbo, netflix, spotify and youtube tv, among others. and when transit starts to make a comeback, you'll also get a nice return there as well, with 3% cash back on those transactions.\n\nrelated: earn more rewards on your groceries with these credit cards.\n\nthe blue cash preferred also comes with a solid return protection policy, which can come in handy during the upcoming holiday season. return protection allows you to return an eligible item within 90 days from the day of purchase if the merchant won't take it back. as long as you used your blue cash preferred to pay for it, american express will refund the full purchase price (excluding shipping and handling). claims are capped at $300 per item, up to a maximum of $1,000 per card account per calendar year.\n\none thing that could be better: many of the bonus categories on the blue cash preferred are limited to purchases made within the united states. there's also a 2.7% foreign transaction fee on the card, which doesn't make this an ideal choice for international travel. and the card has a $95 annual fee, which is significantly higher than many other credit cards offering cash back.\n\nthe blue cash preferred currently comes with a $0 introductory annual fee for the first year, then $95 thereafter. but if you prefer a card that never has an annual fee and also offers a strong return on groceries, you might consider the blue cash everyday® card from american express instead.\n\nwhile the blue cash everyday earns a lower 3% cash back at us supermarkets (up to $6,000 per year, then 1%), it has no annual fee. that means if you spend less than $3,166 in grocery purchases annually, it could be a better choice.\n\nrelated: amex blue cash preferred vs. amex blue cash everyday.\n\nwhere it beats our benchmark card: welcome bonus, an introductory interest rate on purchases, return protection and car rental damage coverage.\n\nwhere our benchmark card is better: the citi double cash has an introductory interest rate on balance transfers, and its cash back can be converted to citi thankyou travel points when combined with the citi prestige card or citi premier card.\n\nlearn more and apply for the blue cash preferred

sentence: the new chase freedom flex credit card offers both fixed category bonuses — including one specifically for dining — and a set of rotating category bonuses, plus cell phone protection as well.\n\nthis card is right for: people who are looking for a no-annual-fee card that earns bonus cash back at restaurants, even if they're just getting delivery or takeout, as well as in several other categories.\n\nhighlights:\n\nearn 5% cash back on travel purchased through chase ultimate rewards.\n\nearn 3% cash back on dining at restaurants, including takeout and eligible delivery services.\n\nearn 3% cash back on drugstore purchases.\n\nearn 5% cash back on quarterly bonuses categories (up to $1,500 on combined purchases).\n\nearn 1% cash back on all other purchases.\n\ncash back can be transferred to airline and hotel travel programs when combined with select chase ultimate rewards cards, such as the chase sapphire preferred card\n\ncell phone protection.\n\nno annual fee.\n\nsign-up bonus: earn $200 bonus cash back after you spend $500 on purchases in the first three months after opening the account.\n\nwhat we like about the chase freedom flex: while you might sign up for the chase freedom flex for its sign-up bonus, it'll likely become one of your long-term go-to cards, thanks to its rotating 5% bonus categories and ongoing 3% category bonuses at restaurants and drugstores.\n\nthe chase freedom flex earns 5% on travel booked through chase ultimate rewards, 3% at drugstores and 3% at restaurants. and even if you're not physically eating out at restaurants right now, you'll still receive the increased cash back on takeout and eligible delivery orders.\n\nbut in addition to those three fixed bonus categories, the card offers a set of 5% bonus categories that rotate each quarter. for the current quarter from january through march, the categories are wholesale clubs, internet, cable and phone services, and select streaming services, the rotating categories are capped at $1,500 in purchases per quarter, so you can earn as much as $75 in bonus cash.\n\naside from the bonus categories, this card also comes with many unique benefits that differ from most other chase cards. one of our favorites is cell phone protection. as long as you use your chase freedom flex to pay your monthly cell phone bill, you'll be covered against theft or damage to your phone, up to $800 per claim and $1,000 per year, with a $50 deductible per claim and a maximum of two claims in a 12-month period. this is currently the only no-annual-fee chase credit card that offers this highly sought-after benefit.\n\none thing that could be better: while there's no maximum on how much cash back you can earn in the three fixed bonus categories, the rotating 5%

earn bonus cash back on gasoline purchases, both at costco and other gas stations.\n\nwhy it's great in one sentence: the costco anywhere visa card by citi offers big rewards on many practical purchases, such as 4% cash back on eligible gas purchases worldwide (capped at the first $7,000 in purchases per year, then 1% thereafter), 3% cash back at restaurants and on eligible travel purchases and 2% cash back on all costco and costco.com purchases.\n\nthis card is right for: costco members who want strong rewards when buying at costco and filling up their gas tank.\n\nhighlights:\n\nearn 4% cash back on eligible gas purchases worldwide, including costco gas (capped at the first $7,000 in purchases per year, then 1% thereafter).\n\nearn 3% cash back at restaurants and on eligible travel purchases.\n\nearn 2% cash back on all costco and costco.com purchases (other than costco gas).\n\nearn 1% cash back on all other purchases.\n\npurchase protection and extended warranty coverage.\n\nno foreign transaction fees.\n\nno annual fee.\n\nsign-up bonus: none.\n\nwhat we like about the costco anywhere visa: for those looking to fill up their vehicle's gas tank, the costco anywhere visa offers the most cash back when compared to other top-earning credit cards.\n\nearning 4% cash back on all gas purchases worldwide for the first $7,000 per year (1% thereafter) can add up quickly and save you some serious money over the course of the year. and aside from the earning potential on gas, earning 3% cash back at restaurants and eligible travel purchases is on par — and many times better — than what you'll see with other cash back credit cards.\n\nthe costco anywhere visa also offers purchase protection, which is a great benefit for all purchases, especially during the holiday season. you'll be covered if your item is damaged or stolen within 120 days of purchase (90 days for new york residents). the coverage is good for up to $10,000 per item and $50,000 annually.\n\nthe purchase protection applies to items you buy anywhere, not just at costco. but even while costco has a favorable return policy for most of its products, electronics and major appliances only have a 90-day return window, which makes the benefits of this credit card extra useful.\n\nalso, with the card's extended warranty coverage, you'll receive an additional two years of warranty on top of the normal manufacturer's warranty for any products you purchase with the card. again, this extended warranty benefit applies not only to purchases made at costco, but also to any other retailer as long as you use your costco anywhere visa as your payment method.\n\none thing that could be better: one big disadvantage of the costco anywhere visa is that you have to wait a full year to receive your rewards, which are sent in the form of an annual certificate after your february billing statement closes each year. the certificate can be redeemed for costco purchases or exchanged for cash at your local costco store, and will expire if it's not redeemed by december 31 of that calendar year.\n\nalso, although this card doesn't carry an annual fee, to be a card member, you must have a costco membership, which starts at $60 per year.\n\nwhere it beats our benchmark card: extended warranty, purchase protection and no foreign transaction fees. also, the costco card is a visa credit card, which is accepted at costco in-store and at costco.com — mastercards like the citi double cash are not accepted in-store.\n\nwhere our benchmark card is better: with the citi double cash, you receive your cash back on a monthly basis instead of once a year, and you don't have to physically go into a store to exchange your rewards for cash.\n\nread our complete costco

we hear a lot about how college is expensive, but many folks don't realize quite how costly a degree can be these days. according to the college board, the average cost of tuition and fees for the 2016-2017 school year looked something like this:\n\n$9,650 for in-state public colleges\n\n$24,930 for out-of-state public colleges\n\n$33,480 for private colleges\n\nof course, that's just one piece of the puzzle. room and board -- an oft-necessary component of college attendance -- averages $10,440 at public colleges and $11,890 at private ones.\n\nwhen we look at these costs, it's easy to see why so many low- and middle-income families struggle to pay for college.\n\nbut for a large number of higher earners, most universities are out of reach as well. according to research by the institute for higher education policy (ihep), even families earning over $100,000 a year can't afford nearly 60% of u.s. colleges.\n\nnow ihep defines affordability as the means to pay for college after saving 10% of one's discretionary income for the 10-year period leading up to college, combined with earnings from a student working 10 hours per week during college.\n\ngiven that most folks are advised to save 10% of their income for retirement, setting aside another 10% for college is a pretty tall order. it's therefore demoralizing to learn that even those who manage to hit that threshold still wind up falling short in terms of being able to afford most learning institutions.\n\nthat said, just because some folks might very well be saving 10% of their income for college doesn't mean that they're saving in the most efficient manner possible.\n\nand that could spell the difference between affording college or winding up with a ridiculous pile of debt for privilege of having a child attend the university of his or her choice.\n\nfind a smarter way to save\n\nwhile setting aside money for college is a smart move off the bat, where you put that cash could have a huge impact on your eventual ability, or lack thereof, to pay those bills.\n\nfidelity investments reports that about 40% of families are now saving for college via a 529 plan, which represents an increase from previous years. and while 529s are by no means the only option for saving for college, they're a far more efficient route than savings and traditional brokerage accounts.\n\nthough you don't get an immediate federal tax break for contributing to a 529, once you fund an account, that money gets to grow tax-free. as long as you use that money for qualified higher education purposes, you'll get to keep your ending balance in full.\n\ntraditional brokerage accounts, by contrast, require you to pay taxes on your gains year after year. this means that if you sell anything in your account at a profit, you'll lose a chunk of those proceeds to taxes, leaving you less money to reinvest. along these lines, if you leave your investments alone during your college savings period and only sell them off once the time comes to start tacking those tuition bills, you'll lose a portion of your eventual earnings to taxes as well.\n\nthen there are savings accounts, which not only impose taxes on interest income but offer very little in the way of returns to begin with. these days, you'll be lucky to get a solid 1% per year out of your savings account, making it a rather inefficient tool.\n\nrelated: how should i save for my kid's college education?\n\nimagine you earn $100,000 a year, and sock away 10% of that, or $10,000 annually, for 10 years. with a regular old savings account, you'll grow your college fund to roughly $104,000 -- not all too impressive considering that $100,000 of that stems from principal contributions.\n\non the other hand, if you save in a traditional brokerage account or 529, your investments might very well generate an average annual 7% return, which would leave you with $138,000 after 10 years' time.\n\nhere's the catch though -- if you have a traditional brokerage account whose investments you sell off to access that cash, you'll lose a portion of your earnings to capital gains taxes. assuming you're in the 25% bracket, those taxes will knock a good $10,000 off your $38,000 in gains. with a 529, however, you'll get to use that $138,000 in full, as long as it's applied to qualified college costs.\n\nnow one major drawback of opening a 529 is that if you don't end up using that money for qualified purposes, you'll face a 10% penalty on the gains portion of your account. it's for this reason that you might consider other college savings avenues, like a roth ira, if you're eligible to open one. (even if you can't fund one directly, you can always convert a traditional ira to a roth.)\n\nrelated links:\n\n• motley fool issues rare triple-buy alert\n\n• this stock could be like buying amazon in 1997\n\n• 7 of 8 people are clueless about this trillion-dollar market\n\nno matter how you decide to save for college, you should do so in a manner that lets you maximize your gains and minimize your taxes. even if you're a relatively high earner, covering the cost of college is likely to be a challenge, so the smarter you are about how you save, the better your chances of meeting your ultimate goals.

(cnn) —\n\na national fraternity and four men are expected to be sentenced monday for charges related to the 2013 hazing death of baruch college student and fraternity pledge chun michael deng. experts say the punishment could influence other cases that involve hazing deaths.\n\npi delta psi inc. was found guilty in november on a felony count of involuntary manslaughter, among other charges, though it was acquitted of the more serious charges of third-degree murder and voluntary manslaughter.\n\nphoto: wnep chun michael deng\n\nin may, four pi delta psi members – kenny kwan, raymond lam, charles lai and sheldon wong – pleaded guilty to felony charges of voluntary manslaughter and hindering apprehension in deng's death, which was the result of a hazing ritual.\n\nthe case bears numerous similarities to the february death of timothy piazza, a fraternity pledge at penn state university who died after consuming an excessive amount of alcohol then engaging in a hazing ritual similar to the one that killed deng. legal experts wonder if the pi delta psi case could have an impact on the piazza case.\n\nat the time of deng's death, baruch college said that deng died participating in an unsanctioned fraternity pledging event that the school had no knowledge of, adding it had a zero tolerance policy regarding hazing.\n\npi delta psi ended its affiliation with its baruch college colony, saying it had violated the values and rules of our organization. individual members involved also had their fraternity memberships revoked.\n\naccording to its website, the asian-american fraternity has a presence on at least 25 college campuses across the country, most of which are based in the northeast.\n\npi delta psi inc. and its lawyer did not respond to cnn's requests for comment.\n\nthere can be no question that the death of michael deng was tragic, said todd greenberg, an attorney for lam.\n\nto a lesser extent it's also a tragedy for mr. lam and the other young men. they never intended for this to happen, he said, adding lam had been guilt ridden for his conduct since the day it happened.\n\nan attorney for wong told cnn, sheldon remains, and will always be, deeply saddened and devastated by michael deng's death.\n\nlawyers for the two other individuals could not be reached for comment sunday.\n\nphoto: monroe county da/monroe county da's

2013 during pi delta psi's crossing over weekend for pledges, according to a criminal complaint. the fraternity chapter held the event at a rented house in pennsylvania's pocono mountains.\n\nit was there deng ultimately suffered and died from a traumatic brain injury while participating in the glass ceiling, a ritual that required pledges to run through a line of fraternity brothers who shoved, pushed and tackled the aspiring members to the ground.\n\nphoto: wnep the house rented by the baruch college colony of pi delta psi in december 2013.\n\nat some point, deng, who was blindfolded and wearing a weighted backpack, fell, struck his head and was immediately unconscious, according to police. some fraternity members placed deng by a fire while others searched the internet for his symptoms and tried to wake the pledge.\n\nmeanwhile, the criminal complaint said, other fraternity members were told by a member and the national fraternity president to protect the fraternity and hide all the memorabilia from police – including clothes, fraternity paddles, banners and signs. they were also instructed to conceal cellphones, marijuana and mushrooms, the complaint said.\n\ndeng arrived at a nearby hospital for treatment 2 hours after he was injured – a delay that a forensic pathologist concluded significantly contributed to the death of mr. deng, the complaint said.\n\ndeng's death was ruled a homicide, with forensic analysis revealing at least three clear impacts to the head, rendered by forces considered significant and severe.\n\nit would take hundreds of pounds of impulsive loads and/or hundreds of g forces in order to cause the damage to the interior of the brain, the criminal complaint said.\n\nsetting precedent\n\nfour fraternity pledge deaths in 2017 overshadowed the case against pi delta psi and its members. however, experts say university communities across the united states will be paying close attention to monday's sentencing for indications of how other cases may be handled.\n\npledge deaths are being investigated on the campuses of louisiana state university, florida state university and texas state university.\n\nprosecutors in the february death of penn state beta theta pi pledge timothy piazza, in particular, will be watching the deng case closely. the similarities in the two cases could mean that the deng outcome effects the course of the piazza prosecution.\n\npiazza died as the result of a hazing ritual called the gauntlet, which involved pledges drinking excessive amounts of alcohol. afterward, piazza fell several times, resulting in a traumatic brain injury and a laceration in his spleen that ultimately proved fatal.\n\neven after it was clear he needed medical attention, fraternity members didn't call for help for at least 12 hours. a criminal presentment in the case detailed an alleged coverup, in which pledges were told to clean up evidence of alcohol and keep quiet about what happened. one member allegedly deleted video evidence from inside the house as police came to collect it.\n\nstill, there are crucial differences – particularly the role of alcohol. whereas piazza consumed at least 18 drinks in 82 minutes, according to video surveillance, deng's toxicology report revealed no alcohol or other substances of abuse.\n\nphoto: patrick carns photography timothy piazza, center, and his parents\n\ndoug fierberg, an attorney for deng's family, said prosecutors in the piazza case could learn from the outcome of the deng case and pi delta psi case sentencing.\n\nthese are two of the higher-profile circumstances involving the prosecution of hazing, said fierberg. prosecutors in the piazza case, he said, might as well learn from the outcome of the deng case.\n\nfierberg said he expects the deng case will help clarify some things ahead of the piazza case and could set a number of precedents.\n\nnumber one, fierberg said, national fraternities can and should be held criminal and civilly responsible for the injury and death caused by their members. the criminal prosecutions shows that can happen and should proceed that way and they can be convicted.\n\nin regard to civil responsibility, fierberg said the deng case will show fraternities can carry the blame, and not just individual students who were involved.\n\nthere are reasons why young men die year in and year out at fraternities, fierberg said. and the ability to reduce those incidents rests within the control of the national fraternities and universities, not solely in the lap of the men who are on the ground.\n\nnot all legal experts believe the pi delta psi case will impact the piazza case.\n\nmonroe county assistant district attorney kimberly metzger, the prosecutor in the deng case, said on friday the two cases are very different and that it would be inappropriate to comment on what (prosecutors in the piazza case) might learn from our case.\n\na 'chilling effect'\n\nthe outcome of the pi delta psi case could also have an impact beyond pennsylvania, said cnn legal analyst joey jackson, who predicted a chilling effect on universities and fraternities nationwide.\n\ni think there's a reckoning here, jackson said, comparing the attention placed on recent hazing deaths to last year's #metoo movement, which became a tipping point in how the public addresses sexual misconduct.\n\nfor whatever reason, this has reached a crescendo, and we're focused on it now, jackson said. i think you will see forceful prosecutions in other jurisdictions and i think they can learn a lot from prosecutions in pennsylvania. universities, he said, will pay attention.\n\nhank nuwer, a journalist and professor at franklin college in indiana who has been tracking and writing about hazing deaths since the 1970s, agreed with jackson's assessment.\n\nnuwer said the verdict against pi delta psi and looming sentence strengthens the arsenal for cases like piazza's and others involving hazing.\n\nparents of victims and activists don't think there's enough being done in these cases, nuwer said, and are pressuring courts to take a harder look at hazing deaths than they have in the past.\n\n03:40 - source: cnn parents open up on son's hazing death\n\njudges are taking it more seriously, said nuwer, adding that lawyers who didn't know how to bring a case against fraternities in the past now have greater understanding of how to handle such cases.\n\ni'm seeing huge changes from 1978 when my first article appeared, he said. these are important cases right now. that's going to be interesting to see how magistrates and juries look at fraternities now.\n\nhopefully, jackson said, whatever sentence pi delta psi receives, it deters other fraternities and ensures they enact policies to protect members and pledges.\n\nthey'll learn from the lessons of pennsylvania, jackson said. you're going to see aggressive prosecutions until this stops and that's the way it is.\n\ncnn's sara ganim contributed to this report.
this story contains images and descriptions of extremist groups and their beliefs.\n\n(cnn) flags, signs and symbols of racist, white supremacist and extremist groups were displayed along with trump 2020 banners and american flags at wednesday's riot at the us capitol.\n\nthe pictures tell part of the story of the beliefs of some of those who chose to show up on that day -- from passionate and peaceful trump supporters to extremists who showed their hate with their symbols as well as their actions.\n\nthe mixing of the groups is one issue that experts who track extremism and hate have long been concerned about.\n\nthe certification of the election results proved to be exactly the type of event that brought together various groups and could have led to radical ideas being shared, they say. the initial event, which was heavily promoted and encouraged by president trump, gave all of these groups something to rally around.\n\nthis was an event designed to oppose the results of a free and fair democratic election and the transition of power that would naturally follow, mark pitcavage, a historian and expert in extremism with the anti-defamation league said.\n\ncnn spoke with him to identify the symbols and understand the chilling messages of tyranny, white supremacy, anarchy, racism, anti-semitism and hatred they portray.\n\nnoose and gallows\n\nwhile a noose on its own is often used as a form of racial intimidation, pitcavage says he believes in this context the gallows were to suggest punishment for committing treason. it is suggesting that representatives and senators who vote to certify the election results, and possibly vice president pence, are committing treason and should be tried and hanged, he explains.\n\nthat treason rhetoric was seen on right-wing message boards in days leading up to the event.\n\nthree percenters flag\n\nthe three percenters (also known as iii%ers, 3%ers or threepers) are part of the militia movement in the united states and are anti-government extremists, according to the adl.\n\nlike others in the militia movement, three percenters view themselves as defending the american people against government tyranny.\n\nbecause many adherents to the militia movement strongly support president trump, in recent years, three percenters have not been as active in opposing the federal government, directing their ire at other perceived foes, including leftists/antifa, muslims and immigrants, according to the adl.\n\nthe group's name comes from an inaccurate claim that only three percent of the people in the colonies armed themselves and fought against the british during the revolutionary war.\n\nthe flag seen above is their logo on the traditional betsy ross flag. pitcavage says right-wing groups (mainstream or extreme), which think of themselves as patriotic, sometimes co-opt america's first flag.\n\nrelease the kraken flag\n\nthe flag references former trump lawyer sidney powell's comments that she was going to release the kraken. powell falsely said she had evidence that would destroy the idea that joe biden won the presidency.\n\nthe kraken, a mammoth sea creature from scandavian folklore, has turned into a meme in circles that believe the election was stolen. the kraken, they say, is a cache of evidence that there was widespread fraud. on social media, qanon conspiracy and fringe sites #releasethekraken has been widely shared along with false theories of fraud.\n\nthe proud boys and the ok sign\n\nthe far right has co-opted the ok sign as a trolling gesture and, for some, as a symbol of white power. the adl added that symbol to its long-standing database of slogans and symbols used by extremists.\n\na photo from the riot at the us capitol shows several people making the ok hand gesture.\n\nsome of the people in the photo are also seen in a livestream from the rally, where they identify themselves as members of the proud boys, specifically the arizona chapter.\n\nthe man livestreaming the event moves through the crowd at the capitol saying support your local proud boys.\n\nin the video, he goes up to a group wearing orange hats and says, they wanna know what the orange hats stand for.\n\none man replies that it's a way to keep their group together before another chimes in: it stands for the best f*cking chapter in the best f*cking organization in the world.\n\nasked what that organization is, the man in an orange hat declares: the proud boys.\n\nthe proud boys has been supportive of president trump and present in large numbers at stop the steal rallies in washington, dc. the proud boys' leader, henry tarrio, who goes by enrique tarrio, was released from police custody tuesday on charges related to allegedly burning a black lives matter banner taken from a black church last month during protests in the city after a stop the steal event. tarrio has admitted to cnn he did burn the banner. he was ordered by a local judge to stay out of dc as he awaits trial, including during this week's protests.\n\nkekistan flags\n\nthe green, white and black flag was created by some members of the 4chan online community to represent a made-up joke country named for kek, a fictional god they also created. it has long been present at right-wing and far-right rallies.\n\nthe kekistan flag is controversial because its design was partially derived from a nazi-era flag; this was apparently done on purpose as a joke, pitcavage explained. younger right-wingers coming from the 4chan subculture (both mainstream right and extreme right) often like to display the kekistan flag at rallies and events.\n\naltered historic flags\n\naltered confederate and gadsden flags were seen throughout the crowds at the capitol. one confederate battle flag variation included an image of assault rifle and the slogan come and take it to convey an anti-gun control message. the phrase come and take it paraphrases the come and take them retort uttered by spartan king leonidas at the battle of thermopylae when the persian king xerxes told him and his people to lay down their spears in return for their lives, pitcavage said.\n\nthe gadsden flag, which is known to many as the don't tread on me flag, is a traditional and historical patriotic flag dating to the american revolution. the flag and symbol are also popular among libertarians. but it also has been co-opted by right wing groups. pitcavage explains that while some fly it as a symbol for patriotism, others use it as a symbol of resistance to perceived tyranny.\n\noath keepers\n\na man is seen wearing an oath keepers hat inside the capitol after it was breached. the oath keepers is a pro-trump, far-right, anti-government group that considers itself part of the militia movement charged to protect the country and defend the constitution. the group tries to recruit members from among active or retired military, first responders, or police.\n\ntheir leader has spouted vast conspiracy theories on his blog, accused democrats of stealing the election, previously threatened violence if it was necessary on election day during an interview with far-right conspiracist alex jones and said his group would be armed to protect the white house if necessary, according to the adl.\n\nthe confederate flag\n\nduring the united states' long civil war, no confederate battle flag came within the shadow of the us capitol, but on wednesday, an insurrectionist carried one right through its halls.\n\nphotographers captured a man carrying it past the portraits of abolitionist charles sumner and slaveholder john calhoun.\n\nthe flag was always a symbol of support for slavery. after world war ii, it became a prominent symbol of jim crow and segregation, pitcavage says not surprisingly, it is a popular symbol among white supremacists -- even outside the united states.\n\namerica first flag\n\na rioter cloaks himself in an america first flag with the logo of the podcast by far-right commentator nick fuentes. fuentes attended the event at the capitol, but was photographed remaining outside the capitol building.\n\namerica first was also a slogan president trump used in describing his foreign policy . its adoption was criticized by the adl, which said it had an anti-semitic use seeking to keep the us out of world war ii.\n\nthe adl says fuentes is part of the groyper army, which the adl calls a white supremacist group.\n\nwhile the group and leadership's views align with those held by the white supremacist alt right, groypers attempt to normalize their ideology by aligning themselves with 'christianity' and 'traditional' values ostensibly championed by the church, including marriage and family, the adl explains. like the alt right and other white supremacists, groypers believe they are working to defend against demographic and cultural changes that are destroying the 'true america' -- a white, christian nation.\n\ncamp auschwitz\n\na rioter inside the capitol wore a camp auschwitz sweatshirt. the bottom of the shirt reads work brings freedom, which is the rough translation of the words arbeit macht frei on the gates of the nazi concentration camp. auschwitz was the largest and most infamous nazi concentration camp, where about 1.1 million people were killed during world war ii.\n\npitcavage says he believes the shirt came from the now-defunct website aryanwear. the design, which has been around for about 10 years according to pitcavage, has been popping up on differing websites in recent weeks, though it is often taken down when a complaint is made.\n\nnationalist social club stickers\n\na social media image shows nationalist social club stickers on what appears to be us capitol police equipment it's unclear when the photo was taken, but it was posted wednesday in a telegram chat the group uses, which includes a nazi symbol as part of their name.\n\nnsc, apparently a word play on the national socialists or nazi party, is a neo-nazi group that has regional chapters in both the united states and across the globe, according to the adl . it is unclear if the sticker on the right refers to a new england chapter, or because the group originally called itself the new england nationalists club.\n\nnsc members see themselves as soldiers at war with a hostile, jewish-controlled system that is deliberately plotting the extinction of the white race, according to the adl. their goal is to form an underground network of white men who are willing to fight against their perceived enemies through localized direct actions.\n\nmaga civil war january 6, 2021 shirts\n\nthere are still many questions about how exactly the attack on the capitol happened and who led the charge. but the calls for overthrowing the government and for a civil or race war have long been rallying cries in far-right circles.\n\nthe shirts worn by these men on the capitol grounds on wednesday show there was at least an intention to commemorate the day. they wore pre-printed shirts, referencing trump's signature make america great again slogan, alongside the words civil war and the date of the event that turned into insurrection.\n\nmany commenters in far-right forums have written since the attack, that this is just the beginning of that civil war that many of them have long desired.\n\nupdate note: this story has been updated with new cnn reporting on the men pictured in orange hats who say they are affiliated with the proud boys.
exxonmobil xom\n\na federal judge in manhattan on thursday dismissed exxon's lawsuit claiming officials in new york and massachusetts were pursuing bad faith investigations in violation of the oil giant's constitutional rights.\n\nus district judge valerie caproni called exxon's position implausible.\n\nexxon has asked two federal courts—first in texas, now in new york—to stop state officials from conducting duly-authorized investigations into potential fraud, she wrote. it has done so on the basis of extremely thin allegations and speculative inferences.\n\nexxon maintained in the lawsuit that the attorneys general in new york and massachusetts worked behind the scenes with environmental groups, who were attempting to promote litigation against fossil fuel companies. it also said the state officials tried to squash exxon's right to free speech and dissenting opinions on climate change.\n\nexxon did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the ruling.\n\nin a statement, new york attorney general eric schneiderman, who opened an investigation into exxon's historical knowledge of climate change in 2015, praised the decision.\n\nhe said the lawsuit wrongfully attempted to thwart a serious state law enforcement investigation into the company.\n\nschneiderman and massachusetts attorney general maura healey are investigating whether exxon, the world's largest publicly traded oil company, misled investors and the public about its knowledge of climate change and the potential effects that climate change may have on its business.\n\nharvard study: exxon 'misled the public' on climate change for nearly 40 years\n\nthe attorneys general are looking into whether exxon's past securities filings were misleading because they failed to disclose the company's internal projections regarding the potential costs of climate change and expected environmental regulations.\n\nexxon filed a lawsuit against the new york and massachusetts officials in 2016, claiming the probes were part of a conspiracy to silence and intimidate one side of the public policy debate on how to address climate change.\n\nexxon is also facing lawsuits from san francisco, oakland and other municipalities in california, which have demanded the company and its rivals pay billions of dollars to cover damage from looming sea level rise due to climate change.\n\nexxon gives up major climate change fight\n\nexxon argues that the california cities and counties have contradicted themselves by admitting in bond sales that climate change risks are unpredictable.\n\nfederal law requires companies and governments to reveal risks to investors before selling securities like stock or muni bonds.\n\nand in late 2017, after years of resisting, exxonmobil agreed to reveal the risks it faces from climate change and the global crackdown on carbon emissions.\n\nexxon said the disclosures will include how the company is positioning for a lower-carbon future and how its business could be hurt by shifting energy demands.\n\n--cnn's jackie wattles and matt egan contributed to this report

(cnn) — it's been a two-horse race this year to be named the world's most powerful passport, with both top contenders in asia.\n\ngoing into the final quarter of 2019, japan and singapore held onto their position as the world's most travel-friendly passports.\n\nthat's the view of the henley passport index , which periodically measures the access each country's travel document affords.\n\nsingapore and japan's passports have topped the rankings thanks to both documents offering access to 190 countries each.\n\nsouth korea rubs shoulders with finland and germany in second place, with citizens of all three countries able to access 188 jurisdictions around the world without a prior visa.\n\nfinland has benefited from recent changes to pakistan's formerly highly restrictive visa policy. pakistan now offers an eta (electronic travel authority) to citizens of 50 countries, including finland, japan, spain, malta, switzerland and the united arab emirates -- but not, notably, the united states or the uk.\n\nrelated content passports for purchase: open citizenship doors around the world\n\nthe european countries of denmark, italy and luxembourg hold third place in the index, with visa-free/visa-on-arrival access to 187 countries, while france, spain and sweden are in the fourth slot, with a score of 186.\n\nfive years ago, the united states and the uk topped the rankings in 2014 -- but both countries have now slipped down to sixth place, the lowest position either has held since 2010.\n\nwhile the brexit process has yet to directly impact on the uk's ranking, the henley passport index press release observed in july, with its exit from the eu now imminent, and coupled with ongoing confusion about the terms of its departure, the uk's once-strong position looks increasingly uncertain.\n\nthe united arab emirates continues its ascent up the rankings, up five places to rank 15th.\n\nit's the strongest climber this quarter, lorraine charles at cambridge university's centre for business research says in the october release.\n\nwhile the uae may not be able to compete with saudi arabia -- the regional hegemon -- in terms of military strength and economic power, the projection of its soft power is uncontested in the gcc.\n\nat the other end of the scale, afghanistan is once again at the bottom of the rankings, with its citizens needing a prior visa for all but 25 destinations worldwide.\n\ndr. christian h. kaelin, chairman of henley & partners and the creator of the passport index concept, says in the july release: with a few notable exceptions, the latest rankings from the henley passport index show that countries around the world increasingly view visa-openness as crucial to economic and social progress.\n\njapan has held onto the top spot throughout 2019. toshifumi kitamura/afp/getty images\n\nthe best passports to hold in 2019 are:\n\n1. japan, singapore (190 destinations)\n\n2. finland, germany, south korea (188)\n\n3. denmark, italy, luxembourg (187)\n\n4. france, spain, sweden (186)\n\n5. austria, netherlands, portugal (185)\n\n6. belgium, canada, greece, ireland, norway, united kingdom, united states, switzerland (184)\n\n7. malta, czech republic (183)\n\n8. new zealand (182)\n\n9. australia, lithuania, slovakia (181)\n\n10. hungary, iceland, latvia, slovenia (180)\n\nthe worst passports to hold\n\nseveral countries around the world have visa-free or visa-on-arrival access to fewer than 40 countries. these include:\n\n100. lebanon, north korea (39 destinations)\n\n101. nepal (38)\n\n102. libya, palestinian territory, sudan (37)\n\n103. yemen (33)\n\n104. somalia, pakistan (31)\n\n105. syria (29)\n\n106. iraq (27)\n\n107. afghanistan (25)\n\nother indexes\n\nhenley & partner's list is one of several indexes created by financial firms to rank global passports according to the access they provide to their citizens.\n\nthe henley passport index is based on data provided by the international air transport authority (iata) and covers 199 passports and 227 travel destinations. it is updated in real time throughout the year, as and when visa policy changes come into effect.\n\narton capital's passport index takes into consideration the passports of 193 united nations member countries and six territories -- roc taiwan, macau (sar china), hong kong (sar china), kosovo, palestinian territory and the vatican. territories annexed to other countries are excluded.
there were just two words i uttered after job offers early in my career: thank you.\n\ni never negotiated for more money. if i did think about it, i quickly worried that i would anger my future employer if i even asked.\n\nto prevent women from making that mistake and to help narrow the gender pay gap (women still make around 80 cents for every dollar a man makes), the american association of university women (aauw) is providing free salary negotiation workshops. over 30,000 women have completed them since 2015, according to the aauw.\n\nnow the goal is to train as many as 10 million women by 2022, by bringing workshops to more cities and states, and releasing a free online training tool, which will be available this summer. currently, workshops are available in boston, washington, dc; tempe, arizona; long beach, california; san francisco and various cities in massachusetts.\n\ni think too many women unfortunately just don't talk about this enough, said kimberly churches, chief executive officer of aauw. it's a muscle and it takes practice to learn negotiation skills and if you're not already in a sales job, that becomes even more trying.\n\nbased on a study conducted in boston, where aauw first started doing the workshops in collaboration with the boston mayor's office, the extra training helps. nearly half of the women who completed workshops in the first year either negotiated a pay raise at their existing job or a competitive starting salary at a new position, according to the report by the center for women in politics and public policy.\n\nrelated: #metoo and #timesup have pushed 48% of companies to review pay policies\n\nhourly workers are negotiating and receiving $2 to $3 more per hour and salaried workers are getting 20% to 30% higher salaries after the workshops, said churches.\n\nsabrina antoine, 29, attended a free workshop in her boston neighborhood. during the two hours, she learned how to define the values she brings to a company, conduct research to understand her value in the marketplace and practice asking for more in role play sessions.\n\nthe biggest piece about negotiating your salary for women particularly is that there is a sense of 'i am not enough' and so ... a lot of the training was around feeling comfortable taking the extra mile, said antoine, who is an account manager in a nonprofit working with banks.\n\nshortly after the training, antoine entered into negotiations for a new position in her organization. but first, she practiced by looking in the mirror, and doing a role play with a trusted colleague. she pushed for 40% more than she was currently making and then ended her pitch.\n\nthat's what they teach you in the training is 'say your piece and stop talking.' you don't have to fill the silence, said antoine, who ended up getting the 40% increase she asked for.\n\nrelated: equality at work sounds great but how do we get there?\n\na new survey shows how critical this training can be. forty percent of women have received salary increases of 5% or less in the past five years, which is below the cost of living increases during the same time frame, according to the sheknows media survey of nearly 1,500 working women in the us. nearly half of the women surveyed said women are less likely to ask for raises and promotions than men.\n\nto help women overcome their fears about negotiating, ashley pare, founder and chief executive officer of own your worth, which helps women grow and manage their careers, turns the tables and has them focus on what they are giving up.\n\ni flip it and i ask 'well what are the consequences if you don't ask? how much money are you leaving on the table? will you be able to pay your bills? will you have the life that you desire?'  said pare, who attended one of the workshops in 2015.\n\npare said she sometimes asked for more during her career in corporate human resources but that the workshop convinced her to stay in the game longer as she negotiated a new position.\n\nin the past, i would ask but i didn't persist, so after that first workshop i went to, it definitely gave me the confidence to ask for everything that i wanted and go back and forth a couple of times to land at a happy medium.\n\nshe now volunteers as a facilitator at aauw workshops in boston.\n\nemployers expect you to negotiate so it's ... knowing that you can and it's ok and you should because it's one way that we can help make a difference, said pare.

(photo by brendan smialowski / afp)\n\neditor's note: a version of this story originally published in january 2019.\n\n(cnn) —\n\nthe departure this week of president donald trump's acting defense secretary – who was subsequently replaced with another acting defense secretary – has underscored again the temporary nature of trump's cabinet.\n\nthe new acting pentagon chief, mark esper, joins acting counterparts at the department of homeland security, the us mission to the united nations, the federal emergency management agency, the office of management and budget, citizenship and immigration services, immigration and customs enforcement and the small business administration.\n\ninside the white house, trump's chief of staff mick mulvaney is also serving in an acting capacity. there hasn't been a white house communications director for months. and trump's press secretary recently announced her departure.\n\nacting gives you much greater flexibility. a lot easier to do things. so that's the way it is, trump said tuesday when asked about the number of acting officials in his administration.\n\nit's a sentiment he's expressed before – and one he's shown he's willing to see through.\n\nacross the government, almost 40% of key leadership positions that require senate confirmation are vacant, according to the partnership for public service, a nonprofit focused on good governance.\n\nwith the partial government shutdown on the verge of becoming the longest in history, an executive branch filled with temps and riddled with leadership vacancies is another sign that the federal government is not functioning as it should.\n\nthe president has sought to put a positive spin on the situation, telling reporters late last year that acting department heads give him more flexibility, yet there's a downside to that. not only does it strip congress of its oversight role in approving the president's top officials, experts say interim officials are limited in their ability to make long-term and strategic decisions because they are not likely to hold their positions.\n\npeople underestimate the corrosive effect it has, said max stier, president and ceo of the partnership for public service. it's like when you have a substitute teacher in your classroom. they aren't going to take on the tough issues.\n\nat his cabinet meeting jan. 2, as trump sat flanked by his top officials, viewers could be excused for not recognizing a lot of them. gone were familiar faces like former defense secretary james mattis, chief of staff john kelly, and interior secretary ryan zinke, all of whom resigned in december. in their place were a handful of relatively unknown interim agency heads, including patrick shanahan, the acting defense secretary, and david bernhardt, the temporary replacement for zinke at the interior department.\n\nshanahan, who trump said he would nominate to the permanent role, announced this week he was withdrawing from consideration due to family concerns. bernhardt was confirmed to the permanent post in april.\n\nwhile mulvaney is operating on an acting basis, that position does not require senate confirmation.\n\nthis is all the result of the record level of chaos and turnover among the president's top advisers and officials. ten cabinet-level officials, including two chiefs of staff, have left their roles in trump's administration so far. that compares with one cabinet-level departure each at the same point in barack obama's and george w. bush's first terms.\n\nas for the vacancies inside federal agencies, there are 260 unfilled leadership jobs, out of a total of 713, that require senate confirmation, according to the partnership for public service. that includes 61 open posts at the state department, 12 at the pentagon and 15 at the justice department. most of these unfilled jobs have official nominees awaiting confirmation in the senate.\n\nyou have an administration that got off to a very slow start filling its leadership positions, and continues to lag even now, said stier. the added element is the amount of turnover, especially at the top.\n\non wednesday, the white house sent six new nominations to the senate. that included formally nominating andrew wheeler to be permanent epa chief, two months after trump said he would do so.\n\nthe president's aides and allies say the lingering vacancies are in part a symptom of how difficult it has been for the administration to attract candidates to fill posts and the challenges in confirming them in a closely divided senate. they also blame the democrats.\n\npresident trump has a well-qualified, talented bench for senior officers that gives him the flexibility to pursue his positive agenda for the american people and the time needed to select appropriate replacements – even as the democrats continue to dither, delay and obstruct needed nominees, white house spokesman hogan gidley said in a statement in january.\n\nacting officials can serve in their posts for only 210 days, because of limitations set in the vacancies reform act. temporary leaders can have trouble rallying their employees and senior staff, who see them as without real power. they can also have a hard time developing relationships across the government, including with congress, undercutting their ability to get things done.\n\non capitol hill, republican lawmakers are cold to trump's suggestion that he can simply leave acting officials in their posts indefinitely.\n\nnot ok with that, oklahoma republican sen. james lankford said when asked about trump's reliance on acting heads for his agencies. we need to get senate-confirmed people in those positions.\n\nlankford said having acting secretaries has a significant impact because their authority can be more limited than that of senate-confirmed nominees. they can't execute all policy when they are acting, he told cnn. anytime you have an acting, they can't perform all the duties that a senate-confirmed appointee can.\n\naides say trump often polls a wide net of associates, friends and advisors to fill key roles in his administration, making the process of naming officials an unconventional affair.\n\nhe has repeatedly offered candidates jobs in spur of the moment decisions, while announcing the hiring and firing of other officials through his twitter feed.\n\nthis has left some nominees unprotected and facing a brutal vetting process with little preparation. his surprise announcement last year of dr. ronny jackson as veterans affairs secretary, for example, revealed accusations of misconduct during jackson's time serving as the presidential physician that eventually derailed his nomination.\n\nsimilar scenarios played out after trump announced he would nominate heather nauert as us ambassador to the un, and herman cain and stephen moore to seats on the federal reserve. all withdrew their names from consideration after damaging information came to light.\n\nand as departures have increased in trump's third year, the resources devoted to vetting potential candidates and publicly defending them have diminished.\n\ni think it's always better to have the advice and consent of the senate and have people that have been thoroughly vetted and confirmed, said texas republican sen. john cornyn.\n\nwith a government shutdown grinding business in washington to a halt, trump is likely to be set back even further.\n\ngovernment ethics officials who vet candidates are operating on a skeletal staff and the senate is unlikely to take on any other significant business while the shutdown remains in effect.\n\ncorrection: this story and graphic have been updated to correct the number of vacant positions at the pentagon.

it said.\n\nthe statement also clarified that although the night house has video surveillance cameras, they were not recording at the time, and are only activated when the zoo has newborn tiger cubs.\n\nwhy or how this could possibly occur is the subject of five ongoing investigations, including our own, aiken said in his statement.\n\nthe zoo said the afternoon that konwiser entered the enclosure, she was alone, which is in compliance with the nationalized standards from the association of zoos & aquariums.\n\ncnn's attempts to reach the zoo for further comments were not immediately successful.\n\nno guarantee 'cat won't kill you'\n\ndave salmoni, a large predator expert and tv host for animal planet, said there is no way to ever guarantee that a cat won't kill you.\n\nalmost never would you allow a keeper to have access to a dangerous predator … if she's given these keys then she has a history of perfect gate-locking procedure, he added.\n\nkonwiser had worked at the zoo for three years and was very experienced with tigers, zoo officials said.\n\nphoto: palm beach zoo stacey konwiser with her husband, jeremy konwiser.\n\nsalmoni said no matter the relationship between konwiser and the tiger, once she entered that enclosure, if this was something unusual, the tiger would have looked at her like a ball of yarn to play with.\n\nonce she started to struggle or moved quickly, that tiger's primal hunter instinct would have then come into play, he said.\n\nthreats against tiger\n\nthe rare tiger was one of four at the facility, held in a contained area where the animals are fed and sleep, carter said. the exhibit has surveillance cameras but is closed to the public, carter said. it is not known at this time whether there is surveillance footage of the incident.\n\nthe male tiger was tranquilized after the attack and remains at the facility. zoo officials have declined to provide information on the tiger, including its name.\n\nidentifying the animal only serves to stigmatize and potentially places the tiger in harm's way, the zoo said in a statement posted on its facebook page. it said it has received threats against the animal.\n\nthe tiger was off-exhibit at the time and no guests could see what happened, carter said. the tiger was never on the loose, contrary to early reports on social media, she said.\n\nother recent attacks by big cats\n\n• in january, a keeper was severely injured at an australian zoo founded by the late wildlife conservationist steve irwin.\n\n• last september, a keeper was attacked and killed by a a sumatran tiger at a zoo in hamilton, new zealand.\n\n• in june 2015, police shot and killed a white tiger that killed a man in tbilisi, georgia, after severe flooding allowed hundreds of wild animals to escape the city zoo.\n\n• in 2013, a 24-year-old woman working at a northern california animal sanctuary was mauled and killed by a lion.\n\n• in 2007, an escaped siberian tiger attacked and killed one zoo patron and injured two others in a cafe at the san francisco zoo.\n\n• in 2003, a white tiger attacked roy horn of siegfried and roy during a performance in las vegas. the tiger lunged at horn's neck about halfway through the show and dragged him off stage as audience members watched.\n\ncnn's keith allen and ralph ellis contributed to this report
(cnn) — there's hope: summer vacations abroad may happen in a big way this year.\n\nthe number of people busting out of their countries will start creeping up this spring and rise higher by mid-year, travel industry experts predict, as vaccines and risk-based safety measures are rolled out more widely and spiking coronavirus cases around the world begin to fall once again.\n\ni'm actually quite confident that first of may onwards ... we'll all be in a much better world, said paul charles, founder and ceo of london-based travel consultancy the pc agency\n\nvaccines and testing are the way forward, charles and other industry experts say, but what's needed perhaps as desperately is greater consistency and coordination across borders.\n\nwhen you don't have a coordinated global approach, it's very difficult for the industry to go forward, especially when you have the rules of the game changing basically every single day, said luis felipe de oliveira, director general of airports council international (aci), a global trade organization representing the world's airports.\n\ndeparture testing is one component of making travel safer during the pandemic. joseph okpako/getty images\n\nthere's a lot more work to be done in ironing out testing protocols that would allow globetrotters to opt out of quarantines and finding ways to smoothly and securely share vaccination and testing information across borders.\n\nsovereign nations still decide what's best for them individually, looking at their own health situations and economies, but progress has been made in getting countries to look more globally at the huge economic force that is travel.\n\nicao, aci, an alphabet soup of agencies, organizations and companies ( unwto wttc , the airlines and so on) have collaborated on numerous sets of guidelines and global recommendations aimed at making travel safer, easier and less confusing for a world of consumers starving for a change of scene.\n\naci's de oliveira says that the summer rebound could mean international air traffic reaching 50% to 60% of previous levels in most countries.\n\nhere are some of the hurdles travelers and the industry will need to get over as travel picks up:\n\nrelated content 21 places to go in 2021\n\neliminating quarantines\n\nmandatory -- and shifting -- quarantine requirements basically are killing the process to restart the industry, de oliveira said.\n\nwhen he spoke to cnn travel, de oliveira was on day 12 of a 14-day quarantine in montreal after returning home from a business trip to the dominican republic followed by a personal trip to mexico. he has quarantined four times in the past seven months, spending 56 days at home without the possibility of going out.\n\nthat kind of time investment, along with the confusion around requirements -- both going and coming home -- are big deterrents for people who might otherwise be willing to travel. safety is essential, but those in the industry are advocating for a more nuanced, layered approach.\n\ntravelers at a hotel in melbourne, australia in december had to quarantine after returning from overseas. william west/afp/getty images\n\na test-out mechanism is needed to avoid quarantines, says tori emerson barnes, executive vice president of public affairs and policy at the national nonprofit u.s. travel association, which has been advocating for a science-driven, risk-based approach to reopening international travel in particular looking at the elimination of quarantines if you have the right testing protocol in place.\n\nwhile vaccines will be critical, de oliveira and others say the travel industry absolutely cannot afford to wait to ramp up until vaccinations are fully administered globally, making testing an essential part of the equation for safer travel in the near-term.\n\nrelated content how risky is flying during a pandemic? what we know and how to make it safer\n\nbarnes mentioned a two-tiered regimen of testing 72 hours before departure and again upon arrival as one possible standard, and she cited a testing pilot program in hawaii -- where a 10-day quarantine can be bypassed on most islands with negative test results -- as an example of where testing out of quarantine has generated demand.\n\nwhile u.s. travel would encourage people to get vaccinated and to test out in places that require quarantines, the association isn't looking for blanket requirements for access, barnes said. we wouldn't say that you have to have a vaccine to travel.\n\nshe acknowledges that determining who is responsible for creating and implementing consistent protocols is a challenge. the government doesn't necessarily want to, she said, and i don't know that the private sector should have that responsibility.\n\nyet countries and organizations around the world are making progress in coordinating common approaches, says alessandra priante, regional director for europe at the world tourism organization (unwto), a specialized agency of the united nations.\n\na coordinated way of testing is already being implemented in numerous cases, and the next step at a global level is tracing, priante says, to make sure that we're able to share a certain amount of data, because if we don't share the data, then we are not really able to have all the information that we should have.\n\nthe travel industry can't afford to wait until vaccines have been distributed globally to ramp up. patrick t. fallon/afp/getty images\n\ngetting vaccinated ... and proving it\n\nsome of that information likely would pertain to vaccinations. the united kingdom's vaccination program is well under way. other countries have also made significant progress, and the united states' program is slowly ramping up.\n\ntraveler confusion may well ramp up, too, as more people start moving around in the spring and additional requirements come into play for negative tests and proof of vaccination.\n\naustralia, for example, just announced that it will require negative pcr covid tests for all travelers, and airline qantas has suggested that all international passengers may soon be required to have a vaccination certificate.\n\nwe'll need a harmonized global approach to recognizing and accurately and safely sharing vaccination and testing information, de oliveira said.\n\ncurrent practices -- involving printed paper documents from unknown labs in languages that may be unfamiliar to those inspecting them or a tangle of unconnected databases across the world -- are less than ideal.\n\nthat's why aci supports the use of health apps such as commonpass , a tool that would allow travelers to share lab results and vaccination records without revealing other personal health information. the international air transport association (iata) is also working on a digital travel pass platform\n\neven when vaccines do become widely available, not everyone will take them and researchers are looking at whether the virus could be still be transmitted by vaccinated people. masking, social distancing, sanitation and other safety layers will still be part of daily life -- and travel -- for a long time to come.\n\ntravel bubbles -- like the anticipated two-way corridor between new zealand and australia -- are among the tailored measures aimed at restoring some international travel. jorge fernández/lightrocket/getty images\n\nmeasures in the meantime\n\nseamless international travel won't happen overnight.\n\neven as we wait for declines in coronavirus cases and more global coordination around safer, less confusing cross-border travel, destinations and corporations increasingly are rolling out their own interim solutions.\n\ndelta air lines is trying out a handful of covid-tested, quarantine-free flights to the netherlands. these flights employ a combination of the gold-standard pcr testing with preboarding rapid antigen testing.\n\nde oliveira sees rapid antigen testing as a potential aid in the industry's recovery. while considered less accurate , antigen tests are also much quicker and less expensive than molecular tests as one layer of risk management.\n\niceland and hungary have embraced the concept of immunity passports, allowing people to enter who have already been infected with covid-19 and recovered.\n\ntravel bubbles, such as a much-anticipated, two-way corridor between new zealand and australia , allow people to travel back and forth between countries without quarantining.\n\nunfortunately like most things covid-related, these measures are subject to change.\n\ncorridors can be useful if they're consistent, but again, they've been up and down, opening and shutting at short notice and that has not helped consumers at all, said paul charles, the travel industry consultant.\n\nultimately, travelers would like to get back to safely mixing and mingling with the rest of the world. robin utrecht / stringer / getty\n\nthe great goal: mingling with strangers\n\nthe unwto's priante is hoping the ups and downs level out soon because the world is missing out.\n\nwhat i regret the most is that all that tourism is about, which is to trust the unknown ... the beauty of exploring, of meeting somebody you've never met before from another culture, another nation, is all sort of on hold and at stake because people are telling us 'don't trust anyone, cross the sidewalk, wear your mask, don't mingle,'  she said from her home in madrid.\n\nand while priante and her colleagues have taken every precaution and continued to travel and work to address the global crisis that is threatening livelihoods in the industry, she wants to see more people traveling safely.
washington (cnn) -- the u.s. supreme court ruled monday the federal government has the power to keep some sex offenders behind bars indefinitely after they have served their sentences if officials determine those inmates may prove sexually dangerous in the future.\n\nthe federal government, as custodian of its prisoners, has the constitutional power to act in order to protect nearby (and other) communities from the danger such prisoners may pose, justice stephen breyer wrote for the 7-2 majority.\n\nat issue was the constitutionality of federal civil commitment for sex offenders who are nearing the end of their confinement or who are considered too mentally incompetent to stand trial.\n\nthe main plaintiff in the case, graydon comstock, was certified as dangerous six days before his 37-month federal prison term for processing child pornography was to end. comstock and the others filing suit remain confined at butner federal correctional complex near raleigh, north carolina.\n\nthree other inmates who filed suit served prison terms of three to eight years for offenses ranging from child pornography to sexual abuse of a minor. another was charged with child sex abuse but was declared mentally incompetent to face trial.\n\nall were set to be released nearly three years ago, but government appeals have blocked their freedom. the government says about 83 people are being held under the civil commitment program.\n\ncorrections officials and prosecutors determined the men remained a risk for further sexually deviant behavior if freed. the inmates' attorneys maintain the continued imprisonment violates their constitutional right of due process and argue congress overstepped its power by allowing inmates to be held for certain crimes that normally would fall under the jurisdiction of state courts.\n\nthe law in question is the 2006 adam walsh child protection and safety act, which includes a provision allowing indefinite confinement of sex offenders. a federal appeals court in richmond, virginia, ruled lawmakers had overstepped their authority by passing it, prompting the current high court appeal.\n\nthe statute is a 'necessary and proper' means of exercising the federal authority that permits congress to create federal criminal laws, to punish their violation, to imprison violators, to provide appropriately for those imprisoned and to maintain the security of those who are not imprisoned but who may be affected by the federal imprisonment of others, breyer wrote.\n\nbreyer equated the federal civil commitment law to congress' long-standing authority to provide mental health care to prisoners in its custody, if they might prove dangerous, whether sexually or otherwise.\n\nin dissent, justice clarence thomas said the federal government overstepped its bounds.\n\ncongress' power, however, is fixed by the constitution, thomas wrote. it does not expand merely to suit the states' policy preferences, or to allow state officials to avoid difficult choices regarding the allocation of state funds. he was joined by justice antonin scalia.\n\nthe case represented a victory for the federal government and the woman who argued the case on its behalf, solicitor general elena kagan. president obama nominated kagan last week to serve on the supreme court.\n\na key lawmaker behind the adam walsh act applauded the ruling.\n\nthe court's holding today is a victory on behalf of the american people, said sen. patrick leahy, d-vermont, chairman of the senate judiciary committee.\n\nthe process to enact this law to protect our children from those who would do them harm was difficult. i am heartened to see an overwhelming majority of the supreme court uphold this important child protection law.\n\nthe justices in april 2009 had blocked the imminent release of dozens of sex offenders who had served their federal sentences after the obama administration claimed many of them remain sexually dangerous. chief justice john roberts ordered the men be kept in custody while the case worked its way to the high court.\n\nmost violent sex offenses are handled at the state level, and at least 20 states run programs in which sexual predators are held indefinitely or until they are no longer considered dangerous. the federal government's civil commitment program is relatively new.\n\nthe adam walsh act was named after the son of john walsh, host of tv's america's most wanted.adam walsh was kidnapped and murdered by a suspected child molester in 1981.\n\nthe act also increased punishments for certain federal crimes against children and created a national registry for sex offenders. those aspects of the bill were not being challenged in this case.

[my husband and i have] been married 30 years in september. we raised three boys together. we have a happy marriage, but we're very strong-minded people and have learned when something is non-negotiable.\n\namong those non-negotiables? dyson hair dryers and bathrobes from ikea -- both things that brown herself swears by and uses at home. she spent years traveling the world for her work and considers herself an expert on what hotels are doing right -- and what they're doing wrong.\n\na few of her favorite things\n\nwhile the expensive dyson hair dryers will have to be signed out from the front desk to prevent thievery, brown had a very specific idea of which things guests would need in grabbing distance, namely coffee -- so there are nespresso coffee makers in every room to prevent pre-caffeinated guests from having to interact with other humans.\n\nbrown, who loves the soho house hotels around the world and opts for boutique stays over big-name brands with loyalty programs, also wanted to keep things personal. since she has strong reactions to fragrances, she chose a delicate peppermint lavender scent for all the in-room toiletries, and has a policy against using perfumes or room sprays in common areas.\n\njust like home: many of the george's interiors come from brown's home goods line with lord & taylor. lesley unruh\n\nwe're very hands-on people, brown says about why the hotel project suited her and plofker so well.\n\ni get into the details. we're going to be serving breakfast and brunch both to hotel guests and the community, we'll have an afternoon tea and smoothies. it matters what yogurt we serve. i will be curating everything, brown says. it's a small hotel, so it's about customer experience and accommodating.\n\nand customer-friendly service doesn't just extend to guests of the human persuasion. brown, a dog lover, has made the george extremely animal-friendly. not only are there special doggie treats and beds, but travelers can pick out their pup's accessories (such as a food bowl) ahead of time when they make their reservation so that everything in the room will be ready to go upon arrival.\n\nanother challenge for brown and plofker was negotiating montclair's quirky local laws. the town has a very small number of liquor licenses, which can make it tough for a new bar or restaurant to open.\n\nwhile the george does not have one of those licenses, brown has come up with creative ways to bring booze onto the property, such as having a favorite local wine store host on-site tastings. (the licenses are portable, which works out nicely.) her team can also arrange for deliveries to individual guest rooms.\n\nthe hotel's small size also makes it easy to accommodate specific dietary needs, from gluten-free to diabetic-friendly.\n\nthe one thing the george will never have, though? a spa.
j. scott applewhite/ap\n\nharvard professor alan dershowitz, a member of president trump's legal team, offered a new defense of the president's actions with ukraine, while answering senators' questions.\n\nin a nutshell, dershowitz argued that a us president is allowed to orchestrate a quid pro quo with a foreign leader to benefit their own re-election campaign, if they also believe that their re-election is in the national interests of the united states.\n\ndershowitz said: every public official that i know believes that his election is in the public interest. and mostly you're right — your election is in the public interest. and if a president did something that he believes will help him get elected, in the public interest, that cannot be the kind of quid pro quo that results in impeachment.\n\nthese comments could normalize the type of behavior that landed trump in the middle of an impeachment scandal, and which democrats say constitutes an improper solicitation of foreign influence into a us election.\n\ndershowitz offered this argument in response to a question from republican sen. ted cruz about the legality of a quid pro quo. dershowitz said all elected officials make decisions through a political lens, and often hire pollsters to see how their decisions would play out.\n\ntrump's legal team does not concede that he attempted a quid pro quo. dershowitz was speaking hypothetically. in his defense of trump this week, dershowitz has relied on controversial theories that are rejected by a wide cross-section of legal scholars.\n\nhow democrats responded: democrats later criticized dershowitz, saying his theory would open the door to rampant abuses from future presidents.\n\nthey also rebutted dershowitz's claims that presidents oversee this-for-that deals with foreign leaders all the time, in furtherance of their personal interests. when vice president joe biden pushed for the dismissal of a top ukrainian prosecutor, he was acting in accordance with established us policy, and promoting the views of international organizations like the imf. trump's team has argued, without providing credible evidence, that biden actually did this to protect his son's corruption in ukraine.\n\nwhat sets trump's behavior apart is that there is substantial evidence that withholding the ukraine aid was not in accordance with official us policy toward ukraine. defense secretary mark esper and secretary of state mike pompeo, along with then-national security adviser john bolton, all lobbied trump to release the aid before he relented in september. additionally, the nonpartisan government accountability office determined trump's decision to withhold the appropriate funds violated the law.\n\ntrump's lawyers argued that only the president sets foreign policy, not his advisers or lower-level diplomats
story highlights idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is a chronic, progressive lung disease with poor prognosis of nine patients, seven died during the reported 16-year period\n\n(cnn) —\n\na cluster of cases of a progressive lung disease occurred among dentists and other dental workers treated at one virginia care center, according to thursday's morbidity and mortality weekly report from the us centers for disease control and prevention.\n\nof nine patients, referred to as a cluster, seven died during the reported 16-year period. the disease, called idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, is a chronic, progressive lung disease with a poor prognosis. the cause is unknown.\n\na cluster is a term used to define a collection of cases grouped in place and time that are suspected to be greater than the number expected, dr. randall j. nett, lead author of the study and medical officer with the us public health service, explained in an email.\n\nin this case, among 894 patients treated for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis at the virginia hospital, nine patients – or 1% – were identified as dentists or dental technicians. this number was about 23 times higher than expected, nett said.\n\nall the cluster patients – eight dentists and one dental technician – were men, with an average age of 64. though the reason for illness has not been identified, occupational exposures are possible, nett and his colleagues wrote.\n\ndentists and other dental personnel have unique exposures at work, nett said. these exposures include bacteria, viruses, dusts, gases, radiation, and other respiratory hazards.\n\none of the surviving cluster patients reported polishing dental appliances and preparing impressions without using a mask or other protection, according to the report. during these tasks, a dental worker would have been exposed to silica and other compounds with known or potential respiratory toxicity.\n\nat this time, we do not know what caused this cluster of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis cases in dental personnel, said nett, who recommended that workers wear certified respiratory protection if the ability to improve ventilation is not practical or effective.\n\nmore work has to be done before we can make any conclusions about the risk dentists or other dental personnel have, nett said. cdc will follow up on this newly recognized cluster.\n\nabout 650,000 dental personnel work throughout the nation, he said.\n\ndr. paul casamassimo, chief policy officer of the american academy of pediatric dentistry's pediatric oral health & research center, said the new report is not surprising.\n\nfor years, dentists have been exposed to plaster and dust from drilling, in addition to the toxic substances listed in the report. the cluster patients were all older, so they may not have been using the most up-to-date practices for personal protection and safety, he noted.\n\nwe do work with materials and with human bioproducts that are potentially damaging to our bodies if we inhale them, casamassimo said. younger dentists are taught differently than in the past, so they know to delegate certain work or procedures to laboratories that meet more safe and stringent ventilation requirements, he said.\n\nfollow cnn health on facebook and twitter see the latest news and share your comments with cnn health on facebook and twitter.\n\ntoday, dental personnel also have required protections from the occupational safety and health administration and the national institute for occupational safety and health, he said.\n\nhis own father was an old-school dentist.\n\nmy father passed away at 79, casamassimo said. though his father did not die of pulmonary fibrosis, he had respiratory problems.\n\nthis probably has been more common than we have known in the past, he said.

with us and see how they stack up.\n\nchase sapphire preferred: best overall travel rewards card\n\nwhy it's great in one sentence: the chase sapphire preferred earns 2 ultimate rewards points for every dollar you spend on travel and dining purchases, and the points can be redeemed for travel and other eligible categories at 1.25 cents per point, or transferred to the program's airline and hotel partners for potentially even more valuable redemptions.\n\nthis card is right for: people with larger than average travel and/or dining expenses (including food delivery) who want a low-fee card with basic transferable points.\n\nhighlights:\n\nearn 2 points for every dollar spent on travel and dining purchases.\n\nearn 1 point per dollar on all other purchases.\n\npoints can be redeemed for travel through the chase ultimate rewards travel portal at a rate of 1.25 cents per point.\n\nnow through april 30, 2021, points can also be redeemed for purchases at grocery stores, dining establishments and home improvement stores at a rate of 1.25 cents per point.\n\npoints can also be transferred to any of chase's 13 airline and hotel partners.\n\nno foreign transaction fees.\n\n$95 annual fee.\n\nsign-up bonus: earn 60,000 bonus points after you spend $4,000 on purchases in the first three months from account opening.\n\nwhat we like about the chase sapphire preferred: it may not seem like it, but at over 10 years old, the chase sapphire preferred is practically the granddaddy of travel credit cards. with classic travel and dining bonus categories, 5 points per dollar on lyft rides and a 60,000-point sign-up bonus, it should be easy to quickly score plenty of points, especially since most food delivery services will code as dining on the csp and earn 2 points per dollar.\n\ncard holders also get a complimentary dashpass subscription for at least one year, and for a limited time from november 1, 2020, through april 30, 2021, you can earn 2 points for every dollar spent at grocery stores using the chase sapphire preferred, up to $1,000 in purchases each month.\n\nrelated: chase sapphire credit cards earn bonus points on groceries for a limited time.\n\nbut the real power of the sapphire preferred is in its redemptions. you'll get 1.25 cents per point when redeeming points through the chase ultimate rewards travel portal, and can get potentially even more value when transferring points to one of chase's 13 travel partners. in fact, the ultimate rewards program still features some of the best transfer partners, including united airlines, southwest airlines and hyatt hotels, and all chase partners transfer at a 1-to-1 ratio.\n\nchase also added new redemption options to the sapphire preferred in 2020. the issuer's pay yourself back feature allows you to redeem points on purchases beyond just travel. the current eligible categories are grocery stores, dining establishments (including delivery and takeout) and home improvement stores. through april 30, 2021, you'll get 1.25 cents per point when redeeming this way.\n\nto top it off, when travel resumes, you'll be able to safely use the sapphire preferred overseas, since it has no foreign transaction fees on international purchases. it even provides primary car rental insurance, so you don't have to look to your own auto policy first if you have an accident with your rental car.\n\nphoto: istock you'll get primary car rental insurance with the chase sapphire preferred.\n\nwhat could be better: the chase sapphire preferred is a classic, but in some ways it's starting to get long in the tooth. other credit cards now offer bonus points or cash back in those same travel and dining categories, and in some cases at higher rates (though usually accompanied by higher annual fees).\n\neven our benchmark citi double cash card earns 2% on all purchases (1% when you buy, plus 1% when you pay it off) and not just on travel and dining, though you can get more value when redeeming your sapphire preferred points than you can with simple cash back.\n\nfor many people, the sapphire preferred isn't as flashy as its older sibling, the chase sapphire reserve, which comes with travel perks, higher bonus rates and a $300 annual travel credit (but also a much higher annual fee). but if you don't need or won't use all those extra perks — especially right now with travel so limited — you may be better off with this significantly less expensive version.\n\nwhere it beats our benchmark card: travel and dining bonus categories, excellent travel protections, solid airline and hotel partners and sign-up bonus.\n\nwhere our benchmark card is better: the citi double cash has no annual fee, an introductory rate on balance transfers and easy cash back.\n\nread cnn underscored's chase sapphire preferred credit card review.\n\nlearn more and apply for the chase sapphire preferred card.\n\namerican express gold: best pandemic travel card\n\nwhy it's great in one sentence: the american express gold card earns tons of valuable amex travel points on practically all the food-related purchases you're making while you're not traveling, and the credits available on the card nearly offset its annual fee.\n\nthis card is right for: people who can utilize all of the card's various credits and who are currently spending significant money at restaurants, on food delivery services or at us supermarkets while they're not on the road.\n\nhighlights:\n\nearn 4 points for every dollar you spend at us supermarkets (up to $25,000 per year in purchases, then 1x).\n\nearn 4 points per dollar at restaurants worldwide.\n\nearn 3 points per dollar for flights booked directly with airlines or on amextravel.com.\n\nearn 1 point per dollar on everything else.\n\nup to $120 in annual dining credits.\n\nup to $120 in uber cash annually.\n\n$250 annual fee.\n\nterms apply.\n\nwelcome bonus: earn 60,000 bonus points after you spend $4,000 on purchases in the first six months after opening the account.\n\nwhat we like about the american express gold: calling it our best pandemic travel card may sound odd, but the amex gold is a perfect choice if you want to earn as many travel points as possible during the pandemic, and then have lots of ways to use those points on trips after the pandemic ends.\n\nfirst, with the amex gold, you'll earn 4 points for every dollar you spend on restaurants worldwide, and on up to $25,000 in annual purchases at us supermarkets (1 point per dollar thereafter). most food delivery services count as restaurants on this card, so that means the vast majority of your food purchases will earn 4x points, regardless of how you're eating right now.\n\nyou'll also earn 3 points per dollar when you book airfare directly with an airline, so if you're looking to jump on any sales for flights later in the year, you can pay for them with the amex gold and earn extra points on those as well.\n\nthe points earned on this card are american express membership rewards points, which are extremely useful. you can redeem them directly for flights via amex travel at 1 cent each, but if you put in some extra effort and research, you can potentially get much more value from them by transferring them to any of amex's 21 airline and hotel partners, which include delta air lines, jetblue, marriott and many more.\n\nthen there are the annual credits. while the amex gold has a substantial $250 annual fee, you can earn almost as much from the card's credits as you pay for it.\n\neach year you have the amex gold, you get up to $120 in dining credits, which can be used for purchases at grubhub, seamless, the cheesecake factory, ruth's chris steak house, boxed and participating shake shack locations. these are doled out in portions of up to $10 each month, but the credits don't roll over from month to month, so you must use them or lose them.\n\nthen, amex has also added up to $120 in uber cash each year to the amex gold. again, these credits come in $10 monthly installments and can be used either for uber rides or on uber eats orders. that's up to $240 in annual credits, which would leave you with an effective annual fee of only $10 if you can use them all.\n\nphoto: istock you'll get up to $10 each month in uber cash with the american express gold card.\n\nwhat could be better: the one big downside of the amex gold is that most of the annual credits come in monthly installments rather than annual chunks, so you'll need to make sure you can take advantage of them each month to make the card worth it.\n\nalso, while amex points are valuable, they're best used for the airline and hotel transfer partners, which take some time to understand and flexibility to maximize. if you'd prefer to just book flights through a standard online travel portal, you might be better off with one of the chase or capital one cards, which can offer more value when redeeming rewards the easy way.\n\nwhere it beats our benchmark card: welcome bonus, annual credits, bonus categories and solid airline and hotel partners.\n\nwhere our benchmark card is better: the citi double cash has no annual fee, an introductory rate on balance transfers and easy cash back.\n\nread cnn underscored's american express gold card review.\n\nlearn more and apply for the american express gold card.\n\nchase sapphire reserve: best for travel purchases\n\nwhy it's great in one sentence: the hugely popular chase sapphire reserve comes with a high price tag but also a $300 annual travel credit, airport lounge access, a $60 annual doordash credit in 2021, a massively increased earning rate when you use lyft and 3 points for every dollar you spend on travel and dining.\n\nthis card is right for: people who make lots of travel purchases, even in their daily lives while they're not on the road right now.\n\nhighlights:\n\n$300 annual travel credit.\n\nearn 3 points for every dollar you spend on dining purchases.\n\nearn 3 points per dollar on travel purchases (after using your $300 travel credit each year).\n\nearn 10 points per dollar on lyft purchases through march 2022.\n\nearn 1 point per dollar on all other purchases.\n\npoints can be redeemed for travel through the chase ultimate rewards travel portal at a rate of 1.5 cents per point.\n\nnow through april 30, 2021, points can also be redeemed for purchases at grocery stores, dining establishments and home improvement stores at a rate of 1.5 cents per point.\n\npoints can also be transferred to any of chase's 13 airline and hotel partners.\n\n$60 annual doordash credit in 2021.\n\nup to two years of free dashpass membership.\n\none free year of lyft pink membership.\n\ncomplimentary priority pass select airport lounge membership.\n\nno foreign transaction fees.\n\n$550 annual fee.\n\nsign-up bonus: earn 50,000 bonus points after you spend $4,000 on purchases in the first three months from account opening.\n\nwhat we like about the chase sapphire reserve: when it first launched in 2016, the chase sapphire reserve was an instant hit, thanks in part to its broad travel and dining categories. it's incredibly easy to earn bonus points with the card, since dining includes almost every restaurant, fast food and even food delivery services such as seamless.\n\na $60 annual doordash credit further adds to the card's value, especially right now. if you can utilize it along with the travel credit, you're left with an effective annual fee of just $190. and like the sapphire preferred, you'll also get bonus points at grocery stores from november 1, 2020, through april 30, 2021, with the sapphire reserve, but at an even higher rate of 3 points per dollar, up to $1,000 in purchases each month.\n\nthe ability to redeem points you earn with the card for any flight or hotel at a rate of 1.5 cents per point via the chase ultimate rewards travel portal makes the card's rewards easy to use, though you'll potentially get even more value if you can dive into the more advanced airline and hotel transfer partners.\n\nalso, like the sapphire preferred, chase added its new pay yourself back feature to the chase sapphire reserve, which allows you to redeem points on purchases beyond just travel. the current eligible categories are grocery stores, dining establishments (including delivery and takeout) and home improvement stores, and through april 30, 2021, you'll get 1.5 cents per point when redeeming this way.\n\nrelated: new redemption options added to the chase sapphire reserve.\n\nand if you plan to fly regularly once travel resumes, you'll find solid value in the card's priority pass select airport lounge membership, with access for you and up to two guests to over 1,200 lounges around the world.\n\nphoto: american express visit the plaza premium lounge at london heathrow, part of the priority pass select network.\n\nwhat could be better: while the high cost of the chase sapphire reserve was easy to justify for the last several years, it increased its annual fee from $450 to $550 at the start of 2020, so you really need to be able to use all of the card's perks for the price to make sense, which can be difficult given the current worldwide travel situation.\n\nthe lyft bonus category means you'll earn an impressive 10 points for every dollar you spend on the ride-sharing service, but it won't be of any use to most people who aren't currently using lyft. the same goes for the added doordash annual credit and free dashpass membership, which are only valuable to folks who order food for delivery and have doordash service in their area.\n\nand while the travel and dining bonus categories were market-leading four years ago, there are now other credit cards with similar if not even better earning rates in those categories, such as the amex gold, which earns 4 points per dollar on restaurant purchases worldwide. or, if the annual fee increase on the sapphire reserve is too much to stomach, consider the cheaper chase sapphire preferred with fewer travel perks but only a $95 annual fee.\n\nwhere it beats our benchmark card: easy-to-use travel credit, travel and dining bonus categories, excellent travel protections, solid airline and hotel partners, and sign-up bonus.\n\nwhere our benchmark card is better: the citi double cash has no annual fee, an introductory rate on balance transfers and easy cash back.\n\nexplore whether the chase sapphire reserve is worth the annual fee.\n\nlearn more and apply for the chase sapphire reserve.\n\namerican express platinum: best luxury travel perks\n\nwhy it's great in one sentence: it's definitely not cheap, but the famous american express platinum card is a heavyweight when it comes to travel perks, with numerous annual credits; access to more than 1,200 airport lounges worldwide, including amex's own centurion lounges and delta sky clubs when flying delta; elite status with hilton, marriott, hertz, avis and national car rental; and many other luxury travel benefits.\n\nthis card is right for: people who want top-notch luxury travel perks, refundable travel credits and transferable travel rewards.\n\nhighlights:\n\nearn 5 points for every dollar you spend on flights booked directly with airlines or with american express travel.\n\nearn 5 points per dollar on prepaid hotels booked on amex travel.\n\nearn 1 point per dollar on all other purchases.\n\npoints can be redeemed for travel through amex travel at a rate of up to 1 cent per point.\n\npoints can also be transferred to any of amex's 21 airline and hotel partners.\n\nup to $200 in statement credits annually for incidental fees at one selected qualifying airline.\n\nup to $100 in statement credits annually for purchases at saks fifth avenue.\n\nup to $15 in statement credits every month ($35 in december) when you pay for your uber rides with the card.\n\ncomplimentary access to american express centurion lounges , delta sky clubs when flying delta, and priority pass airport lounges (not including priority pass restaurants).\n\ncomplimentary gold elite status with hilton and marriott hotel chains.\n\ncomplimentary preferred elite status with hertz, avis and national car rental chains.\n\ncomplimentary shoprunner membership.\n\naccess to american express fine hotels & resorts.\n\nno foreign transaction fees.\n\n$550 annual fee.\n\nterms apply.\n\nwelcome bonus: earn 75,000 bonus points after you make $5,000 in eligible purchases in your first six months.\n\nwhat we like about the american express platinum: for an annual fee of $550 a year, you need to be able to really take advantage of the perks of this card to make it worth the cost. while that's difficult in the current environment, when travel returns to normal, you'll feel like a true vip.\n\nthe amex platinum has access to literally thousands of airport lounges, including amex's own centurion lounges, which are considered some of the best domestic airport lounges in the us. to many road warriors, this benefit is worth the cost of the card all by itself.\n\nbut if you can also take advantage of the card's up-to-$200 annual incidental airline fee credit as well as the up-to-$200 annual uber credit, plus the up-to-$100 saks fifth avenue credit (which you can use to buy anything at saks, either in-store or online), you'll be scoring up to $500 worth of annual credits for a card that costs $550 a year.\n\nspeaking of those credits, the uber credit can also be used on uber eats purchases, which means you can still take advantage of them even if you aren't using ride-share services at the moment. same goes for the saks fifth avenue credit, which can be used on anything you buy at saks' online website.\n\nrelated: how to take advantage of your expensive travel credit card when you can't travel.\n\nthe cherry on top is the 75,000-point welcome bonus after you spend $5,000 on the card in your first six months, which at the very least you should be able to redeem for a pair of domestic airline tickets for you and a companion, or even a trip to europe in coach for yourself.\n\nphoto: istock use your amex platinum bonus to score a pair of domestic airline tickets.\n\nwhat could be better: surprisingly, the american express platinum isn't a terrific card when it comes to earning points. it's strong when you're booking airline tickets, since you'll earn an impressive 5 points for every dollar you spend directly with airlines. but to earn 5 points per dollar at hotels, you'll need to book only prepaid hotels, and only through amex travel. for such an expensive card, those aren't exceptional bonus categories.\n\nthe credits on the amex platinum can also be a challenge to maximize. unlike travel credits on cards such as the chase sapphire reserve, the up-to-$200 airline incidental fee credit is only good on the one airline you choose each year, and then only for certain fees like checked baggage or in-cabin pet fees.\n\nthe up-to-$200 annual uber credit doesn't come as one big credit but instead as a monthly series of $15 credits, with an extra $20 in december to get to the $200 total. even the saks fifth avenue credit is split in two, with $50 available in the first six months of the calendar year and the other $50 in the second half.\n\nin the end, the amex platinum isn't really designed for everyday use. rather, you need to be a regular traveler with a desire to be treated better during those long days on the road for the cost of the card to make sense in the long term.\n\nwhere it beats our benchmark card: luxury travel perks and travel credits, airline and hotel bonus categories, solid travel protections, extensive airline and hotel partners, and welcome bonus.\n\nwhere our benchmark card is better: the citi double cash has no annual fee, an introductory rate on balance transfers and easy cash back.\n\nread cnn

once travel resumes, the southwest rapid rewards priority credit card is an easy win, as its annual credits, perks and points can easily offset its annual fee.\n\nthis card is right for: people who want a card that offers elite perks when flying southwest.\n\nhighlights:\n\nearn 5 points for every dollar you spend on southwest purchases between december 1, 2020, and march 31, 2021, on up to $2,000 spent per month.\n\nearn 2 points per dollar on all other southwest purchases.\n\nearn 1 mile per dollar on all other purchases.\n\n$75 southwest travel credit each year.\n\nfour upgraded

the southwest priority card: if you're already a fan of southwest, you'll really enjoy the perks that come with the southwest priority card. but right now is also the perfect time to take advantage of the card's sign-up bonus to earn the airline's coveted southwest companion pass.\n\nthe companion pass is an elite travel benefit that allows another passenger to fly with you for free on southwest (plus taxes) an unlimited number of times. normally, earning the pass requires earning 125,000 qualifying points in a calendar year. that's a massive amount of flying on southwest, which you likely aren't doing right now.\n\nbut for a limited time, the airline is including a companion pass valid through february 28, 2022, for all new card applicants who spend $5,000 on the southwest priority card in the first three months after opening the account. that's an incredible deal, and one you should grab if you have a friend or family member you'd like to travel with later in 2021.\n\nrelated: use this credit card offer to fly your companion for free for an entire year.\n\nyou'll also get some truly great perks with the southwest priority card. the biggest one is a $75 southwest travel credit every year, which can be used toward any southwest flight purchase — just pay for your flight or taxes on your southwest card and you'll receive a statement credit up to $75. use the credit every year and you've already recouped half of the card's annual fee.\n\nthe southwest priority card also offers four upgraded boarding certificates annually. this means you can purchase an a1-15 boarding position at the gate (if available), giving you the opportunity to board the plane before most other passengers, and you'll receive a statement credit for the amount charged.\n\nyou'll also get 20% back on in-flight drinks and wi-fi purchases on southwest, and 7,500 bonus points at each card anniversary. those points are worth $113 on wanna get away fares, so this card very easily pays for itself as long as you're flying southwest every year.\n\nphoto: istock the southwest priority card offers excellent perks for southwest flyers.\n\nwhat could be better: while southwest flyers can get great value from the perks on the southwest priority card, you probably won't want to use it as your everyday spending card. southwest points are worth approximately 1.5 cents per point when booking southwest's lowest wanna get away fares, so while you're earning a terrific 7.5% return on the temporary southwest 5x bonus category through the end of march, you're only getting a 1.5% return on everything else.\n\nyou'd be better off putting your daily purchases on our benchmark citi double cash card and getting 2% cash back on everything — 1% when you buy it, and another 1% when you pay it off — and utilizing other credit cards with stronger bonus categories or more flexible travel rewards when you can.\n\nwhere it beats our benchmark card: sign-up bonus and travel perks on southwest.\n\nwhere our benchmark card is better: the citi double cash has no annual fee, an introductory rate on balance transfers and easy cash back.\n\nlearn more and apply for the southwest rapid rewards priority credit card.\n\nwhy it's great in one sentence: the world of hyatt credit card features a solid set of bonus categories and earns points in the most valuable hotel loyalty program around while at the same time offering complimentary hyatt discoverist elite status and the ability to earn even higher levels of elite status even if you can't travel at the moment.\n\nthis card is right for: people who routinely stay at hyatt hotels under normal travel conditions, especially those chasing hyatt elite status.\n\nhighlights:\n\nearn 4 points for every dollar you spend at hyatt hotels.\n\nearn 2 points per dollar on dining and on airlines tickets purchased directly from the airlines.\n\nearn 2 points per dollar on local transit and commuting, and on fitness club and gym memberships.\n\nearn 1 point per dollar on all other purchases.\n\ncomplimentary world of hyatt discoverist elite status and 5 qualifying night credits every year.\n\nreceive 2 qualifying night credits per $5,000 spent.\n\nreceive 1 free night at any category 1-4 hyatt each year after your first card holder anniversary.\n\nno foreign transaction fees.\n\n$95 annual fee.\n\nsign-up bonus: earn 60,000 bonus points — 30,000 bonus points after you spend $3,000 on purchases in the first three months from account opening, plus 2 bonus points for every dollar you spend on purchases that earn 1 bonus point, up to $15,000 in the first six months of account opening.\n\nwhat we like about the world of hyatt credit card: hyatt's loyalty program remains by far the best of all the major hotel chains, which makes the world of hyatt credit card our pick for the one hotel credit card to include on our best travel credit cards list.\n\nyou can earn boatloads of hyatt points with this card and still get great value when redeeming hyatt rewards, including stays at top-notch properties like the park hyatt new york or at the hyatt ziva and hyatt zilara all-inclusive resorts.\n\nyou'll also get automatic hyatt discoverist elite status just from having the card, which is the lowest-level elite status but still gets you perks such as 10% bonus points on your hyatt stays, elite check-in, premium internet and a late 2 p.m. checkout where available. and the hyatt card can put you on the way to earning higher-level explorist or globalist elite status — card holders get 5 elite night credits every year just from having the card.\n\nbut the icing on the cake starts one year after you first open the card — you'll receive a free night at any category 1-4 hyatt property every year at your card anniversary when you pay the new year's annual fee. that's perfect timing since travel is likely to have significantly recovered by then.\n\nphoto: hyatt hotels stay at the park hyatt sydney using points earned with the world of hyatt credit card.\n\nwhat could be better: while the bonus categories on the world of hyatt credit card are useful, it's important to remember that chase's ultimate rewards program includes hyatt as a transfer partner, meaning that points you earn with cards such as the chase sapphire preferred or chase sapphire reserve can be turned into hyatt points as well as other airline or hotel points, making them more flexible than just regular hyatt points.\n\nso if you have a card like the sapphire reserve, you'll do better using it on some purchases instead of the hyatt card. for instance, you'll earn 3 points per dollar on dining with the csr versus just 2 points with the hyatt card (and you'll have more options when it comes to redeeming chase points).\n\nthe one major downside to hyatt is that it's a much smaller chain than the big players such as hilton and marriott, which can make it difficult to find a convenient hyatt hotel in some smaller cities. however, the chain has made promising attempts to improve this situation in recent years by partnering with other hotel groups such as small luxury hotels of the world, allowing you to use hyatt points at a greater variety of properties.\n\nhyatt was also originally scheduled to add peak and off-peak redemption rates to its award chart last year, meaning properties would have become more expensive to redeem points for during high-demand times (though also cheaper in low-demand periods). however, the chain announced those changes are delayed until sometime in 2021.\n\nwhere it beats our benchmark card: sign-up bonus, decent bonus categories and travel perks at hyatt.\n\nwhere our benchmark card is better: the citi double cash has no annual fee, an introductory rate on balance transfers and easy cash back.\n\nlearn more and apply for the world of hyatt credit card.\n\nwhy it's great in one sentence: you'll earn 2 capital one miles per dollar on every purchase with the capital one venture credit card, and you can redeem those miles for any travel purchase you make at 1 cent per mile, or transfer them to capital one's airline partners for potentially even more valuable redemptions.\n\nthis card is right for: people who want to travel for free, using easily redeemable miles, but with the option to learn how to master transferable miles down the line for even greater value.\n\nhighlights:\n\nearn 2 miles per dollar on all purchases with no limit.\n\nredeem miles for any travel purchase at a rate of 1 cent per mile.\n\nnow through april 30, 2021, redeem miles for food delivery and streaming services at a rate of 1 cent per mile.\n\nmiles can also be transferred to any of capital one's 15 airline partners.\n\nup to $100 credit when applying for global entry or tsa precheck.\n\nno foreign transaction fees.\n\n$95 annual fee.\n\nsign-up bonus: earn 60,000 bonus miles when you spend $3,000 on purchases in the first three months after opening the account.\n\nwhat we like about the capital one venture: some people want easy-to-redeem travel rewards. others don't mind more complicated redemptions that can increase the value of their miles. the capital one venture card gives you the best of both worlds.\n\nfor folks who don't want to deal with complex charts or award availability, you can use the venture's purchase eraser feature. it uses miles you've accumulated to pay off any travel purchases that you make with the card at a rate of 1 cent per mile, making the 60,000-mile sign-up bonus worth at least $600 in travel.\n\neven better, for a limited time now through april 30, 2021, you can also use the purchase eraser on food delivery and streaming services along with travel purchases. so your miles can still be redeemed for the same value even while travel is halted.\n\nfor others who want to put in the time and research to find first- or business-class flight redemptions when travel returns, capital one's 15 airline transfer partners provide another option. you can transfer miles to most of those partners at a 2-to-1.5 ratio (meaning for every 2 venture miles you transfer, you'll get 1.5 airline miles on the other end), while emirates, singapore air and accor hotels transfer at a 2-to-1 ratio.\n\ncapital one removed the first year annual fee waiver on the venture card, so you're paying $95 a year right from the start. but you'll still get up to a $100 fee credit when applying for either global entry or tsa precheck and no foreign transaction fees.\n\nphoto: istock use the capital one venture to take your family on a beach vacation.\n\nwhat could be better: there's only one bonus category on the capital one venture — you'll earn 5 miles per dollar on hotels or car rentals, but only when you book them through capital one travel. unfortunately, you likely won't get elite credit or have your elite benefits honored when booking a hotel through a travel portal instead of directly with the hotel. it also doesn't have trip cancellation or interruption coverage, which is somewhat unusual for a travel credit card.\n\nif you're only planning to redeem your miles using the purchase eraser, you could be better off with our benchmark citi double cash card, which earns 2% cash back on everything — 1% when you make a purchase, 1% when you pay it off — since you'll be effectively earning 2 cents in rewards for every dollar you spend either way, but the venture card has a $95 annual fee.\n\ncapital one's transfer partners also include only one us airline option (jetblue), though advanced card holders will be able to leverage international airline alliances to score domestic redemptions. but if you think you'll mix in some airline transfers, even down the line, the venture card serves as a great beginner gateway to the world of transferable points.\n\nwhere it beats our benchmark card: sign-up bonus, purchase protections and travel protections.\n\nwhere our benchmark card is better: the citi double cash has no annual fee and an introductory rate on balance transfers.\n\nread our complete capital one venture credit card review.\n\nwells fargo propel american express: best travel protections for no annual fee\n\nwhy it's great in one sentence: the wells fargo propel amex features a unique combination of strong bonus categories, easy-to-redeem points, an introductory interest rate on purchases and balance transfers, solid travel protections, no foreign transaction fees and even cell phone protection coverage, all for no annual fee.\n\nthis card is right for: people who spend significant money on dining, travel (including gas) and certain streaming services, and want to earn travel rewards for no annual fee.\n\nhighlights:\n\nearn 3 points for every dollar you spend on dining and travel.\n\nearn 3 points per dollar on gas stations, ride-shares and transit.\n\nearn 3 points per dollar on popular streaming services\n\nearn 1 point per dollar on all other purchases.\n\ncell phone protection coverage.\n\n0% interest on all purchases for the first 12 months (14.49% to 24.99% variable afterward).\n\n0% interest for 12 months on balance transfers made in the first 120 days after you open the card (14.49% to 24.99% variable afterward).\n\nbalance transfer fee of 3% of each transaction (minimum $5).\n\nno foreign transaction fees.\n\nno annual fee.\n\nsign-up bonus: earn 20,000 bonus points when you spend $1,000 in purchases in the first three months.\n\nwhat we like about the wells fargo propel: while we've included it on our best travel credit cards list, the wells fargo propel amex is similar to a cash back card, since its points can be redeemed at 1 cent per point whether it's for travel, gift cards, as a statement credit or even for cash at a wells fargo atm.\n\nbut the card has a great mix of features, including a slew of useful 3x bonus categories that cover many everyday purchases, and the fact that it doesn't rely as heavily on travel as the other cards on our list could make it more valuable in the current climate.\n\nyou'll also find a 0% introductory interest rate on both purchases and balance transfers on the wells fargo propel, though be sure to clear your debt within 12 months, because after that the rate jumps to a variable 14.49% to 24.99%, depending on your creditworthiness.\n\nyou'll get many enhanced travel protections — such as travel accident insurance, car rental damage coverage and lost luggage insurance — that will be useful when travel resumes. and even while you're not on the road, you'll be covered for up to $600 in the event your cell phone is stolen or damaged (subject to a $25 deductible), so long as you pay your cell phone bill with the propel amex. it's a surprisingly robust set of benefits and perks on a card that has no annual fee.\n\nphoto: istock you're covered with the wells fargo propel amex if your cell phone is stolen or damaged.\n\nwhat could be better: the major feature missing from the wells fargo propel is the ability to transfer points to airline or hotel programs — instead, you can only redeem the points for travel using the issuer's go far rewards travel portal. (however, there's one way to increase the value of your points: if you also have the wells fargo visa signature® card, you can transfer your points between the cards and redeem them for airfare at 1.5 cents per point through the visa signature.)\n\nyou'll also want to be sure the bonus categories make sense for you based on your spending habits versus a flat-rate everyday card. the propel amex is also missing a few high-end travel protections like trip delay and trip interruption coverage, but frankly, for a no-annual-fee card, these are minor omissions.\n\nwhere it beats our benchmark card: bonus points for travel, dining and streaming services, travel protections, cell phone protection, an introductory rate on purchases and sign-up bonus.\n\nwhere our benchmark card is better: the citi double cash has a longer introductory period on balance transfers (18 months) and the option to convert its cash back to transferable thankyou points if you also have the citi premier℠ card or citi prestige®.\n\nthe information for the wells fargo propel amex card and the wells fargo visa signature card has been collected independently by cnn underscored. the card details on this page have not been reviewed or provided by the card issuer.\n\nwhy it's great in one sentence: one of the few no-annual-fee credit cards with both transfer partners and easy-to-redeem direct redemptions, the capital one ventureone features a lower earning rate than its more expensive sibling but offers the same solid redemption options.\n\nthis card is right for: people who like the features of the capital one venture but are willing to exchange a lower everyday earning rate for no annual fee.\n\nhighlights:\n\nearn 1.25 miles per dollar on all purchases with no limit.\n\nredeem miles for any travel purchase at a rate of 1 cent per mile.\n\nmiles can also be transferred to any of capital one's 15 airline partners.\n\n0% interest on all purchases for the first 12 months (15.49% to 25.49% variable afterward).\n\nno foreign transaction fees.\n\nno annual fee.\n\nsign-up bonus: earn 20,000 bonus miles after spending $500 on purchases in the first three months after opening the account.\n\nwhat we like about the capital one ventureone: usually when there are two versions of the same credit card — one with an annual fee and another without — you can expect the no-annual-fee one to be a fairly stripped-down offering. but that's not necessarily the case with the capital one ventureone.\n\nmost of the features of the more expensive capital one venture remain intact on the ventureone, including the same 1 cent per mile redemption value when using the card's purchase eraser to wipe out any travel charge (as well as food delivery and streaming services between now and april 30, 2021), access to the same airline and hotel transfer partners at the same transfer ratios, the same travel and purchase protections, and even the same no foreign transaction fees.\n\nthe main two downsides of the ventureone are a reduced 1.25 miles earned for every dollar you spend (instead of the 2 miles you get on the venture) and only a 20,000-mile sign-up bonus, albeit with a lower minimum spending requirement of just $1,000 in purchases in the first three months you have the account. depending on how much value you can get from these two features, you may want to consider the ventureone with no annual fee and most of the best perks.\n\nphoto: istock miles earned with the capital one ventureone can be redeemed for any travel purchase.\n\nwhat could be better: unless you're going to take advantage of capital one's transfer partners, you'd be better off with our benchmark citi double cash card over the ventureone. that's because you're only earning 1.25 miles per dollar with the capital one ventureone, and you only get 1 cent per mile when redeeming them using the purchase eraser, meaning you're effectively getting a return of 1.25 cents per dollar spent, while the citi double cash earns 2 cents per dollar spent.\n\nthat equation changes if you can utilize the transfer partners when travel gets rolling again, since you can score a higher redemption rate than just 1 cent per mile if you do your homework. but if you're ready for that more advanced step, you're probably better off starting with the more powerful capital one venture card anyway, especially since the $95 annual fee on that card is more than offset by its bigger sign-up bonus.\n\nin the worst-case scenario, you can always try the venture card for a year and get the sign-up bonus, then convert it to a no-annual-fee ventureone after the first year if you still aren't using all its features (though keep in mind you won't get a second sign-up bonus for converting).\n\nwhere it beats our benchmark card: sign-up bonus, purchase protections and travel protections.\n\nwhere our benchmark card is better: the citi double cash has an introductory rate on balance transfers.\n\nread our complete capital one ventureone rewards card review.\n\nwant a credit card that covers you when you're traveling? check out cnn underscored's guide to the best credit cards with

(cnn) north korean leader kim jong un said his country is developing new weaponry including a nuclear-powered submarine, tactical nuclear weapons and advanced warheads designed to penetrate missile defense systems.\n\nin comments published saturday, kim said north korea is pushing ahead with the armaments to deter the united states, comments that appear to show president donald trump's strategy of high-level engagement with pyongyang -- including three historic in-person meetings between trump and kim -- failed to convince pyongyang to stop its pursuit of a modern nuclear arsenal.\n\nno matter who is in power in the us, the true nature and the true spirit of the anti-north korea policy will never change, kim said, according to the country's state-run korean central news agency (kcna).\n\nthe development of nuclear weapons be pushed forward without interruption.\n\nthe projects, according to kim, are at various stages of development. he said multiple-warhead guidance technology is in the final stage, while studies in hypersonic flight that could be applied to new ballistic missiles are complete, with north korea making preparations for their test and production -- a possible sign that pyongyang may be on the verge of resuming the type of missile testing anathema to washington and seoul.\n\nimprovements in tactical nuclear weapons -- which are meant to be used at shorter range and are often less destructive than strategic nuclear weapons -- are also being finalized, kim said. nuclear-powered submarine research appears to be the least far along. research into these subs is complete and in the final stages of examination, kim said.\n\nin this photo provided by the north korean government, north korean leader kim jong un attends the party congress in pyongyang, north korea, on tuesday.\n\nread more

(cnn) —\n\nmichigan state university fostered a culture that was more focused on protecting the school than the survivors of serial abuser larry nassar, a report released thursday by the michigan house of representatives said.\n\nstate lawmakers conducted their own investigation of msu's handling of complaints against the former sports doctor to identify possible policy solutions. the house sent their findings to law enforcement for consideration in the michigan attorney general's investigation of msu's handling of the nassar case.\n\nphoto: jeff kowalsky/afp/afp/getty images larry nassar\n\nthe attorney general appreciates the work done by the michigan house of representatives, the attorney general's office said in a statement. the investigative team will be reviewing the report.\n\nthe report marks the first time the state legislature has commented publicly on the nassar case. it is one of many steps taken by lawmakers and law enforcement to figure out how multiple institutions failed hundreds of nassar's victims – many of them minors – for over 30 years. nassar was sentenced to 40 to 125 years in prison for his crimes in both ingham and eaton counties.\n\nmichigan state spokeswoman emily guerrant said the university will continue cooperating with lawmakers to create improvements and changes with the hopes of preventing tragedies like this from ever happening again.\n\nthese are some of the report's findings:\n\n243 people have reported nassar to msu since 2014\n\nfrom 2014 to the present, 243 people reported abuse to the michigan state university police department, according to the report. most of those who reported abuse were minors at the time.\n\nthe house report also noted that 91 other title ix complaints were filed against nassar since rachel denhollander filed a title ix complaint against him in 2016. denhollander spoke to the indianoplis star in 2016, and, after her interview, many others came forward to tell their own stories of sexual assault and harassment at the hands of nassar.\n\nmsu 'failed to properly investigate'\n\namanda thomashow, a former msu student, filed a title ix complaint against nassar in 2014. the school conducted an investigation and determined that nassar's conduct did not violate the school's sexual harassment policy.\n\nbut the house report states that msu failed to properly investigate thomashow's complaint for a number of reasons.\n\nfor one, the investigation was based on flawed testimony from biased medical experts, the report said. each expert worked with nassar or knew him personally, and nassar handpicked one of them, according to the report.\n\nmoreover, the experts' explanations were fallacious at best and only provided circular justifications for what nassar claimed were legitimate medical treatments, the report states.\n\nthe report also points out that thomashow received a different final report than nassar. thomashow's report did not include the new requirements nassar would need to follow when practicing similar procedures on patients. nassar's did. the discrepancy demonstrates an office culture more focused on protecting the institution than survivors, the report states.\n\nmsu 'defiantly' stands by its 2014 investigation\n\nthe report notes that msu continues to defiantly and wrongfully maintain it did not mishandle the 2014 title ix investigation. msu still defends the conclusions of their 2014 investigation, arguing that the facts of thomashow's case were materially different from a later investigation, which reached the opposite conclusion, the report states.\n\nnassar didn't keep medical records on everything\n\nmedical records for many of what nassar called his treatments were not kept, the report found. in the medical records that were kept, they didn't include any mention of or reference to the more sensitive parts of his treatments, like intravaginal penetration.\n\nin other cases, msu destroyed medical records of people who reported abuse or harassment to msu police later, but they were all destroyed in accordance with state law and msu's record retention policy, according to the report.\n\nnassar grew more comfortable with abuse over time\n\nwhile nassar initially took more care to make his treatments seem medically appropriate when he began these treatments in the 1990s, as time went on, he grew more comfortable with his conduct. initially, nassar would explain the procedure and demonstrate on a pelvic model.\n\nby the 2000s, he would only mention to victims that he was going to adjust the pelvic bones. by 2014, he felt comfortable enough to abuse his patients without any prior explanation when performing the treatment, according to the report.\n\nby 2016, he was self-assured enough to readily admit to investigators that he 'does not get written consent from the patient before treatment' and even testified that 'unless the patient stops him, he is assuming the patient understand.' \n\nmsu sexual assault and harassment policies are changing\n\nmsu has changed a number of policies and procedures regarding sexual harassment and assault since nassar was suspended from msu in 2016. the office of institutional equity, the office within the university that handles title ix complaints, only had three staff members in the 2014-2015 academic year, the staff increased to

repealing and replacing obamacare not only would change health coverage and costs for tens of millions of americans, it would also give a juicy tax gift to the rich.\n\nrolling back obamacare would provide a nearly $1 trillion tax cut that would disproportionately benefit the wealthy and businesses.\n\nbut if republican repeal efforts fail, house speaker paul ryan signaled tuesday that no one should expect lawmakers to include those tax cuts in tax reform.\n\nif the health care bill doesn't pass, then that trillion dollars of obamacare taxes ... we won't incorporate those in tax reform, ryan said on cnbc's power lunch.we will have to put those off to the side and they will have to be gotten to when we get to health care reform.\n\ngiven how hard repealing obamacare has been so far, there's little reason to assume it will get much easier. so for all intents and purposes those taxes will stand indefinitely. they include a high-income medicare surtax on investment income and on wages over $200,000 ($250,000 if married).\n\nthe likely reason why tax writers have decided to leave obamacare tax cuts off the agenda is cost, plain and simple. it would make their efforts to reform the tax code that much more expensive and therefore harder to pay for. and they will need to pay for it as a condition for passing it with a simple majority in the senate.\n\nadding $1 trillion to the cost of the tax bill would make it even harder to make it revenue neutral. as it is, it's a heavy lift, said roberton williams, a senior fellow at the tax policy center.\n\nrelated: who pays if congress kills the state and local tax deduction\n\ntax reform will be a heavy lift for many reasons. for starters, there are still big disagreements within the republican party itself as to how low tax rates should be and whether it's even necessary to pay for tax cuts.\n\nif they're not paid for, not only would tax reform add substantially to deficits, but under senate rules, they would expire at the end of the budget window instead of becoming permanent, which is what ryan wants.\n\nthe white house has been in regular talks with leaders and top tax writers in the house and senate to come up with a framework for a tax reform bill they can all agree on.\n\ndespite what many skeptics believe, ryan on tuesday said after a speech before the national association of manufacturers that he's confident there will be a tax reform bill on the floor this fall and passage by the end of the year.

(cnn) the rev. raphael warnock , the senior pastor of ebenezer baptist church in atlanta, will be the first black senator from georgia, cnn projected early wednesday, a repudiation of republican sen. kelly loeffler and her adherence to president donald trump.\n\nthe democratic party appears closer to retaking the us senate, as georgia republican david perdue narrowly trails in his fight to keep his seat against democratic candidate jon ossoff. both candidates claimed they would win after all the ballots had been counted, but cnn has not yet called the race.\n\nwarnock is the first georgia democrat elected to the senate in 20 years, and his election is the culmination of years of voter registration drives conducted by former state house democratic leader stacey abrams and other activists. president-elect joe biden also won georgia, the first time for a democratic presidential candidate since the 1990s.\n\ni am an iteration and an example of the american dream, the senator-elect told cnn's john berman wednesday morning on new day. he added, when i think about the arc of our history, what georgia did last night is its own message in the midst of a moment in which so many people are trying to divide our country, at a time we can least afford to be divided.\n\nafter no georgia senate candidate received 50% of the vote in november, the races turned to two runoffs. while ossoff and warnock ran on a unity ticket, trump refused to concede his own loss, sparking a fight within the republican party and disenchanting some of his supporters, who believed his false claims that the vote was rigged.\n\ntrump's ongoing onslaught against the republican officials in charge of the elections pressured the two gop senators to make a choice: join the president in seeking to overturn the democratic outcome or risk losing trump supporters, some of whom have become disenchanted with the electoral process. trump recently appeared to pressure georgia secretary of state brad raffensperger on a private call, urging him to find enough votes to reverse the results. raffensperger refused.\n\nbut despite three recounts and no evidence of widespread fraud, loeffler and perdue decided to join the president in objecting to congress' certification of the electoral college's results in a final, deluded display of devotion to trump supporters.\n\nthe american people deserve a platform in congress, permitted under the constitution, to have election issues presented so that they can be addressed, said loeffler in a statement on monday.\n\nasked if it was appropriate for her to vote against certification of the electoral votes, warnock told cnn wednesday that his opponent has consistently put what she perceives to be her own short-term political interests over the concerns of ordinary people.\n\nwhat is unfolding in the senate today or in the house, what's unfolding in this moment is a distraction. it's a distraction, he told berman. these senators know better and the people that i'm talking to all across georgia are concerned about their lives.\n\nwhile georgia is a rapidly diversifying state, the republican candidates came into the senate runoff elections with an advantage.\n\nin november, perdue received over 88,000 more votes than ossoff, while loeffler and the other republican candidates received more votes than warnock and the other democratic candidates in the special election (warnock received most of the vote -- 33% -- overall).\n\nrepublicans hoped their message that georgia should be a check on washington would prove successful, noting that if warnock and ossoff win, biden, house speaker nancy pelosi and senate democratic leader chuck schumer will be in charge.\n\nwe're talking about the future of the country, and we can't just turn it all over to one party, said eric tanenblatt, who served as chief of staff to former republican georgia gov. sonny perdue, before election day. that could be wishful thinking on my part. but i do think that that's going to be a big motivator.\n\nbut republicans are worried that trump's unwillingness to concede jeopardizes the party's hold on the senate, even though the state has not elected a democrat to the chamber since 2000.\n\nheath garrett, a campaign manager for former georgia republican sen. johnny isakson, told cnn that trump's attacks on gov. brian kemp and raffensperger were counterproductive for trying to motivate grassroots, base republicans to go vote, and said they've threw perdue and loeffler off message in the final days of the campaign.\n\nsenator perdue and senator loeffler are being whipsawed by the president on one side and by the democratic money on the other side, he said.\n\nperdue and loeffler had attempted to avoid the intraparty feud sparked by trump by focusing on ossoff and warnock.\n\nperdue's closing message in a recent video was littered with attacks, saying that if republicans lose, undocumented immigrants will vote, americans' private health insurance will be taken away, and democrats will pack the supreme court and defund the police.\n\nwe win georgia, we save america, perdue told the camera.\n\nthe democratic candidates counter that they would demilitarize rather than defund the police, create a legal pathway for undocumented immigrants and support a public option to decrease the number of uninsured. neither democratic candidate has advocated adding justices to the court.\n\nthey argued they would do a better job ending the health care crisis over the coronavirus, which has infected more than 20.8 million americans and killed at least 354,000, in order to reopen the economy. they've pushed policy goals, including debt-free public college and a new voting rights act. and they've attacked the republican senators for their multi-million dollar stock transactions during the pandemic, alleging that they profited off it. the senators have denied any wrongdoing.\n\nwarnock told cnn wednesday that he believes tackling the pandemic by effectively distributing the vaccine and passing $2,000 stimulus checks should be the new senate's top priority.\n\nthe special election was particularly brutal, starting last year when gop rep. doug collins forced loeffler, who kemp appointed to the role in 2019, into a race to the right.\n\nafter no candidate received 50% of the vote, the runoffs turned even more vicious, as loeffler portrayed warnock an anti-police marxist who would destroy america in the senate.\n\nwe have to have georgians come out and vote because we know that chuck schumer's radical agents of change are raphael warnock and jon ossoff, said loeffler on the campaign trail monday. they would defund the police. they would lock down our economy. and we have to make sure that we hold the line right here in georgia.\n\nwarnock has in turn promoted his background from the savannah projects to the pulpit of martin luther king jr.'s historic church, while firing back at loeffler.\n\nkelly loeffler spends tens of millions of dollars to scare you, said warnock in an ad. she's trying to make you afraid of me because she's afraid of you. afraid that you understand how she's used her position in the senate to enrich herself and others like her. afraid that you'll realize that we can do better.\n\nperdue, a 71-year-old former fortune 500 ceo, has dismissed ossoff, a 33-year-old media executive, saying the democrat does not know how to create a job. at their debate in the fall, ossoff called the senator a crook who was fending off multiple federal investigations for insider trading while attacking the health of the people who he represents. perdue snapped back that the democrat had worked for the mouthpiece of terrorism and communist china -- claims ossoff called ridiculous.\n\nthe georgia us senate races have attracted enormous attention due to the stakes for the first years of the biden administration and the state's shift from red to purple. dr. charles bullock, a university of georgia political science professor, told cnn that the senate elections could be the first in which urban georgia casts more votes than rural georgia.\n\nwe've seen tremendous enthusiasm in the early voting numbers, both in person and by mail, and we know that while democrats will have a lead when polls open ... republicans are expected to have a strong election day, said seth bringman, a spokesman for fair fight action, a voting rights organization founded by abrams.\n\npolitical groups spent about $520 million to advertise in the two runoff races, according to kantar media/cmag, averaging more than $8 million per day. republicans outspent democrats by tens of millions of dollars.\n\nwith the senate on the line, trump rallied his supporters in northwest georgia on monday, while president-elect joe biden held an event in atlanta.\n\nbiden said electing ossoff and warnock would end the gridlock in washington and allow congress to provide $2,000 stimulus checks to americans. trump urged the state to elect perdue and loeffler, and claimed that biden would not take the white house.\n\nwe're going to fight like hell, said the president.\n\nthis story has been updated with additional developments wednesday.

(photo by chip somodevilla/getty images)\n\neditor's note: fernand fernandez is the interim president and ceo of the united states hispanic chamber of commerce, the country's largest hispanic business association. the opinions expressed in this commentary are his own.\n\n(cnn) —\n\nlast september, when president trump moved to phase out the deferred action for childhood arrivals (daca) program, congress was given until march 5 to pass a permanent, legislative solution. this week, that deadline passed. were it not for a federal judge's ruling that the program must at least temporarily continue, 800,000 daca recipients would be at risk of deportation.\n\nphoto: sheryl lanzel fernand fernandez\n\nthough the termination of daca has been delayed by the federal court, the legal stability of daca status is not guaranteed. the ruling that is protecting daca recipients could be overturned by an appeal process, just as the executive order that created the program was subsequently overturned with a change in presidential administration. in order to permanently secure the legal status of dreamers, daca or a similar act must be enacted as law.\n\nour leaders in congress have an excellent opportunity to pass a bipartisan solution that has the overwhelming support of the american public. in fact, a poll last september by abc/washington post shows that 86% of americans want dreamers to stay. instead of wrongfully conflating the fate of dreamers with totally separate issues such as national security, our elected officials should be jumping at the chance to create substantive, meaningful change just before the 2018 midterm elections.\n\ndaca has long been framed as a humanitarian issue. the moral case is clear. the individuals who immigrated to the united states as children did not intentionally violate immigration law and should not be punished for the actions of their parents. they have grown up in american schools, pledged allegiance to the american flag and are contributing to the american workforce. the united states is the only home they know.\n\nat the united states hispanic chamber of commerce, we recognize that daca is also an economic issue. the contributions of dreamers to our economy cannot be overstated. they contribute over $40 billion each year to our gross domestic product (gdp), according to a report from the american action forum.\n\ndaca-eligible immigrants pay $2 billion each year in state and local taxes, according to a report from the institute on taxation and economic policy. one study indicates that 97% of daca recipients are in school or employed.\n\namerica depends on dreamers, many of whom give back to their communities. approximately 9,000 daca recipients are serving as teachers. an additional 14,000 work in health care services. to threaten the legal status of daca recipients is not only a disservice to the individuals contributing to our economy and society, but also to the greater united states.\n\nthe state of arizona, for example, has approximately 27,000 daca recipients. if arizona's daca recipients were forced to leave, the state's gdp would drop by $1.3 billion. if texas's 124,300 daca recipients were deported, texas gdp would drop by nearly $6.3 billion. california – the state with the largest daca population of 222,795 –would suffer a gdp loss of over $11 billion without its daca recipients.\n\na daca solution is the path forward for a prosperous american future. while march 5 no longer marks the official end of daca, it should remain a call to action for the white house and members of congress. we ask that our leaders in government save the partisan fighting for actual partisan issues and take this opportunity to show the american people that our elected officials are willing to come together to craft legislation that supports the shared interests of all americans.\n\nget our free weekly newsletter sign up for cnn opinion's new newsletter.\n\njoin us on twitter and facebook\n\nthis is a crucial moment for washington – a chance to demonstrate to the american people that our government still works and that our leaders can still lead.\n\nbut, most importantly, this is a crucial moment for dreamers, the bright, young individuals who do not wish to live in the shadows. their futures rest in the hands of our elected officials, and we ask that they be granted the security to permanently live, work and learn in the united states – their only home.
alabama, which is one of the most profitable college football programs in the country, defends its title against clemson on monday night.\n\na win could bring in even more money for the school.\n\nthe crimson tide's football program reported $103.9 million in revenue for 2016 and posted a $47 million profit. that's up 3.6% from last year.\n\nticket sales account for a big chunk of those earnings, and another championship title will probably mean even stronger ticket sales for next season.\n\nmerchandise revenue will also get a big boost -- alabama has a lucrative deal with collegiate licensing company. it's netted $98 million in royalties since the company was founded in 1981 by alabama's current athletic director, bill battle. alabama was the company's first client and is its top seller, with licensing fees skyrocketing 250% since 2005. battle no longer runs the company.\n\nrelated: clemson is covered -- win or lose\n\nticket prices for monday night's game hit a record high. the average resale ticket price was $3,053 as of saturday, according to ticketiq. the cheapest ticket to get into the game on the alabama side was $1,794. on clemson's side, the cheapest tickets cost $2,600.\n\nwhile these prices won't affect 2016 profits, they'll translate into more money for the program going forward.\n\nas a division i school, alabama also gets a cut of espn's 12-year deal for the rights to broadcast the playoffs, which is worth $7.3 billion.\n\nwith all the money alabama makes, it can afford to pay its head football coach well. nick saban, the second-highest paid college coach in the country, made $6.9 million in 2016. michigan's jim harbaugh made $9 million.\n\nin addition to his ceo-like salary, saban has postseason bonuses built into his contract, which he'll receive whether the team wins or loses. other coaches and select staff members will also receive bonuses.\n\nrelated: ticket prices for alabama-clemson championship game hit a record\n\nstaff bonuses are just part of the expenses of playing in a championship game. clemson, which narrowly lost to alabama in the 2016 title game, took out an insurance policy this year to help cover the cost of what it hoped would be a rematch.\n\nalabama, which has won four national championships in the last seven years, didn't need insurance.\n\nin the words of battle, alabama feels like self-insuring is a better bet.\n\nbattle said alabama budgets for postseason expenses like bowl and championship games so spending on insurance doesn't make sense.
federal reserve chair janet yellen traded sharp words in a rare, feisty exchange with a congressman over legislation that could limit the central bank's independence.\n\nthe normally reserved yellen pushed back against pointed questions from bill posey, a florida republican. he asked why she's opposed to a bill that would allow the government accountability office, a unit of congress, to audit the fed, and, more controversially, review its decisions on interest rates.\n\nposey said the bill, known as audit the fed, would provide more transparency for the central bank and its decisions. fed leaders say it would ruin the central bank's credibility by eliminating its independence.\n\nin january 2017 a version of the audit the fed bill was introduced in both chambers. it passed out of committees in both the house and the senate, but neither version has received a full vote in either the house or the senate. few think it will pass the senate.\n\nrelated: fed chief: trump policies are a source of uncertainty\n\nfor the life of me, i can't understand what the fed fears. can you give me an example that would justify the lack of transparency? posey asked at a hearing of the house financial services committee.\n\nwe don't have a lack of transparency, yellen quickly replied.\n\nyou do if you can't audit it -- that's a lack of transparency, posey shot back.\n\nfed leaders do make their decisions behind closed doors. but the central bank is audited twice a year -- once by the government through the fed's inspector general and once by a private auditor. critics of the bill question the point of a third audit.\n\nright now, gao officials don't attend fed meetings and are unable to second-guess its decisions. yellen argues that the proposed law would give them that power.\n\nrelated: fed raises rates in june\n\nposey pressed on.\n\nwhat do you fear about the audit? can you give me a real-time example? he said.\n\nyellen replied that central bank leaders need privacy to discuss monetary policy without being second-guessed in real time by officials representing lawmakers.\n\nposey wasn't satisfied. just give me an example -- give me an example -- of how transparency could hurt the fed? just give me one example, he asked, holding up his index finger.\n\nyellen started: because what you're talking about with the gao are policy reviews ...\n\nposey cut her off. no, just give me an example.\n\nshe did: i would envision a situation where the gao, at the request of members of congress, might come in and say at our meeting a week ago ... they believe the decision we made was the wrong one at that particular meeting, and i would say that's an extreme interference into monetary policy.\n\nposey replied: so you're telling me we shouldn't be transparent for the fear of being second-guessed or somebody criticizing you because they thought you were wrong?\n\nwhat we're talking about is political interference in decision-making by the [fed's] committee, yellen said.\n\ni don't see that, posey said.\n\ni do, yellen shot back.\n\nwell, give me an example, posey asked again.\n\ni gave you an example, yellen said, sharply.\n\nposey ran out of time, and the hearing moved on.\n\nyellen's testimony before the house on wednesday may have been her last. her term ends in february, and it's unclear whether president trump will reappoint her. house leaders repeatedly asked yellen whether she wants to say on, and she declined to comment.
the u.s. tax code overhaul will result in a tax cut for nearly two-thirds of u.s. households in 2018, according to the tax policy center.\n\nbut the average tax cut will vary by state depending on economic and demographic characteristics, and whether residents pay high state and local taxes, which are now capped as a deduction on one's federal return.\n\nthe map below indicates the average tax cut in each state as measured across all filers in that state – those getting a tax cut, those facing a tax increase and those who will see no change at all. only a small minority of filers will owe more in federal taxes, ranging from a low of 2.8% of residents in west virginia to a high of 10.2% in new jersey.\n\nwhile a tax cut may represent a notable drop in average tax burden, it doesn't necessarily represent a big jump in one's after-tax income, which is a better measure of how a tax cut changes someone's economic situation. for example, mississippi residents will see their average federal tax burden drop by $1,040, or 9.5% on average. but that only represents a jump of 1.8% in after-tax income.
