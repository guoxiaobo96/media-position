another one of our favorites, the vari is a classic electric standing desk, and there's a reason — well, many reasons — why you may have seen it in myriad office spaces throughout the country as the standing desk du jour. for one, it's impossibly sturdy, racking up top marks in that category during our testing. and despite its heavyweight build, it was by far the easiest of the non-budget-priced electric standing desks to assemble, taking approximately 20 minutes to do so. the vari moves up and down smoothly, from a minimum height of 25 to a maximum of 50.2 (the highest maximum height of all desks we tested), and its led keypad displays increments of 0.1. programming the four memory presets is easy as pie; we didn't even need to consult an instruction manual for that. and while there wasn't much difference among all our standing desks in terms of motor noise, we'd contend that the vari was noticeably quieter than the others in our pool. it has a five-year warranty for all components.

for a current claim of i'm not the worst. with such a tight contest now taking shape, anderson and his appeal to the disgruntled of both parties could prove to be the decisive difference in a few key states and swing the election, most likely to reagan. the latest public opinion poll conducted for time by yankelovich, skelly and white discloses just how close the race is once again. carter and reagan are deadlocked at 39% each, while anderson's support is 15% -- precisely the level set by the league of women voters for him to qualify as a viable candidate and therefore earn a third spot in its crucial opening debate, set tentatively for sept. 21 in baltimore. carter, who insists on meeting reagan first without anderson, still threatened last week not to appear if the congressman was included. the league's directs were to meet this week to examine the range of recent poll results and decide whether or not to invite anderson. for so early in the campaign, a surprisingly low 7% of registered voters claim to be undecided about whom they now favor.

the carter advisers are counting on vice president walter mondale to shepherd unhappy kennedy supporters back into the democratic fold. one recruit about to sign up: robert kennedy jr., now a law student at the university of virginia law school. mondale is also busily holding unity meetings to strengthen the old democratic coalition that many experts feel will grudgingly regroup as nov. 4 and the prospect of a ronald reagan presidency loom ever closer. as for john anderson, the carter tactic is to ignore him publicly and try to downgrade his importance. privately, however, the white house is deeply worried about the congressman's threat. in 1976 eugene mccarthy, running independently, won just 1% of the vote, but the carterites insist that was enough to tip maine, iowa, oklahoma and oregon into ford's column. carter desperately wants to keep anderson out of the first debate because of the invaluable exposure it would give him. indeed carter's men have even suggested that the league of women voters hold a five-way first debate, including libertarian candidate ed clark and the citizen's party's barry commoner, to take some of the play away from anderson. but the league turned down the proposal. the president's strategists concede that they have been boxed in by reagan and anderson on the debate issue; they fear public wrath if the president ducks a first debate with the other two. anderson's chances of at least finishing the race brightened considerably last week.

for twitter, the challenge of what to do about trump's account was poised to only get more difficult, not less. as trump reemerged, the company faced a test of its commitment that any further violations of its policies by the president would result in a permanent ban. even one more transgression could land trump in twitter jail — forever. it happened even more quickly than many would have thought.

from dr. king's relationship with the towering jewish rabbi abraham joshua heschel to the extraordinary numbers of jewish students who volunteered for 1964's freedom summer and locked arms with black citizens in selma, black-jewish alliances during the civil rights era proved indispensable to achieving the movement's larger goals. in the age of black lives matter, especially since george floyd's murder, we have witnessed a resurgence of this coalition that is perhaps best symbolized by the dual victories of warnock and ossoff. in so doing, this special election illustrated the possible rise of a religious left of christian and jewish voters in support of progressive politics in a part of the country long thought to be hopelessly conservative.

these are all reasonable questions to consider and evaluate in clinical trials. however, at this time, suggesting changes to the fda-authorized dosing or schedules of these vaccines is premature and not rooted solidly in the available evidence. without appropriate data supporting such changes in vaccine administration, we run a significant risk of placing public health at risk, undermining the historic vaccination efforts to protect the population from covid-19, they added.

all these things are going to have to be looked into, because i have a terrible feeling this won't be the last kidnapping of an american abroad by muslim groups who are disenchanted with american foreign policy. musharraf sent his condolences to pearl's family, pledged to find the reporter's killers and said he would not relent in his month-old crackdown on militant groups, which some believe may have been the impetus for the kidnapping. while the investigation in pakistan continued, friends, colleagues and family struggled to come to terms with a stunning loss. pearl's close friend daniel gill told cnn that pearl was the absent-minded professor going to an interview with papers flying out of his shirt pockets. he just wanted to get a story, gill said. he wasn't about getting into the dangerous places. that wasn't for him. i believe he thought this was a safe assignment. peter r. kann, publisher of the wall street journal, and paul e. steiger, the paper's managing editor, said in a joint statement, (pearl's) murder is an act of barbarism that makes a mockery of everything danny's kidnappers claimed to believe in. pearl was the 10th reporter to die while involved in coverage of the war against terrorism, according to the committee to protect journalists.

the senate majority would determine whether measures expanding abortion access backed by the democrat-led house and democratic president-elect joe biden would meet a receptive vote or a thorny end. and on a much broader scale, whichever party takes the senate holds the power to confirm or reject biden's picks for the federal judiciary, a key part of determining national abortion policy as conservative state legislatures advance restrictions in hopes of overturning roe v. wade, the 1973 landmark supreme court decision legalizing abortion nationwide.

finally, there are those who oppose identifying a timeframe for our transition to afghan responsibility. indeed, some call for a more dramatic and open-ended escalation of our war effort -- one that would commit us to a nation building project of up to a decade. i reject this course because it sets goals that are beyond what we can achieve at a reasonable cost, and what we need to achieve to secure our interests. furthermore, the absence of a timeframe for transition would deny us any sense of urgency in working with the afghan government. it must be clear that afghans will have to take responsibility for their security, and that america has no interest in fighting an endless war in afghanistan.

the mood of the voter as the race begins in earnest, the public is wary, worried -- and waiting (time, september 15, 1980) -- disenchanted, but not apathetic. caring about issues, although much more concerned about character. longing for a strong person to trust, but fearful of strength lacking sound judgment. leery of weakness, but edgy about brashness. all too mindful of the disappointments of the past, but seeking hope in the future. leaning toward one man, but often out of desperation and a sense of disdain for the others. uncommitted. unpredictable. as the 1980 presidential campaign swings into full stride, the american voter is displaying a show-me attitude as perhaps never before: wary, worried and waiting to see how the candidates perform. this unwontedly watchful and volatile electorate has already turned the race into a highly personal, potentially nasty, intensely competitive -- and, yes, exciting -- contest. the voters who could give republican challenger ronald reagan a lead as high as 28% over president jimmy carter in july and then snatch it all away in august can hardly be regarded as the rock- ribbed supporters of party and candidates that flourished in days of yore. and if the reagan rise was giddy and the carter comeback startling, the gadfly persistence of independent john anderson adds even more bite and confusion. he blithely dismisses reagan as irrelevant -- a product of the '20s -- and accuses carter of abandoning his autobiographical guery of why not the best?

this vivo converter was quite similar in both build and function to the flexispot converter. assembly required only attaching the keyboard tray to the base, which was simple enough, and adjustment is controlled via lever. it's a standard desk riser, and we found its sturdiness to rival flexispot's as well, but ultimately we didn't select it as a winner for a few reasons: we took value into consideration, and the vivo is available only in one size, at a starting price of $119.99, versus flexispot's $99.99 for its 31-inch option. (for $159.99, you can snag the vivo in light wood or white finishes, or dark wood for $179.99.) the width of both the keyboard and desktop are a bit smaller than the flexispot converter we tested, at 10 and 15.75, respectively, though it does rise to a maximum height of 19.5, one inch higher than our winning converter does. it comes with two cable clips to stick to the underside of the product, and it has a three-year warranty. if you're seeking a finish that isn't solid black, could make use of another inch of height as a tradeoff for some desktop space, and you're willing to shell out a bit more cash, we think the vivo is a fine option.

that's because idaho residents have been able to claim the full federal personal exemption and standard deduction on their state returns. the new federal law nearly doubled the standard deduction — which may reduce a filer's state tax burden. but it's not enough to offset the loss of personal exemptions for low- and middle-income parents with several kids.
but i, you know, i think it's important to remember here that senator harris has -- has praised the vice president. she started the kind of speech on the debate by saying i respect you, but then she took it to a place that really has joe biden on the back foot as someone who thinks of himself as a civil rights advocate, who has been a real aid and public servant to african-american communities. so this strikes at his whole identity and the way he views his political brand.

the uproar over russia's disinformation drive to hurt hillary clinton and help trump four years ago cast a cloud that the current president has never been able to escape. the president's defensive response to a new russia interference drama, colored by his belief that all such revelations as a deep state assault on his own legitimacy, already appears to be exacerbating the damage caused by moscow's meddling.

trump is certainly not the first public figure to be deplatformed, or face the risk of it. some of the clearest examples are alex jones , the right-wing conspiracy theorist, as well as other figures like far-right activist and self-described proud islamophobe laura loomer and fringe right-wing media personality milo yiannopoulos . these figures frequently made headlines through outlandish comments before having their access to major social media revoked. they later faded significantly from mainstream conversation.

iran's persistent rhythm of half-measures, a drum beat of self-assertion, rarely lets up, leaving its adversaries -- from hawk to moderate -- able to choose from either of those options. monday's admission that it is now enriching uranium to the 20% purity level -- a further breach of the collapsed nuclear deal (the jcpoa) and perhaps the singular most open step they've taken towards an alleged nuclear weapon -- rings some of the loudest non-proliferation alarms in the region so far.
to address these issues, it is important to recall why america and our allies were compelled to fight a war in afghanistan in the first place. we did not ask for this fight. on september 11, 2001, 19 men hijacked four airplanes and used them to murder nearly 3,000 people. they struck at our military and economic nerve centers. they took the lives of innocent men, women and children without regard to their faith or race or station. were it not for the heroic actions of the passengers on board one of those flights, they could have also struck at one of the great symbols of our democracy in washington, and killed many more.

perhaps due to my chilean origins, i am convinced that we urgently need drastic solutions and radical reforms, not piecemeal and partial ones. americans should heed the cautionary tale that chile sends us. in 1990, after 17 years of dictatorship, chileans regained the right to determine their own destiny, but they were unable to take the crucial next step of pressuring their leaders to right the wrongs of the past and move forward to a full democracy. remnants of the old regime survived , and strangled attempts at indispensable economic, political and social reforms.

the vacillations in the polls make most opinion analysts and political scientists leery about how the current campaigns and their various pitches will affect the voters. traditionally, of course, a majority of postwar voters have turned to the democratic candidates during a time of economic recession or depression on the theory that the party of f.d.r. is more likely to use government tools to check the decline. but now a democratic president is presiding over high inflation and a recession. simultaneously, government intervention in the economy has become more suspect. observes m.i.t. political scientist thomas ferguson: the signals coming down to the voters are incredibly mixed. there is an enormous amount of confusion even in the political parties. there is turmoil at all sectors of the electorate. appearing on a panel of pollsters convened in washington by the american political science association, warren mitofsky of cbs news's election and survey unit contended that the issues carry little weight with voters intent on examining the character of the candidates. said he: we are really seeing a loss of respect for our system of selecting our elective officials. this disenchantment with the candidates is causing voters to look at the personalities rather than the issues.

h-1b applicants who get requests for evidence are actually the luckier bunch among all visa applicants. a new policy directive issued by uscis last summer permits the agency to summarily deny visa applications for immigrant visas, for green cards and for adjustments of status without first issuing a request for evidence or a notice to appear as they used to. instead, the agency can, at their discretion, deny the visa and immediately label the applicant illegal and deportable, without giving them an option to depart voluntarily. the real consequence of the policy change is to make many more people ineligible for re-entry into the united states, because they have been deemed deportable. in cases of immigrant visas, applicants appearing for green card interviews have been rejected and then immediately detained because, under this new policy directive, they had been declared illegal.

every administration factors domestic politics into its foreign policy. but rarely has any president allowed those politics – particularly political commitments made during an election campaign, or personal opposition to the policies of his predecessor – to outweigh national security and foreign policy considerations. trump's unilateral withdrawal from the 2015 iran's nuclear accord – a flawed but functional arms-control agreement – isolated the us, strained relations with allies and removed constraints on tehran's nuclear weapons program without offering any alternative approach.

a group of nearly a dozen republican senators announced saturday that they would vote for hawley's objection when it was brought forward, unless a commission was created to study voter fraud, something that is unlikely. the group, led by gop sen. ted cruz of texas, speaks to the balancing act many republicans feel like they have to maintain. cruz's group has not said if any members would separately file their own objections or just vote in support of challenges that hawley brings up, but the practical effect is the same: a dozen republicans rejecting the results of at least one state's election.

dudley: well the president is obviously going to be able to make some appointment to the board of governors. of course, remember, the federal open market committee also consists of the federal reserve bank presidents and more importantly than that, the fed's mandate is set by congress. congress wants the fed to achieve maximum sustainable employment and price stability. so i would expect that whoever gets named to the federal reserve is going to try to carry out that task set for the fed by congress.

most of my fellow americans may find this idea puzzling, even insulting. our country has no restrictions of freedom of speech or assembly. it just carried out an election that the sitting president lost decisively, despite his and his supporters' many desperate efforts to overturn the result. it seems clear that by wednesday, when congress meets to officially acknowledge donald trump's defeat, we should no longer be worried about the transfer of power, the successful transition, in effect, between administrations.

why? because it is actually good policy to hold accountable anyone who enabled the 19 hijackers to live here in the united states for 18 months, plan and then execute the heinous murders on 9/11. it is good policy to enact legislation that protects the rights of americans to utilize our judicial system and hold accountable foreign states that aid in terrorist attacks on u.s. soil. and it is good policy to enact legislation that addresses the funding sources of terrorist organizations. after all, without money, terrorists cannot pay for their travel, training camps, bomb-making material, weapons or even their basic living expenses. they cannot forge passports or recruit new jihadists. without money it is far harder for terrorists to kill americans. unfortunately, kerry's floodgate comment wrongly equates collaboration with designated terrorists (which jasta addresses) with conduct to protect our national security (which jasta does not address). he also wrongly assumes the bill would expose boots on the ground, while the bill focuses solely on the foreign state's accountability for those boots.

where the apexdesk elite series lost points was in its led display keypad, which displays desk height in full-inch increments rather than the 0.1-inch increments we saw on the other electric standing desks we tested at this price point. this means that whether the desk is standing at 40.1 or 40.7 inches high, the display will still read 40. if you're using the memory function to program a preferred height, that precise height you set will be programmed, though the number on the screen may not accurately reflect the height if it isn't a round number. all that to say: it isn't really a detriment to usage and we didn't consider it a deal-breaker by any means.

of course, none of the trump team's remarks should come as a surprise. kellyanne conway's recent insistence that we judge trump not by what comes out of his mouth but by what is in his heart turns the distinction between truth and falsehood into matters of emotions rather than arguments open for evaluation. when emotion is privileged over reason, the truth can be whatever trump says it is at any given moment. trump's serial lies, including that he never mocked a disabled person or believed that he wasn't going to win, when words from his own mouth indicate the contrary, is wholly consistent with seeing plagiarism as just another point of view.

in the final weeks of 2018, trump suddenly revived his promise to build a wall with all the concentrated determination of a man fleeing a posse. the promise was never quite dead (the second stanza of the build the wall campaign chant, the part about mexico paying, has faded, drowned by the debunking of nonsensical claims) but two years into the trump administration, the urgency of building a wall exploded onto the scene only after tangible threats to trump looked imminent.

he cited recent news stories about a newly developed technique for shielding aircraft and other weapons against detection by enemy radar. before a cheering audience of businessmen in jacksonville, reagan claimed this had been the most tightly classified, most highly secret weapons information since the manhattan project. disclosure normally would be illegal, he said. but he charged that the breach of secrecy was blessed and sanctioned by the carter administration itself clearly for the sole political purpose of aiding mr. carter's troubled campaign. as a result, the soviet union has been handed a ten-year head start on developing ways to counter this type of ultrasophisticated weapons system. defense secretary harold brown angrily denied that the leaks about the defense technique were politically motivated. responding to the reagan blast, press secretary jody powell declared: any implication that the president or secretary of defense acted in a manner which damaged the security of this country is wrong and not responsible and goes beyond the acceptable grounds of political partisanship. governor reagan doesn't know what he's talking about. with each candidate so eagerly on the attack so early, the 1980 presidential campaign could swing on a single event in such a volatile year. if held, the debates could turn the trick- perhaps even the very first one. but the candidates are all anxiously looking over their shoulders, wondering when lightning might strike. the reaganites talk nervously, and sarcastically, of an october surprise, some international event that carter will be able to exploit as the incumbent.

however, the sampling did not examine just how anderson has scored 20% or higher in key states, such as new york, california and massachusetts. one of the most dramatic findings of the survey came from a more indirect probing of voter sentiment -- and it looks potentially helpful to carter. in the survey's state of the nation indicator, which measures how people feel about the way things are going in the country in general and how much confidence they have in the future, voters are becoming increasingly optimistic. while only 11% took a positive view of the nation's well-being in may, 21% are upbeat now. as the incumbent, carter would presumably benefit from any continued upsurge in optimism, which seems centered on a belief that the economy may be revving up again. while nearly all the polls have found that the economy ranks first as an issue, well ahead of foreign affairs, the time study finds that, surprisingly, neither has much impact on voter preferences for the presidential candidates. many polls reveal the voters are thoroughly confused when asked to make judgments about the candidates on most issues; the election seems much more likely to turn on personality than on policy, notes time national political correspondent john stacks. one intriguing but as yet unexplained phenomenon that might be linked to issues is yankelovich's discovery that 10% more women prefer carter than reagan. this is balanced, however, by reagan's 10% edge among men.

there will be a split among democrats. it's much easier to be united in pursuit of power than it is to stay united in power. trump, to his credit, was able to effectively marshal republicans, often through fear and bullying, during his time in office. as president, it's unlikely biden will use those same tactics. and he'll have to contend with progressives on the left who want more attention to big problems like climate change and inequality that require systemic change the moderates in his party have less interest in pursuing. a year from now, it will be much easier for republicans to focus on biden's policies -- and he's likely to be a relatively moderate president -- in a way to aggravate and turn off progressives. vermont sen. bernie sanders won't quietly let biden take the moderate route. neither will massachusetts sen. elizabeth warren, new york rep. alexandria ocasio-cortez or the congressional black caucus.

large-scale defections from the democratic party helped both dwight eisenhower and richard nixon win the presidency and today seem vital to reagan's prospects. so far, no real switch has been found. carter leads by 10 percentage points among blue-collar workers, setting these states up as some of the key battleground between now and november. the survey pinpoints one group of voters still posing a considerable problem for carter: the former followers of senator edward kennedy. despite the efforts at the democratic national convention to patch up the party's deep rift and kennedy's later pledges of support for carter, the senator's followers now split three ways on what they intend to do: 39% say they will back carter; 28% prefer anderson; a surprising 22% are so disaffected that they say they will jump over the wall and vote for reagan. that degree of party defection could cripple the carter candidacy. the mood could well be, however, just a passing stage of postconvention blues. while the kennedy problem lingers for carter, the anderson difference so confidently proclaimed by the earnest and stubborn congressman from illinois has not really faded either. if anderson were to drop out, 37% of his present share of the voters say they would switch to carter, 28% would go to reagan and 26% claim they would not vote at all. with anderson out, carter narrowly leads reagan in the nationwide popular vote, 44.5% to 43%.

background: time for a new approach? franklin d. roosevelt signed the first federal poverty assistance law in 1935, called the aid to dependent children act, a little-noticed add-on to the social security law designed to aid poor depression-era widows and their children. the act established what for the next sixty years became the core of federal welfare -- open-ended payments from the federal government to single mothers with dependent children. as the depression lifted, caseloads remained low during the post-war years. then in 1962, at john f. kennedy's urging, congress raised welfare payments, and renamed the program aid to families with dependent children (afdc). under the new law, states were permitted to require beneficiaries to do community work and attend training programs. kennedy articulated what has since been a central goal of federal welfare policy: to end poverty, not just alleviate it. welfare should be a hand up, not a hand out, in kennedy's words. it wasn't until lyndon b. johnson's war on poverty, beginning in 1965, that welfare spending began to take off. eligibility requirements were broadened and benefits increased for afdc and a bevy of federal programs designed to lower the 14 percent poverty rate. but some 27 years and $6 trillion later, the official poverty rate had notched up to 15.2 percent. more ominously, perhaps, out-of-wedlock births jumped from 5 percent (2 percent of white children, 19 percent of black children) in 1965 to its current level of 32 percent (23 percent of white children, 68 percent of black children).

the fundamental flaw in the us tax system is that we tax wages, not wealth. if america were to follow rep. ocasio-cortez's lead, high income workers would be facing higher taxes, up to 70% for those with more than $10 million of taxable income. many upper-income earners would be tempted to move, or retire, or shift their financial plans to show fewer wages and all of them, as workers, are shouldering a hefty tax burden as is. meantime, the truly rich, who do not have to work, or work in the ways ordinary folk do, would continue to pay nothing on their accumulated wealth. that's crazy.

because this is an international effort, i have asked that our commitment be joined by contributions from our allies. some have already provided additional troops, and we are confident that there will be further contributions in the days and weeks ahead. our friends have fought and bled and died alongside us in afghanistan. now, we must come together to end this war successfully. for what's at stake is not simply a test of nato's credibility -- what's at stake is the security of our allies, and the common security of the world.
