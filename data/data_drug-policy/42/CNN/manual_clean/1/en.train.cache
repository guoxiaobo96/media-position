bush: bob, we relied upon a company out of england to provide about half of the flu vaccines for the united states citizen, and it turned out that the vaccine they were producing was contaminated. and so we took the right action and didn't allow contaminated medicine into our country.
now, even as health care reform would reduce our deficit, it's not enough to dig us out of a massive fiscal hole in which we find ourselves. it's a challenge that makes all others that much harder to solve and one that's been subject to a lot of political posturing.
scott nemeth, who played offense from 1999 to 2001, said barnett was a strict disciplinarian and handed out wristbands bearing the letters dtrt, which stood for do the right thing, nemeth explained.

cooper: and welcome back. we're live from sahara, las vegas, for a democratic presidential town hall with senator amy klobuchar. let's get back to our questions.
but i think we both recognize that these problems have to be dealt with and that we have seen an administration over the last seven years that has failed to address them and -- in many ways -- has made them worse.
the essential point is that we don't come together in a real way until we set foot on u.s. soil. that's when our latino experience begins. latino is an american identity.

and we can't count on military might alone. we have to invest in our homeland security, because we can't capture or kill every violent extremist abroad. we have to improve and better coordinate our intelligence, so that we stay one step ahead of shadowy networks.
lawyers for trump and the trump organization did not respond to cnn's requests for comment.
whether you count homicides only, or all deaths, more people have died from gun violence since 2007 than military deaths in us wars since the vietnam conflict began in 1964. a congressional research service report said 67,000 military members were killed in wars since then.
bloomberg spent nearly $12 million in 2016 to support the reelection of republican sen. pat toomey of pennsylvania, an ally of his on the issue of background checks on gun purchases. the new york times also reported in november he supported republican sen. lindsey graham of south carolina in 2014.
so what they did back then, get this, is they would say, ok, just come and live in canada for one day. stay over night in canada, the army did this. and then you can come back and you're a citizen. because they needed people to serve. this is during world war ii. and he said, i stayed in a hotel and i came back and i was a citizen.
brown: all right. we've got to take another quick break. we've got a lot more ahead. stay with us. we'll be right back.
operation warp speed is continuing to ensure second doses are available to vaccine administration sites, at appropriate intervals, as directed by jurisdiction leaders, said a spokesman for hhs. we would be delighted to learn that jurisdictions have actually administered many more doses than they are presently reporting. we are encouraging jurisdictions to expand their priority groups as needed to ensure no vaccine is sitting on the shelf after having been delivered to the jurisdiction-directed locations.
he had been brought over when he was five years old. he didn't know it. he thought he was born in our country. and i see one of our navy veterans out there with the hat. he signed up to serve in world war ii. and when he signed up to serve, that was when he found out that he was a dreamer, that he had not been born in our country. and so then you couldn't serve.

and thank you to the presidential commission for undertaking this enormous task. we're proud to be here.
camerota: so joe, strategically, what has mayor pete buttigieg done better than other people? why has he leapfrogged?
but the notion that, somehow, i am interested in leaving out 15 million people, without health insurance, is simply not true.
pence: an organization that we now understand was involved in disseminating classified information by the united states of america.
clinton: you look at what will work and what will not work. if you do not have a plan that starts out attempting to achieve universal health care, you will be nibbled to death, and we will be back here with more and more people uninsured and rising costs.
and let's tell another 1 million students that, when they graduate, they will be required to pay only 10 percent of their income on student loans, and all of their debt will be forgiven after 20 years, and forgiven after 10 years if they choose a career in public service, because in the united states of america, no one should go broke because they chose to go to college.
but if anyone from either party has a better approach that will bring down premiums, bring down the deficit, cover the uninsured, strengthen medicare for seniors, and stop insurance company abuses, let me know.
phillips: well, i know the white house is already listening to her, too. let's talk about noah feldman. i can't believe that noah isn't even 35 yet.
the biggest indicator of this party's leaning has become its silence. it is like the malignancy of the ideas from this president will lead nowhere but to more victory, so shh!
most of all, i know that this decision asks even more of you -- a military that, along with your families, has already borne the heaviest of all burdens. as president, i have signed a letter of condolence to the family of each american who gives their life in these wars. i have read the letters from the parents and spouses of those who deployed. i have visited our courageous wounded warriors at walter reed. i have traveled to dover to meet the flag-draped caskets of 18 americans returning home to their final resting place. i see firsthand the terrible wages of war. if i did not think that the security of the united states and the safety of the american people were at stake in afghanistan, i would gladly order every single one of our troops home tomorrow.
facts first: although sanders is correct that several studies have found medicare for all would reduce health care spending, at least one study published last year found the opposite.
cuomo: at his suggestion! and you wonder why bloomberg got in! and yet, this president is seen as very formidable to the wizard of odds himself, harry enten, and here is why.
running through august 2019, the opening values of design exhibition will explore the influence of design on culture both in shenzhen and around the world.
phillips: all right. dr. phil meets lou dobbs. that's how you describe elizabeth warren.

next, we need to encourage american innovation. last year, we made the largest investment in basic research funding in history, an investment -- an investment that could lead to the world's cheapest solar cells or treatment that kills cancer cells but leaves healthy ones untouched.
of course, this burden is not ours alone to bear. this is not just america's war. since 9/11, al qaeda's safe havens have been the source of attacks against london and amman and bali. the people and governments of both afghanistan and pakistan are endangered. and the stakes are even higher within a nuclear-armed pakistan, because we know that al qaeda and other extremists seek nuclear weapons, and we have every reason to believe that they would use them.
in her recent letter, halsema also noted concerns about the city's coffee shops supply chain.

today, after extraordinary costs, we are bringing the iraq war to a responsible end. we will remove our combat brigades from iraq by the end of next summer, and all of our troops by the end of 2011. that we are doing so is a testament to the character of our men and women in uniform. thanks to their courage, grit and perseverance , we have given iraqis a chance to shape their future, and we are successfully leaving iraq to its people.
one reason for the jump in spending increase is the widening gap between what the federal government reimburses for medicare and what private insurers and employers pay for those with job-based coverage, anderson said. in 2000, the difference was roughly 10%. now, studies have shown it has widened to 50% or more.
but hey, you heard him say, his administration's looking to all this, so let's leave it there. sleep well america, and know that the president is working hard from his throne room to get the gridlock unclogged on the ridiculist.

trump said his administration has taken an unprecedented effort to secure the us-mexico border.
but i think this is rather important is that growth is what's important. it's not the absolute levels. it's basically where you've grown, and basically with the economy at this point, we're kind of running into a wall, since we're near max employment.

i don't think american elections should be bankrolled by america's most powerful interests or, worse, by foreign entities. they should be decided by the american people. and i urge democrats and republicans to pass a bill that helps correct some of these problems.

the president-elect believes we must accelerate distribution of the vaccine while continuing to ensure the americans who need it most get it as soon as possible. he supports releasing available doses immediately, and believes the government should stop holding back vaccine supply so we can get more shots in americans' arms now, said tj ducklo, a spokesman for biden's transition. he will share additional details next week on how his administration will begin releasing available doses when he assumes office on january 20th.
because the problem is, if we think that meeting with the president is a privilege that has to be earned, i think that reinforces the sense that we stand above the rest of the world at this point in time. and i think that it's important for us in undoing the damage that has been done over the last seven years, for the president to be willing to take that extra step.
boulder, colorado (cnn) -- already under heavy scrutiny for allegedly using sex as a recruiting tool, the university of colorado football program thursday suffered another setback: a sixth rape allegation against a player.
so far, the incoming trump administration hasn't released its health plan to replace obamacare. but, experts say, it is likely to give the states less federal money for treating the poor. it is unclear how rural hospitals will compensate for the financial benefits they are likely to lose — or how many more rural hospitals will fall.
as cadets, you volunteered for service during this time of danger. some of you have fought in afghanistan. many will deploy there. as your commander in chief, i owe you a mission that is clearly defined, and worthy of your service. that is why, after the afghan voting was completed, i insisted on a thorough review of our strategy. let me be clear: there has never been an option before me that called for troop deployments before 2010 -- so there has been no delay or denial of resources necessary for the conduct of the war. instead, the review has allowed me ask the hard questions, and to explore all of the different options along with my national security team, our military and civilian leadership in afghanistan, and our key partners. given the stakes involved, i owed the american people and our troops no less.

the us became the top producer of crude oil in particular during trump's tenure. the united states has been the world's top producer of natural gas since 2009, when us natural gas production surpassed that of russia, and it has been the world's top producer of petroleum hydrocarbons since 2013, when its production exceeded saudi arabia's, the energy information administration says.

the way this number is presented appears to be misleading. the latest customs and border protection statistics for fiscal year 2018 (which do not include the month of september) show that the border patrol apprehended 808 people affiliated with gangs at the border and across the nation. on the other hand, immigration and customs enforcement removed or deported 5,872 gang members in fiscal year 2018, per its latest numbers. these arrests and removals take place in communities over the country. the way this category is worded could leave readers under the impression that 6,000 gang members were arrested solely at the southwest border, and it again plays to fears stoked by the administration of dangerous individuals coming into the us through mexico.
if they had a committed a crime in our country or the country they came from, then they should be deported. but for everyone else, there must be a path to legalization. i would introduce that in the first 100 days of my presidency.

but what they do also want is some order to the process. and so, we're not going to be able to do these things in isolation. we're not going to be able to deal with the 12 million people who are living in the shadows and give them a way of getting out of the shadows if we don't also deal with the problem of this constant influx of undocumented workers.

in the opening moments of the debate, former new york city mayor michael bloomberg mocked sanders' embrace of socialism, claiming that russian president vladimir putin was trying to get him nominated so he would lose to trump. former vice president joe biden took on sanders' record on guns and questioned whether he would be soft on authoritarian leaders. massachusetts sen. elizabeth warren, who has avoided attacking her close ally, claimed she would be more effectual in enacting a progressive agenda. minnesota sen. amy klobuchar argued sanders would alienate middle of the road voters with his expensive ideas.

this situation could be resolved in a 45-minute meeting, trump said in his remarks.
trump has worked to undermine the affordable care act from his first day in office, when he issued an executive order directing agencies to interpret its regulations as loosely as possible. he championed congressional republicans' bills in 2017 that would have weakened the law's protections.
he just said he wants everybody to be able to buy in to the same plan that senators and congressmen get. that costs the government $7,700 per family. if every family in america signed up, like the senator suggested, [it] would cost us $5 trillion over 10 years.
and what i learned last night when i was there with congressman ortiz is that the university of texas at brownsville would have part of its campus cut off.
administration officials last year dropped plans to effectively ban drug makers from providing rebates to pharmacy benefit managers and insurers because it would have increased medicare premiums.
and his justice department is siding with a coalition of republican states that are fighting in federal court to invalidate the affordable care act. an appellate panel in december upheld a lower court ruling that found obamacare's individual mandate unconstitutional but sent the case back to the lower court to decide whether the entire law must fall.

now, i know that some in my own party will argue that we can't address the deficit or freeze government spending when so many are still hurting. and i agree, which is why this freeze won't take effect until next year, when the economy is stronger. that's how budgeting works.
this review is now complete. and as commander in chief, i have determined that it is in our vital national interest to send an additional 30,000 u.s. troops to afghanistan. after 18 months, our troops will begin to come home. these are the resources that we need to seize the initiative, while building the afghan capacity that can allow for a responsible transition of our forces out of afghanistan.

roof's background check took longer than three days to complete and so the gun shop owner was allowed to sell him the gun after the three days passed. because this error wasn't discovered until after the shooting, when the fbi began investigating roof, it's unclear how a longer waiting period would have prevented roof from passing the background check.

before i came into office, trump said tuesday, if you showed up illegally on our southern border and were arrested, you were simply released and allowed into our country, never to be seen again.
question: good afternoon, and, senator klobuchar, i want to welcome you back to nevada.
one last point i want to make on the immigration issue because we may be moving to different topics: something that we can do immediately that i think is very important is to pass the dream act, which allows children who through no fault of their own are here but have essentially grown up as americans, allow them the opportunity for higher education.
my opponent said this war is a matter of intelligence and law enforcement. no, this war is a matter of using every asset at our disposal to keep the american people protected.
mudd: it is really frustrating for people to jump to conclusions. let me tell you why the bureau's not.

with unyielding commitment, we are curbing the opioid epidemic -- drug overdose deaths declined for the first time in nearly 30 years. among the states hardest hit, ohio is down 22%, pennsylvania is down 18%, wisconsin is down 10% -- and we will not quit until we have beaten the opioid epidemic once and for all, trump said during his speech.
look, demonizing practically anyone who crosses the southern border, it's all part of the same idea, this.
touting his record of appointing conservative judges, trump said, we have confirmed a record number of 187 new federal judges to uphold our constitution as written.

as a country, we are not as young -- and perhaps not as innocent -- as we were when roosevelt was president. yet we are still heirs to a noble struggle for freedom. now we must summon all of our might and moral suasion to meet the challenges of a new age.
sharfstein said the agency learned of the problem in early february, when a basic foods customer tested the product and reported to fda that it was contaminated.
my name is altogether too long for americans, who've always struggled with it. it's even too long for a driver's license. african-americans assume i'm named after the notorious soledad prison or mount soledad in california. latinos want to know if i'm lonely. that doesn't fit because i grew up with five siblings and i have four kids of my own, so i'm not lonely at all, though i do often seek solitude, the actual meaning of my name.
i'm also calling on congress to continue down the path of earmark reform, democrats and republicans.
so phil, you were making the point that you actually did at the governmental level weigh in, almost like an actuarial kind of assessment--
why it's great in one sentence: the capital one spark miles for business card earns an unlimited 2 miles for every dollar you spend on the card — plus 3 additional miles for hotel and car rentals booked through capital one travel with the card — and those miles can be redeemed for any travel purchase you make at 1 cent per mile or transferred to capital one's airline partners for potentially even more valuable redemptions.
the fda food safety modernization act, the law pending in the senate, would change the whole system, modernize it to say we're going to try to prevent the contamination before it occurs.
drug companies, however, do appear to have slowed the rate of price increases, perhaps in part because of trump's twitter bully pulpit. pfizer temporarily walked back hikes in mid-2018 after trump tweeted that it should be ashamed for raising prices and taking advantage of the poor. pfizer ended up raising them the following january.
it also remains unclear who was behind the trickery.
that's why we stand with the girl who yearns to go to school in afghanistan, why we support the human rights of the women marching through the streets of iran, why we advocate for the young man denied a job by corruption in guinea, for america must always stand on the side of freedom and human dignity, always.
you know, i think you can tell from the first 45 minutes, you know, senator obama and i have a lot in common. we both care passionately about our country. we are devoted to public service. we care deeply about the future, and we have run a very vigorous and contested primary campaign, which has been by most standards, i think, very positive and extremely civil.
president donald trump and his allies have launched a full-court press to convince americans, and skeptical lawmakers, that there is a crisis on the southern border, and the only way to fix it is to approve billions of dollars for trump's signature border wall.

2021 must be an opportunity to rectify our national failures. president-elect joe biden and vice president-elect kamala harris must do their part but so should ordinary citizens. every city, town and hamlet in the nation should look inward at their histories of racial inequality, acts of truth-telling that can form the basis for local, state, and regional policy solutions that can pave the way toward healing and reconciliation across the nation.
and now i want to give you an idea of what to expect over the next 90 minutes or so. we want to have a real conversation between these two candidates on the issues important to texas and the entire nation, so we won't have any hard and fast rules for them to follow. we simply ask the candidates to keep their answers to a reasonable length and to stay on point.

one of the reasons that i, and 200 members of congress, have sued the president in blumenthal versus trump, and there'll be a hearing this monday, is that financial interests, taking benefits and payments from foreign governments have been very much a part of this administration.
even better, once you've converted your cash back to points, you can transfer them to any of chase's 13 airline and hotel loyalty partners. this amazing flexibility is why frequent flyer website the points guy values ultimate rewards points at 2 cents apiece. at that rate, since you're earning 1.5% cash back on the freedom flex, you could effectively end up with a 3% return on your purchases.

jeffrey toobin, cnn legal analyst: i thought so, miles. tom mesereau, the defense attorney for michael jackson, continued and completed his opening statement this morning and talked about the repeated occasions in which the accuser and his family denied that michael jackson had done anything inappropriate with them. over and over again, they denied, including with the government, with the department of children's services in los angeles, on videotape, which i'm sure the jurors will be hearing, right up until the time they changed their story 180 degrees and this case moved forward. it's going to be difficult, it seems to me, for the prosecutors to explain away all of these statements, but that's what -- the task the prosecution has set for itself.

facts first: trump is inflating his administration's own estimate of job creation under the new trade deal -- which is even higher than an estimate from an independent agency.
watson: elizabeth warren, you just -- i got a chance to spend a little time talking to her. and you just love talking to her. she married at 19, pregnant at 22, never thought she was going to go to law school, much less become a law professor. and now everyone from ted kennedy and chuck schumer on the left, to john corn (ph) and john kyl, two u.s. senators on the right, listen to her when she talks about the middle-class economic squeeze. and guess who really loves her, besides our own lou dobbs, maybe, because she talks about the economic squeeze? dr. phil. she's dr. phil's favorite. so i call her lou dobbs meets dr. phil, and she's someone we'll hear a lot from.

o'brien: serious business ahead. wichita police believe they have the btk killer. we'll hear from the district attorney who will prosecute dennis rader.
but i also want to make sure that english-speaking children are getting foreign languages because this world is becoming more interdependent and part of the process of america's continued leadership in the world is going to be our capacity to communicate across boundaries, across borders, and that's something frankly where we've fallen behind.
want to bring in cnn senior political analyst john avlon.
phillips: webster's defines a leader as one who has influence or power, especially of a political nature. several u.s. presidents were former college professors, and a new crop of potential power brokers is emerging from the university sect now. who are these new faces to watch? our political analyst, carlos watson, in mountain view, california, is good at spotting diamonds in the rough. hi, carlos.

this is the latest and, in some ways, the most sinister bit of evidence that this president and his administration do not respect the rule of law. and they are being contained by professionals in agencies who try to tell them that their plans to release detainees on the streets of sanctuary cities, small and mid-sized, by the way, to punish their political enemies cannot be done.

brown: i think one of the points -- i think one of the points that john king was alluding to in talking about some of senator clinton's comments is there has been a lot of attention lately on some of your speeches, that they are very similar to some of the speeches by your friend and supporter deval patrick, the governor of massachusetts, and senator clinton's campaign has made a big issue of this. to be blunt, they've accused you of plagiarism.

question: as president, first of all, what joy can you bring back to this country? and, secondly, what will you do to make each of us proud to be an american? and, lastly, how will you reestablish our dignity and standing in the world community?

and i think what that's about is people tend to look at, like, sanders as democrats want an ultra-progressive, a democratic socialist. i don't think that's it at all. i think the democratic constituency's much more in the middle.
as we know, these men belonged to al qaeda -- a group of extremists who have distorted and defiled islam, one of the world's great religions, to justify the slaughter of innocents. al qaeda's base of operations was in afghanistan, where they were harbored by the taliban -- a ruthless, repressive and radical movement that seized control of that country after it was ravaged by years of soviet occupation and civil war, and after the attention of america and our friends had turned elsewhere.
for many years in california, harris recoiled from questions about her personal life, which helped establish her image as a disciplined and cautious politician. her first book, smart on crime, reflected that private veneer with its narrow focus on policy, drawing from her experience prosecuting crimes that ranged from child sexual assault to homicide in alameda county and san francisco.
howard dean, former presidential candidate: it's early.

we will continue to go through the budget line by line, page by page, to eliminate programs that we can't afford and don't work. we've already identified $20 billion in savings for next year.
this recession has also compounded the burdens that america's families have been dealing with for decades, the burden of working harder and longer for less, of being unable to save enough to retire or help kids with college.
berman: all right, john. we're going to talk much more about this coming up. thank you very much.
what would you do differently on day one than a president obama would when it comes to managing the nation's economy?
and i think there's other things that we should be doing, as well. we just passed the first step act, which is a bipartisan effort in the congress that reduced the federal sentences for non-violent offenders, some of them way too long. and i actually was a cosponsor of that bill.
second, there are those who acknowledge that we can't leave afghanistan in its current state, but suggest that we go forward with the troops that we have. but this would simply maintain a status quo in which we muddle through, and permit a slow deterioration of conditions there. it would ultimately prove more costly and prolong our stay in afghanistan, because we would never be able to generate the conditions needed to train afghan security forces and give them the space to take over.
plus, you can get potentially even more value when you transfer your points to one of chase's 13 travel partners. in fact, the ultimate rewards program still features some of the best transfer partners around, including united airlines, southwest airlines and hyatt hotels, and all partners transfer at a 1-to-1 ratio (meaning you'll get 1 point in the partner program for every 1 point you transfer from chase).
the briefing further breaks down the numbers of who's arriving at the border: in fiscal year 2018, 60,000 unaccompanied minors and 161,000 family units came to the us. the figures appear to be aggregations of people who are determined to be inadmissible by customs and border protection and apprehensions – both are an increase from fiscal year 2017.
you know, there's a lot of talk about how to keep the economy growing. we talk about fiscal matters. but perhaps the best way to keep jobs here in america and to keep this economy growing is to make sure our education system works.

that's why, as we meet here tonight, over 10,000 americans are working with many nations to help the people of haiti recover and rebuild.
then, in early 2003, the decision was made to wage a second war in iraq. the wrenching debate over the iraq war is well-known and need not be repeated here. it is enough to say that for the next six years, the iraq war drew the dominant share of our troops, our resources, our diplomacy, and our national attention -- and that the decision to go into iraq caused substantial rifts between america and much of the world.
i think that, actually, having someone very different than he is, as i just described my background, i think that's really important. and i think the other thing is to have an optimistic economic agenda that you keep pushing. that's going to be important. people want to have something to vote for and someone to vote for and not just someone to vote against.

whether they'll do it or not – with considerations of tight budgets and competing priorities – us attorneys' offices can now begin crackdowns at various points in the billion dollar industry.
that's the work we began last year. since the day i took office, we renewed our focus on the terrorists who threaten our nation. we've made substantial investments in our homeland security and disrupted plots that threatened to take american lives.
unfortunately, too many of our citizens have lost faith that our biggest institutions -- our corporations, our media, and, yes, our government -- still reflect these same values.
he said that in 2016, there were 541 us billionaires with wealth totaling about $2.4 trillion. in 2019, he said, there were 607 us billionaires with wealth totaling about $3.1 trillion.
it added, most americans would be stunned to learn that fda doesn't even have the authority to make recalls like these mandatory.
and then, then, i would say we should start talking about negotiating the nuclear agreements that we have for nuclear arms with russia. one of them, unfortunately, donald trump has already gotten us out of, which has not made the world safer. the other one is called the new start treaty. and it's going to end during a new president's term. and i would immediately start negotiating things.

now, one place to start is serious financial reform. look, i'm not interested in punishing banks. i'm interested in protecting our economy. a strong, healthy financial market makes it possible for businesses to access credit and create new jobs. it channels the savings of families into investments that raise incomes. but that can only happen if we guard against the same recklessness that nearly brought down our entire economy.
one of the biggest supervised injection facilities in the world – certainly in north america – is insite in vancouver, british columbia, thomas said. there's a nurse's station in the middle of the room that has all of the syringes, sterile supplies that they may need, and then they go through the usual process of preparing their drugs and injecting them, all under the supervision of trained staff.

so i think that -- you know, i think people are ready for it. i think it is -- i've thought about this a lot because, actually, in my races, i was the first woman in both jobs i had, as the county attorney and then as the woman senator from my state. and i didn't really talk about it much back then because women had tried to run for the u.s. senate in my state twice, and they were both really qualified, and they didn't make it. and there had been a lot of emphasis on put the first woman in.
why it's great in one sentence: you'll earn 2 capital one miles per dollar on every purchase with the capital one venture credit card, and you can redeem those miles for any travel purchase you make (or, for a limited time, on food delivery and streaming services) at 1 cent per mile, or transfer them to capital one's travel partners for potentially even more valuable redemptions.

but is that who haley wants to be? she was seen as this party's, you know, the hope. i'll get more of that in a second because what the party is dealing with right now is capitulation to this fetid bs.
we need to change the incentives in the supply chain that fuel higher rebates and prices and do more to ensure rebates are used to lower costs for patients at the pharmacy counter, it said in a statement wednesday.
question: vladimir putin and his regime have attacked western democracies throughout the world with fake information, facebook, instagram accounts, and attacked our election in 2016. putin seems to have a disproportional influence over trump and several actors in washington. what are your views on regime change in moscow?

(end video clip) cuomo: never should have been there. she got it, and she should, because it was, is, and always has been obvious, especially as a family like hers, immigrants who felt the sting of being an other.
and we have given the candidates the opportunity to make opening statements. the order was determined by a draw. senator obama won the draw and elected to go second.
what could be better: membership rewards points earned with the blue business plus can be converted to cash back, but at a poor rate of 0.6 cents per point, so small businesses focused on earning cash back instead of travel rewards should instead choose the american express® blue business cash card, which has all the same features as the blue business plus but earns cash back instead of points.
and 21,000 national guard and reserve members get access to health care because i went across the party line and joined up with a republican senator to make that happen.
but san francisco will probably be the first to open one.
and that, you know, the 20 million people who've been paying attention to 19 debates and the editorial boards all across the country at newspapers who have given me endorsements, including every major newspaper here in the state of texas.
i knew from the outset i had to have as broad a focus as possible to cover such a large story. my team of producers, photographers and editors had to look at the latino community through many sets of eyes. i urged our team to break new ground, to not end up rehashing the same old story told of any minority community, that there are anglos unhappy they've arrived. that is not what it means to be latino in america. we had to step back and watch a more complex human story unfold.
also, more emergency rooms now have access to advanced -- and pricey -- technology, such as ct scans and mris, said renee hsia, professor of emergency medicine and health policy at the university of california, san francisco. and patients expect to have more testing done in the er rather than waiting to go to a lab or doctor's office after they are discharged.

why it's great in one sentence: for businesses with less than $50,000 in annual expenses, the blue business plus from american express is a great and simple choice, since it earns a flat rate of 2 membership rewards points for every dollar you spend on all your business purchases up to $50,000 a year, then 1 point per dollar spent thereafter, and all with no annual fee.
and that's why i think comprehensive reform is so important. that's the kind of leadership that i've shown in the past; that's the kind of leadership that i'll show in the future.
facts first: trump is correct. between november 2016, the month of his election, and december 2019, the last month for which we have data, the economy added 7.3 million jobs.

still, crossings at the southern border remain and many of the policies put forth by the trump administration have resulted in prolonged court challenges.

watson: you bet you. professor at loyola marymount, political science professor, grew up in east l.a., first in his family to go to college, decided to go to graduate school to get a ph.d. instead of law school. but now state legislators on either side of the aisle, when they're thinking about state and local issues, they're listening often to fernando guerra. you're going to hear a lot from him. a very interesting mix of policy advice and political advice. call him mr. inside. there's a little bit of karl rove in him.
the idea for the shift in strategy was raised over the past week by top aides, who believed the administration's messaging was not resonating with americans. the idea had been championed by, among others, the acting chief of staff mick mulvaney, and was a topic of discussion at a weekend senior staff retreat at camp david.
the plan that has made all of this possible, from the tax cuts to the jobs, is the recovery act.
and they don't get a sense that the debates that are happening in washington right now relate to them at all. and what they believe is that people are trying to get on tv and they're trying to score points and they're trying to win elections, and that they're not interested in knocking down the barriers that stand between the american people and their dreams.
question 5: is bush entirely to blame for loss of jobs?
thank you, arizona state, for welcoming us.
bernie and i agree on a lot of things, but i think i would make a better president than bernie, she said. getting a progressive agenda enacted is going to be really hard, and it's going to take someone who digs into the details to make it happen. bernie and i both wanted to help rein in wall street. in 2008, we both got our chance. but i dug in. i fought the big banks. i built the coalitions, and i won.
bush: well, his rhetoric doesn't match his record.
you know, there are all kind of statistics out there, but i want to bring it down to an individual.
and so i think it was a confluence, perhaps, where you had the statute of limitations. the legal process had been under seal. the indictment had been under seal in the eastern district of virginia for some time. and then we needed the other factor -- u.s. law enforcement needed the other factor in play, which was the government of ecuador finally making the decision to release him to u.k. authorities. camerota: yes, and it sounds like their patience really ran out with him. i mean, certainly, we hear nick paton walsh's reporting about the conditions that he was living in.

the national sustainable agriculture coalition is seeking changes in the bill before passage, according to senior policy associate kate fitzgerald.
phillips: yes, we do, don't we? although you get all the credit for barack obama, i got to tell you. i just supported you. so you were telling us, ok, since we were so good at nailing barack obama and talking about him and now let's see where he is. you have moved into another genre, i guess you could say, right? the people that we're about to talk to, you see as big movers in politics out of academics.
this card is right for: people with larger than average travel and/or dining expenses who want to redeem their credit card rewards for travel.
but i also know this: if people had made that decision 50 years ago or 100 years ago or 200 years ago, we wouldn't be here tonight. the only reason we are here is because generations of americans were unafraid to do what was hard, to do what was needed even when success was uncertain, to do what it took to keep the dream of this nation alive for their children and their grandchildren.
earn 5% cash back in bonus categories that rotate, up to $1,500 in purchases each quarter.

meanwhile, drug makers are continuing to consolidate. bristol-myers squibb announced thursday a $74 billion deal to buy celgene, in one of the biggest mergers in pharmaceutical industry history.
brown: let me go on, again -- john?
berman: posters more traditional, to be sure.
rosenstein telling the wall street journal, quote, he's being as forthcoming as he can, and so this notion that he's trying to mislead people, i think is just completely bizarre.
so i think that we have to shift policy. i think our goal has to be ultimately normalization. but that's going to happen in steps. and the first step, as i said, is changing our rules with respect to remittances and with respect to travel.
we are in afghanistan to prevent a cancer from once again spreading through that country. but this same cancer has also taken root in the border region of pakistan. that is why we need a strategy that works on both sides of the border.
biden's attacks sanders over gun control votes
still, this is a complex issue. and the longer it was debated, the more skeptical people became. i take my share of the blame for not explaining it more clearly to the american people. and i know that with all the lobbying and horse-trading, this process left most americans wondering, what's in it for me?
so we acted, immediately and aggressively. and one year later, the worst of the storm has passed.
phillips: the best 30 minutes of your life are straight ahead.
to have insurance and to be facing these astronomical bills, i get incensed, said brown. you're in a lot of pain and you have insurance. you are expecting it to be covered.
and, as a consequence, it was much more difficult to get congress to cooperate.
and, by the way, it's time for colleges and universities to get serious about cutting their own costs, because they, too, have a responsibility to help solve this problem.

changing this shameful situation requires three things:
harris describes her focus on immigration as a senator – including her efforts to drill trump officials like former homeland security secretary john kelly on protections for recipients of the deferred action for childhood arrivals program and children crossing the border – as being shaped by watching her mother's experience of being a target as an immigrant in america.
for now, she writes that her centering ritual is the tradition of a sunday gathering of friends and family.
she will launch a media blitz tuesday with appearances on abc's good morning america and the view, followed by a late night interview later this week with cbs' stephen colbert and a series of talks about her book in washington d.c., new york, san francisco and los angeles. her announcement about a presidential run is expected toward the end of this month.
this number is highly misleading and fits a pattern of statements by the administration that have sought to tie immigration on the us-mexico border to islamic terror. the figure, as the department of homeland security writes, represents individuals blocked from traveling to or entering the u.s. – not necessarily along the southwest border. it is not uncommon for an individual named on a federal watchlist to be denied access to a flight at a foreign airport or from obtaining a visa when they apply for entry at an embassy abroad.
i have a plan to cover all americans. we're going to make it affordable and accessible. we're going to let everybody buy into the same health-care plan senators and congressmen give themselves.
in the 21st century, the best anti-poverty program around is a world-class education.
that's what i came to washington to do. that's why, for the first time in history, my administration posts our white house visitors online. that's why we've excluded lobbyists from policy-making jobs or seats on federal boards and commissions.
cuomo: service, sacrifice, and heritage? service to slavery, the sacrifice of the slaves, and the heritage of slavery, that's what it was about.
laura barron-lopez, national political reporter, politico: right. i think that even though pete buttigieg hasn't made this debate with pence a central part of his campaign, it definitely helps him. i mean, any time that a democratic candidate can be seen at odds with either the president or with the vice president, it boosts them. and that could be, also, part of why he's surging in the polls.

though the trump administration rolled out a 44-page blueprint on how to lower drug prices in 2018, few of the president's proposals have gone into effect. a district court judge last year blocked the administration's effort to require drug companies to include list prices in tv ads.
the more that tv pundits reduce serious debates to silly arguments, big issues into sound bites, our citizens turn away.
i think that's really important right now, that we build this coalition, that we not shut people out. and i know he agrees with me on that. but i am the one that actually has the receipts of anyone that you'll see on the debate stage tomorrow night, that's done it. so it's just a different experience that i bring to this and to the job.
kathleen hays, cnn correspondent: hi, miles. ford's car loan unit is being taken to court in a class-action lawsuit alleging its lending practices allowed dealers to discriminate against minorities. the case accuses ford dealers of discriminating against minorities by tacking on larger markups that raised the overall interest rate on their loans -- larger than the rates they would charge to non-whites, that is -- (unintelligible) minorities. lawyers for the plaintiffs say research show minorities are often the targets of those higher markups. ford motor credit is not the first lender to be accused of such discrimination. the financing units at gm, honda and nissan already settled similar suits out of court -- miles.

first, there are those who suggest that afghanistan is another vietnam. they argue that it cannot be stabilized, and we are better off cutting our losses and rapidly withdrawing. i believe this argument depends upon a false reading of history. unlike vietnam, we are joined by a broad coalition of 43 nations that recognizes the legitimacy of our action. unlike vietnam, we are not facing a broad-based popular insurgency. and most importantly, unlike vietnam, the american people were viciously attacked from afghanistan, and remain a target for those same extremists who are plotting along its border. to abandon this area now -- and to rely only on efforts against al qaeda from a distance -- would significantly hamper our ability to keep the pressure on al qaeda, and create an unacceptable risk of additional attacks on our homeland and our allies.
klobuchar has a score of 2.815, ranking first among the 48 democrats in the senate during that time. and warren has a score of .548 and ranks 32nd out of 48 democrats in the senate.

it might be a good idea to be honest about american foreign policy, and that includes the fact that america has overthrown governments all over the world in chile, in guatemala, in iran, sanders continued. and when dictatorships, whether it is the chinese or the cubans do something good, you acknowledge that. but you don't have to trade love letters with them.
sanders encouraged a primary challenge to obama
for what it's worth, i had been in the senate all day. we had six votes and including a resolution to be a check on the president so he doesn't go pell-mell into war with iran. and i got on a plane and got there, i think, at midnight my time and had a fast interview and then did two forums after that, i think, ending at about two or three in the morning.

klobuchar: what a good question. and i want to first of all tell you, heather, i'm so glad you're here and i cannot imagine -- i don't think any of us here can imagine what that was like for you. and you must think about those moments all the time. and...

he has a mandate for parents to be sure to ensure their children. i agree with that. i just know that if we don't go and require everyone to have health insurance, the health insurance industry will still game the system. everyone of us with insurance will pay the hidden tax of approximately $900 a year to make up for the lack of insurance.
king: let's give senator clinton that opportunity then.
camerota: and is that what you think is happening here?
look, we're working with chelsea manning. julian assange was involved in one of the greatest compromises of classified information in american history. it literally put american military personnel at risk, and we'll hold him to account in the american justice system.
and no area is more ripe for such innovation than energy. you can see the results of last year's investments in clean energy in the north carolina company that will create 1,200 jobs nationwide, helping to make advanced batteries, or in the california business that will put 1,000 people to work making solar panels.
clinton: he's also said that if people show up at a hospital sick, without health insurance, well, maybe at that point you can fine them.
we have more people who qualify. that's not what we want.
cuomo: i'd like talk to you about how this is being handled because we don't know enough to proceed about what was done and what the response should be.

... that have been spent, and wants it to continue.
clinton: we are going to rid the tax code of these loopholes and giveaways.
and then i think it is important for us to have the direct contact, not just in cuba, but i think this principle applies generally. i recall what john f. kennedy once said, that we should never negotiate out of fear, but we should never fear to negotiate. and this moment, this opportunity when fidel castro has finally stepped down, i think, is one that we should try to take advantage of.

obama: as i indicated earlier, one of the things that i did last year was to pass a bill with tom coburn, very conservative republican but a sincere fiscal conservative. and we got together and created what we call google for government. it's a searchable database, where every single dollar of federal spending is posted on the internet, so that ordinary voters can take a look. and if they see a bridge to nowhere being built, they know where it's going and who sponsored it. and if they see a no-bid contract going to halliburton, they can check that out, too.

new englanders are digging out from their second major snowstorm in a week. snow is still coming down in maine at this hour where state government workers were told to stay home for the day. traveling is especially tough by air with dozens of flights canceled in new york and boston. in the words of one state trooper in massachusetts, it's horrible out there.
obama: well, i think it is important that everyone learns english and that we have that process of binding ourselves together as a country. i think that's very important.

at the beginning, people were shocked, and he always finds ways to distract us every single day. and then that makes it harder, right, to work on these long-term challenges, some of which we talked about, and things like bringing health care premiums down and doing something about climate change and all of those things. it makes it harder to do, because those are really hard things to work on, because you've got to have -- meet with people and you've got to draft a bill and do all these things. and he's just out there tweeting all the time. so i think that is -- that's the first thing.
i said this is going to distract us from afghanistan; this is going to fan the flames of anti-american sentiment; it's going to cost us billions of dollars and thousands of lives and overstretch our military. and i was right.
the crowd booed. really? sanders said, looking taken aback. really? literacy programs are bad?

what we like about the citi double cash: life is complicated enough right now — not everyone wants to make their credit cards complicated as well. if you don't want to deal with bonus categories, transfer partners or spending caps, you can't get much simpler than the citi double cash.
clinton: now, in addition, there are three ways we need to jump start the economy.
now, even after paying for what we spent on my watch, we'll still face the massive deficit we had when i took office. more importantly, the cost of medicare, medicaid, and social security will continue to skyrocket.

rule may mean more confusion for consumers
but, since we're in texas, i'd like to borrow a phrase that they often use here and you've used yourself in the context of president bush. are you saying that your opponent is all hat and no cattle, and can you say that after the last 45 minutes?

as president, i refuse to set goals that go beyond our responsibility, our means, our or interests. and i must weigh all of the challenges that our nation faces. i don't have the luxury of committing to just one. indeed, i am mindful of the words of president eisenhower, who -- in discussing our national security -- said, each proposal must be weighed in the light of a broader consideration: the need to maintain balance in and among national programs.

so my suggestion is, i think one of the reasons the president has been able to move so far to the right is that there is no primary opposition to him, and i think it would do this country a good deal of service if people started thinking about candidates out there to begin contrasting what is a progressive agenda as opposed to what obama is doing, sanders said on the thom hartmann show in july 2011.
what is your reaction to that?
3. uber problems: it's been a very rough 48 hours for the world's most valuable startup.

we have a huge choice, klobuchar said. do you want to have someone in charge of this ticket who wants to put $60 trillion in spending, three times the american economy? i don't think we do. i think we can get all the bold progressive things done without having someone so alienating that we're going to turn off the voters that we need to bring with us.
daniel martin, a 28-year-old highlands patient who also works in the rafting trade said he uses his new coverage for his monthly blood medication. a trump voter, he hadn't realized that coverage now could be in jeopardy.
the most difficult challenge will be the battle of unrealistic expectations. i think that the attorney general and her team will be able to hit a grand slam in the courts in a lot of these investigations, but there will certainly be a segment of progressives that won't be satisfied with anything other than removal from office,' he said. in my experience, that can drive any attorney general crazy.
the survey also looked into whether adding an entry fee for visits to the wallen/singel areas -- the medieval city center that constitutes the red light district -- would bring tourist numbers down.
we have never historically seen the federal government prosecute people for small possession of marijuana. i think it's highly unlikely the federal government will be using their scarce federal resources to hone in on marijuana users, vicente said.
addressing his history with the controversial stop and frisk policy, mike bloomberg claimed the number of incidents decreased by 95% while he was mayor of new york.

the affordable care act, which president-elect donald trump has vowed to repeal, threw a number of life-savers to these vital but financially troubled centers. and its full repeal, without a comparable and viable replacement, could signal their death knell.

european markets advanced in early trading, with most gains limited to less than 1%. asian markets ended mixed.
avlon: i think that is the cold comfort we can take is that we're living through a civic stress test. but the president's worst impulses, his most autocratic and, you know, vengeful impulses. and those of his senior aides on some of these issues are being contained by administration officials, some of whom are trump appointees, some of whom are simply people who've dedicated their life to serving the people of the united states.

... where you legalized marijuana and where you actually put in place, i think, medical marijuana, and you did that when you made some changes to the legislation and a new governor and the like. and so i think it's really important to look at it as a way of making changes to our drug policy and doing the right thing.
and the fourth thing would be to respond appropriately when things come up around the world, instead of doing tweets in the bathrobe at 5:00 in the morning. and then the fifth thing is to reassert american values around the world. and it really comes down to one r, and that would be to renew sanity. return to sanity in our foreign policy.

it's really interesting, because the president used that very plan as a reason for seniors to accept his prescription drug plan. he said, if it's good enough for the congressmen and senators to have choice, seniors ought to have choice.
since then, we have made progress on some important objectives. high-ranking al qaeda and taliban leaders have been killed, and we have stepped up the pressure on al qaeda world-wide. in pakistan, that nation's army has gone on its largest offensive in years. in afghanistan, we and our allies prevented the taliban from stopping a presidential election, and -- although it was marred by fraud -- that election produced a government that is consistent with afghanistan's laws and constitution.

facts first: klobuchar is right about herself. she did rank among the most effective members of the senate and first among democrats, according to that study. she's also right that warren ranked among the bottom half of democrats. her characterization of sanders' ineffectiveness within the democratic party, though, requires clarification.
the trump administration has insisted it's necessary to hold back doses to ensure americans who receive the first course of the two-dose vaccine will be sure to have access to a second dose. but the move has sparked a debate about whether a better strategy would be releasing all available doses as quickly as possible, particularly amid rising death and hospitalization rates. a study published monday in the annals of internal medicine also found that administering first doses of a covid-19 vaccine to more individuals instead of withholding available supply for use as a second dose may reduce the number of new cases.

and i told her privately what i have said publicly many times -- i will bring him home because i do not think it is in the interest of america or of the iraqis that we continue to be there. it is up to the iraqis to decide the kind of future they will have.
facts first: while it's unclear what measures trump is specifically referencing when he says unprecedented effort, his administration has taken some steps previous administrations haven't and officials have credited those measures with having reduced the influx of migrants into the us.
american democracy doesn't work that way. we don't govern by temper tantrum. no president should pound the table and demand he gets his way or else the government shuts down, hurting millions of americans who are treated as leverage.
but the president could have put pressure on the saudi king to give information about this guy. i mean this president has said all of islam is out to get us. we don't know that the man is muslim. but it is the predominant religion there.
we have to crack down on those employers, although we also have to make sure that we do it in a way that doesn't lead to people with spanish surnames being discriminated against, so there's got to be a safeguard there.

it's, first of all, renewing american leadership in the world. it's secondly -- don't worry, i won't go through them that long -- the second one is to repair our relationships with our allies, something we've talked about tonight. the third one is to renegotiate back into international agreements. i mentioned the russian nuclear arms agreements, but also the iranian nuclear agreement, which this president got us out of, which i didn't think was the right thing.

but pete buttigieg was the mayor of south bend, indiana, at zero or minus in the polls to months ago. and now he's ahead of people who have been in the senate. he's ahead of people who live next door to new hampshire. there is clearly something happening with this south bend mayor.
taken together, these additional american and international troops will allow us to accelerate handing over responsibility to afghan forces, and allow us to begin the transfer of our forces out of afghanistan in july of 2011. just as we have done in iraq, we will execute this transition responsibly, taking into account conditions on the ground. we will continue to advise and assist afghanistan's security forces to ensure that they can succeed over the long haul. but it will be clear to the afghan government -- and, more importantly, to the afghan people -- that they will ultimately be responsible for their own country.
question: question: senator, we love how even and reasonable you are, but how would you compete with the bombast of trump? would you be lost in the shuffle?
the fact is: we all agree that we need to secure our borders, while honoring our values: we can build the infrastructure and roads at our ports of entry; we can install new technology to scan cars and trucks for drugs coming into our nation; we can hire the personnel we need to facilitate trade and immigration at the border; and we can fund more innovation to detect unauthorized crossings.
... companies that begin when an entrepreneur -- when an entrepreneur takes a chance on a dream or a worker decides it's time she became her own boss.
so what i have said is, yes, there are places when after a careful review, again listening to the people who live along the border, there may be limited places where it would work. but let's deploy more technology and personnel, instead of the physical barrier.
that's a good move, said martin makary, professor of surgery and health policy at johns hopkins university. when patients come to the er, they don't need to sign any paperwork promising to pay in full, makary said. federal law requires emergency rooms to screen and stabilize anyone who comes through the doors.

we find that under most plausible scenarios, a more balanced approach that withholds fewer doses during early distribution in order to vaccinate more people as soon as possible could substantially increase the benefits of vaccines, while enabling most recipients to receive second doses on schedule, write the study's authors, who were supported by the canadian institutes for health research and the us centers for disease control and prevention.

right now, we know that rudy giuliani is - is supposedly doing that. we have reason to believe from the phone records that he has talked to the president from there before. and we know that gordon sondland did that as well.
over the past several years, we have lost that balance. we have failed to appreciate the connection between our national security and our economy. in the wake of an economic crisis, too many of our friends and neighbors are out of work and struggle to pay the bills, and too many americans are worried about the future facing our children. meanwhile, competition within the global economy has grown more fierce. so we can't simply afford to ignore the price of these wars.
so the first thing you do is you make sure you have an attorney general in place that is going to make this a priority. that's number one.

and, you know, there were rocky periods during my youth, when i made mistakes and was off course. and what was most important, in my life, was learning to take responsibility for my own actions, learning to take responsibility for not only my own actions but how i can bring people together to actually have an impact on the world.

buttigieg repeatedly turned the conversation to the effect that sanders' liberal ideology could have on house members in once-red districts that were flipped to blue in 2018. he said that if sanders becomes the democratic nominee it would mean four more years of donald trump, kevin mccarthy as speaker of the house and the inability to get the senate in democratic hands.
in the end, our security and leadership does not come solely from the strength of our arms. it derives from our people -- from the workers and businesses who will rebuild our economy; from the entrepreneurs and researchers who will pioneer new industries; from the teachers that will educate our children, and the service of those who work in our communities at home; from the diplomats and peace corps volunteers who spread hope abroad; and from the men and women in uniform who are part of an unbroken line of sacrifice that has made government of the people, by the people and for the people a reality on this earth.

turnout was expected to be high heading into the primary. according to the most recent cnn tracking poll conducted by university of new hampshire, 74% of adults in new hampshire said they were extremely or very interested in the 2020 primary election and a similar three-quarters said they would definitely vote.

that july 25th phone call is the smoking gun here, where the president of the united states is asked by the ukrainian president in one portion, we need those anti-tank missiles.

early in the debate, sanders used an inaccurate figure that had been provided to his campaign by a progressive think tank that, among other things, keeps track of the fortunes of billionaires.
so, let's get to the analysis of what we do know now, what the right questions are going forward.
the balance transfer offer does come with a 3% fee, though that's comparable to other credit cards with similar balance transfer features. and the citi double cash doesn't offer a sign-up bonus, which means other cards might be more rewarding right out of the gate, though the double cash will catch up with long-term use.
obama: now, i think that senator clinton has a fine record and i don't want to denigrate that record. i do think there is a fundamental difference between us in terms of how change comes about. senator clinton of late has said: let's get real. the implication is that the people who've been voting for me or involved in my campaign are somehow delusional.
customs and border protection data counts nearly 17,000 criminal aliens encountered by the office of field operations and the border patrol in fiscal year 2018. but it should be noted that large portions of the immigrants being arrested at the southwest border committed nonviolent crimes, like illegal entry or re-entry – the act of crossing into the us illegally – and driving under the influence of alcohol. customs and border protection statistics measure immigrants convicted of crimes in the us or abroad.

what could be better: business travel isn't likely to be top-of-mind for most businesses right away even after the pandemic subsides, so if you'd rather earn cash back instead of miles, you can look at the capital one® spark® cash for business card as an option. it earns 2% cash back on all purchases and its $95 annual fee is waived the first year, but it's missing a few perks such as 5x on car rentals and hotels at capital one travel and a global entry/tsa precheck credit.

why it's great in one sentence: for those who'd rather pay no interest on purchases for as long as possible instead of earning cash back or travel rewards, the u.s. bank visa platinum card offers 0% interest on all purchases for the first 20 billing cycles you have the card (the interest rate rises to a variable 14.49% to 24.49% after the introductory period ends).

but we've got five people today, kyra, beginning with a woman by the name of caroline hoxby, who is a professor at harvard, economics professor. but although she's an economics professor, she's actually having her biggest impact on education. so she's helping lots of states, from florida to texas, decide how do we help our kids learn? do we do it through smaller class sizes? do we increase teacher pay? does bilingual education make a difference? should we do charter schools? she's a name you're going to hear a lot. could be end up being a secretary of education, maybe even a secretary of the treasury. she's going to be a big deal.
but the president could also have said, you know, i have the assurances, firm assurances from the government of saudi arabia, the king himself, that they're going to cooperate, leave no stone unturned.
also making sure the officers showing the picture doesn't know who it is, that can make a big difference. using everything from dna reviews to making sure that both our police departments and our prosecutors' offices are diverse makes a big difference. and i just think we have to come to grips with the fact that while we must keep our communities safe, you can do that at the same time you get at the institutional racism that we have in the criminal justice system.

but as we end the war in iraq and transition to afghan responsibility, we must rebuild our strength here at home. our prosperity provides a foundation for our power. it pays for our military. it underwrites our diplomacy. it taps the potential of our people, and allows investment in new industry. and it will allow us to compete in this century as successfully as we did in the last. that is why our troop commitment in afghanistan cannot be open-ended -- because the nation that i am most interested in building is our own.

but while we have achieved hard-earned milestones in iraq, the situation in afghanistan has deteriorated. after escaping across the border into pakistan in 2001 and 2002, al qaeda's leadership established a safe haven there. although a legitimate government was elected by the afghan people, it has been hampered by corruption, the drug trade, an under-developed economy, and insufficient security forces. over the last several years, the taliban has maintained common cause with al qaeda, as they both seek an overthrow of the afghan government. gradually, the taliban has begun to take control over swaths of afghanistan, while engaging in increasingly brazen and devastating acts of terrorism against the pakistani people.

third, approximately 300,000 people from countries including el salvador, honduras and haiti, who have lived and worked legally in the united states for decades thanks to tps, face the very real possibility of deportation in 2019 because the trump administration plans to allow most protections to expire. instead of kicking out families whose countries of birth continue to face or recover from conflict, environmental disaster and other challenging conditions, we should cement their contributions to our country by putting them on a path to legal status and eventual citizenship.
i was trying to communicate that we cared about katie. we were going to go to any extent we could to help her achieve her dream of being a college football kicker, he said. no matter what her ability was, we were trying to find a way to make sure she had a chance to do this.
i would meet without preconditions, although senator clinton is right that there has to be preparation. it is very important for us to make sure that there was an agenda, and on that agenda was human rights, releasing of political prisoners, opening up the press. and that preparation might take some time.
take, for example, the ban on partial birth abortion. it's a brutal practice. people from both political parties came together in the halls of congress and voted overwhelmingly to ban that practice. it made a lot of sense. my opponent, in that he's out of the mainstream, voted against that law.
toobin: it is bizarre. and obviously, it had been worked out in advance, so both sides knew it was coming. but, i mean, here you have michael jackson talking about his childhood and, you know, being beaten by his father, and his mother and brother, i believe it's randy, sitting there sort of nodding their heads about how terrible it was with their father. you have michael -- you know, his back is to us. so we can't see michael's reaction, but, you know, the jurors, you know, some of the stuff in the bashir documentary is really very funny -- when martin bashir, who was in the courtroom, tries to dance with michael, it's funny, and the jurors are laughing.
i think we have to respect that.
carrie cordero, cnn legal analyst: i think it certainly was a factor. and i think it's important to keep in mind that this case against him and the investigations involving him and the process of extradition, this would have been work that was done behind the scenes by law enforcement and prosecutors and diplomats from the u.s., the u.k. and ecuador, which was housing him for some time.
during that time, you can charge purchases to the card and pay them off slowly without incurring any interest at all. that's a longer intro period than almost any credit card on the market, so it's a good way to finance a large emergency purchase or even just daily expenses if you're in a pinch.

facts first: trump is correct about the recent decline, but he's cherry-picking the most favorable possible starting point: may 2019 was the month with the largest number of illegal crossings at any point in his presidency. the total number of illegal crossings under trump has increased, not decreased, from the late obama era.
i do not make this decision lightly. i opposed the war in iraq precisely because i believe that we must exercise restraint in the use of military force, and always consider the long-term consequences of our actions. we have been at war for eight years, at enormous cost in lives and resources. years of debate over iraq and terrorism have left our unity on national security issues in tatters, and created a highly polarized and partisan backdrop for this effort. and having just experienced the worst economic crisis since the great depression, the american people are understandably focused on rebuilding our economy and putting people to work here at home.

cnn reported last month that the trump administration's response to coronavirus was being coordinated by the white house's national security council. but the nsc does not currently have a person dedicated to overseeing global health issues. that position was restructured in 2018, and a current official with a similar purview has less authority than the former official.

i think one of the reasons that president obama has moved as far to the right as he has is he thinks he can go all the way and no one will stand up to him, sanders added.
that's about a 24-point spread there, kyra. back for o.j. simpson, there were 40-point spreads between the percent of whites who thought he was probably guilty of murder and african-americans. so although the race difference is there in this case, not nearly as pronounced as ten years ago.

facts first: bloomberg accurately pointed to a us intelligence community belief that russia is trying to help sanders' campaign. russia also backed sanders in the 2016 primary, but sanders has publicly denounced russian interference in us politics.

i proposed a constitutional amendment. the reason i did so was because i was worried that activist judges are actually defining the definition of marriage, and the surest way to protect marriage between a man and woman is to amend the constitution.

and as far as mexico in general, i think i was the first one on the stage, yes, who gave my support to the united states-mexican-canadian trade agreement, which i think got much better because of the hard work of people like my friend sherrod brown, in terms of some labor provisions, and earned the support of the president of the afl-cio richard trumka.

imagine spending the better part of 2020 with bernie sanders versus donald trump, buttigieg said.

mary dodgen, jury coordinator: i hope it will get better. i know i had trouble sleeping, and i've had some dreams that i remember. i know they say we all dream, but some of these dreams have been more like nightmares.
to address these issues, it is important to recall why america and our allies were compelled to fight a war in afghanistan in the first place. we did not ask for this fight. on september 11, 2001, 19 men hijacked four airplanes and used them to murder nearly 3,000 people. they struck at our military and economic nerve centers. they took the lives of innocent men, women and children without regard to their faith or race or station. were it not for the heroic actions of the passengers on board one of those flights, they could have also struck at one of the great symbols of our democracy in washington, and killed many more.

thank you so much for being with us, and let me start with a little news. after nearly half a century in office, fidel castro resigned as the head of the cuban government. ninety miles off the coast of the united states, we might have a new opportunity.

first, it should augment the more than 600 miles of physical barriers (or a wall) we already have on the southern border with better infrastructure, new and advanced technology and more personnel at ports of entry. the latter would slow the movement of illegal drugs, 80% of which go through our ports. smarter border security would also prime the economy by enabling more efficient cross-border commerce, which currently is slowed because of a shortage of personnel to process trade.

the book is a rallying cry against what harris views as the un-american policies of the trump administration, alongside her set of policy alternatives. she casts herself as a champion for everyday americans against the powerful, and she is unsparing in her disdain for the policies of president donald trump. she notes that after her own victory speech in 2016, she watched the returns with her husband in a state of shock, eating an entire family-size bag of classic doritos. didn't share a single chip.
plus, we need fiscal discipline. restore fiscal discipline, we'll do a lot better.
obama: senator clinton and i share a lot of policy positions. but if we can't inspire the american people to get involved in their government and if we can't inspire them to go beyond the racial divisions and the religious divisions and the regional divisions that have plagued our politics for so long, then we will continue to see the kind of gridlock and nonperformance in washington that is resulting in families suffering in very real ways.

i have a 6 million-person organization around this country: moms demand action and everytown, bloomberg said. we have got background checks in 20 states. so you can do it. it's congress that can't seem to do it. and i don't know why we think they're going to do it. the vice president voted for a death bill, and supported the nra. and certainly senator sanders has supported the nra.

the administration has released similar data points in the past, though it's unclear at times where the information has been pulled from. during a news conference friday in the rose garden, president donald trump, flanked by nielsen, among others, cited some of these figures as reasons for a border wall, which he's argued would stem the flow of migrants to the border.
the white house counsel's office continues to deliberate on the legality of the step. trump has been under pressure from informal advisers and allies to take the step, which officials was still possible in the coming days.

klobuchar: yes, i was just in reno. it was great.
and if you think this doesn't matter, i use an example of an image -- this wasn't a paid ad, but an image that went out to african-american facebook pages in the 2016 election. and we had it and displayed it in the judiciary committee. it was an innocent woman, innocent african-american woman from chicago. they put her face on an image with a fake hillary logo. and it said, why wait in line to vote? this is in 2016. you can text your vote to 86513. made up some number.
obama: one other thing that i've said, as a show of good faith that we're interested in pursuing potentially a new relationship, what i've called for is a loosening of the restrictions on remittances from family members to the people of cuba, as well as travel restrictions for family members who want to visit their family members in cuba.
that's why the international community is more united and the islamic republic of iran is more isolated. and as iran's leaders continue to ignore their obligations, there should be no doubt: they, too, will face growing consequences. that is a promise.

every day, americans meet their responsibilities to their families and their employers. time and again, they lend a hand to their neighbors and give back to their country. they take pride in their labor and are generous in spirit.

sen. kamala harris' unique biography and unlikely political ascent might have been summed up best by a political strategist who incorrectly predicted her defeat in the 2010 california attorney general's race.
she's already made history by becoming the first woman in new york to be elected to the office. she is also the first african-american woman to serve as the state's top attorney and the first black woman to be elected to statewide office.

the move is one of three trump administration efforts to overhaul snap. another proposed regulation, which would tighten the rules governing who qualifies for aid, could end up stripping more than 3 million people of their benefits and leave nearly 500,000 children without access to free school meals. the third proposal would change how allowances for utility expenses are calculated, which would have a mixed impact. the agency is still working on the latter two proposals.
clinton: because he recognizes that unless we have some kind of restriction, we will not get there.

because i think we should look for ways that we can possibly move countries that are adversarial to us, you know, toward the world community. it's in our interests. it's in the interests of the people in countries that, frankly, are oppressed, like cuba, like iran.
the administration has steadfastly refused to take steps that would restore funding to some agencies, believing the shutdown is its best leverage to secure the wall funds. fearing he could lose a messaging battle as more americans feel the pain of a shuttered government, trump escalated his warnings that the country is unsafe without the border wall he promised as a candidate.
newport: they're split on that issue. we have a slight majority, i think, who would prefer that the pope, as you see here, stay in office. 43 percent of american catholics say he should resign for health reasons. apparently he will not do that. it was the 12th century or 13th century, i think, when the last pope resigned before for passing away.
ukraine is probably the most thoroughly-penetrated country on earth by the russian intelligence service. they operate almost com - with complete freedom there. rudy giuliani is known as a close adviser, and confidant, and counselor of the president.

but that i say he's not the problem here. rudy is the agent. that's all he is. if he's right about all of it, burisma, the bidens, ukraine, fine. present the evidence. let's see what we do about it. it doesn't change the analysis. it's not about rudy.
and i think it has to be a priority for whoever the next president is to be able to overcome the dominance of the special interests in washington, to bring about the kinds of economic changes that i'm talking about.
the second thing that we can do is provide a fair trade playing field. this president didn't stand up for boeing when airbus was violating international rules and subsidies. he discovered boeing during the course of this campaign after i'd been talking about it for months.

sen. barack obama: first of all, thank you so much to the university of texas for hosting us, and it's a great honor to share the stage once again with senator clinton. i've said before that we've been friends before this campaign started; we'll be friends afterwards, unified to bring about changes in this country.

all told, by the time i took office the cost of the wars in iraq and afghanistan approached a trillion dollars. going forward, i am committed to addressing these costs openly and honestly. our new approach in afghanistan is likely to cost us roughly $30 billion for the military this year, and i will work closely with congress to address these costs as we work to bring down our deficit.

that's why i fight against poverty. that's why i fight to clean up the environment and protect this earth.
and, you know, in the last week, even president bush has said we have to do something like that.
for unlike the great powers of old, we have not sought world domination. our union was founded in resistance to oppression. we do not seek to occupy other nations. we will not claim another nation's resources or target other peoples because their faith or ethnicity is different from ours. what we have fought for -- what we continue to fight for -- is a better future for our children and grandchildren, and we believe that their lives will be better if other peoples' children and grandchildren can live in freedom and access opportunity.
the president and i share the belief that marriage is between a man and a woman. i believe that. i believe marriage is between a man and a woman.
senator clinton and i, i think, both agree on many of these issues. and i think it's a credit to the democratic party as a whole that the other candidates who were involved earlier on agreed with us on many of these issues.
san francisco residents are also generally supportive of the idea. a poll conducted by david binder research in january among 500 registered voters found that 67% of respondents backed the idea, while 27% opposed it and 6% didn't know.
this wikileaks stuff is unbelievable. it tells you the inner heart. you've got to read it. it's been amazing what's coming out on wikileaks.
the spike in spending was driven almost entirely by an increase in the prices charged by hospitals, even as er usage remained relatively flat. the spending covers the hospitals' charges for stepping foot in the er, known as a facility fee, as well as some tests and services. it doesn't include er evaluations by doctors, who usually send patients a separate bill.
more than one-third of democratic voters going to the polls in new hampshire's first-in-the-nation primary said health care was the most important issue in determining their vote.

trump chose to deliver the address after weekend talks between administration officials and democrats failed to generate a deal that could reopen the parts of government closed by the shutdown.
we've done an incredible job, the president said. i think you're gonna see a tremendous reduction in drug prices.
you can do that, craig. it might not stop child trafficking, but it will save many children like m.c.
that doesn't mean, however, that all special interest aliens are terrorists, according to dhs.
bryan mcmullin, a 47-year-old who works in connellsville's river-rafting business, got coverage last year but said good health care remains hard to come by. in this area, nothing's changed in 40 years, no matter who is president, he explained from a barstool at a pub near the now-vacant glass factory.
and she said as she was sobbing in that firehouse, she had this thought of that school aide, because she knew that that woman would never leave her son's side. and when they found them in that school, that woman had her arms around that little boy. and they were both shot to death.

the dhs presentation asserts that border security is the only effective disincentive to prevent migrants from making the dangerous journey and reducing the influx of vulnerable families. some academic scholars and advocates, however, rebut the idea that deterrence policy works in situations where people are fleeing dangerous conditions, which has become a more prevalent driving factor for migrants journeying to the southern border. since 2010, the population of people coming to the us-mexico border has shifted as a result of deteriorating conditions in el salvador, honduras and guatemala, otherwise known as the northern triangle.

and if we don't inject this sort of reciprocity in our relations, we - we end up with a situation where you end up with bad allies, chris, and worse adversaries. and that is in fact the conundrum that the united states faces in the middle east today.
obama: so we've got to fix that.
as a result, millions of americans had more to spend on gas and food and other necessities, all of which helped businesses keep more workers. and we haven't raised income taxes by a single dime on a single person, not a single dime.
i also think that economic issues for women and men are key. getting an increase to the minimum wage, the federal minimum wage, that has not happened for literally nearly a decade would be really important for a lot of women workers.

cuomo: right. you know, he learned from that guy, from tom tancredo. he learned that that could be effective with a certain population of his party.
obama: it's the reason that i have the capacity to bring people together, and it's the reason why i am determined to make sure that the american people get a government that is worthy of their decency and their generosity.
obama: i support the eventual normalization. and it's absolutely true that i think our policy has been a failure. i mean, the fact is, is that during my entire lifetime, and senator clinton's entire lifetime, you essentially have seen a cuba that has been isolated, but has not made progress when it comes to the issues of political rights and personal freedoms that are so important to the people of cuba.

finally, there are those who oppose identifying a timeframe for our transition to afghan responsibility. indeed, some call for a more dramatic and open-ended escalation of our war effort -- one that would commit us to a nation building project of up to a decade. i reject this course because it sets goals that are beyond what we can achieve at a reasonable cost, and what we need to achieve to secure our interests. furthermore, the absence of a timeframe for transition would deny us any sense of urgency in working with the afghan government. it must be clear that afghans will have to take responsibility for their security, and that america has no interest in fighting an endless war in afghanistan.
where our benchmark card is better: the citi double cash earns cash back rewards on all purchases.
that is untrue, categorically untrue, sanders responded.
cuomo: all right, like i said, as soon as they tell me that the press conference is ready, i think we should listen to it. yes, we have a lot of other show planned but, you know, we can get fresh information on this very primary interest of why did this person do this.
during the prior nine debates, sanders' democratic rivals had tried a lighter touch -- quibbling with the cost of his ideas or arguing that they couldn't possibly make it through congress. but with the south carolina and super tuesday contests just days away, they adopted a far sharper tone during the cbs debate in charleston as they sought to knock sanders from his front-runner perch.

the next sentence, virtually out of the president's mouth, is i need you to do us a favor though.
to close that credibility gap, we have to take action on both ends of pennsylvania avenue, to end the outsized influence of lobbyists, to do our work openly, to give our people the government they deserve.
clinton: well, i have said that about president bush, and i think our next president needs to be a lot less hat and a lot more cattle.
still, if you need to pay no interest on both your new and existing debt for an extended period, the citi diamond preferred is potentially worth the extra cost to buy yourself time to get back on track and firm up your financial picture.

i took on health care because of the stories i've heard, from americans with pre-existing conditions whose lives depend on getting coverage, patients who've been denied coverage, families, even those with insurance, who are just one illness away from financial ruin.

and -- but there's still more to be done. we just talked about sentencing reform. i think there needs to be more done when it comes to grand jury reform. when i was there, i worked on eyewitness identification and making sure that when police showed witnesses pictures, that they showed them one at a time, instead of all at once, because it's been proven there's mostly racially involved misidentifications when you do it that way.

one last point i want to make on this, and that is, the incredible burden that has been placed on the american people, starting with military families, and the fact that we still are not doing right by our veterans, that we still don't honor their service, that there are still homeless veterans, that we still don't screen properly for post-traumatic stress disorder and make sure that they're getting mental services that they need, that we are still...

second, 2021 must see a coordinated effort at the local, state and national levels to eradicate the thousands of racist policies that keep too many black americans at the bottom of the well of this society. criminal justice reform is the tip of the iceberg on this score. eliminating the cash bail system and disparate sentencing for crack versus powdered cocaine, releasing non-violent drug offenders and transforming a juvenile justice system that disproportionately harms black children should be at the top of the policy agenda.
meanwhile, he issued another executive order in late 2017 that would make it easier for americans to buy alternatives to the affordable care act that are cheaper, but offer fewer protections, such as short-term health plans . the law's defenders, however, fear that such plans could siphon off younger and healthier people, which could cause premiums to rise for those left buying policies in the obamacare exchanges.
in order for you to force people to get health insurance, you've got to have a very harsh penalty, and senator clinton has said that we won't go after their wages. now, this is a substantive difference. but understand that both of us seek to get universal health care. i have a substantive difference with senator clinton on how to get there.

obama: well, i think actions do speak louder than words, which is why over the 20 years of my public service i have acted a lot to provide health care to people who didn't have it, to provide tax breaks to families that needed it, to reform a criminal justice system that had resulted in wrongful convictions, to open up our government and to pass the toughest ethics reform legislation since watergate, to make sure that we create transparency...

uniontown, about 15 miles away, is also in fayette county. it has 175 beds — more than double highlands — but no behavioral health services to treat problems like addiction. frick, another small rural hospital about 12 miles away, technically serves neighboring westmoreland county. for more serious conditions, and trauma care, university hospitals are about an hour away — in pittsburgh on one end, and morgantown, west virginia, on the other. patients in extremis often get stabilized at the local hospitals before transfer.

in the back-and forth-about deaths due to gun violence, biden's use of the 150 million figure was inaccurate. when cnn asked about it, his campaign said he misspoke. about 413,000 people in the us have died from gun violence since 2007. biden is correct that that figure is more than the number of military casualties since the vietnam conflict.

finally, we must draw on the strength of our values -- for the challenges that we face may have changed, but the things that we believe in must not. that is why we must promote our values by living them at home -- which is why i have prohibited torture and will close the prison at guantanamo bay. and we must make it clear to every man, woman and child around the world who lives under the dark cloud of tyranny that america will speak out on behalf of their human rights, and tend to the light of freedom, and justice, and opportunity, and respect for the dignity of all peoples. that is who we are. that is the source -- the moral source of america's authority.

sanders shot back by speaking directly to putin: let me tell mr. putin, who interfered in the 2016 election -- try to bring americans against americans, the vermont senator said. hey, mr. putin, if i'm president of the united states, trust me, you're not going to interfere in any more american elections.
and then i think the other piece of it is how, when you put yourself -- i was just talking about, before the break, putting yourself in the shoes of other people. you know, not everyone agrees with everything that's said on the democratic debate stage. i don't agree with everything that's said there. and there are a lot of people out there who are independents or moderate republicans, or people who maybe stayed home in 2016, who see this as a patriotism check on this president.
and i think that's why we see, and there was a poll last summer that showed for the majority of hunters, this was a fox poll, and it said the majority of hunters actually supported universal background checks.
so our suggestion is a simple one: mr. president: re-open the government and we can work to resolve our differences over border security. but end this shutdown now.

allergan raised prices on 51 drugs on january 1, just over half its portfolio. some 27 medications saw a 9.5% jump and the rest a 4.9% increase. the company, however, said it does not expect to see any net gains since it is also providing higher rebates and discounts to insurers, pharmacy benefit managers and the government.
obama: and i've said that i'm going to do things differently. i think we have to open up the process. everybody has to have a seat at the table. and most importantly, the american people have to be involved and educated about how this change is going to be brought about.

clinton: you know, the hits i've taken in life are nothing compared to what goes on every single day in the lives of people across our country.
here's where the doj decision could really bare its teeth. by empowering us attorneys to decide on their own whether or not to prosecute the sale of marijuana in states that have decriminalized it, risk for industry movers is greater.

a note on the term crisis: part of the white house counsel's office review of declaring a national emergency has included laying the groundwork for a legal defense of the move, according to officials familiar with the matter. that has included advising the president's aides on ramping up talk of the humanitarian and security crisis — a characterization that administration lawyers could use later in court to defend a national emergency.

one mother in green bay gave me this bracelet in memory of a 20- year-old son who had been killed in a roadside bomb, as a consequence of a war that i believe should have never been authorized and should have never been waged and has cost us billions of dollars that could have been invested here in the united states in roads and bridges and infrastructure and making sure that young people can go to college and that those who need health care actually get it.
cuomo: all right, so there is someone who knows a lot more about the ukraine showdown than even maybe some congressional investigators. has vladimir putin been closely listening in on president trump's calls?
and i ask you -- i ask you to join in my campaign. it's now up to the people of texas, ohio, and the other states ahead.

so, you know, such is life. and -- and i would say to the mayor, this isn't like a game of jeopardy. this is about, to me, experience. and i have so much respect for him and his experience. but my experience is different. i have been in the senate. i have passed over 100 bills as the lead democrat. i think that matters.
and contrary to conventional wisdom, there's actually a bipartisan deal within reach – something like the dreamers-for-border-security proposal that failed narrowly in the senate last february, when eight republicans joined 46 democrats, but fell short of the 60-vote threshold to proceed to final passage. an updated version should pair smart border security with solutions for the more than 1 million immigrants protected under deferred action for childhood arrivals (daca) or temporary protected status (tps) programs who could soon lose their legal status.
obama: i'm running for president because i want to help america be as good as its promise.

we can't afford another so-called economic expansion like the one from last decade, what some call the lost decade, where jobs grew more slowly than during any prior expansion, where the income of the average american household declined while the cost of health care and tuition reached record highs, where prosperity was built on a housing bubble and financial speculation.

clinton: but the fact is that the purpose of it has not been fulfilled. the iraqi government has slowly inched toward making a few of the decisions in a less than complete way, but it hasn't taken advantage of the sacrifice and the losses of life and billions of dollars that have occurred since the surge began.
because, ultimately, that's what's at stake. understand, not only have we been diverted from afghanistan. we've been diverted from focusing on latin america.
after nearly a century of trying -- democratic administrations, republican administrations -- we are closer than ever to bringing more security to the lives of so many americans.
i think the second thing is to be very firm in our relationships with vladimir putin. we know that this isn't just about interfering in our election. we know that under his regime that they have done things like poisoned dissidents, like went after and killed journalists, like brought down planes, like invading ukraine, which i'll never forget being there with the ukrainians on the front line on new year's eve with my friend, john mccain, one of the last trips that he took.

in the past, we too often defined our relationship with pakistan narrowly. those days are over. moving forward, we are committed to a partnership with pakistan that is built on a foundation of mutual interests, mutual respect and mutual trust. we will strengthen pakistan's capacity to target those groups that threaten our countries, and have made it clear that we cannot tolerate a safe haven for terrorists whose location is known, and whose intentions are clear. america is also providing substantial resources to support pakistan's democracy and development. we are the largest international supporter for those pakistanis displaced by the fighting. and going forward, the pakistani people must know: america will remain a strong supporter of pakistan's security and prosperity long after the guns have fallen silent, so that the great potential of its people can be unleashed.

obama: madam speaker, vice president biden, members of congress, distinguished guests, and fellow americans, our constitution declares that from time to time the president shall give to congress information about the state of our union. for 220 years, our leaders have fulfilled this duty. they've done so during periods of prosperity and tranquility, and they've done so in the midst of war and depression, at moments of great strife and great struggle.

my question is, how can you or any president, whoever is elected next time, keep that pledge without running this country deeper into debt and passing on more of the bills that we're running up to our children?

it is easy to forget that when this war began, we were united -- bound together by the fresh memory of a horrific attack, and by the determination to defend our homeland and the values we hold dear. i refuse to accept the notion that we cannot summon that unity again. i believe with every fiber of my being that we -- as americans -- can still come together behind a common purpose. for our values are not simply words written into parchment -- they are a creed that calls us together, and that has carried us through the darkest of storms as one nation, as one people.
british tourist allan claydon, 24, told cnn travel in 2020 he agreed with this take -- adding that he didn't think curbing coffee shop culture would change amsterdam's appeal for visitors.
gallup: well, kyra, we look at the data, poll after poll, and the country is still divided. now, in the short term, the numbers go up and they go down a little. this is a question -- we've showed it to you before here on cnn. we started asking this about korea, actually, many, many years ago. now we're asking it about the iraq situation. was it a mistake to be involved?
while trump is known for his ad-libbed remarks rife with false claims, he tends to stick to the script for formal speeches such as the state of the union. nonetheless, here are the facts around what the president said in his third state of the union.

[06:05:11] and for that, they come under intense political pressure. this is deeply, deeply troubling if this is the instinct of the president and his political advisers to try to pull off kind of a domestic mariel boatlift, to disrupt and undercut his perceived political opponents in america's cities and towns.
as we take the fight to al qaeda, we are responsibly leaving iraq to its people. as a candidate, i promised that i would end this war, and that is what i am doing as president.
until then, i want you all to know that we are working this together. we are going to work this around the clock. this is a 24/7 operation. we need to do this for 24/7 because we got to get this right for the community, and everybody gets the answers that they deserve.
so i think it's important -- or they think of it as a decency check. i have met so many people that see it in those eyes.
in the end, that wasn't hard because there are so many great untold stories to tell about latinos that i knew would interest an audience of any racial or ethnic origin. the numbers of latinos are exploding and spanning out into places where latinos have never been seen before. their impact on the united states is awesome.
a, that's a heck of a lead. b, retaliate against political adversaries with human beings.
cuomo: it doesn't have to be effected.

more than anything, the stories have to be good, the story lines compelling and the people in them interesting. if no one watches, then i've accomplished nothing. the communities i cover have their own high expectations. people see this as a rare chance for good reporting about their communities to make it to television and they expect a lot. it can be exhausting to be reduced to your race and ethnicity. you can be made to feel bad about where you come from or feel bad about succeeding or feel like you're not a part of a community because your experience is different. my cuban-born mother is wonderful on this topic. this woman who didn't teach her children spanish did teach us pride.
tonight – and throughout this debate and his presidency – president trump has appealed to fear, not facts. division, not unity.
sanders on medicare for all health spending
my first thought was what a terrific opportunity this was for me! after so many years of fighting for fair and accurate coverage of people of color, i finally had a chance to work on a wide-ranging project that could show all americans a fuller picture of who latinos are and what they mean to this country. i vowed to give voice to the part of the community i knew, an optimistic, family-centered people who infuse u.s. culture with the warmth of their humanity.

throughout this period, our troop levels in afghanistan remained a fraction of what they were in iraq. when i took office, we had just over 32,000 americans serving in afghanistan, compared to 160,000 in iraq at the peak of the war. commanders in afghanistan repeatedly asked for support to deal with the reemergence of the taliban, but these reinforcements did not arrive. that's why, shortly after taking office, i approved a long-standing request for more troops. after consultations with our allies, i then announced a strategy recognizing the fundamental connection between our war effort in afghanistan, and the extremist safe havens in pakistan. i set a goal that was narrowly defined as disrupting, dismantling, and defeating al qaeda and its extremist allies, and pledged to better coordinate our military and civilian efforts.

they must look to provide affordable health care for every american. while some major democratic candidates for president in 2020 favored a medicare for all plan , president-elect joe biden has vowed instead to add the public option to obamacare -- reviving a measure that failed to pass in 2010. but we are long past the time for policy tinkering with the health of americans. of those who insist that medicare for all is unaffordable we should ask another question: how can we afford not to? medicare for all would increase jobs, employment and tax revenue through massive public investments that could increase worker productivity, economic mobility and ensure that families and children's health care would not be tied to a single job or eliminated amidst a pandemic.
and that is also an argument that we have to have with john mccain because he has said that he is willing to have these troops over there for 100 years. the notion that we would sustain that kind of effort and neglect not only making us more secure here at home, more competitive here at home, allow our economy to sink. as john mccain says, he doesn't really understand the economy that well. it is clear from his embrace of george bush's policies that he doesn't, and that's what i intend to change when i am president of the united states of america.
matt bingham, smith county district attorney: the actions of these officers is what prevented this defendant from -- this killer from getting into the back of the courthouse. reaves: the courthouse reopened to the public, although the east door remains boarded up, bullet holes in the glass and the marble wall. just to the left of the door, mary dodgen is back on her job as jury coordinator, but coming back wasn't easy.

between february 2017, trump's first full month in office, and december 2019, the economy added 6.7 million jobs, according to the bureau of labor statistics. jobs added in january 2020 and the early days of this month likely took the total under trump even closer to 7 million. the jobs report for january is due on friday. but pre-election, trump said he would create 25 million jobs. regarding the projection it was not immediately clear what trump was referring to.
we're here in charleston, and you know who is going to be in charleston later this week? it's donald trump, warren said. he's going to be here to raise money for his buddy, senator lindsey graham. who funded lindsey graham's campaign for reelection last time? it was mayor bloomberg. and that's not the only right-wing senator that mayor bloomberg has funded.

obama: senator clinton and i have both campaigned in places like iowa and ohio and my home state of illinois, and i think that the american people want fairness, want justice. i think they recognize that the idea that you're going to deport 12 million people is ridiculous, that we're not going to be devoting all our law enforcement resources...

i think that implementing that is going to be the job of the new president, making sure that those provisions are strong and that we enforce the trade agreement to help our workers. and i also think having a president, unlike this president, who's going to reach out to our allies immediately -- in my first 100 days i will be meeting with the president of mexico, the president -- the prime minister of canada, justin trudeau, as well as so many of our allies around the world. i think that has to immediately happen with the new president.

and tonight -- tonight, i'd like to talk about how together we can deliver on that promise.

facts first: bloomberg's statement is mostly accurate. the trump administration eliminated key white house positions that handled global health issues, and, while it didn't fully defund the cdc, the administration did cut funding to the federal agency.
from some on the right, i expect we'll hear a different argument, that if we just make fewer investments in our people, extend tax cuts, including those for the wealthier americans, eliminate more regulations, maintain the status quo on health care, our deficits will go away.
and the saudis have spent a lot of money in his hotels, on his properties in new york. it may be an interest that comes into play.

vermont sen. bernie sanders , the current front-runner after winning the nevada caucus, faced attacks over his recent defense of some of the actions of fidel castro following the 1959 cuban revolution. sanders also had to defend his recently released plan to pay for his legislative proposals such as medicare for all, free college, and various debt forgiveness ideas.
my community embraced this project from the outset with an enthusiasm i'd not expected. total strangers approached me with advice and assistance. over and over, i was asked to please report on the people who are so often ignored, the latinos who do not reflect the illegal alien who crosses the border to steal american jobs.

in other words, he did a specific thing to try to assist chelsea manning to crack a password to get unauthorized access into department of defense procedures. and so what the justice department is going to argue is that is not traditional journalist behavior.
i believe that this president, regrettably, rushed us into a war, made decisions about foreign policy, pushed alliances away. and, as a result, america is now bearing this extraordinary burden where we are not as safe as we ought to be.

plus, the hospital is connellsville's second-largest single employer (pdf), after the school district. it contributes an estimated $15 million to the local economy, andursky said. that's in a town where unemployment's already at 7.6 percent — up from last year and higher than the state and national averages.
but when i ran for president, i promised i wouldn't just do what was popular, i would do what was necessary. and if we had allowed the meltdown of the financial system, unemployment might be double what it is today. more businesses would certainly have closed; more homes would have surely been lost.
i was first forced into prostitution when i was 11 years old by a 28-year-old man, m.c. wrote. i am not an exception. the man who trafficked me sold many girls my age, his house was called 'daddy day care.'

miller: well the risk is if - you basically reinforce bad behavior. you create the logic in the mind of an already impulsive and reckless crown prince that in fact mr. trump and the administration will have their back, and empirically, that's exactly what the saudis have concluded. that's the risk.
there's no uniform definition of the term special interest alien, but dhs defines a special interest alien as a non-us person who, based on an analysis of travel patterns, potentially pose a national security risk to the united states or its interests. someone might be flagged for additional vetting because of where they're traveling from or how they arrived in the us.
how? well, a new credit card could help by temporarily letting you finance the things you need to buy at 0% interest, or consolidating debt at a lower interest rate. or perhaps you just want to make sure you're earning as many rewards as possible when you're ordering online or having food delivered to your home.

buttigieg: i'm not interested in feuding with the vice president. but if he wanted to clear this out, he could come out today and say he's changed his mind, that it shouldn't be legal to discriminate against anybody in this country for who they are. that's all.
ramos: senator clinton, yesterday you said, and i'm quoting, one of us is ready to be commander in chief.

under the banner of this domestic unity and international legitimacy -- and only after the taliban refused to turn over osama bin laden -- we sent our troops into afghanistan. within a matter of months, al qaeda was scattered and many of its operatives were killed. the taliban was driven from power and pushed back on its heels. a place that had known decades of fear now had reason to hope. at a conference convened by the u.n., a provisional government was established under president hamid karzai. and an international security assistance force was established to help bring a lasting peace to a war-torn country.

but there has been this difference between us over when and whether the president should offer a meeting, without preconditions, with those with whom we do not have diplomatic relations. and it should be part of a process, but i don't think it should be offered in the beginning. because i think that undermines the capacity for us to actually take the measure of somebody like raul castro or ahmadinejad and others.
donald trump, president of the united states: the king said that the saudi people are greatly angered by the barbaric actions of the shooter, and that this person in no way, shape, or form, represents the feelings of the saudi people who love the american people so much.
in the years since, she continues, we've seen an administration align itself with white supremacists at home and cozy up to dictators abroad; rip babies from their mothers' arms in grotesque violation of their human rights; give corporations and the wealthy huge tax cuts while ignoring the middle class; derail our fight against climate change; sabotage health care and imperil a woman's right to control her own body; all while lashing out at seemingly everything and everyone, including the very idea of a free and independent press. we're better than this.

james campaigned on promises to investigate the president and his business dealings and has pushed for the passage in the state assembly's first 100 days of legislation that would allow her to pursue state charges for anyone the president pardons on federal charges – a hedge against any efforts by trump to undo convictions won by special counsel robert mueller or federal prosecutors investigating various trump associates.
facts first: trump's claim about protecting those with pre-existing conditions is false. though trump says he would do this, his administration has consistently taken steps to undermine the affordable care act -- including joining a lawsuit aimed at striking down the law -- without presenting alternative plans that would offer similar benefits.

sadly, much of what we have heard from president trump throughout this senseless shutdown has been full of misinformation and even malice.

you may recall way back in, when was it,1961 they invaded cuba and the, everybody was totally convinced the castro was the worst guy in the world. all the cuban people were going to rise up in rebellion against fidel castro, sanders said, discussing the logic behind the kennedy administration's failed bay of pigs coup. they had forgotten that he educated the kids, gave them health care, totally transformed the society.

brown: but that's different from your position back in 2003. you called u.s. policy toward cuba a miserable failure, and you supported normalizing relations.
clinton: and as president, i would look for opportunities to try to make that happen and to create the momentum that might eventually lead to a presidential visit.
but there has to be evidence that indeed the changes are real; that they are taking place; and that the cuban people will finally be given an opportunity to have their future determined by themselves.

capital one's transfer partners also include only one u.s. airline option (jetblue), though advanced card holders will be able to leverage international airline alliances to score domestic redemptions. but if you think you'll mix in some airline transfers even down the line, the venture card serves as a great beginner gateway to the world of transferable points.
and then on may the 2nd, most likely after he's sentenced, he'll have an extradition hearing. that is to face this indictment in the united states, which specifies that he worked with chelsea manning to try and crack part of a password that would have enabled chelsea manning to masquerade as an administrator in a u.s. computer system during the iraq and afghanistan wars, classified information here, so she could have downloaded that. well, he at the time, bradley manning, could have downloaded that and then released it through wikileaks.
cordero: exactly right, alisyn. so the passage that you just put up, that's really the crux of this particular indictment and charge against him.
and john, i want to read the lead from the washington post. rachael bade, one of the reporters, will be with us a little bit later, which is great to hear from her.

facts first: biden's number is incorrect. when cnn asked about it, his campaign said he misspoke. he's also wrong about when the vote occurred. it was 2005, not 2007. fewer than half a million people in the us have died by gun violence since 2005 -- but he's correct that it's more than the number of military casualties since the vietnam conflict.
and you know, in one of our earlier debates, john edwards made a great point. it would be as though social security were voluntary. medicare, one of the great accomplishments of president johnson, was voluntary.

bush: i think it's important to promote a culture of life. i think a hospitable society is a society where every being counts and every person matters.
from the day i took office, i've been told that addressing our larger challenges is too ambitious, such effort would be too contentious. i've been told that our political system is too gridlocked and that we should just put things on hold for a while.
despite a contentious few weeks, the budget impasse – which has not reflected positively on the new era of divided government – provides a rare opportunity for democrats and republicans to come together. that's because americans still overwhelmingly believe immigration to the united states is a good thing.

when i released my plan a few months later, we were in a debate and senator clinton said we all want universal health care. of course, i was down 20 points in the polls at the time, and so my plan was pretty good. it's not as good now, but my plan hasn't changed. the politics have changed a little bit.
trump and top white house officials have in recent days begun speaking more about the humanitarian crisis at the border, which democrats say is real but of the administration's own making. a surge of families seeking asylum has strained health and child care facilities, and two children have died in us custody.
the vaccines by pfizer/biontech and moderna are both about 95% effective after two full doses.
these claims were debunked at the time as exaggerations and speculation. though they've made a comeback this year. white house press secretary sarah sanders was fact-checked live on fox news when she said sunday nearly 4,000 known or suspected terrorists come into our country illegally, and we know that our most vulnerable point of entry is at our southern border.

anderson cooper, cnn host: whatever's going on there, i mean, if you look at the president when he's outside, these - it's clearly it's not a light bulb problem. you can see the line around his face where the makeup, or the tanner, whatever it is, stops. it's a whole system. it's a whole thing.

at home, we'll do everything we can to protect the homeland. i signed the homeland security bill to better align our assets and resources. my opponent voted against it.
facts first: the unemployment rate for americans with disabilities is lower than at any point in the obama administration, but it did go up from 6.1 percent in september of last year to 7 percent in december. in addition, describing this as an all-time low obscures the fact that the government has only tracked this data since 2008.

sanders tried to fend off the attacks by condemning russian meddling in the 2016 election and warning putin that he wouldn't be a russia-friendly president.

well, i do not accept second place for the united states of america.

you know, just this week, it's a good example. we had elections in pakistan, we had change in government in cuba -- or at least the leadership. we've had the elections that, you know, should have happened that haven't happened and just changed the leader the way they do in cuba. we've had kosovo declaring independence, and we have had our embassy set on fire in serbia.
while sanders has acknowledged he'd have to raise taxes on the middle class, he hasn't laid out specifically how he would cover the tab.
but after that moment, he was continually on defense.

having the option to convert the card's cash back to citi thankyou points when you have certain other citi cards is useful to points and miles experts, but the thankyou program's airline transfer partners can be challenging to leverage for beginners, who might want to just stick with the card's cash back rewards.

pfizer, for instance, is not on rx savings solutions' list. that's because the company announced in november that it would raise prices on 41 drugs, but not until january 15. the manufacturer temporarily walked back hikes last summer after trump tweeted that it should be ashamed for raising prices and taking advantage of the poor.
car rental loss and damage insurance included.
what you need to know about public pools
but we've had this conversation before, senator obama and myself, and i believe that we should have full diplomatic engagement where appropriate. but a presidential visit should not be offered and given without some evidence that it will demonstrate the kind of progress that is in our interest, and in this case, in the interests of the cuban people.
my fellow americans, there is no challenge so great that our nation cannot rise to meet it. we can re-open the government and continue to work through disagreements about policy. we can secure our border without an expensive, ineffective wall. and we can welcome legal immigrants and refugees without compromising safety and security.
democrats and republicans, you've trimmed some of this spending. you've embraced some meaningful change, but restoring the public trust demands more. for example, some members of congress post some earmark requests online.

you know, they don't like that we have a president that stood next to a ruthless dictator in vladimir putin, and when asked about russian interference in the election, made a joke about it. think about it. hundreds of thousands of americans have lost their lives on the battlefield standing up for democracy. that's what world war ii was about. four little girls at the height of the civil rights movement lost their life because they were innocent, trying to be part of that democracy and other people were trying to shove them out of that democracy.

i don't know that at this point in time you can say anything has gone wrong, he said. i think there are a lot of allegations. at this date, there has yet to be anything proven, there has yet to be any charges brought.
but when we see what's been happening, with literally babies being left with no one to take care of them, children coming home from school, no responsible adult left, that is not the america that i know.
and i personally, as president, would work with our neighbors to the south, to help them create more jobs for their own people.
in an interview with cnn, david bier, an immigration policy analyst at the cato institute, explained that a syrian christian who asks for asylum, for example, would be classified as a special interest alien simply because he/she is from syria. according to a report from the libertarian think tank, no special interest alien has produced a terrorist attack on us soil.
the border security roundtable has wrapped after a little over an hour.

you can see at one point, the percent who said yes was 52 percent, then it was down. now it's at 47 percent in our last poll. slightly more say it was not a mistake. so a little more optimism there. but kyra, there's no way around it, the public is still split on iraq and pessimistic about the long-term need for troops there in iraq. here's the question. you see it in front of you. look at the bottom two rows there. we've got two-thirds of americans who think it may be necessary to have u.s. troops there three or more -- three years or longer than that -- kyra.
about gun owners and the interaction with the second amendment. so my state actually is a pretty big hunting state. and so i look at these proposals and i always say, do they hurt my uncle vic (ph) in the deer stand? and they don't.
releasing nearly all vaccine doses on hand could quickly ratchet up the availability of coronavirus vaccines by allowing more people access to a first dose. it could also be a risky strategy as both pfizer/biontech and moderna's vaccines require two doses, administered at specific intervals, and vaccine manufacturing has not ramped up as rapidly as many experts had hoped.
trump: we have a situation where we're looking very strongly at sinks and showers and other elements of bathrooms where you turn the faucet on in areas where there's tremendous amounts of water, where the water rushes out to sea because you could never handle it, and you don't get any water.
... having veterans in south texas have to drive 250 miles to access a veterans hospital.
the debate was heated and chaotic with multiple candidates often shouting over one another in what became an incomprehensible garble of words. but with sanders rising, even in south carolina -- which biden once claimed was his firewall -- their imperative was clear.
know, i don't mind that he has this money, that's a great thing he made that money. but we want to make sure that we have the best candidate to lead the ticket. and i don't think that when people look at donald trump they automatically say, hmm, can we get someone richer?

klobuchar: ok. so i think the way that you get people in other countries to want to believe in actually having a democracy is by having strong leaders in your own democracies -- i will start with that -- that respect democracies.
this week -- this week, i'll be addressing a meeting of the house republicans. i'd like to begin monthly meetings with both democratic and republican leadership. i know you can't wait.

good evening. to the united states corps of cadets, to the men and women of our armed services, and to my fellow americans. i want to speak to you tonight about our effort in afghanistan -- the nature of our commitment there, the scope of our interests, and the strategy that my administration will pursue to bring this war to a successful conclusion. it is an honor for me to do so here at west point where so many men and women have prepared to stand up for our security, and to represent what is finest about our country.
i've been campaigning now for the last two years. deval is a national co-chairman of my campaign, and suggested an argument that i share, that words are important. words matter. and the implication that they don't i think diminishes how important it is to speak to the american people directly about making america as good as its promise. barbara jordan understood this as well as anybody.

talk to the single teacher raising two kids who was told by her principal in the last week of school that, because of the recovery act, she wouldn't be laid off after all.
facts first: trump's claim is correct, but it needs context. drug overdose deaths declined in 2018 for the first time since 1990, 28 years prior. the centers for disease control and prevention found that there were 67,367 drug overdose deaths in the united states in 2018, a 4.1% decline from 70,237 deaths in 2017.
what could be better: the citi double cash is a no-frills credit card, so you won't find any fancy travel or dining perks on it, nor are there any significant travel or purchase protections. you also won't want to use this card for overseas purchases when travel resumes, as the 3% foreign transaction fee will offset the rewards you earn.
and then it's possible in the united states he will face further charges. now, there will be intense political debate here. his pretty substantial defense team already using the open court system to make a very clear case that he's a journalist who published information who's being persecuted. the indictment says he conspired to commit a criminal act. it will be up to u.k. judges to decide his fate -- alisyn.
the allegation comes a day after head coach gary barnett was suspended from the program for comments demeaning the only woman to have ever played on the team. katie hnida, a colorado placekicker in 1999, has alleged she was raped by a teammate.
and it's better connected than ever: shenzhen and neighboring hong kong are already linked by rail, but a new bullet train opening this fall will cut the travel time from 1.5 hours down to just 20 minutes.
the seeds of a solution are planted. mr. president, it's time to make a deal.
what could be better: the amex gold earns points that can be redeemed a number of ways, but are best used for travel. that means you'll likely want to hold off on redeeming the points you earn with this card until travel resumes more broadly. so, if you're looking for a card with rewards that you can use more immediately, you might be better off with a cash back card.
phillips: well, let's hear what the public is saying about the jackson trial. gallup editor-in-chief frank newport is in princeton, new jersey, crunching the latest poll numbers for us. frank, race has been an underlying issue in this case. is there a difference in the way african americans and whites are viewing it?
meanwhile, president trump embracing controversial comments from his attorney general, william barr.

i think that there is a real, solid agenda for moving change forward in the next presidency.
we will also have a different approach toward trade.
so no -- i do not make this decision lightly. i make this decision because i am convinced that our security is at stake in afghanistan and pakistan. this is the epicenter of the violent extremism practiced by al qaeda. it is from here that we were attacked on 9/11, and it is from here that new attacks are being plotted as i speak. this is no idle danger; no hypothetical threat. in the last few months alone, we have apprehended extremists within our borders who were sent here from the border region of afghanistan and pakistan to commit new acts of terror. this danger will only grow if the region slides backwards, and al qaeda can operate with impunity. we must keep the pressure on al qaeda, and to do that, we must increase the stability and capacity of our partners in the region.
president trump, who spoke in front of a display of stacks of drugs, guns and cash seized at points of entry, opened the event by praising border patrol agents as heroes and said they're highly respected in our country.
how do you plan to do that?
meanwhile, moderates such as biden, buttigieg and minnesota sen. amy klobuchar favor building on the affordable care act. they would add to the obamacare exchanges a government-backed public option, which would presumably have lower premiums and would compete with the private insurers. they would also boost federal subsidies so more people could afford coverage.
so we can do a better job of homeland security. i can do a better job of waging a smarter, more effective war on terror and guarantee that we will go after the terrorists.
so, you look, and we did this at - at the fbi, and say, if we have tens of thousands, just in saudi arabia's case alone, tens of thousands of students coming in, you can't say you're going to close the door to that number of students.

and it also undercuts, in a significant way, the president's, one of his primary defenses, which is that he was - he was pressuring ukraine, not for his own benefit, but rather to address legitimate corruption issues.
and it lives on in all the americans who've dropped everything to go someplace they've never been and pull people they've never known from the rubble, prompting chants of usa! usa! usa! when another life was saved.

klobuchar: well, thank you. and i think we know, if you didn't know it was going on, when you look at what just happened in new york city, the rabbi's home, where this stabbing occurred. can you imagine, at a time that was supposed to be joyful, of a holiday, and you have this madman, anti-semitic, coming in and stabbing people in the rabbi's home? we've seen that time and time again in this country.
cooper: also, i assume you'd allow your national security staff to listen in to the call?
latinos are a people who celebrate the new culture they've created in the united states while struggling each day with whether we need to assimilate or integrate into this new society. we ask ourselves what good things we want to preserve from our culture and what american values we want or need to adopt. and that question never goes away, not one, two or three generations beyond immigration.
a number of those senators that voted for it, republicans, are still there today. and that bill back in 2013 got stopped, i think it ended up in john boehner's freezer when he was speaker of the house next to the frozen peas. and the point of it is nancy pelosi is now the speaker. i believe that if i am our candidate for the president, we are going to be able to win big and make sure we keep the house and win in these senate districts like in arizona, right, and in colorado, and make a change.

you know, i think if you talk to those wounded warriors at walter reed who, prior to me getting to the senate, were having to pay for their meals and have to pay for their phone calls to their family while they're recovering from amputations, i think they've said that i've engaged not just in talk, but in action.
obama: we're going to make sure that we reduce costs by emphasizing prevention. and i want to make sure that we're applying technology to improve quality, cut bureaucracy.

clinton: well, jorge, i hope we have an opportunity. the people of cuba deserve to have a democracy. and this gives the cuban government, under raul castro, a chance to change direction from the one that was set for 50 years by his brother.
blumenthal: well, first of all, as you have observed very correctly, the president has given the saudis a very wide berth. and the exact reasons for it are somewhat a mystery. he has financial interests that may be coming into play.
cuomo: born here, by the way, the person they were talking about.
miami gardens, florida - may 06: florida gov. ron desantis speaks during a press conference at the hard rock stadium testing site on may 06, 2020 in miami gardens, florida. gov. desantis announced during the press conference that a covid-19 antibodies test will be available. the test can show if a person has had the virus in the past without showing symptoms, and therefore may be immune to it. the test will be available to first responders and health care workers first, with the goal of being able to expand testing to the general public.

it's critical in covering a community well to report both the good and the bad. i learned so much about reporting on race and some unexpected lessons about the stress of being a woman of color in the media. but by the time the project ended, i felt like i had started an important conversation about the struggles and the successes of the african-american community.
now through april 30, 2021, points can also be redeemed for purchases at grocery stores, dining establishments and home improvement stores at a rate of 1.25 cents per point.

cuomo: this moment was a defining moment for then-governor nikki haley, when the confederate flag came down at south carolina state, at the capitol, and after the charleston church massacre. it was big. it meant a lot all over the country and for her personally.
lisa gilbert, vice president of legislative affairs at the nonprofit advocacy group public citizen, said james' past rhetoric could give her critics  some success in the court of public opinion.
and so, working as a community organizer on the streets of chicago, with ordinary people, bringing them together and organizing them to provide jobs and health care, economic security to people who didn't have it, then working as a civil rights attorney and rejecting the jobs on wall street to fight for those who were being discriminated against on the job -- that cumulative experience, i think, is the judgment that i now bring.
and we're on track to add another 1.5 million jobs to this total by the end of the year.
shenzhen might be a hub of shopping and manufacturing, but it's also endearingly offbeat.

in the past, there have been those in pakistan who have argued that the struggle against extremism is not their fight, and that pakistan is better off doing little or seeking accommodation with those who use violence. but in recent years, as innocents have been killed from karachi to islamabad, it has become clear that it is the pakistani people who are the most endangered by extremism. public opinion has turned. the pakistani army has waged an offensive in swat and south waziristan. and there is no doubt that the united states and pakistan share a common enemy.

on the specific issue of pork barrel spending, fiscal accountability by the government at a time when many americans frankly think, whether it is the house or the senate, that you all waste money on things that aren't important to them, don't affect their daily lives, does he have a better case to make to the american people that, i have done this my entire career; i will do it as president, on the issue of on the issue of wasteful pork barrel spending?

second, it should end once and for all the uncertainty around the daca program – a limited version of which lives on, for now, because of court rulings that have blocked the administration's attempt to end it. the nearly 800,000 young people with daca status earn degrees, work and contribute to the american story. a solution for them is the right thing to do, and a daca deal could help the president start to win back some of the suburban voters who handed control of the house to democrats in november.

the hispanic unemployment rate was 4.2% in december 2019 -- an uptick from the 3.9% all-time low in september 2019 but, again, lower than any point under any other president for whom we have data.

the yearlong effort of black in america was exhausting for me. i was one of a handful of black voices on the staff, and each day was a meshing of ideas and backgrounds and cultures. in other words, we argued a lot. i compiled everything. i learned new things about the black community that i'd lived in and covered my entire life. the result was a four-hour documentary that earned terrific reviews, got more viewers than almost any cnn documentary and started a discussion about the community of which i continue to be proud.

but i said before, i think she did it in the wrong way, because it wasn't just the fact that the insurance companies, the drug companies were battling here, and no doubt they were. it was also that senator clinton and the administration went behind closed doors, excluded the participation even of democratic members of congress who had slightly different ideas than the ones that senator clinton had put forward.

washington may think that saying anything about the other side, no matter how false, no matter how malicious, is just part of the game. but it's precisely such politics that has stopped either party from helping the american people. worse yet -- worse yet, it's sowing further division among our citizens, further distrust in our government.

nick paton walsh, cnn international correspondent: john, behind me, i think, in the ecuadorian embassy, they're probably breathing a sigh of relief, maybe even cleaning up after their lengthy unwelcome house guest, even reports from ecuadoran officials of feces on the walls at some point, damage to the building's infrastructure.

we will have all of our combat troops out of iraq by the end of this august.
klobuchar: i think the need has become clearer and clearer. and we were so close in 2013. george bush worked valiantly, actually, to try to get that done. and back then they had -- it was right-wing talk radio defeated it. then you go to 2013 and president obama had come in in the middle of the downturn. he tried it in his second term and he worked really hard as well.
roof, who was not legally allowed to purchase a firearm due to a pending illegal drug possession case, was able to buy a handgun because the database that was supposed to flag roof's pending case, the national instant criminal background check system managed by the fbi, didn't include the pending case details. due to a clerical error, the information was never submitted to that database.

sanders was the clear favorite among this group, garnering support from more than three in 10. buttigieg and klobuchar each attracted 1 in 5 of these voters, while biden was the pick of 1 in 10. warren, who has also campaigned on health care, landed in the single digits among this group.

this is the kind of absurdity that we're getting from this administration. i know it because i've been fighting with them about the northern border. their imposition of passports and other kinds of burdens are separating people from families, interfering with business and commerce, the movement of goods and people.

berman: he makes a pledge on family separations, which will be interesting to hear what he says on that.
since the days of franklin roosevelt, and the service and sacrifice of our grandparents and great-grandparents, our country has borne a special burden in global affairs. we have spilled american blood in many countries on multiple continents. we have spent our revenue to help others rebuild from rubble and develop their own economies. we have joined with others to develop an architecture of institutions -- from the united nations to nato to the world bank -- that provide for the common security and prosperity of human beings.

in other words, in order to make sure we're secure, there must be a comprehensive plan.
they all know trump was wrong to do what he did, how he did it, and why he did it. they know. they were more righteous about clinton's escapades than this obvious escapade to procure foreign help in the election.
two years ago, we were able to get a bill out of the senate. i was one of the group of senators that helped to move it through, but it died in the house this year. because it was used as a political football instead of a way of solving a problem, nothing happened.
i'm not saying he's responsible for the nine deaths, but that man would not have been able to get that weapon, biden said.
and another was my great friend ann richards, who taught me so much...
redeem miles for any travel purchase at a rate of 1 cent per mile.
blumenthal: it doesn't have to be effected, and it can be an act that would have been done. anyway, it is soliciting bribery amounts to asking for a favor or a personal benefit in return for performing an official act.
us intelligence leaders have said that russia routinely tries to sow discord among the american public and amplify voices on the extremes of the political spectrum, to inflame divisions and undermine the stability of american democracy. their past support for sanders and trump, who have both antagonized their own parties, fits into this big-picture strategy.
but azar said friday that he worries that might backfire if manufacturing goes wrong.
so they have something to look to. when you look at what happened with the fall of the iron curtain and other moments in history, a lot of people in those countries who were desperate for examples of beacons of democracy would look to our own country. so making sure that our democracy is working and that we have a president that actually believes in democracy is key.
senator, back in 2006, you voted for the construction of that fence. as you know, progress has been slow.
watson: you bet. already a big name in legal circles, former supreme court clerk himself, former assistant attorney general, helped draft the patriot act. in conservative circles, people absolutely love him. rising star. professor at georgetown. and he's someone who, like al gonzales, could have lots of big jobs. could be a white house counsel, a solicitor general, maybe even get talked about one day for a supreme court spot.

we will meet these objectives in three ways. first, we will pursue a military strategy that will break the taliban's momentum and increase afghanistan's capacity over the next 18 months.
enten: i - i - i think that the economy is not the silver bullet that he necessarily thinks it is, although it's certainly rather helpful because, you know, if you take a look here, what we see is trump standing on the economy, his approval rating 55 percent in our latest poll, but that is below his overall approval rating of 42 percent.

obama: that's unacceptable. but we talked about the economy earlier, the fact that we're spending $12 billion every month in iraq means that we can't engage in the kind of infrastructure improvements that are going to make us more competitive. it means that we can't deliver on the kinds of health care reforms that both senator clinton and i are looking for.

facts first: that's not quite true. the president was citing the 12-month change in the consumer price index for prescription drugs for december 2018, when it dropped 0.6%. that was the largest (but not the first) decrease since april 1973, not in 51 years. at last year's state of the union he said drug prices experienced their single largest decline in 46 years.

cuomo: probably shouldn't call him the wiz given the context of that conversation. but i did. it's too late.
yet huge challenges remain. afghanistan is not lost, but for several years it has moved backwards. there is no imminent threat of the government being overthrown, but the taliban has gained momentum. al qaeda has not reemerged in afghanistan in the same numbers as before 9/11, but they retain their safe havens along the border. and our forces lack the full support they need to effectively train and partner with afghan security forces and better secure the population. our new commander in afghanistan -- gen. mcchrystal -- has reported that the security situation is more serious than he anticipated. in short: the status quo is not sustainable.
and i remember sitting up there and watching them come in. those who could walk were walking. those who had lost limbs were trying with great courage to get themselves in without the help of others. some were in wheelchairs and some were on gurneys. and the speaker representing these wounded warriors had had most of his face disfigured by the results of fire from a roadside bomb.
brown: senator obama, is your position the same as hillary clinton's?
so when you think about everything that is going to happen, what we can predict and what we cannot predict, i believe that i am prepared and ready on day one to be commander in chief, to be the president, to turn our economy around, and to begin making a lot of these very difficult decisions that we will inherit from george bush. and that is what i am putting forth to the voters.
you look at how you can look for the signs, right? some of this is everything from schools to social media and, by the way, having enough counselors and other people in the schools to identify this, which, as you know, as we talked about gun violence, is not just about mass shootings. it's also about everyday violence and what we can see.
trump: i think what he said was absolutely true. there was absolutely spying into my campaign. i'll go a step further. in my opinion, it was illegal spying, unprecedented spying.
here are six of the best:
on the question of pakistan, which senator clinton just raised -- we just had an election there. but i've said very clearly that we have put all our eggs in the musharraf basket. that was a mistake. we should be going after al qaeda and making sure that pakistan is serious about hunting down terrorists, as well as expanding democracy. and i was right about that.
and i think that initiating that change in policy as a start and then suggesting that an agenda get set up is something that could be useful, but i would not normalize relations until we started seeing some of the progress that senator clinton was talking about.
several residents who voted in manchester told cnn that health care was their top priority and influenced their vote.
now that 2021 is well underway and vaccines are being rolled out across the country, many people are taking stock of their personal finances and, in many cases, trying to get things back in order after the challenges of last year. and while it may seem counterintuitive to think about credit cards if you're still having money issues due to the pandemic, the right credit card can be a useful tool in your financial arsenal.
now, i'm going to reverse that. i'm going to change that. we're going to restore the fiscal discipline we had in the 1990s.

president donald trump and democratic lawmakers alike are pressuring drug makers to lower prices, but they don't seem to be listening.
but i also know this problem is not going away. by the time i'm finished speaking tonight, more americans will have lost their health insurance. millions will lose it this year. our deficit will grow. premiums will go up. patients will be denied the care they need. small-business owners will continue to drop coverage altogether.
and it's - it's a willingness on the part of the administration to understand that relationships in this part of the world have to be reciprocal that you don't simply apply honey in response to a security partner or an ally. sometimes, it's necessary to - to apply vinegar as well.
and so those kinds of stories and making sure that people know that kind of interfaith alliances that still exist and are so strong and having a president that wants to talk about it, i think that makes a big difference, too. it's knowing how you enforce the laws. it's putting people in place that will do it. but it is also having the heart to actually make it a priority.
people, many of them my own co-workers, asked me to push past the rancor of the immigration debate, which has strayed from being a discussion of policy and law enforcement to one that demonizes and stereotypes and hurts people whether they are illegal immigrants or not.
the last thing we want to do as a government is to inhibit these regional food systems by poorly crafted regulation, she said. under the proposed legislation, a farmer selling broccoli heads would be classified as a farmer, but a farmer selling broccoli florets would be classified as a facility and subject to more rigorous controls, she said.
so, their job is to go out and collect information about what our leadership is thinking, what they're planning to do, and how they're going to execute those actions. there is no bigger target in the world for policies, plans, and intense information than the president of the united states. he is the crown jewel of all targets.
senator obama, beginning with you, tell us as specifically as you can, how would a president obama be different than a president clinton in managing the nation's economy?
cuomo: all right, something very important has come up. the president's bringing it to our attention, and i pass it along to you right now.
andrew mccabe, cnn contributor: ok. so, here's why it matters. the job of every foreign intelligence service is to collect what - what professionals refer to as information about the policies, plans, and intents, of your adversary.
what i'm saying is is that as we promote life and promote a culture of life, surely there are ways we can work together to reduce the number of abortions: continue to promote adoption laws -- it's a great alternative to abortion -- continue to fund and promote maternity group homes; i will continue to promote abstinence programs.
