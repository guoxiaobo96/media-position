What we like about the Costco Anywhere Visa: For those looking to fill up their vehicle's gas tank, the Costco Anywhere Visa offers the most cash back when compared to other top-earning credit cards.
Why it's great in one sentence: The Costco Anywhere Visa Card by Citi offers big rewards on many practical purchases, such as 4% cash back on eligible gas purchases worldwide (capped at the first $7,000 in purchases per year, then 1% thereafter), 3% cash back at restaurants and on eligible travel purchases and 2% cash back on all Costco and costco.com purchases.

In the lead-up to the address, the President and his advisers made a public show of considering a national emergency declaration to secure funding for the border wall, a drastic step that would surely be challenged in court.

(CNN) International travel (and possibly even big summer vacations) could be back in full swing this year , and the travel industry is already preparing.
So, instead of sticking with a credit card that earns rewards for a vacation that isn't happening in the near future, why not consider a credit card that earns you cash back almost instantly?

Another adviser to Trump said the President has been receiving advice telling him he should declare the state of emergency so he has something to sell to his base – and that if the step is held up in the courts, Trump can still say he tried.
One thing that could be better: Although the Bank of America Cash Rewards card can earn bonus cash back on your travel purchases, there are very few travel perks that come with this card. If you travel a lot throughout the year and are looking for a card that offers you travel credits, lounge access, complimentary Global Entry or TSA PreCheck and travel protections, you might want to instead consider another travel rewards card, such as the Bank of America®️ Premium Rewards®️ credit card — although it carries a $95 annual fee.

This card is right for: People looking for an easy and straightforward way to earn cash back without having to worry about category bonuses.
Car rental loss and damage insurance.
One thing that could be better: Many of the bonus categories on the Blue Cash Preferred are limited to purchases made within the United States. There's also a 2.7% foreign transaction fee on the card, which doesn't make this an ideal choice for international travel. And the card has a $95 annual fee, which is significantly higher than many other credit cards offering cash back.
On top of that, all the cash back you earn on the Discover it Cash Back will be matched at the end of the first year for new card holders, making this an ideal card to have if you know you'll be spending a lot on your credit card over the next year. This means those rotating bonus categories are worth 10% in the first year, and all your purchases outside of the bonus categories earn a solid 2% return the first year.
Earn 5% cash back on quarterly bonuses categories (up to $1,500 on combined purchases).

Indonesia's National Search and Rescue Agency is still searching for some of the 62 people aboard Sriwijaya Air Flight 182, which crashed into the ocean Saturday shortly after taking off from Jakarta. Rescuers have located the black box flight recorder from the Boeing 737-500 , but their recovery efforts have been largely hampered by debris in the water. The Boeing 737-500 model that crashed is not the same as the 737 Max, and it does not have the flawed cockpit software that contributed to two fatal 737 Max crashes. Still, the wreck is the latest tragedy to plague Indonesia's burgeoning airline sector. In 2007, the European Union banned all 51 Indonesian airlines from its airspace after a crash killed 140 people; the airlines were reinstated in 2018.
This card is right for: People who want a no-annual-fee credit card that offers the flexibility to earn cash back in the categories that work best for them based on their personal spending habits.

The purchase protection applies to items you buy anywhere, not just at Costco. But even while Costco has a favorable return policy for most of its products, electronics and major appliances only have a 90-day return window, which makes the benefits of this credit card extra useful.
That means if you're a Preferred Rewards member, you're looking at an increased 3.75% to 5.25% cash back in the 3% cash back categories. Of course, this requires parking a significant amount of money in your Bank of America bank or investment account, but it can pay out extremely well for loyal Bank of America customers.
The Blue Cash Preferred also comes with a solid return protection policy, which can come in handy during the upcoming holiday season. Return protection allows you to return an eligible item within 90 days from the day of purchase if the merchant won't take it back. As long as you used your Blue Cash Preferred to pay for it, American Express will refund the full purchase price (excluding shipping and handling). Claims are capped at $300 per item, up to a maximum of $1,000 per card account per calendar year.
Purchase protection and extended warranty coverage.

Salad chain Sweetgreen has entered the chicken sandwich wars
One thing that could be better: One big disadvantage of the Costco Anywhere Visa is that you have to wait a full year to receive your rewards, which are sent in the form of an annual certificate after your February billing statement closes each year. The certificate can be redeemed for Costco purchases or exchanged for cash at your local Costco store, and will expire if it's not redeemed by December 31 of that calendar year.
Welcome bonus: Earn a $300 statement credit after you spend $3,000 in purchases on your new card within the first six months after opening the account, plus get a $0 introductory annual fee for the first year ($95 thereafter).
With the Bank of America Cash Rewards, you're capped at a higher $2,500 per quarter to receive the 2% and 3% cash back categories. If you're able to max out the bonus on a quarterly basis on the 3% cash back categories alone, you'll earn you an extra $75 every quarter.

What we like about the Chase Freedom Unlimited: If you prefer cash back now but think that a dose of adventure is in your future once travel returns to normal, the Chase Freedom Unlimited can give you the best of both worlds.
Where it beats our benchmark card: Sign-up bonus, selectable bonus categories and an introductory offer on balance transfers.
Even better, once you've converted the cash back to points, you can transfer them to any of Chase's 13 airline and hotel loyalty partners. This amazing flexibility is why frequent flyer website The Points Guy values Ultimate Rewards points at 2 cents apiece. At that rate, since you're earning 1.5% cash back in all non-bonus categories with the Freedom Unlimited, you could effectively end up with a 3% return on your everyday purchases.
The administration has steadfastly refused to take steps that would restore funding to some agencies, believing the shutdown is its best leverage to secure the wall funds.

Earning 4% cash back on all gas purchases worldwide for the first $7,000 per year (1% thereafter) can add up quickly and save you some serious money over the course of the year. And aside from the earning potential on gas, earning 3% cash back at restaurants and eligible travel purchases is on par — and many times better — than what you'll see with other cash back credit cards.

With the other cards, the increased quarterly categories are selected by the issuer and can't be changed by the card holder.

US federal prosecutors say Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernández helped an alleged drug trafficker deliver thousands of kilos of cocaine to the United States in exchange for hefty bribes, allegedly vowing he was going to shove the drugs right up the noses of the gringos. Court documents allege Hernández and other top officials took bribes while he was running for the presidency in 2013, and in exchange offered military support and the use of the country's armed forces as security for drug-running operations. Hernández has not been charged and called the claims 100% false. The Honduran President in 2019 admitted he had been investigated by the US Drug Enforcement Administration. Allegations surfacing in this US drug trafficking investigation have renewed calls among Hondurans for Hernández's resignation.

One thing that could be better: One big disadvantage of the Costco Anywhere Visa is that you have to wait a full year to receive your rewards, which are sent in the form of an annual certificate after your February billing statement closes each year.

The Citi Double Cash also offers a relatively long 18-month introductory 0% interest rate period for balance transfers — a great way to pay off your debt (though make sure you pay it off, because the rate jumps to a variable 13.99% to 23.99% after the introductory offer ends). And you have up to four months after you open the account to make your first balance transfer and still have it qualify for the introductory offer.
