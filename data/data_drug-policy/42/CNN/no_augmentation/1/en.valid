While a tax cut may represent a notable drop in average tax burden, it doesn't necessarily represent a big jump in one's after-tax income, which is a better measure of how a tax cut changes someone's economic situation. For example, Mississippi residents will see their average federal tax burden drop by $1,040, or 9.5% on average. But that only represents a jump of 1.8% in after-tax income.
But a series of defections – including one by what is believed to be the highest ranking military officer so far – could offer some useful insights into what is going on there.

Traditional brokerage accounts, by contrast, require you to pay taxes on your gains year after year. This means that if you sell anything in your account at a profit, you'll lose a chunk of those proceeds to taxes, leaving you less money to reinvest. Along these lines, if you leave your investments alone during your college savings period and only sell them off once the time comes to start tacking those tuition bills, you'll lose a portion of your eventual earnings to taxes as well.

Traditional brokerage accounts, by contrast, require you to pay taxes on your gains year after year. This means that if you sell anything in your account at a profit, you'll lose a chunk of those proceeds to taxes, leaving you less money to reinvest. Along these lines, if you leave your investments alone during your college savings period and only sell them off once the time comes to start tacking those tuition bills, you'll lose a portion of your eventual earnings to taxes as well.
Here's the catch though -- if you have a traditional brokerage account whose investments you sell off to access that cash, you'll lose a portion of your earnings to capital gains taxes. Assuming you're in the 25% bracket, those taxes will knock a good $10,000 off your $38,000 in gains. With a 529, however, you'll get to use that $138,000 in full, as long as it's applied to qualified college costs.

The state of Arizona, for example, has approximately 27,000 DACA recipients. If Arizona's DACA recipients were forced to leave, the state's GDP would drop by $1.3 billion. If Texas's 124,300 DACA recipients were deported, Texas GDP would drop by nearly $6.3 billion.

In order to permanently secure the legal status of Dreamers, DACA or a similar act must be enacted as law.

Even Disney villains usually have some sort of facial deformity, which sends the message to children from a young age that disabilities are bad and that people with disabilities are evil or monstrous.

It is difficult to obtain reliable insights information into the inner workings of the North Korean government given the opaque nature of the regime. Access to a high-level military official familiar with the North Korean system and leadership will therefore be an important asset on military and intelligence matters.

We can disagree about a lot of things but we can agree maybe now is the time to get serious about the deficit, Hassett said.
According to the Congressional Budget Office, total public debt stood at 78% of America's gross domestic product in fiscal year 2018, the highest percentage since 1950. The deficit – or the difference between what the government spends and what it takes in over any one year – jumped to 3.8% of GDP in 2018, up from 3.5% in 2017.
The debt began to level off at the beginning of Trump's term, but bounced up again last year as the tax cuts passed at the end of 2017 took effect and the dramatically lower corporate tax rate lowered Treasury revenues.
But the average tax cut will vary by state depending on economic and demographic characteristics, and whether residents pay high state and local taxes, which are now capped as a deduction on one's federal return.

Though the termination of DACA has been delayed by the federal court, the legal stability of DACA status is not guaranteed.

In order to permanently secure the legal status of Dreamers, DACA or a similar act must be enacted as law.

To say an election was the craziest or most controversial simply isn't objective.

Still, whatever the truth behind the debate over the release of information, the escape of such a prominent military and intelligence official is important. The colonel will not only be able to furnish valuable information on military operations and tactics, but may also provide better clarity into the strategic thinking of North Korea's leadership.

One thing that could be better: You need to activate the cash back categories every quarter on the U.S. Bank Cash+ Visa, and you'll only earn the increased 2% or 5% cash back after activation — rewards can't be retroactively applied. This means you truly need to be on top of your credit card and remember the categories that you select on a quarterly basis.
One thing that could be better: Although the Citi Double Cash card will earn you the most cash back on your everyday purchases, it doesn't have any category bonuses. This can be a downside if you routinely make a large number of purchases in a particular category.

Repealing and replacing Obamacare not only would change health coverage and costs for tens of millions of Americans, it would also give a juicy tax gift to the rich.
But the announcement of the colonel's defection is part of a larger story. The public acknowledgment of defections is unusual, and government policy has typically been to keep these events quiet so as not to endanger remaining family members in the North (or other defectors that might be en route or considering such a move).
Media reports indicate the officer may have been in charge of espionage operations in South Korea, and he is believed to be the highest-ranking military leader to have ever defected to the South. With all this in mind, it is clear why he could prove to be valuable.
It's stunning but not surprising to see some self-styled constitutional conservatives -- who warned about mob violence and demanded law and order when it came to Black Lives Matter protests - immediately default to rationalizing this violence through a flurry of whataboutism . Folks who proclaimed facts don't care about your feelings suddenly seem to care about understanding the feelings of people who commit political violence. That's usually a definition of terrorism -- but these attackers were not contained or confronted or even arrested in large numbers. If they'd been Black or left wing or Muslim the reaction and calls for violent retribution by the President and his allies would have been deafening.

Imagine: A raging president refuses to accept that his rule is ending and incites mass protests to disrupt the certification of his election loss. A radicalized band of loyalist lawmakers also tries to deny voters' verdict . The wannabe autocrat leans on a party subordinate to find enough votes to let him win. Propagandistic media organs spew misinformation to support the his lies. Meanwhile the real crisis — a once-in-a-century pandemic that kills 3,000 citizens each day — is ignored in a gross display of negligence.

One thing that could be better: Although the Bank of America Cash Rewards card can earn bonus cash back on your travel purchases, there are very few travel perks that come with this card.

That means if you're a Preferred Rewards member, you're looking at an increased 3.75% to 5.25% cash back in the 3% cash back categories.

Trump's ongoing onslaught against the Republican officials in charge of the elections pressured the two GOP senators to make a choice: Join the President in seeking to overturn the democratic outcome or risk losing Trump supporters, some of whom have become disenchanted with the electoral process. Trump recently appeared to pressure Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger on a private call, urging him to find enough votes to reverse the results. Raffensperger refused.
Well, after a month of horse trading, many of Clay's supporters shifted their support to Adams, who would go on to win the majority of the House vote. Maryland, Illinois and Louisiana, which had cast most of their Electoral College votes for Jackson, as well as Kentucky, where Adams did not receive a single ballot in the popular vote, decided to back Adams.
In November, Perdue received over 88,000 more votes than Ossoff, while Loeffler and the other Republican candidates received more votes than Warnock and the other Democratic candidates in the special election (Warnock received most of the vote -- 33% -- overall).
Warnock is the first Georgia Democrat elected to the Senate in 20 years, and his election is the culmination of years of voter registration drives conducted by former state House Democratic leader Stacey Abrams and other activists. President-elect Joe Biden also won Georgia, the first time for a Democratic presidential candidate since the 1990s.

The Proud Boys has been supportive of President Trump and present in large numbers at Stop The Steal rallies in Washington, DC. The Proud Boys' leader, Henry Tarrio, who goes by Enrique Tarrio, was released from police custody Tuesday on charges related to allegedly burning a Black Lives Matter banner taken from a Black church last month during protests in the city after a Stop the Steal event. Tarrio has admitted to CNN he did burn the banner. He was ordered by a local judge to stay out of DC as he awaits trial, including during this week's protests.
What sets Trump's behavior apart is that there is substantial evidence that withholding the Ukraine aid was not in accordance with official US policy toward Ukraine. Defense Secretary Mark Esper and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, along with then-national security adviser John Bolton, all lobbied Trump to release the aid before he relented in September. Additionally, the nonpartisan Government Accountability Office determined Trump's decision to withhold the appropriate funds violated the law.
It can't be both incredibly urgent that the House impeach Trump with just more than a week left in his term AND totally cool for the House to sit on the articles of impeachment until the Biden administration gets off the ground.

Like the alt right and other white supremacists, groypers believe they are working to defend against demographic and cultural changes that are destroying the 'true America' -- a white, Christian nation.

I've been on the receiving end of this damaging and destructive hate speech for years. I was born with Freeman-Sheldon syndrome, a rare genetic bone and muscular disorder; it affects everything from my joints to my physical appearance.

DeSantis announced during the press conference that a COVID-19 antibodies test will be available.

In 2018, Trump touted the success of his new tax cuts, calling them the biggest tax cuts and reforms in American history and claiming they would be a boon to the economy. However, a combination of the reduced revenues due to the tax cuts and record-setting defense spending helped balloon the federal budget deficit to $1 trillion last year. More recently, the President has said he is considering cuts to entitlement programs as a means of debt reduction.

Indonesia's National Search and Rescue Agency is still searching for some of the 62 people aboard Sriwijaya Air Flight 182, which crashed into the ocean Saturday shortly after taking off from Jakarta. Rescuers have located the black box flight recorder from the Boeing 737-500 , but their recovery efforts have been largely hampered by debris in the water. The Boeing 737-500 model that crashed is not the same as the 737 Max, and it does not have the flawed cockpit software that contributed to two fatal 737 Max crashes. Still, the wreck is the latest tragedy to plague Indonesia's burgeoning airline sector. In 2007, the European Union banned all 51 Indonesian airlines from its airspace after a crash killed 140 people; the airlines were reinstated in 2018.

Still, whatever the truth behind the debate over the release of information, the escape of such a prominent military and intelligence official is important. The colonel will not only be able to furnish valuable information on military operations and tactics, but may also provide better clarity into the strategic thinking of North Korea's leadership. Moreover, these defections might start to reveal more about elite behavior in North Korea. Could such defections, for example, be early indicators of political instability?

We are still in the fog of war. But some things are clear. The politicians and hyper-partisans who have coddled this President's autocratic impulses have enabled this assault to our democracy. The Republican members of Congress -- like Senators Ted Cruz and Josh Hawley -- who have tried to benefit politically from contesting the election results without any concrete evidence of fraud are culpable in this violence because they have stoked its fears. So is Trump's attorney, Rudy Giuliani, who demanded  trial by combat  to resolve the election dispute at a Save America rally this morning, after his legal team lost some 60 cases in court because of an absence of evidence.
