{"original": "but that crossroads moment was about more than climate policy. young voters were the foundation of the sunrise-biden relationship during the campaign. biden wanted their support. sunrise understood what it took to unlock it. the desire of democrats to keep them energized now is what could, potentially, sustain the coalition going forward.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "what we wanted to make clear to them, weber said of the post-debate conversation, was our perspective that ... just as there's a fierce right wing constituency and it's animated against the green new deal, there's an even bigger constituency of young people for whom the green new deal is something that they are dedicating their lives to realizing and making possible.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "for those who make these claims, i have one simple question: how long should we wait? how long should america put its future on hold? you see...", "augmented": []}
{"original": "you see, washington has been telling us to wait for decades, even as the problems have grown worse. meanwhile, china's not waiting to revamp its economy; germany's not waiting; india's not waiting.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "these nations, they're not standing still. these nations aren't playing for second place. they're putting more emphasis on math and science. they're rebuilding their infrastructure. they're making serious investments in clean energy because they want those jobs.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "well, i do not accept second place for the united states of america.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "as hard as it may be, as uncomfortable and contentious as the debates may become, it's time to get serious about fixing the problems that are hampering our growth.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "now, one place to start is serious financial reform. look, i'm not interested in punishing banks. i'm interested in protecting our economy. a strong, healthy financial market makes it possible for businesses to access credit and create new jobs. it channels the savings of families into investments that raise incomes. but that can only happen if we guard against the same recklessness that nearly brought down our entire economy.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "we need to make sure consumers and middle-class families have the information they need to make financial decisions. we can't allow financial institutions, including those that take your deposits, to take risks that threaten the whole economy.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "now, the house has already passed financial reform with many of these changes. and -- and the lobbyists are trying to kill it. well, we cannot let them win this fight. and if the bill that ends up on my desk does not meet the test of real reform, i will send it back until we get it right. we've got to get it right.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "next, we need to encourage american innovation. last year, we made the largest investment in basic research funding in history, an investment -- an investment that could lead to the world's cheapest solar cells or treatment that kills cancer cells but leaves healthy ones untouched.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and no area is more ripe for such innovation than energy. you can see the results of last year's investments in clean energy in the north carolina company that will create 1,200 jobs nationwide, helping to make advanced batteries, or in the california business that will put 1,000 people to work making solar panels.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "but to create more of these clean-energy jobs, we need more production, more efficiency, more incentives, and that means building a new generation of safe, clean nuclear power plants in this country.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "it means making tough decisions about opening new offshore areas for oil and gas development.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "it means continued investment in advanced biofuels and clean-coal technologies.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and, yes, it means passing a comprehensive energy and climate bill with incentives that will finally make clean energy the profitable kind of energy in america.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "i'm grateful to the house for passing such a bill last year.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and this year -- this year, i'm eager to help advance the bipartisan effort in the senate.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "i know there have been questions about whether we can afford such changes in a tough economy. i know that there are those who disagree with the overwhelming scientific evidence on climate change.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "but -- but here's the thing. even if you doubt the evidence, providing incentives for energy efficiency and clean energy are the right thing to do for our future, because the nation that leads the clean-energy economy will be the nation that leads the global economy, and america must be that nation.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "third, we need to export more of our goods.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "because the more products we make and sell to other countries, the more jobs we support right here in america. so...", "augmented": []}
{"original": "so tonight, we set a new goal: we will double our exports over the next five years, an increase that will support 2 million jobs in america.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "to help meet this goal, we're launching a national export initiative that will help farmers and small businesses increase their exports and reform export controls consistent with national security.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "we have to seek new markets aggressively, just as our competitors are. if america sits on the sidelines while other nations sign trade deals, we will lose the chance to create jobs on our shores.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "but realizing those benefits also means enforcing those agreements so our trading partners play by the rules.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and that's why we'll continue to shape a doha trade agreement that opens global markets and why we will strengthen our trade relations in asia and with key partners like south korea, and panama, and colombia.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "fourth, we need to invest in the skills and education of our people. now, this year -- this year, we've broken through the stalemate between left and right by launching a national competition to improve our schools.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and the idea here is simple: instead of rewarding failure, we only reward success. instead of funding the status quo, we only invest in reform, reform that raises student achievement, inspires students to excel in math and science, and turns around failing schools that steal the future of too many young americans, from rural communities to the inner city.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "in the 21st century, the best anti-poverty program around is a world-class education.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and in this country, the success of our children cannot depend more on where they live than on their potential. when we renew the elementary and secondary education act, we will work with congress to expand these reforms to all 50 states.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "still, in this economy, a high school diploma no longer guarantees a good job. that's why i urge the senate to follow the house and pass a bill that will revitalize our community colleges, which are a career pathway to the children of so many working families.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "to make college more affordable, this bill will finally end the unwarranted taxpayer subsidies that go to banks for student loans. instead, let's take that money and give families a $10,000 tax credit for four years of college and increase pell grants.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and let's tell another 1 million students that, when they graduate, they will be required to pay only 10 percent of their income on student loans, and all of their debt will be forgiven after 20 years, and forgiven after 10 years if they choose a career in public service, because in the united states of america, no one should go broke because they chose to go to college.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and, by the way, it's time for colleges and universities to get serious about cutting their own costs, because they, too, have a responsibility to help solve this problem.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "now, the price of college tuition is just one of the burdens facing the middle class. that's why last year i asked vice president biden to chair a task force on middle-class families.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "that's why we're nearly doubling the childcare tax credit and making it easier to save for retirement by giving access to every worker a retirement account and expanding the tax credit for those who start a nest egg. that's why we're working to lift the value of a family's single largest investment, their home.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the steps we took last year to shore up the housing market have allowed millions of americans to take out new loans and save an average of $1,500 on mortgage payments. this year, we will step up refinancing so that homeowners can move into more affordable mortgages. and...", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and it is precisely to relieve the burden on middle-class families that we still need health insurance reform.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "now, let's clear a few things up.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "i didn't choose to tackle this issue to get some legislative victory under my belt. and by now, it should be fairly obvious that i didn't take on health care because it was good politics.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "i took on health care because of the stories i've heard, from americans with pre-existing conditions whose lives depend on getting coverage, patients who've been denied coverage, families, even those with insurance, who are just one illness away from financial ruin.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "after nearly a century of trying -- democratic administrations, republican administrations -- we are closer than ever to bringing more security to the lives of so many americans.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the approach we've taken would protect every american from the worst practices of the insurance industry. it would give small businesses and uninsured americans a chance to choose an affordable health care plan in a competitive market.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "it would require every insurance plan to cover preventive care. and by the way, i want to acknowledge our first lady, michelle obama, who this year is creating a national movement to tackle the epidemic of childhood obesity and make kids healthier.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "our approach would preserve the right of americans who have insurance to keep their doctor and their plan. it would reduce costs and premiums for millions of families and businesses.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and according to the congressional budget office, the independent organization that both parties have cited as the official scorekeeper for congress, our approach would bring down the deficit by as much as $1 trillion over the next two decades.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "still, this is a complex issue. and the longer it was debated, the more skeptical people became. i take my share of the blame for not explaining it more clearly to the american people. and i know that with all the lobbying and horse-trading, this process left most americans wondering, what's in it for me?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "but i also know this problem is not going away. by the time i'm finished speaking tonight, more americans will have lost their health insurance. millions will lose it this year. our deficit will grow. premiums will go up. patients will be denied the care they need. small-business owners will continue to drop coverage altogether.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "i will not walk away from these americans, and neither should the people in this chamber.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "as temperatures cool, i want everyone to take another look at the plan we've proposed. there's a reason why many doctors, nurses and health care experts who know our system best consider this approach a vast improvement over the status quo.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "but if anyone from either party has a better approach that will bring down premiums, bring down the deficit, cover the uninsured, strengthen medicare for seniors, and stop insurance company abuses, let me know.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "let me know. let me know.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "here's what i ask congress, though: don't walk away from reform, not now, not when we are so close. let us find a way to come together and finish the job for the american people. let's get it done.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "now, even as health care reform would reduce our deficit, it's not enough to dig us out of a massive fiscal hole in which we find ourselves. it's a challenge that makes all others that much harder to solve and one that's been subject to a lot of political posturing.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "so let me start the discussion of government spending by setting the record straight. at the beginning of the last decade, the year 2000, america had a budget surplus of over $200 billion.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "by -- by the time i took office, we had a one-year deficit of over $1 trillion and projected deficits of $8 trillion over the next decade. most of this was the result of not paying for two wars, two tax cuts, and an expensive prescription drug program.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "on top of that, the effects of the recession put a $3 trillion hole in our budget. all this was before i walked in the door.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "now -- just stating the facts. now, if we had taken office in ordinary times, i would have liked nothing more than to start bringing down the deficit. but we took office amid a crisis, and our efforts to prevent a second depression have added another $1 trillion to our national debt. that, too, is a fact.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "i'm absolutely convinced that was the right thing to do, but families across the country are tightening their belts and making tough decisions. the federal government should do the same.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "so tonight, i'm proposing specific steps to pay for the $1 trillion that it took to rescue the economy last year.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "starting in 2011, we are prepared to freeze government spending for three years. spending related to our national security, medicare, medicaid and social security will not be affected, but all other discretionary government programs will.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "like any cash-strapped family, we will work within a budget to invest in what we need and sacrifice what we don't. and if i have to enforce this discipline by veto, i will.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "we will continue to go through the budget line by line, page by page, to eliminate programs that we can't afford and don't work. we've already identified $20 billion in savings for next year.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "to help working families, we'll extend our middle-class tax cuts. but at a time of record deficits, we will not continue tax cuts for oil companies, for investment fund managers, and for those making over $250,000 a year. we just can't afford it.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "now, even after paying for what we spent on my watch, we'll still face the massive deficit we had when i took office. more importantly, the cost of medicare, medicaid, and social security will continue to skyrocket.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "that's why i've called for a bipartisan fiscal commission, modeled on a proposal by republican judd gregg and democrat kent conrad.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "this can't be one of those washington gimmicks that lets us pretend we solved a problem. the commission will have to provide a specific set of solutions by a certain deadline.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "now, yesterday, the senate blocked a bill that would have created this commission. so i'll issue an executive order that will allow us to go forward, because i refuse to pass this problem on to another generation of americans.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and when the vote comes tomorrow, the senate should restore the pay-as-you-go law that was a big reason for why we had record surpluses in the 1990s.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "now, i know that some in my own party will argue that we can't address the deficit or freeze government spending when so many are still hurting. and i agree, which is why this freeze won't take effect until next year, when the economy is stronger. that's how budgeting works.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "but understand -- understand, if we don't take meaningful steps to rein in our debt, it could damage our markets, increase the cost of borrowing, and jeopardize our recovery, all of which would have an even worse effect on our job growth and family incomes.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "from some on the right, i expect we'll hear a different argument, that if we just make fewer investments in our people, extend tax cuts, including those for the wealthier americans, eliminate more regulations, maintain the status quo on health care, our deficits will go away.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the problem is, that's what we did for eight years.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "that's what helped us into this crisis. it's what helped lead to these deficits. we can't do it again.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "rather than fight the same tired battles that have dominated washington for decades, it's time to try something new. let's invest in our people without leaving them a mountain of debt. let's meet our responsibility to the citizens who sent us here. let's try common sense, a novel concept.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "now, to do that, we have to recognize that we face more than a deficit of dollars right now. we face a deficit of trust, deep and corrosive doubts about how washington works that have been growing for years.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "to close that credibility gap, we have to take action on both ends of pennsylvania avenue, to end the outsized influence of lobbyists, to do our work openly, to give our people the government they deserve.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "that's what i came to washington to do. that's why, for the first time in history, my administration posts our white house visitors online. that's why we've excluded lobbyists from policy-making jobs or seats on federal boards and commissions.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "but we can't stop there. it's time to require lobbyists to disclose each contact they make on behalf of a client with my administration or with congress. it's time to put strict limits on the contributions that lobbyists give to candidates for federal office.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "with all due deference to separation of powers, last week, the supreme court reversed a century of law that i believe will open the floodgates for special interests, including foreign corporations, to spend without limit in our elections.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "i don't think american elections should be bankrolled by america's most powerful interests or, worse, by foreign entities. they should be decided by the american people. and i urge democrats and republicans to pass a bill that helps correct some of these problems.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "i'm also calling on congress to continue down the path of earmark reform, democrats and republicans.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "democrats and republicans, you've trimmed some of this spending. you've embraced some meaningful change, but restoring the public trust demands more. for example, some members of congress post some earmark requests online.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "tonight, i'm calling on congress to publish all earmark requests on a single web site before there's a vote so that the american people can see how their money is being spent.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "of course, none of these reforms will even happen if we don't also reform how we work with one another. now, i'm not naive. i never thought that the mere fact of my election would usher in peace and harmony and some post-partisan era.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "i knew that both parties have fed divisions that are deeply entrenched. and on some issues, there are simply philosophical differences that will always cause us to part ways. these disagreements, about the role of government in our lives, about our national priorities and our national security, they've been taking place for over 200 years. they're the very essence of our democracy.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "but what frustrates the american people is a washington where every day is election day. we can't wage a perpetual campaign where the only goal is to see who can get the most embarrassing headlines about the other side, a belief that if you lose, i win. neither party should delay or obstruct every single bill just because they can.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "i'm speaking of both parties now. the confirmation of well-qualified public servants shouldn't be held hostage to the pet projects or grudges of a few individual senators.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "washington may think that saying anything about the other side, no matter how false, no matter how malicious, is just part of the game. but it's precisely such politics that has stopped either party from helping the american people. worse yet -- worse yet, it's sowing further division among our citizens, further distrust in our government.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "so, no, i will not give up on trying to change the tone of our politics. i know it's an election year. and after last week, it's clear that campaign fever has come even earlier than usual. but we still need to govern.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "to democrats, i would remind you that we still have the largest majority in decades and the people expect us to solve problems, not run for the hills.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and if the republican leadership is going to insist that 60 votes in the senate are required to do any business at all in this town, a supermajority, then the responsibility to govern is now yours, as well. just saying no to everything may be good short-term politics, but it's not leadership. we were sent here to serve our citizens, not our ambitions.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "so let's show the american people that we can do it together.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "this week -- this week, i'll be addressing a meeting of the house republicans. i'd like to begin monthly meetings with both democratic and republican leadership. i know you can't wait.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "now, throughout our history, no issue has united this country more than our security. sadly, some of the unity we felt after 9/11 has dissipated. and we can argue all we want about who's to blame for this, but i'm not interested in re-litigating the past.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "i know that all of us love this country. all of us are committed to its defense. so let's put aside the schoolyard taunts about who's tough. let's reject the false choice between protecting our people and upholding our values. let's leave behind the fear and division and do what it takes to defend our nation and forge a more hopeful future, for america and for the world.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "that's the work we began last year. since the day i took office, we renewed our focus on the terrorists who threaten our nation. we've made substantial investments in our homeland security and disrupted plots that threatened to take american lives.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "we are filling unacceptable gaps revealed by the failed christmas attack with better airline security and swifter action on our intelligence. we've prohibited torture and strengthened partnerships from the pacific to south asia to the arabian peninsula.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and in the last year, hundreds of al qaeda's fighters and affiliates, including many senior leaders, have been captured or killed, far more than in 2008.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and in afghanistan, we're increasing our troops and training afghan security forces so they can begin to take the lead in july of 2011 and our troops can begin to come home.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "we will reward good governance, work to reduce corruption, and support the rights of all afghans, men and women alike. we're joined by allies and partners who have increased their own commitment and who'll come together tomorrow in london to reaffirm our common purpose. there will be difficult days ahead, but i am absolutely confident we will succeed.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "as we take the fight to al qaeda, we are responsibly leaving iraq to its people. as a candidate, i promised that i would end this war, and that is what i am doing as president.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "we will have all of our combat troops out of iraq by the end of this august.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "we will support -- we will support the iraqi government -- we will support the iraqi government as they hold elections, and we will continue to partner with the iraqi people to promote regional peace and prosperity.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "but make no mistake: this war is ending, and all of our troops are coming home.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "tonight, all of our men and women in uniform -- in iraq, in afghanistan, and around the world -- they have to know that we -- that they have our respect, our gratitude, our full support. and just as they must have the resources they need in war, we all have a responsibility to support them when they come home.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "that's why we made the largest increase in investments for veterans in decades last year.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "that's why we're building a 21st-century [veterans affairs]. and that's why michelle has joined with jill biden to forge a national commitment to support military families.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "now, even as we prosecute two wars, we're also confronting perhaps the greatest danger to the american people, the threat of nuclear weapons. i've embraced the vision of john f. kennedy and ronald reagan through a strategy that reverses the spread of these weapons and seeks a world without them.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "that's why the international community is more united and the islamic republic of iran is more isolated. and as iran's leaders continue to ignore their obligations, there should be no doubt: they, too, will face growing consequences. that is a promise.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "biden: well, by the way, here's the thing, chris, no -- cuomo: i was against it but now i've changed.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "biden: i was -- i was in favor of busing that was dejure busing. that is, if a court ruled that there was a law passed or circumstance that a county, a city, a state did that prevented black folks from being somewhere, then that's wrong, you should bus. i even went so far in the middle of that busing controversy with saying i'd use helicopters if that was necessary to make the point. and we really got, you know, town meeting that was -- got very hot. but what the issue is now is, for example, and it was then, voluntary busing. we supported it. we supported it then. and, by the way, barack and i, as president and vice president, we provided money for voluntary busing if cities wanted to do it.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "cuomo: i'm not questioning any of that.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "look, the question is, how do you equalize education in every area? and i put forward the most -- the most aggressive plan to do that and i've been pushing it for a long time. for example, in, you know, title i schools, schools that are disadvantaged, we should -- i proposed we go from $15 billion a year to $45 billion a year. we should bring people in and have preschool from three, four, five years old, before kindergarten. we should have -- look, every child out there, every child out there is capable, but they live in circumstances that make it difficult. from the time they get to school they've heard three, four million fewer words spoken. they're at a disadvantage.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "biden: so what are we doing? we're sitting around here as if it's an insoluble problem.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "cuomo: i'm -- i get it on the policy. i never have viewed the busing back and forth in that debate as about policy or application of how to affect civil rights. it's about consistency and proving if you'll be better than what we're dealing with now in the white house, which is people won't tell the truth about things. if busing didn't work, then it made sense that you weren't for it back then.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "cuomo: but why say you were for it?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "cuomo: why not just be straight about it and move on?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "biden: ok, because there's three different pieces. i was for voluntary busing. number one. i was for busing where the courts showed that, in fact, a legislative body took an action preventing black folks from going to a school. that is dejure -- i know you know, dejure segregation. the difficult piece is, this is 50 years ago, people don't understand the context.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the third one is, do you have an administration, through their non- elected officials, the department of housing, decide every school should be equally balanced across the board? that's a different issue. and the way to deal with that problem is what i did from the time i was a kid. i got out of -- i got out of law school, came back, had a great job, became a public defender. i fought for putting housing and -- low-income housing in suburbia. i talked about eliminating red line and i talked about school districts should be consolidated in ways that made sense so, in fact --", "augmented": []}

{"original": "biden: well, i didn't have an opportunity to re-watch it. and, besides, you know, my measure is how people react outside, getting on a train, getting on a plane, walking through an airport, walking in a parade, just going to the grocery store. i got no sense, i really mean it, no sense.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "cuomo: here's the tough question for democrats. they need a warrior, ok, because not too aggrandize, not to lionize, but this president knows how to fight in the ring one on one. kamala harris is friendly fire. cory booker is friendly fire. how can democrats have confidence that you can take on the biggest and the baddest when you're having trouble sparring in party?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "biden: i don't think i'm having trouble sparring. it's how you want to spar. look, i'm the guy at the time everybody talks about things that are changed. i took on same-sex marriage. i took on a whole range of issues. i took on arms control. i took on dealing with russia with the -- with the arms control agreement. i took on putin in terms of iraq -- i mean, excuse me, in terms of what was going on in ukraine. i've taken on these leaders around the world. i'm the guy that's gone in and met -- i've taken on all these leaders. i -- i mean i -- this is ironic. i've never been accused of being -- not being able to spar. i've been accused of being too aggressive.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "cuomo: what exactly bothers you abroad?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "biden: what bothers me abroad is, look, the idea that we can go it alone with no alliances for the next 20 or 30 years is a disaster. how are we going to deal with stateless terrorism without doing what i've been able to do with the president, put together coalitions of 50, 60 nations to take it on? i come out of a generation where we were trying to be the policemen of the world. we can't go in every place. we need allies. he is absolutely dissing them. he's embracing thugs. he's embracing kim jong-un, who is a thug. he's embracing putin, who is a -- who is a flat dictator. he's embracing people who, in fact -- and he's stiff-arming our friends. he's threatening nato, to pull out of nato. i mean, come on.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "cuomo: so with north korea, the idea of reaching out, president obama, vice president biden wanted to do more than that. the republicans used to whack you on the head. you can't be nice to people who are our enemies. hadn't this president done what you wanted to do by reaching out to kim?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "biden: he did the exact opposite. he gave kim everything that he wanted, legitimacy. he gave kim -- he ended our relationship, as a practical matter with south korea and japan as a united front and let china off the hook. he put us in a position where we say, by the way, i love the man. i know what he's doing. he hasn't done a thing. he hasn't done a thing, kim jong-un. and what have we done? we've suspended exercises.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "look, i come out of the arms control era. guess what, there's two ways you do this, you work or you defend and you say, hey, man, don't screw with us. you move, this is what's going to happen. this is going to happen.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "but, in the meantime, what you do is you deal with your allies and also those who don't -- aren't with you. do you think china wants any part of north korea becoming a nuclear power?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "cuomo: so what do you do differently with north korea and china?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "biden: with regard to north korea -- with china, i make it clear that we're going to move our defenses up, as we did before, and we're going to make sure we have the capacity to deal with it near term. i'm going to let south korea and japan know we're there for them. we are their nuclear umbrella. we're there for them. and china, understand, if you don't want us in your throat here, if you don't want us in your face, do something.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "cuomo: do you stop the trade battle with china? do you go back to tpp?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "biden: by the way, the idea that this trade battle makes any sense, is benefitting anybody, is absolutely ludicrous. and just ask the farmers here or around the world. their -- i mean around the united states and the manufacturers. it's killing us.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "what we should do is we deal with china -- i had a conversation with xi before i -- xi jinping before i left. and he said, well, you know, remember they set up their no-fly zone and -- i said, we're not going to pay attention to it. he said, what do you want me to do, just withdraw it? and i said, no, but just understand, we're just going to fly through. we flew a b-52 through it. we are a pacific power. we're not going anywhere, understand. and that's the reason why you have security is because we've allowed stability in the region. they get it. but what they're doing now is we're not dealing with china's problem for (ph) us. china's problem is they're stealing intellectual secrets.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "ryan lizza, cnn senior political analyst: yes, i found one of the most interesting moments when he was almost personally offended that harris brought this up by mentioning her long friendship with beau biden. and i know -- i think kamala harris has actually talked about that relationship. and he didn't dwell on that for a long time, but he sort of threw it out there. you know, he didn't think she would go there, i'm paraphrasing him, because -- one reason was because she had a relationship with his deceased son, beau.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "keilar: it's -- it's -- what did you think? i mean it seems to me that he felt attacked by his son's good friend.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "astead herndon, cnn political analyst: yes, i think that that was a really interesting kind of offhand comment that clearly when you say something like that, that's going to get folks' attention. that, you know, joe biden is someone who prizes those personal relationships and we know that senator harris has talked about how she respected his son.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "but it should not be a surprise that people are coming after his record. i mean senator harris was someone who kind of prizes that legion of older black voters that joe biden currently has a stranglehold on and so she was using that debate moment to try to go at him directly.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "now, was he surprised at the kind of personal way she did it, invoking her own story, the way the campaign came with t-shirts with her childhood photo on after, maybe that took the campaign by surprise. but certainly the issue should not be a surprise for biden. he knew that he was going to be the target on that stage.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "but i, you know, i think it's important to remember here that senator harris has -- has praised the vice president. she started the kind of speech on the debate by saying i respect you, but then she took it to a place that really has joe biden on the back foot as someone who thinks of himself as a civil rights advocate, who has been a real aid and public servant to african-american communities. so this strikes at his whole identity and the way he views his political brand.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "keilar: and, astead, what do you think?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "ok. so, and why -- why is that? is that just that sort of -- his ability to sort of have a one-on-one relation -- he wanted to stay above the fray it seemed like. no one likes what kamala harris called a food fight is what he seemed to be saying.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "[13:25:04] lizza: well, first, he's got a good rapport with chris that, you know, they know each other. and he's able -- look, he doesn't have nine other people sniping at him. he has a chance to answer with longer statements.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "i thought it was a little strange that he said, you know, he -- oh, you only get 30 seconds to respond. but, i mean, that's the nature of a debate. everyone knows that. it's not going to be much different when he takes on trump because, look, there's so many levels of what harris did here. there's just the pure policy level, was he wrong to oppose federally mandated desegregation via busing back in the '70s? that's one thing. but the other thing, i think maybe even the broader issue is, is he made biden -- she -- excuse me, she made biden look unprepared, right? you know --", "augmented": []}
{"original": "keilar: that's right. and he said -- he even said i wasn't prepared for that, right? i think he was expecting a different kind of attack.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "keilar: now, taking on president trump, to that point, ryan, one of the things that stood out to me in this was that he raised the specter of physically taking on president trump. so you'll recall, in that 2016 town hall debate that donald trump had with hillary clinton, and i think we actually may have a picture of this, that he was standing kind of menacingly behind hillary clinton. it became a meme, right? and he actually said here, you know, if trump were to walk behind me, and the head -- there's the head-on shot, right? he basically said, you know, if trump were to walk behind me, hinting at that, what did you think, astead?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "herndon: yes, we've seen vice president biden do this before, kind of hint at the fact, you know, his brand is kind of a tougher guy and he said, he said i think last year they had a back-and-forth about the kind of physical confrontation again.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "i think to the broader point, this is him again trying to play to that electability kind of figurative that he wants to present himself as, as the person who can match trump on his own turf and best him at that.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "what i think, though, is the risk here is that this is a democratic electorate that while vice president biden may have enjoyed that reputation months ago as kind of the only person who can deal with trump on that plane, i think that is what the debate has changed. to ryan's point, senator harris was able to kind of bring him down to earth and look just like those other candidates. and so i think we see in polling now the kind of -- the question of who can best take on trump, senator warren, senator harris are seeing bumps in that -- in that question, and that strikes at the real heart of vice president biden's campaign and even in statements like that.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "and now i want to give you an idea of what to expect over the next 90 minutes or so. we want to have a real conversation between these two candidates on the issues important to texas and the entire nation, so we won't have any hard and fast rules for them to follow. we simply ask the candidates to keep their answers to a reasonable length and to stay on point.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and we have given the candidates the opportunity to make opening statements. the order was determined by a draw. senator obama won the draw and elected to go second.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "so please go ahead, senator clinton.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "sen. hillary clinton: well, thank you.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and i am just delighted to be back here in austin. you know, nearly 36 years ago i came to austin for my very first political job, and that was registering voters in south texas. and i had the great privilege of living for a while in austin and in san antonio, and meeting people and making friends that have stayed with me for a lifetime.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and i found that we had a lot in common, a lot of shared values, a belief that hard work is important, that self-reliance and individual responsibility count for a lot.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "clinton: and among the people whom i got to know, who became not only friends, but heroes, were barbara jordan, who taught me a lot about courage, and today...", "augmented": []}
{"original": "...would actually be her birthday. i remember all the time about how she got up every single morning, facing almost insurmountable odds, to do what she did.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and another was my great friend ann richards, who taught me so much...", "augmented": []}
{"original": "... about determination. ann was a great champion for the people of texas. she also reminded us that every so often it is good to have a laugh about what it is we're engaged in.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and as i think back on those years and the work that i've done ever since, you know, for me politics is about making real differences in people's lives. i am very, very proud that over these years i have been able to make a difference in the lives of people in texas, ohio and elsewhere.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "clinton: you know, 350,000 children in texas get health care every month because i helped to start the children's health insurance program.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and 21,000 national guard and reserve members get access to health care because i went across the party line and joined up with a republican senator to make that happen.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "so there's a lot that we've already done. but there's so much more to do.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "i want to take on the tough issues that face us now. i want to stop the health insurance companies from discriminating against people because they're sick. you know, it's unconstitutional to discriminate on the basis of race or gender or ethnic origin or religion, but it's ok to discriminate against sick people.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and we're going to end that, because it's time we said no more.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and i want to continue the work that i've done in the senate to take care of our veterans.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "clinton: it was shocking and shameful, what happened, that we discovered about a year ago at walter reed. we can do so much better, to take care of the people who've taken care of us.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and there is a lot of work ahead. i offer a lifetime of experience and proven results. and i know that, if we work together, we can take on the special interests, transfer $55 billion of all those giveaways and subsidies that president bush has given them, back to the middle class, to create jobs and provide health care and make college affordable.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and i ask you -- i ask you to join in my campaign. it's now up to the people of texas, ohio, and the other states ahead.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "sen. barack obama: first of all, thank you so much to the university of texas for hosting us, and it's a great honor to share the stage once again with senator clinton. i've said before that we've been friends before this campaign started; we'll be friends afterwards, unified to bring about changes in this country.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "you know, we are at a defining moment in our history. our nation is at war, and our economy is increasingly in shambles. and the families of texas and all across america are feeling the brunt of that failing economy.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "one mother in green bay gave me this bracelet in memory of a 20- year-old son who had been killed in a roadside bomb, as a consequence of a war that i believe should have never been authorized and should have never been waged and has cost us billions of dollars that could have been invested here in the united states in roads and bridges and infrastructure and making sure that young people can go to college and that those who need health care actually get it.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "... senator clinton and i have been talking about these issues for the last 13 months. we both offer detailed proposals to try to deal with them. some of them are the same. some we have differences of opinion.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "but i think we both recognize that these problems have to be dealt with and that we have seen an administration over the last seven years that has failed to address them and -- in many ways -- has made them worse.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "but understand that what is lacking right now is not good ideas.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "obama: the problem we have is that washington has become a place where good ideas go to die. they go to die because the lobbyists...", "augmented": []}
{"original": "they go to die because lobbyists and special interests have a strangle-hold on the agenda in washington. they go to die in washington because too many politicians are interested in scoring political points rather than bridging differences in order to get things done.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and so the central premise of this campaign is that we can bring this country together, that we can push against the special interests that have come to dominate the agenda in washington, that we can be straight with the american people about how we're going to solve these problems and enlist them in taking back their government.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "you know, senator clinton mentioned barbara jordan, somebody who was an inspiration to me and so many people throughout the country. and she said that what the american people want is very simple: they want an america that is as good as its promise.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "obama: i'm running for president because i want to help america be as good as its promise.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "brown: all right, senator obama, thank you, and let's begin with questions.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "univision's jorge ramos: thank you very much (speaking in spanish).", "augmented": []}
{"original": "thank you so much for being with us, and let me start with a little news. after nearly half a century in office, fidel castro resigned as the head of the cuban government. ninety miles off the coast of the united states, we might have a new opportunity.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the question for you, senator clinton: would you be willing to sit down with raul castro, or whoever leads the cuban dictatorship when you take office at least just once, to get a measure of the man?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "clinton: well, jorge, i hope we have an opportunity. the people of cuba deserve to have a democracy. and this gives the cuban government, under raul castro, a chance to change direction from the one that was set for 50 years by his brother.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "i'm going to be looking for some of those changes: releasing political prisoner, ending some of the oppressive practices on the press, opening up the economy.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "of course the united states stands ready. and, as president, i would be ready to reach out and work with a new cuban government, once it demonstrated that it truly was going to change that direction.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "i want to bring the region together, our european allies who have influence with cuba, to try to push for some of those changes, and to make it very clear that, if cuba moves toward democracy and freedom for its people, the united states will welcome that.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "clinton: and as president, i would look for opportunities to try to make that happen and to create the momentum that might eventually lead to a presidential visit.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "but there has to be evidence that indeed the changes are real; that they are taking place; and that the cuban people will finally be given an opportunity to have their future determined by themselves.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "ramos: very simply, would you meet with him or not, with raul castro?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "clinton: i would not meet with him until there was evidence that change was happening, because i think it's important that they demonstrate clearly that they are committed to change the direction. then i think, you know, something like diplomatic encounters and negotiations over specifics could take place.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "but we've had this conversation before, senator obama and myself, and i believe that we should have full diplomatic engagement where appropriate. but a presidential visit should not be offered and given without some evidence that it will demonstrate the kind of progress that is in our interest, and in this case, in the interests of the cuban people.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "brown: senator obama, just to follow up, you had said in a previous cnn debate that you would meet with the leaders of cuban, iran, north korea, among others, so presumably you would be willing to meet with the new leader of cuba.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "obama: that's correct. now, keep in mind that the starting point for our policy in cuba should be the liberty of the cuban people. and i think we recognize that that liberty has not existed throughout the castro regime. and we now have an opportunity to potentially change the relationship between the united states and cuba after over half a century.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "i would meet without preconditions, although senator clinton is right that there has to be preparation. it is very important for us to make sure that there was an agenda, and on that agenda was human rights, releasing of political prisoners, opening up the press. and that preparation might take some time.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "but i do think that it's important for the united states not just to talk to its friends, but also to talk to its enemies. in fact, that's where diplomacy makes the biggest difference.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "obama: one other thing that i've said, as a show of good faith that we're interested in pursuing potentially a new relationship, what i've called for is a loosening of the restrictions on remittances from family members to the people of cuba, as well as travel restrictions for family members who want to visit their family members in cuba.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and i think that initiating that change in policy as a start and then suggesting that an agenda get set up is something that could be useful, but i would not normalize relations until we started seeing some of the progress that senator clinton was talking about.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "brown: but that's different from your position back in 2003. you called u.s. policy toward cuba a miserable failure, and you supported normalizing relations.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "obama: i support the eventual normalization. and it's absolutely true that i think our policy has been a failure. i mean, the fact is, is that during my entire lifetime, and senator clinton's entire lifetime, you essentially have seen a cuba that has been isolated, but has not made progress when it comes to the issues of political rights and personal freedoms that are so important to the people of cuba.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "so i think that we have to shift policy. i think our goal has to be ultimately normalization. but that's going to happen in steps. and the first step, as i said, is changing our rules with respect to remittances and with respect to travel.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and then i think it is important for us to have the direct contact, not just in cuba, but i think this principle applies generally. i recall what john f. kennedy once said, that we should never negotiate out of fear, but we should never fear to negotiate. and this moment, this opportunity when fidel castro has finally stepped down, i think, is one that we should try to take advantage of.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "brown: senator clinton, do you want a quick response?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "clinton: well, i agree, absolutely, that we should be willing to have diplomatic negotiations and processes with anyone. i've been a strong advocate of opening up such a diplomatic process with iran, for a number of years.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "because i think we should look for ways that we can possibly move countries that are adversarial to us, you know, toward the world community. it's in our interests. it's in the interests of the people in countries that, frankly, are oppressed, like cuba, like iran.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "but there has been this difference between us over when and whether the president should offer a meeting, without preconditions, with those with whom we do not have diplomatic relations. and it should be part of a process, but i don't think it should be offered in the beginning. because i think that undermines the capacity for us to actually take the measure of somebody like raul castro or ahmadinejad and others.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "clinton: and, as president kennedy said, he wouldn't be afraid to negotiate, but he would expect there to be a lot of preparatory work done, to find out exactly what we would get out of it.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and therefore, i do think we should be eliminating the policy of the bush administration, which has been very narrowly defined, and frankly against our interests, because we have failed to reach out to countries, we have alienated our friends, and we have emboldened our enemies.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "so i would get back to very vigorous diplomacy, and i would use bipartisan diplomacy. i would ask emissaries from both political parties to represent me and our country, because i want to send a very clear message to the rest of the world that the era of unilateralism, preemption and arrogance of the bush administration is over and we're going to...", "augmented": []}
{"original": "brown: very briefly and then we're going to move on.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "obama: i think, as i said before, preparation is actually absolutely critical in any meeting. and i think it is absolutely true that either of us would step back from some of the bush unilateralism that's caused so much damage.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "but i do think it is important precisely because the bush administration has done so much damage to american foreign relations that the president take a more active role in diplomacy than might have been true 20 or 30 years ago.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "because the problem is, if we think that meeting with the president is a privilege that has to be earned, i think that reinforces the sense that we stand above the rest of the world at this point in time. and i think that it's important for us in undoing the damage that has been done over the last seven years, for the president to be willing to take that extra step.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "obama: that is the kind of step that i would like to take as president of the united states.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "brown: a question now on the economy.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "cnn's john king: campbell, senators, good evening, first.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "i want to bring the conversation back home. you know from your travels -- you don't need to look at the polls or anything else -- that the economy is by far now the dominant issue that voters want to hear about from the candidates.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "for some, that is a question about: what should we do about an economy that is at the edge or perhaps in the early stages of a recession? for some, it is more focused. maybe it is: will you raise the minimum wage? maybe it's about trade deals that they think leave them on the raw end, as you mentioned in your opening statement, senator obama.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "but when we ask democrats, how are these two candidates different?, they even think they don't know.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "senator obama, beginning with you, tell us as specifically as you can, how would a president obama be different than a president clinton in managing the nation's economy?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "obama: well, first of all, let me emphasize the point that you just made, which is: you don't need an economist or the federal reserve to tell the american people that the economy's in trouble, because they've been experiencing it for years now.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "everywhere you go, you meet people who are working harder for less, wages and incomes have flatlined, people are seeing escalating costs of everything from health care to gas at the pump.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and so people have been struggling for a long time. in some communities, they have been struggling for decades now. so this has to be a priority of the next president.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "now, what i've said is that we have to restore a sense of fairness and balance to our economy, and that means a couple of things.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "number one, with our tax code: we've got to stop giving tax breaks to companies that are shipping jobs overseas and invest those tax breaks in companies that are investing here in the united states of america.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "we have to end the bush tax cuts to the wealthy...", "augmented": []}
{"original": "... and to provide tax breaks to middle-class americans and working americans who need them.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "obama: so i've said that if you are making $75,000 a year or less, i want to give an offset to your payroll tax that will mean $1,000 extra in the pockets of ordinary americans. senior citizens making less than $50,000, you shouldn't have to pay income tax on your social security.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "we pay for these by closing tax loopholes and tax havens that are being manipulated.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "on our trade deals, i think it is absolutely critical that we engaged in trade, but it has to be viewed not just through the lens of wall street, but also main street, which means we've got strong labor standards and strong environmental standards and safety standards, so we don't have toys being shipped in the united states with lead paint on them.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "so these are all issues that i've talked about repeatedly, and i think there are also opportunities in our economy around creating a green economy. we send $1 billion to foreign countries every day because of our addiction to foreign oil.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "obama: and for us to move rapidly to cap greenhouse gases, generate billions of dollars that we can reinvest in solar and wind and biodiesel -- that can put people back to work. so...", "augmented": []}
{"original": "now, i don't want to take too much time. and i'm sure we'll be spend more time discussing this.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "senator clinton and i, i think, both agree on many of these issues. and i think it's a credit to the democratic party as a whole that the other candidates who were involved earlier on agreed with us on many of these issues.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "i think that there is a real, solid agenda for moving change forward in the next presidency.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the question people are going to have to ask is: how do we get it done?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and it is my strong belief that the changes are only going to come about if we're able to form a working coalition for change. because people who were benefiting from the current tax code are going to resist. the special interests and lobbyists are going to resist.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and i think it has to be a priority for whoever the next president is to be able to overcome the dominance of the special interests in washington, to bring about the kinds of economic changes that i'm talking about.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "obama: and that's an area where senator clinton and i may have a slight difference. but i'm happy to let her speak first and then can pick up on anything that's been left out.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "king: let's give senator clinton that opportunity then.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "as you have campaigned, senator, on this issue and others, but specifically on this issue, you have said, i am ready on day one to take charge of the economy.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the clear implication, since you have one opponent at the moment, is that you're ready; he's not.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "what would you do differently on day one than a president obama would when it comes to managing the nation's economy?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "clinton: well, i would agree with a lot that senator obama just said, because it is the democratic agenda.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "clinton: we are going to rid the tax code of these loopholes and giveaways.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "we're going to stop giving a penny of your money to anybody who ships a job out of texas, ohio or anywhere else to another country.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "we're certainly going to begin to get the tax code to reflect what the needs of middle class families are so we can rebuild a strong and prosperous middle class.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "you know, the wealthy and the well-connected have had a president the last seven years, and i think it's time that the rest of america had a president to work for you every single day.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "we will also have a different approach toward trade.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "we're going to start having trade agreements that not only have strong environmental and labor standards, but i want to have a trade time-out. we're going to look and see what's working and what's not working, and i'd like to have a trade prosecutor to actually enforce the trade agreements that we have before we enter into any others.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "we're also going to put much tougher standards in place so that people cannot import toys with lead paint, contaminated pet food, contaminated drugs into our market. we're going to have much more vigorous enforcement of safety standards.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "clinton: now, in addition, there are steps i would take immediately. one is on this foreclosure crisis. i have been saying for nearly a year we had to crack down on the abusive practices of the lenders. but we also need a moratorium on home foreclosures.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "everywhere i go, i meet people who either have been or about to lose their home. 85,000 homes in foreclosure in texas; 90,000 in ohio. i've met the families: the hairdresser, the single mom who's going to lose her home, the postal worker who got really hoodwinked into an agreement that wasn't fair to him.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "so i would put a moratorium for 90 days, to give us time to work out a way for people to stay in their homes, and i would freeze interest rates for five years. because these adjustable-rate mortgages, if they keep going up, millions of americans are going to be homeless. and vacant homes will be across the neighborhoods of texas and america.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "clinton: now, in addition, there are three ways we need to jump start the economy.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "clean green jobs; i've been promoting this. i wanted it to be part of the stimulus package. i thought a $5 billion investment in clean green jobs would put hundreds of thousands of americans to work helping to create our future.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "we also need to invest in our infrastructure. we don't have enough roads to take care of the congestion, we have crumbling bridges and tunnels. we need to rebuild america, and that will also put people to work.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and, finally, we need to end george bush's war on science, which has been waged against scientists and researchers...", "augmented": []}
{"original": "brown: thank you, senator. and we've got a lot of ground to cover...", "augmented": []}
{"original": "clinton: this is about how we fund the future. we've got to get back to being the innovation nation. think of everything that goes on at this great university to create the new economy...", "augmented": []}
{"original": "brown: all right. senator clinton, thank you very much.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "brown: and, as i was saying, we've got a lot to get through. so i do want to shift gears and go on to another topic especially important here in texas, which is immigration.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and, jorge, you have a question.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "ramos: (speaking in spanish) federal raids by immigration enforcement officials on homes and businesses have generated a great deal of fear and anxiety in the hispanic community and have divided the family of some of the 3 million u.s.-born children who have at least one undocumented parent.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "would you consider stopping these raids once you take office until comprehensive immigration reform can be passed?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "clinton: i would consider that, except in egregious situations where it would be appropriate to take the actions you're referring to.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "but when we see what's been happening, with literally babies being left with no one to take care of them, children coming home from school, no responsible adult left, that is not the america that i know.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "clinton: that is against american values. and it is...", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and it is a stark admission of failure by the federal government. we need comprehensive immigration reform. i have been for this. i signed onto the first comprehensive bill back in 2004. i've been advocating for it: tougher, more secure borders, of course, but let's do it the right way, cracking down on employers, especially once we get to comprehensive immigration reform, who exploit undocumented workers and drive down wages for everyone else.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "i'd like to see more federal help for communities like austin and others like laredo, where i was this morning, that absorb the health care, education, and law enforcement costs.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and i personally, as president, would work with our neighbors to the south, to help them create more jobs for their own people.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "finally, we need a path to legalization, to bring the immigrants out of the shadows, give them the conditions that we expect them to meet, paying a fine for coming here illegally, trying to pay back taxes, over time, and learning english.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "if they had a committed a crime in our country or the country they came from, then they should be deported. but for everyone else, there must be a path to legalization. i would introduce that in the first 100 days of my presidency.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "brown: senator obama, is your position the same as hillary clinton's?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "obama: there are a couple of things i would add. comprehensive immigration reform is something that i have worked on extensively.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "two years ago, we were able to get a bill out of the senate. i was one of the group of senators that helped to move it through, but it died in the house this year. because it was used as a political football instead of a way of solving a problem, nothing happened.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and so there are a couple of things that i would just add to what senator clinton said.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "number one, it is absolutely critical that we tone down the rhetoric when it comes to the immigration debate, because there has been an undertone that has been ugly.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "oftentimes, it has been directed at the hispanic community. we have seen hate crimes skyrocket in the wake of the immigration debate as it has been conducted in washington, and that is unacceptable.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "we are a nation of laws and we are a nation of immigrants, and we can reconcile those two things. so we need comprehensive reform...", "augmented": []}
{"original": "... we need comprehensive reform, and that means stronger border security. it means that we are cracking down on employers that are taking advantage of undocumented workers because they can't complain if they're not paid a minimum wage.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "obama: they can't complain if they're not getting overtime. worker safety laws are not being observed.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "we have to crack down on those employers, although we also have to make sure that we do it in a way that doesn't lead to people with spanish surnames being discriminated against, so there's got to be a safeguard there.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "we have to require that undocumented workers, who are provided a pathway to citizenship, not only learn english, pay back taxes and pay a significant fine, but also that they're going to the back of the line, so that they are not getting citizenship before those who have applied legally, which raises two last points.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "number one, it is important that we fix the legal immigration system, because right now we've got a backlog that means years for people to apply legally.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and what's worse is, we keep on increasing the fees, so that if you've got a hard working immigrant family, they've got to hire a lawyer; they've got to pay thousands of dollars in fees. they just can't afford it. and it's discriminatory against people who have good character, we should want in this country, but don't have the money. so we've got to fix that.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "obama: so we've got to fix that.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the second thing is, we have to improve our relationship with mexico and work with the mexican government so that their economy is producing jobs on that side of the border.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and the problem that we have...", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the problem that we have is that we have had an administration that came in promising all sorts of leadership on creating a u.s.- mexican relationship. and, frankly, president bush dropped the ball. he has been so obsessed with iraq that we have not seen the kinds of outreach and cooperative work that would ensure that the mexican economy is working not just for the very wealthy in mexico, but for all people. and that's as policy that i'm going to change when i'm president of the united states.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "we're going to stay with this topic. i want to have john king ask another question.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "king: i want to stay on the issue, but move to a controversial item that was not held up when the immigration debate collapsed in washington, and that is the border fence.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "king: to many americans, it is a simple question of sovereignty and security. america should be able to keep people out that it doesn't want in.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "but, as you know in this state, especially if you go to the south of here, along the border, and in other border states, to many people it's a much more personal question. it could be a question of their livelihood. it could be a question of cross-border trade. it might be an issue to a rancher of property rights. it might be a simple question of whether someone can take a walk or a short drive to see their family members.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "senator, back in 2006, you voted for the construction of that fence. as you know, progress has been slow.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "as president of the united states, would you commit tonight that you would finish the fence and speed up the construction, or do you think it's time for a president of the united states to raise his or her hand and say, you know what? wait a minute. let's think about this again. do we really want to do this?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "clinton: well, i think both senator obama and i voted for that as part of the immigration debate.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "clinton: and having been along the border for the last week or so -- in fact, last night i was at the university of texas at brownsville -- and this is how absurd this has become under the bush administration. because, you know, there is a smart way to protect our borders, and there is a dumb way to protect our borders.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and what i learned last night when i was there with congressman ortiz is that the university of texas at brownsville would have part of its campus cut off.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "this is the kind of absurdity that we're getting from this administration. i know it because i've been fighting with them about the northern border. their imposition of passports and other kinds of burdens are separating people from families, interfering with business and commerce, the movement of goods and people.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "so what i've said is that i would say, wait a minute, we need to review this. there may be places where a physical barrier is appropriate.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "i think when both of us voted for this, we were voting for the possibility that where it was appropriate and made sense, it would be considered. but as with so much, the bush administration has gone off the deep end, and they are unfortunately coming up with a plan that i think is counterproductive.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "clinton: so i would have a review. i would listen to the people who live along the border, who understand...", "augmented": []}
{"original": "... what it is we need to be doing to protect our country.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "brown: let me go on, again -- john?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "king: does that mean that you think your vote was wrong, or the implementation of it was wrong?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "because, as you know, when they first built the fence in the san diego area, it only went so far. and what it did was it sopped the people coming straight up the path of where that was built, and they simply moved. and california's problem became arizona's problem.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "clinton: but, you know, john, there is -- there's a lot we've learned about technology and smart fencing. you know, there is technology that can be used instead of a physical barrier.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "clinton: it requires us having enough personnel along the border so that people can be supervising a certain limited amount of space and will be able to be responsive in the event of people attempting to cross illegally.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "i think that the way that the bush administration is going about this, filing eminent domain actions against landowners and municipalities, makes no sense.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "so what i have said is, yes, there are places when after a careful review, again listening to the people who live along the border, there may be limited places where it would work. but let's deploy more technology and personnel, instead of the physical barrier.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "i frankly think that will work better and it will give us an opportunity to secure our borders without interfering with family relations, business relations, recreation and so much else that makes living along the border, you know, wonderful.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "clinton: and the people who live there need to have a president who understands it, will listen to them and be responsive.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "obama: well, this is an area where senator clinton and i almost entirely agree. i think that the key is to consult with local communities, whether it's on the commercial interests or the environmental stakes of creating any kind of barrier.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and the bush administration is not real good at listening. that's not what they do well.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and so i will reverse that policy. as senator clinton indicated, there may be areas where it makes sense to have some fencing. but for the most part, having border patrolled, surveillance, deploying effective technology, that's going to be the better approach.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the one thing i do have to say, though, about this issue is, it is very important for us, i think, to deal with this problem in terms of thousands of -- hundreds of thousands of people coming over the borders on a regular basis if we want to also provide opportunity for the 12 million undocumented workers who are here.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "obama: senator clinton and i have both campaigned in places like iowa and ohio and my home state of illinois, and i think that the american people want fairness, want justice. i think they recognize that the idea that you're going to deport 12 million people is ridiculous, that we're not going to be devoting all our law enforcement resources...", "augmented": []}
{"original": "but what they do also want is some order to the process. and so, we're not going to be able to do these things in isolation. we're not going to be able to deal with the 12 million people who are living in the shadows and give them a way of getting out of the shadows if we don't also deal with the problem of this constant influx of undocumented workers.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and that's why i think comprehensive reform is so important. that's the kind of leadership that i've shown in the past; that's the kind of leadership that i'll show in the future.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "one last point i want to make on the immigration issue because we may be moving to different topics: something that we can do immediately that i think is very important is to pass the dream act, which allows children who through no fault of their own are here but have essentially grown up as americans, allow them the opportunity for higher education.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "many of them are right here. by the year 2050, there will be 120 million hispanics in the united states. now, is there any downside, senator clinton, to the united states becoming (speaking spanish) becoming a bilingual nation? is there a limit?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "clinton: well, i think it's important for as many americans as possible to do what i have never been able to do, and that is learn another language and try to be bilingual because that connects us to the rest of the world.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "i think it is important, though, that english remain our common unifying language because that brings our country together in a way that we have seen generations of immigrants coming to our shores be able to be part of the american experience and pursue the american dream.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "you know, i have been adamantly against the efforts by some to make english the official language. that i do not believe is appropriate, and i have voted against it and spoken against it.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "clinton: i represent new york. we have 170 languages in new york city alone. and i do not think that we should be, in any way, discriminating against people who do not speak english, who use facilities like hospitals or have to go to court to enforce their rights.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "but i do think that english does remain an important part of the american experience. so i encourage people to become bilingual. but i also want to see english remain the common, unifying language of our country.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "ramos: senator obama, is there any down side to the united states becoming a bilingual nation?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "obama: well, i think it is important that everyone learns english and that we have that process of binding ourselves together as a country. i think that's very important.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "i also think that every student should be learning a second language, because...", "augmented": []}
{"original": "... you know, so, when you start getting into a debate about bilingual education, for example, now, i want to make sure that children who are coming out of spanish-speaking households had the opportunity to learn and are not falling behind.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "obama: if bilingual education helps them do that, i want to give them the opportunity.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "but i also want to make sure that english-speaking children are getting foreign languages because this world is becoming more interdependent and part of the process of america's continued leadership in the world is going to be our capacity to communicate across boundaries, across borders, and that's something frankly where we've fallen behind.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "one of the failures of no child left behind, a law that i think a lot of local and state officials have been troubled by, is that it is so narrowly focused on standardized tests that it has pushed out a lot of important learning that needs to take place.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "i've been watching each of you give speeches in arenas not unlike this one individually. and the tone is often quite different than the very polite, substantive discourse we've had tonight.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and so, i want to ask you about that. there are times when each of you seems to call into question the other one's credibility or truthfulness.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and, senator clinton, i want to talk specifically about some words you've spoken here in the state of texas over the past couple of days.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "you've said, quote, my opponent gives speeches; i offer solutions.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "you said the choice for democrats in this campaign is, quote, talk versus action.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "now, in a campaign that some of us are old enough to remember, maybe not many of the students here, this would be called the where's the beef? question.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "but, since we're in texas, i'd like to borrow a phrase that they often use here and you've used yourself in the context of president bush. are you saying that your opponent is all hat and no cattle, and can you say that after the last 45 minutes?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "clinton: well, i have said that about president bush, and i think our next president needs to be a lot less hat and a lot more cattle.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "you know, i think you can tell from the first 45 minutes, you know, senator obama and i have a lot in common. we both care passionately about our country. we are devoted to public service. we care deeply about the future, and we have run a very vigorous and contested primary campaign, which has been by most standards, i think, very positive and extremely civil.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "clinton: but there are differences between us. and i think, in our efforts to draw those contrasts and comparisons, we obviously try to let voters know how we see the world differently.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and i do offer solutions. that's what i believe in and what i have done. and it's what i offer to voters because it's part of my life, over the last 35 years, working to get kids health care, working to expand legal services for the poor, working to register voters, working to make a difference. because i think that this country has given me so much.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and there are differences between our records and our accomplishments. i have to confess, i was somewhat amused, the other night, when, on one of the tv shows, one of senator obama's supporters couldn't.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "so i know that there are comparisons and contrasts to be drawn between us. and it's important that voters get that information. so, yes, i do think that words are important and words matter, but actions speak louder than words. and i offer...", "augmented": []}
{"original": "brown: senator obama, do you want to respond?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "obama: well, i think actions do speak louder than words, which is why over the 20 years of my public service i have acted a lot to provide health care to people who didn't have it, to provide tax breaks to families that needed it, to reform a criminal justice system that had resulted in wrongful convictions, to open up our government and to pass the toughest ethics reform legislation since watergate, to make sure that we create transparency...", "augmented": []}
{"original": "... to make sure that we create transparency in our government so that we know where federal spending is going and it's not going to a bunch of boondoggles and earmarks that are wasting taxpayer money that could be spent on things like early childhood education.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "you know, i think if you talk to those wounded warriors at walter reed who, prior to me getting to the senate, were having to pay for their meals and have to pay for their phone calls to their family while they're recovering from amputations, i think they've said that i've engaged not just in talk, but in action.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "obama: now, i think that senator clinton has a fine record and i don't want to denigrate that record. i do think there is a fundamental difference between us in terms of how change comes about. senator clinton of late has said: let's get real. the implication is that the people who've been voting for me or involved in my campaign are somehow delusional.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and that, you know, the 20 million people who've been paying attention to 19 debates and the editorial boards all across the country at newspapers who have given me endorsements, including every major newspaper here in the state of texas.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "obama: you know, the thinking is that somehow, they're being duped, and eventually they're going to see the reality of things.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "well, i think they perceive reality of what's going on in washington very clearly. what they see is that if we don't bring the country together, stop the endless bickering, actually focus on solutions and reduce the special interests that have dominated washington, then we will not get anything done. and the reason that this campaign has done so well...", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the reason that this campaign has done so well is because people understand that it is not just a matter of putting forward policy positions.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "obama: senator clinton and i share a lot of policy positions. but if we can't inspire the american people to get involved in their government and if we can't inspire them to go beyond the racial divisions and the religious divisions and the regional divisions that have plagued our politics for so long, then we will continue to see the kind of gridlock and nonperformance in washington that is resulting in families suffering in very real ways.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "i'm running for president to start doing something about that suffering, and so are the people who are behind my campaign.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "brown: i think one of the points -- i think one of the points that john king was alluding to in talking about some of senator clinton's comments is there has been a lot of attention lately on some of your speeches, that they are very similar to some of the speeches by your friend and supporter deval patrick, the governor of massachusetts, and senator clinton's campaign has made a big issue of this. to be blunt, they've accused you of plagiarism.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "obama: well, look, the -- first of all, it's not a lot of speeches. there are two lines in speeches that i've been giving over the last couple of weeks.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "i've been campaigning now for the last two years. deval is a national co-chairman of my campaign, and suggested an argument that i share, that words are important. words matter. and the implication that they don't i think diminishes how important it is to speak to the american people directly about making america as good as its promise. barbara jordan understood this as well as anybody.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "obama: and the notion that i had plagiarized from somebody who was one of my national co-chairs...", "augmented": []}
{"original": "... who gave me the line and suggested that i use it, i think, is silly, and...", "augmented": []}
{"original": "... you know, this is where we start getting into silly season, in politics, and i think people start getting discouraged about it...", "augmented": []}
{"original": "what they want is, how are we going to create good jobs and good wages?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "how are we going to provide health care to the american people?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "how are we going to make sure that college is affordable?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "so what i've been talking about, in this speeches -- and i've got to admit, some of them are pretty good.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "what i've been talking about is not just hope and not just inspiration. it's a $4,000 tuition credit for every student, every year, in exchange for national service...", "augmented": []}
{"original": "... so that college becomes more affordable.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "obama: i've been talking about making sure that we change our tax code so that working families actually get relief. i have been talking about making sure that we bring an end to this war in iraq so that we can start bringing our troops home and invest money here in the united states.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "so just to finish up, these are very specific, concrete, detailed proposals, many of them which i have been working on for years now. senator clinton has a fine record. so do i. i'm happy to have a debate on the issues, but what we shouldn't be spending time doing is tearing each other down. we should be spending time lifting the country up.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "brown: senator clinton, is it the silly season?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "clinton: well, i think that if your candidacy is going to be about words, then they should be your own words. that's, i think, a very simple proposition.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and, you know, lifting whole passages from someone else's speeches is not change you can believe in, it's change you can xerox. and i just don't think...", "augmented": []}
{"original": "clinton: no, but, you know, but, barack, it is.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "because, you know, if you look -- if you look -- if you look at the youtube of these videos, it does raise questions.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "now, there is no doubt that you are a passionate, eloquent speaker, and i applaud you for that. but when you look at what we face in this country, we do need to unite the country, but we have to unite it for a purpose around very specific goals.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "clinton: it is not enough to say, let's come together. we know we're going to have to work hard to overcome the opposition of those who do not want the changes to get to universal health care.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "you know, when i proposed a universal health care plan, as did senator edwards, we took a big risk, because we know it's politically controversial to say we're going to cover everyone.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and you chose not to do that. you chose to put forth a health care plan that will leave out at least 15 million people. that's a big difference.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "when i said we should put a moratorium on home foreclosures, basically your response was, well, that wouldn't work.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and, you know, in the last week, even president bush has said we have to do something like that.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "i just believe that we've got to look hard at the difficult challenges we face, especially after george bush leaves the white house.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "clinton: the world will breathe a sigh of relief once he is gone. we all know that.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "but then we've got to do the hard work of not just bringing the country together, but overcoming a lot of the entrenched opposition to the very ideas that both of us believe in, and for some of us have been fighting for, for a very long time. you know, when i took on...", "augmented": []}
{"original": "when i took on universal health care back in '93 and '94, it was against a firestorm of special interest opposition. i was more than happy to do that, because i believe passionately in getting quality affordable health care to every american.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "i don't want to leave anybody out. i see the results of leaving people out. i am tired of health insurance companies deciding who will live or die in america.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "brown: all right, senator clinton, thank you.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "obama: well, i think that senator clinton mentioned two specific issue areas where we've got some differences. i'm happy to debate those, which is what i think should be the focus of this campaign. we both want universal health care.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "when i released my plan a few months later, we were in a debate and senator clinton said we all want universal health care. of course, i was down 20 points in the polls at the time, and so my plan was pretty good. it's not as good now, but my plan hasn't changed. the politics have changed a little bit.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "we both -- 95 percent of our plans are similar. we both want to set up a system in which any person is going to be able to get coverage that is as good as we have as members of congress. and we are going to subsidize those who can't afford it.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "obama: we're going to make sure that we reduce costs by emphasizing prevention. and i want to make sure that we're applying technology to improve quality, cut bureaucracy.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "now, i also want to make sure that we're reducing costs for those who already have health insurance. so we put in place a catastrophic reinsurance plan that would reduce costs by $2,500 per family per year.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "so we've got a lot of similarities in our plan. we've got a philosophical difference, which we've debated repeatedly, and that is that senator clinton believes the only way to achieve universal health care is to force everybody to purchase it.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and my belief is, the reason that people don't have it is not because they don't want it but because they can't afford it.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and so i emphasize reducing costs.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and as has been noted by many observers, including bill clinton's former secretary of labor, my plan does more than anybody to reduce costs, and there is nobody out there who wants health insurance who can't have it.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "obama: now, there are legitimate arguments for why senator clinton and others have called for a mandate, and i'm happy to have that debate.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "but the notion that i am leaving 15 million people out somehow implies that we are different in our goals of providing coverage to all americans, and that is simply not true. we think that there's going to be a different way of getting there.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "one last point i want to make on the health care front. i admire the fact that senator clinton tried to bring about health care reform back in 1993. she deserves credit for that.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "but i said before, i think she did it in the wrong way, because it wasn't just the fact that the insurance companies, the drug companies were battling here, and no doubt they were. it was also that senator clinton and the administration went behind closed doors, excluded the participation even of democratic members of congress who had slightly different ideas than the ones that senator clinton had put forward.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and, as a consequence, it was much more difficult to get congress to cooperate.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "obama: and i've said that i'm going to do things differently. i think we have to open up the process. everybody has to have a seat at the table. and most importantly, the american people have to be involved and educated about how this change is going to be brought about.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the point is this, you know, we can have great plans, but if we don't change how the politics is working in washington, then neither of our plans are going to happen, and we're going to be four years from now debating once again how we're going to bring universal health care to this country.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "brown: all right, we've got some time constraints here, so we've got to take another real quick break. stay with us. we've got a lot more ahead.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "you can compare the candidates on the issues any time; just go to our web site, cnnpolitics.com. a lot more ahead here at the university of texas. we'll be right back.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "brown: an enthusiastic crowd here at the university of texas.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "welcome back to the texas democratic debate. let's get right to it. jorge ramos with the next question.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "ramos: senator clinton, yesterday you said, and i'm quoting, one of us is ready to be commander in chief.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "are you saying that senator obama is not ready and not qualified to be commander in chief?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "clinton: well, i believe that i am ready and i am prepared. and i will leave that to the voters to decide.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "but i want to get back to health care, because i didn't get a chance to respond after senator obama finished. no, let me finish, jorge...", "augmented": []}
{"original": "ramos: but i would like to come back...", "augmented": []}
{"original": "clinton: this is a significant difference. you know, senator obama has said it's a philosophical difference. i think it's a substantive difference.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "he has a mandate for parents to be sure to ensure their children. i agree with that. i just know that if we don't go and require everyone to have health insurance, the health insurance industry will still game the system. everyone of us with insurance will pay the hidden tax of approximately $900 a year to make up for the lack of insurance.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and you know, in one of our earlier debates, john edwards made a great point. it would be as though social security were voluntary. medicare, one of the great accomplishments of president johnson, was voluntary.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "i do not believe that is going to work. so it's not just a philosophical difference.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "clinton: you look at what will work and what will not work. if you do not have a plan that starts out attempting to achieve universal health care, you will be nibbled to death, and we will be back here with more and more people uninsured and rising costs.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "brown: all right. we appreciate that you want to make a point, senator obama. we have limited time, so i would like jorge to move on to another subject or we're going to be out of time.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "obama: well, i understand. but i think that senator clinton made a...", "augmented": []}
{"original": "you know, she's making a point, and i think i should have the opportunity to respond very briefly. and i'll try to make...", "augmented": []}
{"original": "obama: number one, understand that when senator clinton says a mandate, it's not a mandate on government to provide health insurance, it's a mandate on individuals to purchase it. and senator clinton is right; we have to find out what works.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "obama: now, massachusetts has a mandate right now. they have exempted 20 percent of the uninsured because they have concluded that that 20 percent can't afford it.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "in some cases, there are people who are paying fines and still can't afford it, so now they're worse off than they were. they don't have health insurance and they're paying a fine.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "in order for you to force people to get health insurance, you've got to have a very harsh penalty, and senator clinton has said that we won't go after their wages. now, this is a substantive difference. but understand that both of us seek to get universal health care. i have a substantive difference with senator clinton on how to get there.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "clinton: wait a minute, no, this is too important. this is the number one issue that people talk to me about. you know, when a mother grabs my arm and says, i can't get the operation my son needs because i don't have health insurance, it is personal for me.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "clinton: and i just fundamentally disagree.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "you know, senator obama's plan has a mandate on parents and a fine if parents do not...", "augmented": []}
{"original": "clinton: because he recognizes that unless we have some kind of restriction, we will not get there.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "we would not have a social compact with social security and medicare if everyone did not have to participate. i want a universal health care plan.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "obama: now, that's -- that mother -- that mother who is desperate to get health care for her child, will be able to get that health care under my plan. point number one.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "point number two, the reason a mandate for children can be effective is we've got an ability to make affordable health care available to that child, right now.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "obama: there are no excuses. if a parent is not providing health care for that child, it's because the parent's not being responsible, under my plan. and those children don't have a choice. but i think that adults are going to be able to see that they can afford it, under my plan; they will get it, under my plan.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and it is true that, if it turns out that some are gaming the system, then we can impose, potentially, some penalties on them for gaming the system.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "here we go again. because we also believe the war in iraq is very important.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and here's the question. are you suggesting that senator obama is not ready; he doesn't have the experience to be commander in chief? that's a question of: what did you mean by that phrase?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "clinton: what i mean is that, you know, for more than 15 years, i've been honored to represent our country in more than 80 countries to negotiate on matters such as opening borders for refugees during the war in kosovo, to stand up for women's rights as human rights around the world. i've served on the senate...", "augmented": []}

{"original": "you know, just this week, it's a good example. we had elections in pakistan, we had change in government in cuba -- or at least the leadership. we've had the elections that, you know, should have happened that haven't happened and just changed the leader the way they do in cuba. we've had kosovo declaring independence, and we have had our embassy set on fire in serbia.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "so we have serious problems that pose a real question about presidential leadership, and also some great opportunities. you know, we now have opportunities perhaps with cuba, i hope with president musharraf, for him to do the right thing.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "clinton: i supported the independence of kosovo because i think it is imperative that in the heart of europe we continue to promote independence and democracy. and i would be moving very aggressively to hold the serbian government responsible with their security forces to protect our embassy. under international law, they should be doing that.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "so when you think about everything that is going to happen, what we can predict and what we cannot predict, i believe that i am prepared and ready on day one to be commander in chief, to be the president, to turn our economy around, and to begin making a lot of these very difficult decisions that we will inherit from george bush. and that is what i am putting forth to the voters.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "my number one job as president will be to keep the american people safe. i will do whatever is required to accomplish that. i will not hesitate to act against those that would do america harm.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "now, that involves maintaining the strongest military on earth, which means that we are training our troops properly and equipping them properly, and putting them on proper rotations. and there are an awful lot of families here in texas who have been burdened under two and three and four tours because of the poor planning of the current commander-in-chief, and that will end when i am president.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "obama: but it also means using our military wisely. and on what i believe was the single most important foreign policy decision of this generation, whether or not to go to war in iraq, i believe i showed the judgment of a commander in chief. and i think that senator clinton was wrong in her judgments on that.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "obama: and as a consequence, they didn't have enough ammunition, they didn't have enough humvees. they were actually capturing taliban weapons, because it was easier to get taliban weapons than it was for them to get properly equipped by our current commander in chief.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "now, that's a consequence of bad judgment. and you know, the question is, on the critical issues that we face right now, who's going to show the judgment to lead? and i think that on every critical issue that we've seen in foreign policy over the last several years -- going into iraq originally, i didn't just oppose it for the sake of opposing it.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "i said this is going to distract us from afghanistan; this is going to fan the flames of anti-american sentiment; it's going to cost us billions of dollars and thousands of lives and overstretch our military. and i was right.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "on the question of pakistan, which senator clinton just raised -- we just had an election there. but i've said very clearly that we have put all our eggs in the musharraf basket. that was a mistake. we should be going after al qaeda and making sure that pakistan is serious about hunting down terrorists, as well as expanding democracy. and i was right about that.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "on the issues that have come up that a commander in chief is going to have to make decisions on, i have shown the judgment to lead. that is the leadership that i want to show when i'm president of the united states.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "king: i want to continue in this vein, and hone in on the very point you just made. because one of you, unless this remarkable campaign here takes another wacky, unpredictable turn, is going to be running against a decorated war hero, who is going to say that you don't have the experience to be commander in chief.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and you have both said, it's not about that type of experience; it's about judgment.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "you both had to make a judgment, a short time ago, in your job in the united states senate, about whether to support the surge. and as that was going on, senator clinton, you had the commanding general in iraq before you. and you said, i think that the reports provide to us really require the willing suspension of disbelief -- your words to general petraeus.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "is iraq today better off than it was six months or a year ago because of the surge?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "clinton: well, john, i think you forget a very important premise of the surge. the rationale of the surge was to create the space and time for the iraqi government to make the decisions that only it can make.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "now, there is no doubt, given the skill and the commitment of our young men and women in uniform that putting more of them in will give us a tactical advantage and will provide security in some places, and that has occurred.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "clinton: but the fact is that the purpose of it has not been fulfilled. the iraqi government has slowly inched toward making a few of the decisions in a less than complete way, but it hasn't taken advantage of the sacrifice and the losses of life and billions of dollars that have occurred since the surge began.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "that is why i have said, upon taking office i would ask the secretary of defense and the joint chiefs of staff and my security advisers to give me a plan so that i could begin withdrawing our troops within 60 days.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and i would begin that with...", "augmented": []}
{"original": "... with a very clear message to the iraqis that they no longer had a blank check, as they had been given by president bush, that as we withdraw our troops, probably one to two brigades a month, they would have to step up and make these decisions.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "clinton: i believe that is in the best interest of our military, which has been stretched thin.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "last night in brownsville, you know, a woman grabbed my hand and said, please, my husband's there for the third time. bring him home.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "brown: senator obama, in the same vein, you were also opposed to the surge from the beginning. were you wrong?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "obama: well, i think it is indisputable that we've seen violence reduced in iraq. and that's a credit to our brave men and women in uniform.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "in fact, you know, the 1st cavalry, out of fort hood, played an enormous role in pushing back al qaeda out of baghdad.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "but this is a tactical victory imposed upon a huge strategic blunder.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "... than having to argue about the tactics subsequent to the decision.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "because, ultimately, that's what's at stake. understand, not only have we been diverted from afghanistan. we've been diverted from focusing on latin america.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "we contribute -- our entire foreign aid to latin america is $2.7 billion, approximately what we spend in iraq in a week.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "obama: and it is any surprise, then, that you've seen people like hugo chavez and countries like china move into the void, because we've been neglectful of that.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "iran is the single biggest strategic beneficiary of us having invaded iraq, and that is something that i think john mccain has to come to terms with.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "so that is a debate that i'm happy to have.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "one last point i want to make on this, and that is, the incredible burden that has been placed on the american people, starting with military families, and the fact that we still are not doing right by our veterans, that we still don't honor their service, that there are still homeless veterans, that we still don't screen properly for post-traumatic stress disorder and make sure that they're getting mental services that they need, that we are still...", "augmented": []}
{"original": "... having veterans in south texas have to drive 250 miles to access a veterans hospital.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "obama: that's unacceptable. but we talked about the economy earlier, the fact that we're spending $12 billion every month in iraq means that we can't engage in the kind of infrastructure improvements that are going to make us more competitive. it means that we can't deliver on the kinds of health care reforms that both senator clinton and i are looking for.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and that is also an argument that we have to have with john mccain because he has said that he is willing to have these troops over there for 100 years. the notion that we would sustain that kind of effort and neglect not only making us more secure here at home, more competitive here at home, allow our economy to sink. as john mccain says, he doesn't really understand the economy that well. it is clear from his embrace of george bush's policies that he doesn't, and that's what i intend to change when i am president of the united states of america.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "brown: all right. we've got to take another quick break. we've got a lot more ahead. stay with us. we'll be right back.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "stay with us after the debate. anderson cooper and the best political team on television will have lots of analysis.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "both of you have been harshly critical of the bush administration for its secrecy, what you consider overuse of secrecy and executive power.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "tonight, senator obama, you've talked about more transparency. you also at one point criticized earmarks.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and yet, a recent report came out that identified you -- lower on the list in terms how much money senators seek and sneak into the budget for these pork barrel spending projects, but it still said you were responsible for $91 million in earmarks.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and you have refused to say where the money went, what it's for. why?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "obama: no, that's not true. we've actually disclosed, john, all our earmarks. and so, you know, we'll be happy to provide you with that information, because i believe very strongly in transparency.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "obama: as i indicated earlier, one of the things that i did last year was to pass a bill with tom coburn, very conservative republican but a sincere fiscal conservative. and we got together and created what we call google for government. it's a searchable database, where every single dollar of federal spending is posted on the internet, so that ordinary voters can take a look. and if they see a bridge to nowhere being built, they know where it's going and who sponsored it. and if they see a no-bid contract going to halliburton, they can check that out, too.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and you know, the idea is that we open up the process so that the american people can make judgments about whether or not government is doing what it's supposed to be doing with its taxpayer money. and i've been consistently in favor of more disclosure around earmarks.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "obama: now, keep in mind, a lot of these are worthy projects in our states. i have actively pursued projects that i think are important. but i want to make sure that they're not done in the dark of night, that they're not done in committee, that everybody stands up and says, this is the kind of spending that i think is important.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "i have consistently supported those efforts. i will push for those as president of the united states of america.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "king: senator clinton, as you know, i think your number was about $342 million. you say they're worthy projects, as senator obama did, for your state and that's part of your job, to get money for worthy projects back in your state.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "senator mccain, as you know, is proud of going around the country earmark.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "on the specific issue of pork barrel spending, fiscal accountability by the government at a time when many americans frankly think, whether it is the house or the senate, that you all waste money on things that aren't important to them, don't affect their daily lives, does he have a better case to make to the american people that, i have done this my entire career; i will do it as president, on the issue of on the issue of wasteful pork barrel spending?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "clinton: well, no, not at all. because he supported the wasteful tax cuts of the bush administration and the iraq war, with the billions of dollars...", "augmented": []}
{"original": "... that have been spent, and wants it to continue.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "you know, when president bush came into office, he inherited a balanced budget and a surplus. and it is gone. and we now are looking at a projected deficit of $400 billion, under the new bush budget, and a $9 trillion debt.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "we borrow money from the chinese to buy oil from the saudis. that is not a winning strategy for america.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "i will get us back to fiscal responsibility. and i will make it clear that the bush tax cuts on the upper income, those making more than $250,000 a year, will be allowed to expire.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "clinton: middle-class tax cuts and support for the middle class, to make college affordable, retirement security possible, health insurance affordable: those will be my priorities.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and i think it's important that we look at where the money has gone under president bush -- no-bid contracts, cronyism, outsourcing the government in ways that haven't saved us money and have reduced accountability.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "so the larger question is, who really is going to move us toward fiscal responsibility, and i believe that we can get back on the path we were on. it was working well. it was one of the reasons why the economy was booming.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "i've got that, you know, clearly in my economic blueprint, which is something that i've published the last few days, because it's part of what we have to do again. and i think that i will be very comfortable and effective in taking on senator mccain over the fiscal irresponsibility of the republican party that he's been a part of.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "ramos: as we can see, this has been an extremely close nomination battle that will come down to superdelegates. house speaker nancy pelosi, the highest ranking democrat in government, said recently, and i'm quoting, it would be a problem -- and this is a question for you, senator clinton -- it would be a problem for the party if the verdict would be something different than the public has decided.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "clinton: well, you know, these are the rules that are followed, and you know, i think that it will sort itself out. i'm not worried about that. we will have a nominee, and we will have a unified democratic party, and we will go on to victory in november.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "and they don't get a sense that the debates that are happening in washington right now relate to them at all. and what they believe is that people are trying to get on tv and they're trying to score points and they're trying to win elections, and that they're not interested in knocking down the barriers that stand between the american people and their dreams.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and i have no doubt that the democratic party at its best can summon a sense of common purpose again and higher purpose for the american people.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "obama: and i think that the next nominee going into the november election is going to have a lot to talk about because the american people are tired of politics that is dominated by the powerful, by the connected. they want their government back, and that's what i intend to provide them when i'm nominated for president of the united states.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "brown: we have time for just one final question, and we thought we would sort of end on a more philosophical question. you've both spent a lot of time talking about leadership, about who's ready and who has the right judgment to lead if elected president.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "obama: well, you know, i wouldn't point to a single moment. but what i look at is the trajectory of my life because, you know, i was raised by a single mom. my father left when i was two, and i was raised by my mother and my grandparents.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and, you know, there were rocky periods during my youth, when i made mistakes and was off course. and what was most important, in my life, was learning to take responsibility for my own actions, learning to take responsibility for not only my own actions but how i can bring people together to actually have an impact on the world.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "stephen miller, donald trump's 33-year old senior policy adviser, is rumored to have written a good bit of the speech that the president delivered last night from the oval office. taken by itself, the speech and its horror-heavy rhetoric would suggest that the trump administration and miller take issue only with illegal immigration to the united states, the sort they believe authorities could stem with a physical barrier.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "this is not true. for stephen miller, advocating for the border wall and railing against illegal immigrants is but one part of the transformation he envisions for the united states and its immigration system. the other parts have to do with legal immigrants and crippling the programs that allow them to come into the country.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "miller, whose antipathy for immigration dates back to his high school years (when he wrote editorials critical of hispanic students while blasting bilingual high school announcements) and is himself descended from immigrants, has gone so far as to associate immigration, as he said in a june 2016 trump rally, with heartbreak, heartache and needless death. in august of 2018, miller's uncle denounced him as an architect of immigration policies that repudiate the very foundation of our family's life in this country. a former national security council official told politico in november that miller said at one meeting: we must save americans from these immigrant criminals! despite evidence showing that immigrants commit crimes at far lower rates than native-born americans, miller's persona and policy objectives make it clear that, to him, a fixed immigration system is one in which as few immigrants as possible cross america's borders, illegally or otherwise.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "in the first two years of the trump administration, miller, taking care not to leave a paper trail, has hacked away at america's legal immigration system using what one senior senate staffer described to vanity fair as the termite method: letting legal immigration programs erode from neglect and in some cases intentionally pulverizing them.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "with pernicious regularity, miller – considered trump's most influential immigration adviser – has inserted himself into the construction of one executive order which bans travelers from seven countries, another that exhorts american employers to hire american, forced the state department to reject research that discounted a connection between refugees and terrorism, and inserted himself into high-level nsc meetings leading at least one official to label him president of immigration.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the details of how so many programs that enable legal migration to the united states have been debilitated are damning. the h-1b program, long the best way for highly skilled workers to migrate to the united states, will now be harder to access. according to data obtained by the national foundation for american policy, united states citizenship and immigration service (uscis) has begun to issue more visa denials and requests for evidence than it did before, with nearly 69% of applicants getting an rfe in the last quarter of 2017. the onerous requirement delays visa processing further and, along with new forms demanded from employers, contributes to costly delays, potentially suggesting a deliberate effort to deter employers from hiring foreign workers altogether.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "where all immigrant workers are concerned, statistics released by immigration and customs enforcement (ice) last month showed a 750% increase in the number of worksite investigations, administrative proceedings and raids over the previous year. ironically, the government shutdown has also led to the unavailability of the e-verify system that allows employers to check the immigration status of workers before they hire them, thwarting the administration's own concern with worker legality.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "h-1b applicants who get requests for evidence are actually the luckier bunch among all visa applicants. a new policy directive issued by uscis last summer permits the agency to summarily deny visa applications for immigrant visas, for green cards and for adjustments of status without first issuing a request for evidence or a notice to appear as they used to. instead, the agency can, at their discretion, deny the visa and immediately label the applicant illegal and deportable, without giving them an option to depart voluntarily. the real consequence of the policy change is to make many more people ineligible for re-entry into the united states, because they have been deemed deportable. in cases of immigrant visas, applicants appearing for green card interviews have been rejected and then immediately detained because, under this new policy directive, they had been declared illegal.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the virulence of miller's views toward international students also came through last fall when he argued that chinese students should be banned from us universities because of the possibility that they could be engaging in espionage for the chinese government, and because (in miller's view) such a ban would punish elite universities who have been critical of mr. trump. thirty percent of international students are chinese and most pay full price at american universities, subsidizing costs for american students. around the midterm elections, it was reported that further restrictions on all international students and student exchange programs would also be forthcoming.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "miller has also been successful in arguing for a lower cap on the number of refugees coming to the united states, restricting the number to a record low of only 45,000 for 2018. in 2018, he turned his attention to asylum-seekers, championing a new rule that would disqualify those entering the country anywhere except a legal port of entry from claiming asylum. the law was struck down, but appeals are in progress. in late 2018, miller pushed for yet another proposal to force asylum applicants on the southern border to wait in mexico while their cases were processed.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "destroying or disabling work, student, immigrant, asylee and refugee programs is apparently not enough to sate the nativist sentiment that undergirds this miller-led transformation of the us immigration system. early in 2018, the trump administration set about dividing real native-born citizens from naturalized citizens, inaugurating the denaturalization task force, whose operation janus and operation second look are pursuing denaturalization proceedings and screening old naturalization applications for fraud. no public guidelines exist for whom they may investigate or for how long. furthermore, naturalized citizens, along with all other visa holders, are being monitored by the government through their social media accounts, and the information is being stored in files known as a-files that are kept and maintained by uscis. a naturalized citizen, it seems, in the trump administration's view, is not entitled to the fourth and fifth amendment protections the constitution provides against just such surveillance.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "for a current claim of i'm not the worst. with such a tight contest now taking shape, anderson and his appeal to the disgruntled of both parties could prove to be the decisive difference in a few key states and swing the election, most likely to reagan. the latest public opinion poll conducted for time by yankelovich, skelly and white discloses just how close the race is once again. carter and reagan are deadlocked at 39% each, while anderson's support is 15% -- precisely the level set by the league of women voters for him to qualify as a viable candidate and therefore earn a third spot in its crucial opening debate, set tentatively for sept. 21 in baltimore. carter, who insists on meeting reagan first without anderson, still threatened last week not to appear if the congressman was included. the league's directs were to meet this week to examine the range of recent poll results and decide whether or not to invite anderson. for so early in the campaign, a surprisingly low 7% of registered voters claim to be undecided about whom they now favor. (the study was based on a national sample of 1,644 registered voters interviewed between aug. 26 and 28. the sampling error is thus plus or minus 3% and 4.5% when comparing present trend readings with previous time studies.) still, the survey discloses just how shaky those current preferences are. fully 55% say they are not personally interested or excited about any of the candidates.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "only 11% report genuine enthusiasm for reagan; a mere 9% feel that way about carter and 6% about anderson. in fact, much of the support given their preferred candidates is based on voters' opposition to the others, the choices are essentially anti votes. thus 43% of the voters who prefer reagan say they do so because they are really voting against carter. similarly, 34% of carter's supporters say their choice is based on opposition to reagan, while a hefty 61% of anderson's followers admit that they are motivated by being against carter and reagan. though carter and reagan are even up in the race, the poll discloses areas of serious slippage for reagan in important areas. for one thing, 59% of those preferring carter claim they do so out of a positive feeling for him: they like his experience, and consider him safer in foreign affairs. only 48% of reagan's followers feel a similar sense of confidence in their choice's ability to get things done and to answer the need for a change. at the same time, reagan's rating on abilities regarded as important by voters has declined. in time's last survey in may, 49% of those sampled agreed that reagan was a leader you can trust, while 42% believe that now. reagan was then considered acceptable as a president by 64%; the current figure is 54%.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "but with vaccines now ramping up production, it's likely that travel begins its comeback in 2021. and if you've been eager to book a trip for later this year, you may want to start looking at your options now instead of waiting to see how things unfold. that's because there are a number of reasons that booking today could be a better choice than holding off until we're already deep into 2021.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "1. most flights can now be changed for free", "augmented": []}
{"original": "there aren't many silver linings to the pandemic cloud we've been living under for nearly a year now, but one of the few bits of good news is that the major us airlines — american, delta and united — have dropped their change fees on all domestic tickets and most international itineraries departing from north america. the one exception is basic economy tickets, and even some of those can still be changed without a fee depending on how and when they're booked.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "(also, let's give credit here to southwest, which has never had basic economy or change fees in the first place. if you're looking for a passenger-friendly airline, southwest continues to have some of the best policies of all the us carriers, including easy-to-change tickets and free checked bags.)", "augmented": []}
{"original": "now, that doesn't mean all airline tickets are refundable. there's a big difference between changeable and refundable. basically, the new policies mean you can change your ticket before departure and not have to pay an extra fee. but unless you specifically pay more for a refundable flight, you still can't get your money back on most tickets unless there's a cancellation by the airline itself.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and while there are no longer fees for changing your flight, you'll still have to pay any difference between the original fare you bought and the price of the new ticket if it's more. conversely, if the price of your new flight is lower, both american and delta will give you a credit for the difference. (united just pockets it, so keep that policy in mind when you're choosing an airline.)", "augmented": []}
{"original": "still, the new rules offer a lot more flexibility and make it more attractive to go ahead and book since there's no risk of losing your money if a vaccine doesn't make it to you before your trip. it also means it's worth locking down a great deal for the future if you find one now. speaking of which…", "augmented": []}
{"original": "unsurprisingly, struggling airlines and hotels are doing everything they can to get people to book. and while now isn't a good time to partake in unnecessary travel, you can take advantage of deals now for trips in the future.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "what kinds of deals can you get? just as an example, jetblue is currently running a flash sale with flights between january and june starting at $59 one way. even june may still be too soon for a leisure trip, but you can get from san francisco to honolulu for thanksgiving at a round-trip price of $326 as of this writing.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "to find cheap airfares, either use google flights or an online travel agency to search for trips, or sign up for notifications from a deal site, such as the flight deal or scott's cheap flights. or try a data-driven app like hopper to find the ideal time to book.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and if you've been sitting on a stack of frequent flyer miles, now's the time to use them. award availability is more open than it has been in years as airlines try to fill seats, and most us airlines no longer charge a fee to cancel an award ticket and get your miles back (again, united is the exception if you cancel less than 30 days from departure). so put aside some time to search the airline's website and see what sorts of miles deals appear.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "many travel credit cards include various forms of travel protection, such as trip cancellation and interruption coverage, travel accident insurance, emergency evacuation coverage and more. while these protections generally don't cover you if you voluntarily cancel your trip due to the pandemic, they often do cover you if you personally get sick from the coronavirus.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "every credit card offers different levels of coverage, and some don't have any travel protections at all, so it's important to check the fine print before you book your trip with a specific credit card to know exactly what you're being protected against. but if you want to be sure that your travel investment is safe, choose the right credit card to book your post-pandemic vacation.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "once demand takes off, great airfares and award availability are likely to taper off. that doesn't mean deals will completely disappear — industry leaders are projecting that business travel, which is the most lucrative part of the market for airlines, won't fully return for several years. but if you want to lock in a great deal, it's better to do it now while demand is still depressed.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "and even with all of the above in mind, if you just don't feel comfortable booking future travel at the moment, don't feel bad about that either. many people don't have a flexible enough family or work schedule to allow themselves to book speculative travel with so many unknowns still out there.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "if that's you, there's one other thing you can do while waiting for travel to resume: earn extra travel rewards on your credit card. many cards offer big sign-up bonuses to new card holders, and those bonuses alone can be enough to book a trip when the world is finally more stable. plus, you can use a credit card to earn rewards on the everyday things you buy while you're stuck at home.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "secretaries of state and state and local election administrators have been scrutinized for hardware, software, and vendor choices. this scrutiny is healthy, but often fails to address the big picture: yes, our election equipment and procedures are in need of an upgrade, but so are the policies that shape those choices in the first place.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the reality is that, even when officials want to do the right thing, red tape, contorted lines of authority and a lack of resources and inaction from congress and state legislatures often hold them back. our laws, procedures and financial commitment to elections need fixing – and that won't happen unless we pressure our lawmakers to do it.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "many people don't realize that election system is not monolithic. it is not run like the transportation security administration, a national bureaucracy with a unified leadership structure, budget and security protocols. quite the opposite – there are around 7,000 election jurisdictions nationwide. some states run their elections centrally, some delegate authority to counties or localities.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "everything from budgets, equipment, human resources and policy are set differently and at different levels of government. even the titular heads of elections vary by state, ranging from an elected secretary of state to administrators or commissions selected by governors or legislators. the system's diversity can make it more resistant to attack, but it also means one-size-fits-all solutions aren't workable.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "moreover, election officials at every level are confined within the restraints of law, budget and bureaucratic architecture as much as any other part of government. even if an election official decides her state needs new machines with a paper audit trail, she can't necessarily go out and buy them – she may need the legislature to appropriate millions of dollars and go through a procurement process.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "similarly, if she feels that her state needs new software, she may be locked into a contract her predecessor put in place years ago. the same applies to vendor security. many contracts were put in place without strict provisions about reporting security incidents, or allowing third party audits. cybersecurity simply wasn't top of mind even a few years ago.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "there are other complications. the integrity of our election system is ultimately a question of perception, not reality. the russians don't actually need to manipulate vote tallies to achieve their desired outcome of distrust and chaos. they need only create the perception of interference. even if we could completely guard against cyberintrusions – which is impossible – nation states could use social media to spread falsified documents and propaganda, or steal emails of election officials, to make people believe that an election was rigged.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "given this reality, we can't just secure databases and machines, we have to secure our civic ecosystem against the kind of foreign-born lies and distractions that we saw documented in friday's indictment of russians by special counsel robert mueller. this requires collaboration between our national security and intelligence services, law enforcement, social media platforms and our election officials.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "congress must act to align our intelligence services so they will be best equipped to detect and prevent information operations. social media platforms should not wait for rules or regulations to fully disclose the content that is spread on their platforms and force users to declare who they are. it would also be beneficial if they'd mandate that only humans can traffic information, not botnets.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "none of these challenges should be excuses for negligence, but they explain why change has been painfully slow. we must focus our attention and advocacy on the people who can really change all of this: our legislators, especially our state legislators and governors, who have the power to remove financial, bureaucratic, and policy hurdles that slow reform. congress has a unique ability to bring financial and intelligence resources to bear.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "there is good legislation ready for a vote. at the federal level, a bipartisan group of senators have introduced a very sound bill that would provide states with an infusion of money, badly needed intelligence on cyberthreats, and federal support to get election technology up to date and keep it current. yet another bipartisan bill has been introduced to better utilize national security tools to reduce foreign manipulation of elections.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "there will be so much more covid. the beginning of biden's presidency will likely be judged more for what he does to kickstart the use of covid vaccines than for any large policy proposals. the country is at war with the disease and, as he prepares to take office, thousands of americans are dying each day. he's promised to move heaven and earth to get vaccines out to americans, something more easily said than done as he navigates public skepticism of vaccines.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "finally, the poorly understood concept of herd immunity is likely to cause serious dispute among citizens, given that it focuses on the well-being of the community and not the individual. the idea of herd immunity was developed a century ago by veterinary researchers interested in livestock. they and others created a statistical model to estimate how many people (or animals) in a community must be immune (by vaccine or natural infection) to make it very unlikely for a non-immune person to become infected.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "viewed a different way, the premise of herd immunity (better referred to, in my opinion, as community immunity) is this: we want to vaccinate you to help you, sure, but mostly to protect that guy over there whom you have never met and with whom you might disagree about everything, who has decided not to get the vaccine. if we all pull together as a group, it makes life better for everyone!", "augmented": []}
{"original": "this message of communitarianism is at odds with much of the current political discourse. and the e pluribus unum angle is likely to sharpen as we learn just how many people will decline the vaccine. as of early december, just over a quarter of the population were hesitant to take the vaccine, according the kaiser family foundation. this group represents veteran anti-vaxxers, some additional trump stalwarts determined to stare the infection down, others who already had the infection and think enough is enough, and of course some who believe the baseless conspiracy theory that bill gates wants to place a microchip into their bodies.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "no matter how they arrived at their refusenik stance, if this group is large enough, it may prevent herd immunity, which experts estimate would require immunity from 70-85% of the population to achieve. that would precipitate discussions of mandatory vaccination, which, in turn, would inflame those already determined to avoid vaccination, threatening the entire national campaign and exacerbating a giant national argument about the role of government in daily health and safety.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "in short, times have changed, and laws must too. and many states are now taking action. in 2017, 42 states introduced laws to address the wage gap. their strategies ranged from banning salary histories to ensuring employees have vital access to salary information in order to identify if they are being paid unfairly. five states and puerto rico succeeded in passing their laws. this year, per aauw's internal monitoring, 38 states have pay equity legislation under consideration, with a new law passing in washington state just last month.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "second, we must change employer practices and break down barriers for women. growing numbers of employers recognize fair pay and good benefits are not just good for employees, they are good for business and bottom lines. businesses and organizations like salesforce, delta, luna and starbucks are taking actions – conducting pay audits and banning the use of prior salary histories, which perpetuates cycles of underpay.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "third, we must support women in advocating for themselves. at aauw, we are launching a new commitment to train 10 million women to negotiate their financial futures by 2022. through aauw's work smart program, we will give women the skills they need to effectively understand their market worth – based on experience and accomplishments – and the tools and confidence to negotiate for it.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "to be frank, all the electric standing desks we tested within the $500 to $650 starting price range had only minor discrepancies in function and build that we could determine from everyday use. assembly times and clarity of instructions varied perhaps the most, but in general, they were all sturdy, functional desks that move up and down smoothly and can be programmed to four memory presets. they did vary a bit in terms of the number of components for wire organization and the like, and digital panels differed a bit.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "but the apexdesk's contoured desktop design was one of the many reasons we deemed it the best overall standing desk, especially at its price point and size. the curved design allowed us to sit closer to the desk, lending itself to a more comfortable experience both in standing and sitting positions compared with the other standing desks we tried. its height is adjustable from 29 to 48 with a simple keypad that features the industry standard four memory presets along with up and down buttons.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "it also earned top marks for build quality. the desk can support up to 225 pounds including its desktop. given that a standard 24-inch monitor is generally no more than 10 pounds and a 16-inch macbook pro weighs in under 5 pounds, with a dual-monitor setup you'll be well under the limit and have capacity for plenty other equipment, books and the like. its sturdiness both from side to side and front to back at all heights was unmatched — we noticed nearly no wobble whatsoever — which was especially impressive given that it isn't designed with a crossbar (a bonus for anyone who enjoys using an under-desk bike). the desktop is designed with two large, covered grommets at the back corners to organize your cords and cables, and an under-desk cable management tray is sold separately.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "assembling the desk took some time — a little under an hour — because it arrived in four boxes (including the cable management tray) and has a lot of parts to build. instructions were clear, and a phillips screwdriver is needed; it's certainly helpful to have two people tag team assembly, though tackling it solo is doable.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "where the apexdesk elite series lost points was in its led display keypad, which displays desk height in full-inch increments rather than the 0.1-inch increments we saw on the other electric standing desks we tested at this price point. this means that whether the desk is standing at 40.1 or 40.7 inches high, the display will still read 40. if you're using the memory function to program a preferred height, that precise height you set will be programmed, though the number on the screen may not accurately reflect the height if it isn't a round number. all that to say: it isn't really a detriment to usage and we didn't consider it a deal-breaker by any means.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the desk is available in two sizes, 60x30 and 71x33, both of which provide ample space for two monitors, a laptop, a keyboard and then some.

{"original": "we tested the smallest available desktop size, 42x30, a perfect option for tighter office spaces or cramped city apartments with but a corner to spare. we found it more than comfortable for a monitor and laptop setup, though if you're working with multiple monitors and other equipment, you'll probably want to opt for a larger size. good news: uplift's got four more to choose from. the 48x30 will cost you an extra $50, the more standard 60x30 desktop size an extra $110, 72x30 will run you an extra $210, and the massive 80x30 desktop brings you to a total starting price of $849.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "then, you've got a staggering 22 desktop finishes to choose from (including a whiteboard option, which could be fun for the kiddos). we tested the walnut laminate, and couldn't be more pleased with its quality and appearance. solid wood and bamboo options are also available, as well as a contoured shape in four finishes; that will run the price tag up a bit more than the contoured apexdesk at the same size, which is why the latter ultimately took top honors. you also choose from four finishes for the desk's legs, select the color of the grommets, plus you can add on a power grommet (i.e., one with two outlets) for an additional $39 or add two for $69.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "as for the keypad, there are options here too (colors being one of them): the standard desk provides a no-frills keypad with just an up and down arrow. you can upgrade to the advanced comfort keypad — akin to what the apexdesk comes standard with — or splurge for the advanced paddle keypad, at an extra $59.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "to determine the extent of this desk's functionality, we chose the advanced paddle keypad and were wholly impressed by its breadth of features. in addition to displaying heights within 0.1-inch increments, from 22.6 to 48.7, the largest range of all desks we tested, the advanced paddle includes a standing reminder, which can be set to 30-, 60 and 120-minute intervals, plus a child lock feature, the ability to set minimum and maximum heights and, of course, memory presets. we found there is a bit of a learning curve with this keypad. we had some trouble lowering it from an elevated position, resetting it and setting up the memory presets. but after some tinkering and regular use, we did get the hang of it. tl;dr: you'll definitely need to consult the instruction manual for how to use this keypad, and possibly reset it a few times.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "like our top pick, the uplift arrived in four separate boxes, and assembly took nearly an hour due to all the parts required. note that the instructions provided include those for two different models of the desk, so you'll just want to make sure you follow the instructions for the particular model you've purchased. a phillips screwdriver is necessary, and again, because of how heavy-duty its parts are, it's definitely helpful to borrow a second set of hands and tackle assembly together. the desk comes standard with two grommets at the back corners as well as a cable management tray, though we found the tray to be a bit flimsy once installed.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "this desk comes standard with a digital keypad featuring four memory presets; while programming the memory presets was not as intuitive as it was with some of the other desks we tested, once you know how to do so, it's a breeze. adjustable from 28 to 46 high in round-number increments (though reflected on the led screen as 69 to 114, which we can only explain as being a roughly accurate conversion from inches to centimeters), this desk moves smoothly up and down without a hitch. it also comes standard with one small, uncovered grommet at the left back corner as well as an under-desk mesh tray at the front.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "we should note that the desktop is actually two planks of wood rather than one solid piece as the product photos may lead you to believe.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "this converter is available in eight widths, from 27 to 47 (you can find the larger models here) to accommodate a variety of workspace sizes. note, however, that it is only available in black. we tested the 35 model, which can comfortably fit two small monitors, or a monitor and a laptop, and measured the depth of the desktop to be 18.75 and the keyboard tray to be 12. like any standard riser, a simple lever attached to a hydraulic device is used to raise it up or down, with a maximum height, from top to bottom, of 18.5.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the only place the flexispot converter lost major points was in ease of adjustments; while it moved smoothly upward with a press of the lever, pushing it back down proved a bit more difficult, and some elbow grease was necessary. for that reason, it might not be the best choice if the intention is to share it between people of varying heights. that caveat aside, we were more than pleased with our experience using this product, which we found ergonomically designed and comfortable to use in every way.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the converter comes with a five-year warranty for the frame and desktop, and a three-year warranty for the gas spring system and other mechanisms, which seems more than fair for such an affordably priced item.", "augmented": []}

(for $159.99, you can snag the vivo in light wood or white finishes, or dark wood for $179.99.) the width of both the keyboard and desktop are a bit smaller than the flexispot converter we tested, at 10 and 15.75, respectively, though it does rise to a maximum height of 19.5, one inch higher than our winning converter does. it comes with two cable clips to stick to the underside of the product, and it has a three-year warranty. if you're seeking a finish that isn't solid black, could make use of another inch of height as a tradeoff for some desktop space, and you're willing to shell out a bit more cash, we think the vivo is a fine option.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "putting sexual abusers or harassers on pedestals, however, contributes to a more terrible world. turning such people into idols suggests that sexual misconduct isn't such a big deal and that it's possible to get away with it. that's an unconscionable message to send to people around the world.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "ultimately, as the organization in charge of the olympic games, the ioc should take responsibility for deciding who is in violation of sexual misconduct policies, rather than directing countries and sports leagues to solve the problem. if the ioc sets standards of conduct, then find reasonable evidence that they've been violated, they should be the ones to take action to remove that athlete's privilege of competing.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "over the next couple of weeks, the nuclear posture review will be released. taken together, these documents will shape the us nuclear defense policy over the course of the administration and likely usher in significant changes. one of those changes could come on the question of low-yield nuclear weapons, or those weapons most likely to employed on the battlefield. these weapons are smaller, less destructive and have shorter ranges than strategic nuclear weapons – though the death and destruction they cause could still mean substantial casualties.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "from the cold war to today, russia has maintained strategic and nonstrategic nuclear weapons. the only category of nuclear-capable forces that neither the u.s. nor russia have maintained were the intermediate-range nuclear forces (inf) – with ranges of 500 km to 5,500 km – that were eliminated as part of the 1987 inf treaty. however, the russians have recently developed a ground-launched cruise missile that the us believes violates the inf treaty.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "experts make compelling cases for developing low-yield nuclear weapons on both sides of the argument. yet, judging the costs and benefits of such a policy reversal comes down to a matter of perspective and largely depends on where one begins in approaching the question, whether from a warfighting, deterrence or nonproliferation perspective.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "from the perspective of warfighting, reintroduction of nonstrategic nuclear weapons provides another powerful tool to the arsenal. lower yields provide a nuclear capability that is more likely to be incorporated into a conflict. certain missions – striking deeply buried targets like command bunkers – call for nuclear weapons to increase the probability of destruction of these targets.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "naysayers make the case that the conventional arsenals of both nations are more than adequate to attack complex targets with a reasonable surety of destruction. during the cold war, lower-yield weapons provided a measure of deterrence by linking the battlefield and strategic nuclear capabilities and providing an offset to the perceived soviet advantage in conventional forces in europe. ominously, the russians have already begun to incorporate these systems into their warfighting plans, something the us halted following the cold war.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "nuclear weapons provide unique opportunities for deterrence, perhaps discouraging an adversary's action due to the fear of the consequences and the potential escalation that could raise the stakes of conflict.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the theory has been that two nuclear nations had to exercise greater caution before entering into a conflict, as controlling escalation or blundering into a strategic nuclear engagement was always a possibility.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "with the reintroduction of these weapons, a nation could use them to escalate the conflict, demonstrate a willingness to continue to escalate, and seek to cause the adversary to terminate the conflict on less favorable conditions (the russian doctrine of escalate to de-escalate). however, it is also possible the use of these weapons could be misinterpreted and result in escalation to a strategic nuclear exchange, with potentially devastating consequences", "augmented": []}
{"original": "if one approaches the policy change from a nonproliferation perspective, the outcomes are uniformly negative. incorporating tactical nuclear weapons into america's military planning would undermine 65 years of nonproliferation that goes back to president eisenhower's 1953 atoms for peace speech, which sought to share the benefits of atomic power while containing the risks, and the 1970 nuclear nonproliferation treaty for preventing the spread of nuclear weapons and associated technologies.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "ultimately, the goal has been to lessen the likelihood that nuclear weapons will continue to proliferate to other nations. despite these efforts, nine nations today have nuclear weapons – the us, russia, united kingdom, france, china, india, pakistan, israel and north korea. others such as japan and south korea have demonstrated mastery of the technical components of a nuclear weapons program, but have not developed such weapons. still others such as syria and iran have been dissuaded from developing these weapons.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "in contrast to president donald trump's populism, which has revolved around racial resentment, twitter tirades and rally rhetoric attacking people and institutions that didn't support him, carter hoped to bring the nation a stripped-down presidency, defined less by pomp and circumstance and more by tackling the difficult problems facing the nation.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "from the start, he didn't seek to put himself on a pedestal above those he was meant to lead. and this meant something at the time. for a people desperate for a new direction, it offered hope that politics could be different. he made the presidency so engaging that even bands like crosby, stills and nash would show up at the white house just to have a chance to meet him, as the film recounts.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "but it's worth looking back on those original years -- when rock and rollers, as well as country music mavericks -- saw something fresh and inspiring in carter's political populism. he was one of the rare leaders who tried to make himself a little less important to benefit the overall health of our democracy. in recent years, the nation has been sold a brand of populism wielded by a deeply divisive president who abused his executive powers and did little to address the needs of average americans.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "cuomo: so, what do you do when the senate, if there's a trial, and it seems like there will be, and it's obviously controlled by the republicans, and they have rudy giuliani, and others, come in, and just dump tons of information about how ukraine was the source of interference, and the bidens and burisma were thick with corruption, that's what that trial could be about, if they want to. they control the rules. it's just a simple majority vote.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "blumenthal: their effort obviously is going to be to distract and distort. that's the meaning of giuliani's trip abroad insofar as it tries to aid the president's defense. but it's more than distracting.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "cuomo: he says he'll testify, you know, this new friend of his over there says he wants to come in and talk about it.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "cuomo: for being with us, and an important night as well.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "cuomo: all right, so there is someone who knows a lot more about the ukraine showdown than even maybe some congressional investigators. has vladimir putin been closely listening in on president trump's calls?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "it's a big concern. why? andrew mccabe explains next.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "cuomo: all right, if you're following rudy's rovings, he tells cnn he is no longer in ukraine, but he was there, and we know what he was doing, drawing a lot of attention, and really casting a pretty big shadow over this impeachment situation.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and now let's talk about what it could mean. let's bring in andrew mccabe.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "so, there are two big things to look at in terms of significance. help me understand why i should care about this first one, which i only kind of care about. so, don't be nice about it.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the idea that they were communicating over cell phones, and not secure lines, russia could be listening, why does that matter a lot?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "andrew mccabe, cnn contributor: ok. so, here's why it matters. the job of every foreign intelligence service is to collect what - what professionals refer to as information about the policies, plans, and intents, of your adversary.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "so, their job is to go out and collect information about what our leadership is thinking, what they're planning to do, and how they're going to execute those actions. there is no bigger target in the world for policies, plans, and intense information than the president of the united states. he is the crown jewel of all targets.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "so, let's put aside for a moment the question of whether or not the president is actually using a cell phone from the oval office, and think about the president speaking to someone else, in a country like ukraine, who's using a cell phone.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "right now, we know that rudy giuliani is - is supposedly doing that. we have reason to believe from the phone records that he has talked to the president from there before. and we know that gordon sondland did that as well.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "ukraine is probably the most thoroughly-penetrated country on earth by the russian intelligence service. they operate almost com - with complete freedom there. rudy giuliani is known as a close adviser, and confidant, and counselor of the president.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "cuomo: how easily can they tap your phone?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "mccabe: easily, chris, very easily. in that part of the world, intelligence services have almost unfettered access to cellular service providers, to internet service providers, things of that - that nature.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "also, the technology to intercept individual cell phones, that are in use is widely available now, things that were like totally, you know, cutting-edge a few years ago are widely used across intelligence services around the globe.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "so, the idea that rudy is being covered by a foreign intelligence service, i'd bet the farm on it. and if they are listening to his phone, they now know the private conversations of the president of the united states, and his attorney.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "cuomo: and my point of emphasis is that all they have to do is watch the news, or read twitter, and they'll know more than they need to know about what the plans and the intent is right now because rudy giuliani said something that i can't believe the president's team wants him to say.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "he said in a tweet, hey ukraine, you're not going to get u.s. help in your anti-corruption reform efforts if you don't help me with what i'm doing with the bidens.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "how is that helpful to the president's impeachment case?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "mccabe: boy, it's not helpful at all. i mean it really resonates with all of the concerns that are being voiced by the democratic side, right, so.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and it also undercuts, in a significant way, the president's, one of his primary defenses, which is that he was - he was pressuring ukraine, not for his own benefit, but rather to address legitimate corruption issues.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "having his own personal attorney off the grid doing god-knows-what in ukraine, talking to people like andriy derkach who has a - an extensive historical connection with russian-backed politicians and intelligence officials in ukraine, i mean it's just a perfect storm of - of bad circumstances.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "cuomo: well you're certainly not going to have a hard time finding russians in ukraine, who want to put stink on ukraine for what happened in 2016. we know that out of putin's own mouth.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "now, here's the part i don't get andrew. this is why we need your mind on this.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "i don't understand how any of this helps the case. forget about the subtle threat to ukraine, to step up, otherwise they're not going to get the u.s. help, which is exactly what the president's accused of doing.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "but even if rudy's right about everything, obama was dirty, you can't - you know - you know, the former ambassador was dirty, the bidens with burisma was done a little dirty, even if he's right about all of it, how does it change the case against the president, because it's still how you went about getting that type of investigation done.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "you should have done it yourself, or in the senate, with the doj. you're not supposed to go to ukraine, and hold up aid to get it, even if it's true. isn't that right?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "mccabe: that is right. that's absolutely right. so - so, why he's doing this? i mean only rudy knows. but two things i would suggest.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "one, there is clear political value to the president to just create a distraction, to go, to put up as many false narratives and conspiracy theories to get people thinking about those potential bad things rather than the bad things that the president is alleged to have done.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and the second thing is i do think that there's an element here of rudy kind of saving himself in a way.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "he seems to be going like further and further down this rabbit hole, in an effort maybe to find the one, you know, verifiable piece of proof that will show the world that ah-ha, he was right all along.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "cuomo: and he may be right. he can be right. and it doesn't change the analysis. that's why i always say, you know, people think it's personal, even though, you know, rudy basically tried to decapitate me on television.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "but that i say he's not the problem here. rudy is the agent. that's all he is. if he's right about all of it, burisma, the bidens, ukraine, fine. present the evidence. let's see what we do about it. it doesn't change the analysis. it's not about rudy.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "cuomo: it's about how the president went about getting what he wanted, and why. andrew, i'm out of time. thank you so much. have a great weekend. and i appreciate it. you're always a plus for the audience.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "cuomo: all right, something very important has come up. the president's bringing it to our attention, and i pass it along to you right now.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "trump: we have a situation where we're looking very strongly at sinks and showers and other elements of bathrooms where you turn the faucet on.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "people are flushing toilets 10 times, 15 times.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "cuomo: and the democrats don't have somebody that for sure can beat this guy?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "i want to bring in the wizard of odds. that's what they're up against, wiz. and democrats are scrambling to find an answer, next.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "cuomo: first, the democrats seemed to believe that anyone they had could beat this president. now, it seems they're scrambling to find anyone who can beat this president. but today, we got a good look at what they are up against.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "this was the president trying to attack the epa for over-regulating. but he did it like this.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "trump: we have a situation where we're looking very strongly at sinks and showers and other elements of bathrooms where you turn the faucet on in areas where there's tremendous amounts of water, where the water rushes out to sea because you could never handle it, and you don't get any water.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "you turn on the faucet. you don't get any water. they take a shower and water comes dripping out. it's dripping out, very quietly dripping out.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "people are flushing toilets 10 times, 15 times, as opposed to once. they end up using more water. so, epa is looking at that very strongly, at my suggestion.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "cuomo: at his suggestion! and you wonder why bloomberg got in! and yet, this president is seen as very formidable to the wizard of odds himself, harry enten, and here is why.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "harry enten, cnn politics senior writer and analyst: yes.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "cuomo: --and the hypocrisy of the fact that his administration has been hurting water standards, hurting the money for keeping things protected, he's basically attacking over-regulation, big government.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "cuomo: he's still tough to beat not because of how he is, but because of what's gone on, despite him, mostly in the economy. what do we know?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "enten: yes. so, i think this is rather important. first, let me just say, what a shabbos (ph) conversation, toilets and so on, so forth.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "enten: but ok - ha, ha, ha, hilarious!", "augmented": []}
{"original": "enten: look, this is basically the yearly job growth weighted each - weighted over each terms last two years. and what we see here is that the winners tend to have very good job growth, right? all of them had at least 1.1 percent or above.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the blow-outs, nixon, 3.6 percent, 4.1 percent for reagan.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the losers on the other hand tended to have pretty poor job growth. carter and bush, of course, basically got blown out, and they were below 1 percent.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "so, what we see here is very clearly what has often been described as it's the economy, stupid! and we see that to be the case. cuomo: we just got more good job numbers and some income pressure going up that helps the president as well.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "enten: yes, so look, let's put this into some context where the president is versus where the winners versus the losers were.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "so, the average yearly job growth, again, in those final two years, the presidents who won re-election, 2.5 percent growth, the presidents who lost, they averaged 1 percent growth.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "where is trump? trump over the last year is right in the middle there at 1.5 percent. and i think this is rather important.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "cuomo: but he sells it as being the best ever.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "enten: well he sells a lot of things at being the best ever, you know. so, that's not too much of a surprise. sometimes he sells toilet pressures being the best ever.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "but i think this is rather important is that growth is what's important. it's not the absolute levels. it's basically where you've grown, and basically with the economy at this point, we're kind of running into a wall, since we're near max employment.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "cuomo: so, you think that the democrats can use the economy against this president?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "enten: i - i - i think that the economy is not the silver bullet that he necessarily thinks it is, although it's certainly rather helpful because, you know, if you take a look here, what we see is trump standing on the economy, his approval rating 55 percent in our latest poll, but that is below his overall approval rating of 42 percent.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "so clearly, voters are judging him stronger on the economy than overall, which is perhaps why he should be talking more about the economy than about other things.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "cuomo: but - and this also goes to the point i made on the last panel, which is he sells it as the best ever. it's obviously working.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "cuomo: because the number of growth, that growth percentage you're showing, middle-of-the-road, would not justify 55 percent.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "enten: yes. it's certainly working to the extent that if, you know, basically you were to say, ok, if you approve of trump's job, why is it? here are the top five reasons. this is rather interesting.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "so, among those who say they approve of trump's job, 26 percent say the economy, look at this, jobs and unemployment, 8 percent, getting things done, doing a good job, generally speaking, again, related to the economy, 10 and 9 percent.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "so, people who approve of the job that the president is doing, they do so because of the economy.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "cuomo: so, if you are looking to figure out what the best avenue is for change, what is it? is it to go with the man directly?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "enten: yes, i - i - i think that that's exactly right.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "if you were to say why should we change this president, look at these, these are trump's qualities, essentially presidential qualities, has stamina and sharpness to be a president, could bring the type of change the country needs, so on, so forth, you can read that, you see it up on the screen.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "look at this. this is so important because on this, yes, what do we see? majorities all say in fact no, he does not have these qualities.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "majorities are saying the president doesn't have these presidential qualities. and that is why, in spite of what they approve of as a strong economy, he is behind, at least in a number of the horserace polls that we've seen so far.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "so, go after the man, say he's un-presidential. and that's why i think you saw a lot of good response to biden's ad this week.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "cuomo: do you think you could have - you could name another person who could ever win a presidential election talking about people needing to flush 10 to 15 times?", "augmented": []}

{"original": "here is the transcript of that interview.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "richard quest: mr. president, thank you, sir. much appreciated. there's a lot to talk about, but don't worry, we won't talk about it all. we'll be judicious in our time with you. but here, if you like, are the controversial bits, the sexy bits: the last minutes of the fomc used the phrase fairly soon. we all know what fairly soon means. if you and i go to have a cup of coffee, we'll have it fairly soon. we could meet for dinner fairly soon. what does fairly soon mean in the context of the minutes?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "president dudley: i think it means what it says. it doesn't say it's a week, a month, a couple months. fairly soon means in the relatively near future. i think the key thing in terms of thinking about monetary policy is -- what are we basically communicating to people in the markets? we've basically been saying that if the economy continues on the trajectory that it's on, slightly above-trend growth, gradually rising inflation, we're going to continue to remove monetary policy accommodation. so let's look at what we've actually gotten. it seems to me that most of the data we've seen over the last couple months is very much consistent with the economy continuing to grow at an above-trend pace, job gains remain pretty sturdy, inflation has actually drifted up a little bit as energy prices have increased. so we're very much on the trajectory that we said -- that we thought we'd be on and we said if we were on that trajectory we're going to gradually remove accommodation. what else have we seen? we've also seen things that should make us even more confident that this is going to continue in the future. after the election we've seen very large increases in household and business confidence, we've seen very buoyant financial markets -- the stock market is up, credit spreads are narrow. and we have the expectation that fiscal policy will probably move in a more stimulative direction.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "so, put it all together, i think the case for monetary policy tightening has become a lot more compelling.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "quest: and that's obviously fairly soon, which implies sooner rather than later?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "quest: there's also one new wrinkle into this, of course, which is the role of fiscal policy. a large increase in government spending is coming. we know it's coming. the president is going to talk about it tonight. how does the fed factor in what you know is coming but is not here yet?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "dudley: well, it's hard to actually put it into your forecast yet because we don't know what it is, how big it is or when it's actually going to hit the economy. but we do know that fiscal policy is going to move in a more stimulative direction. so what that says to me is that the risks to the outlook are now starting to tilt to the upside. so while i haven't really built it into my gdp forecast, when i think about the balance of risks -- up or down in terms of economic activity -- i think the fiscal side tends to push things -- the risks to the upside.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "quest: but you can't wait for it to happen, can you? i mean the whole question of monetary lag. i know you've got to think about many of these policies not coming into force until 2018, but you have to plan now.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "dudley: well, look, i think monetary policy is pursued on the basis on the economic outlook. fiscal policy outlook obviously affects that -- the trajectory of gdp, unemployment and inflation. so that's a factor weighing on us but the fact that we have so little specifics yet about what's going to happen -- it's got to wind its way through congress -- means i don't put a lot of weight on it in terms of my modal forecast. i just think it makes the risks to the outlook a little bit tilted to the upside at this point.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "quest: and from what you've heard -- and i'll accept that the detail is few and far between -- from what you've heard, are the sort of spending, fiscal plans that you're hearing, are they the right sort in terms of productivity gains that the fed can live with?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "dudley: well, i think we're going to have to see. to the extent that you reduce the burden of regulation, that should lift productivity growth. to the extent that you pursue greater infrastructure spending, that should lift productivity growth. so those are the aspects of changes on the fiscal side that would actually be supportive to stronger economic activity.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "quest: but, for instance, i'm going to throw the numbers that we've seen -- the $50 billion on defense spending that the president said that yesterday, $50-odd billion on defense. is that the sort of thing that you find is -- leads to greater productivity as opposed to just shear consumption?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "dudley: i wouldn't think that defense spending would have a huge benefit to the productivity growth, but obviously we have to spend money on the military to keep the country safe. also, if you're increasing spending on military but cutting spending on discretionary or domestic programs, the net effect may not be very powerful in terms of supporting the economy.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "quest: into this difficult area we have the financial markets. they're on a tear. i mean today could be the 13th record high, we could be in record territory, you know the numbers better than myself. you can't wait for the fiscal plans completely until next year, but you have to take into account what's happening in the markets at the moment, don't you?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "dudley: well, financial conditions are very important in terms of how they influence economic activity. so if the stock market is up, credit spreads are narrow, financial conditions are more buoyant, that's going to tend to make the economy stronger. the important thing for us, though, is not to overreact to every little movement in the stock market. it's got to be something that lasts for a period of time for it to actually affect household and business behavior. so if the stock market goes up, and then goes right back down, it's not going to have much consequence for the economic outlook. but if it goes up and stays up, then that's going to support, presumably, consumption through higher household wealth.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "quest: what do you believe you're seeing at the moment?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "dudley: well, there's no question that animal spirits have been unleashed a bit post the election. stock market is up a lot. household and business confidence have increased significantly. there's a survey of small businesses that showed a very large increase in december and sustained that increase in january. so, there's no question that sentiment has improved quite markedly post the election.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "quest: that -- animal spirits or whatever you want to call it -- that market influence. it transmits itself around to the entire economy, doesn't it?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "dudley: well, we would expect to have some consequence for economic activity. but we'll have to see if that actually -- one if the confidence is sustained, and whether it actually materializes in terms of increases in spending. i would say so far we haven't seen much effect of the improvement in confidence actually leading into greater spending. i think the economy is still on about a 2% gdp track, which about what it's been over the last year or so.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "quest: when you hear the president looking for 3 to 4% -- and the treasury secretary looking for 3% to 4% economic growth -- admittedly not next week, next month, maybe not even next year. but as a medium-term, longer-term goal, do you find that acceptable?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "dudley: i think it would be great if we have 3% to 4% gdp growth because that would mean productivity growth is very strong and that would lead to rapidly rising living standards, so that would be good for everybody. the key is, what actually happens to productivity growth.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "quest: do you find 3% to 4% realistic?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "dudley: i would say it's possible. you know, we had productivity growth back in the late 1990s where productivity growth was averaging over 2.5% a year. if we could get back to that kind of level of productivity growth, then i think 3% plus growth would actually be achievable. but that's a pretty high standard to reach for.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "quest: you are no longer the only game in town, to use the phrase. for the last five years, six years, seven years, you -- not you personally but you and your colleagues -- central bankers around the world have been saying 'hey, c'mon, we can't do this on our own. you're requiring us to do all the heavy lifting.' well, guess what, you've now got a bit of help from washington, haven't you?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "dudley: well, i think it is correct that monetary policy has had to do most of the heavy lifting over the last few years. and i think that's unfortunate because monetary policy is a blunt tool. monetary policy can't allocate resources across the economy. monetary policy can't do much to affect productivity growth. so i think it's good that the burden is going to be more broadly shared.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "quest: how close do you believe -- and in this i'm not just asking about the fed but i'm thinking about the bank of japan, i'm thinking about the ecb, the boe -- how close do you believe central banks have come to being out of ammunition?", "augmented": []}

{"original": "dudley: well the president is obviously going to be able to make some appointment to the board of governors. of course, remember, the federal open market committee also consists of the federal reserve bank presidents and more importantly than that, the fed's mandate is set by congress. congress wants the fed to achieve maximum sustainable employment and price stability. so i would expect that whoever gets named to the federal reserve is going to try to carry out that task set for the fed by congress.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "photo: courtesy charles black charles black", "augmented": []}

{"original": "second, the active phase of the primary campaign in 2016 may run later than in years past. this may not leave adequate time for the vetting and selection process. and if it is unclear who a party's nominee will be going into the convention, there will be absolutely no time to follow the vetting schedule of previous campaigns.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "a presidential candidate's selection of a running mate is one of the first looks at how he or she will govern. the choice of a vice presidential running mate illuminates those characteristics that are important in a partner to the presidential candidate, and the structure and process used to make the selection is a glimpse into the candidate's management style.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "presidential nominees are well-served by getting to know the potential vice presidential candidates personally. one key approach is for the campaigns to arrange for possible running mates to join the nominee on the campaign trail. the ticket is a short-term political alliance but also a longer-term personal and governing partnership, and of crucial importance is the element of personal compatibility and mutual confidence.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "other recommendations concern the running of a well-designed and efficient selection process. among them are that the campaigns should take steps to assure that the sensitive task of vetting candidates should be tightly structured to assure confidentiality. this requires limiting the circle of those provided with the information and requiring all involved to sign nondisclosure agreements.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "these measures encourage qualified candidates to put themselves forward for consideration and to engage candidly with the vetting process. it also guards against the risk that the wider circulation of vetting material could adversely affect trust and working relationships within the nominees' senior ranks and reduces the chance that, after the campaign, sensitive data could be put to inappropriate use.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "it is an extraordinary feature of our political system that the selection of a vice president, a decision of great magnitude, is left almost entirely in the hands and to the personal judgment of the presidential candidates. a thorough and successful vetting requires the campaigns to invest significant time, effort and resources. the decision made will have a lasting impact not just on the campaign, but on the country as well.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "here's a simplified example that shows why this is so important. let's say that you earn $100,000 per year and that your employer will match 50% of your contributions, up to 5% of your salary. so, you choose to contribute $5,000 into your 401(k) each year and your employer matches 50% of your contributions for a total of $7,500 flowing into your account annually. over a 30-year period, your account could be expected to grow to approximately $708,000, assuming 7% annualized investment returns.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "on the other hand, let's say that you choose to contribute just 3% of your salary, which is a common automatic contribution level set by many employers. including the employer match, this means that just $4,500 will go into your account per year. each year, you're missing out on $1,000 in employer contributions that you could have received for contributing the 5% matching limit. what's more, a move like this can really add up over time -- assuming the same 7% annualized returns, your account would only grow to about $425,000. that $283,000 difference could have a big impact on your financial security after retirement.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "for this reason, the maximum contribution level your employer is willing to match should be the bare minimum you choose to put into your 401(k). not doing so is literally turning down free money. would you turn down a raise? of course not. not taking advantage of your employer match is just as silly.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "starting tomorrow, the senate judiciary committee will hold a confirmation hearing for william barr, president donald trump's nominee for attorney general. while any attorney general inherently holds immense power, the ongoing investigation by special counsel robert mueller – and the threat it poses to trump's presidency – potentially raises the ordinarily high stakes to bet-the-republic levels.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "recent revelations that the fbi opened a counterintelligence investigation based on suspicions that trump may have intended to obstruct justice when he fired then-fbi director james comey, and that trump took steps to conceal details of his meetings with russian president vladimir putin, only raise the stakes when barr faces questioning tomorrow. given barr's public condemnation of mueller's work – particularly mueller's ongoing investigation of potential obstruction of justice by trump – the senate must press hard to determine whether barr is sufficiently impartial, independent and principled to take the mantle as attorney general.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "photo: courtesy lowenstein sandler elie honig", "augmented": []}
{"original": "whenever the department of justice closes in on the white house or other powerful players, the attorney general must choose: will doj serve political ends, or will it pursue justice as the facts and the law dictate? perhaps most famously, steel-spinned doj prosecutors refused to buckle to intense political pressure to curtail investigations that ultimately resulted in the resignations of vice president spiro agnew in 1973 and president richard nixon in 1974. the next attorney general's commitment to apolitical rule of law could have similar consequences.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "while barr's eventual confirmation seems likely given the republican majority in the senate and on the judiciary committee, the senate nonetheless must question barr rigorously. the american public needs to learn what barr is really about, and barr must know that congress will demand accountability should he get the job.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the senate should, of course, examine barr on vital doj policy issues, including the trump administration's efforts to enforce zero tolerance immigration policy, to roll back civil rights protections for transgender people, to scale back oversight of police departments and to investigate purported voter fraud despite a paucity of evidence.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "beyond these policy questions, the senate must scrutinize the legitimate and troubling questions that have arisen about barr's impartiality on the mueller investigation. while it is some comfort that sen. lindsey graham said on wednesday that barr has vowed not to stop mueller from completing the investigation, the senate still must question barr directly and put him squarely on record. and even if barr permits mueller to complete the investigation unfettered, there are plenty of things barr still can do to affect the ultimate outcome of mueller's work.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "given the enormous potential fallout of mueller's work, here are five key questions the senate should ask barr at next week's hearing.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "1. why did barr send a memo to doj attacking mueller's obstruction of justice investigation?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "in june 2018, barr – apparently unsolicited – sent a detailed 19-page memo to doj arguing that mueller's obstruction theory is fatally misconceived. barr previously offered the hill a more plainspoken assessment, calling the obstruction investigation asinine.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the senate must ask barr why he wrote the doj memo. barr likely will answer that he merely was concerned as a private citizen and former attorney general by what he read about mueller's obstruction inquiry, and felt compelled to express his personal view.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "don't buy it. barr's decision to send the memo to doj is unusual and, at best, conspicuous. there is much about the letter itself, and the circumstances of barr sending it, that casts doubt on a benign explanation.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "questions? got questions about the week's legal news? elie honig will be responding on fridays. send your questions to: cnn.opinion@turner.com", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the senate should challenge barr with pointed follow-up questions. for example: did anyone at doj or elsewhere in the trump administration ask you to write the memo? did you show the memo to anybody or discuss it with anybody before you sent it to doj? in the 25 years since you last served as attorney general, have you ever sent another memo to doj in your personal capacity? when you sent this memo in june 2018, had you seen news reports that trump had repeatedly attacked and ridiculed his then-attorney general jeff sessions and likely would fire sessions shortly after the november midterm elections, leaving the attorney general job open? did you know that two of trump's recent selections for high-level positions had expressed public skepticism about the president's amenability to criminal process generally (justice brett kavanaugh) and mueller's investigation specifically (acting attorney general matthew whitaker)?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "these questions should cast doubt on any facile response from barr that he acted purely from a sense of personal duty. it is far more likely that barr sent the memo to audition before trump for the attorney general job.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "2. does barr believe trump obstructed justice if he pressured james comey to drop the fbi investigation of michael flynn?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "mueller's obstruction investigation reportedly focuses, among other things, on trump's 2017 effort to pressure then-fbi director james comey to drop an investigation of trump's former national security adviser michael flynn. (flynn since has pleaded guilty to lying to the fbi about his conversations with the russian ambassador regarding 2016 election-related sanctions).", "augmented": []}
{"original": "barr argues in his memo to doj that in commenting to comey about flynn's situation – to the extent it is taken as the president having placed his thumb on the scale in favor of lenity – the president was plainly within his plenary discretion over the prosecution function. barr also claims, there is no legal prohibition – as opposed to a political constraint – against the president's acting on a matter in which he has a personal stake.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "barr's argument is deeply problematic because it permits the president to shut down a criminal investigation, including one that might implicate him or his associates, without legal consequence.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the senate must probe whether barr stands by his position: does the president have unlimited power to shut down a criminal investigation for any purpose whatsoever? is it ok for a president to place his thumb on the scale in favor of lenity to protect himself or his associates against potential criminal charges? by your reasoning, is the president free to fire mueller if mueller gets too close to exposing crimes committed by the president or others?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "barr already has answered these questions in his memo. the senate must not permit barr to wriggle away from his own words once the bright lights of the confirmation hearing are turned on.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "3. does barr believe trump stands above doj's normal powers to subpoena and indict?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "in his memo to doj, barr writes that mueller should not be permitted to demand that the president submit to interrogation about alleged obstruction. thus, in barr's stated view, mueller can neither demand nor compel (through a subpoena, which is how prosecutors obtain testimony) trump to provide information to criminal investigators. this echoes the views previously stated publicly by recent trump appointees kavanaugh (who proposed that congress should pass a law exempting a sitting president from questioning by criminal prosecutors) and whitaker (who, the new york times reports, will not allow the president to be subpoenaed).", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the senate should press barr on this issue: do you categorically believe the president can never be subpoenaed, or is there some limitation? if so, when can the president be subpoenaed? isn't the fifth amendment sufficient to protect a president who might incriminate himself by responding to a subpoena?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "barr's memo to doj does not address the next logical (and even more consequential) question: can doj indict a sitting president? internal doj policy guidance from 2000 counsels against indicting a sitting president, but legal scholars differ and there is no statute or prior court decision on the point.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the senate should demand answers from barr on this issue, which could be the most consequential of his tenure: if confirmed, will you follow doj guidance that a sitting president cannot be indicted, or will you re-examine the issue? do you believe the issue is properly decided by the courts; if so, and if doj finds sufficient evidence, should it indict and then permit the courts to decide?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "4. if career ethics professionals in doj recommend barr's recusal from the mueller investigation, will he follow their advice?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "like whitaker, barr likely must undergo internal doj ethics review to determine whether his prior public statements necessitate recusal from the mueller investigation. whitaker rejected an ethics official's advice that he recuse, despite the official's conclusion that a reasonable person with knowledge of the relevant facts likely would question the impartiality of the acting attorney general. by declining to recuse, whitaker fueled public skepticism that trump chose him primarily to exercise control over mueller.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the senate should ask barr: if a reasonable person would question a prosecutor's impartiality on a given case, should the prosecutor recuse from that case? does public perception of a prosecutor's impartiality matter? do your prior statements, including that mueller is pursuing an asinine theory, give rise to reasonable concerns about your impartiality? will you rely on the fact that whitaker did not recuse to justify your own non-recusal, or will you conduct a completely independent inquiry?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "5. does barr stand by his prior public criticisms of mueller and his investigation?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "although barr worked with and supervised mueller at doj in the 1990s, barr has been unsparing in more recent public criticism of his former colleague. beyond calling mueller overly zealous and overly aggressive in his memo to doj, barr told the hill in 2017 that mueller's investigation risked taking on the look of an entirely political operation to overthrow the president.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "the senate should ascertain exactly where barr stands with respect to mueller: do you stand by your prior statements that mueller is overly aggressive and politically motivated? on what do you base your assertion? why would a longtime republican (mueller) who was appointed by another republican (deputy attorney general rod rosenstein) who was nominated by yet another republican (trump) have a political motivation to overthrow trump? given that mueller has obtained guilty pleas from flynn, paul manafort, michael cohen, rick gates, george papadopoulos and others, do you stand by your characterization of mueller as an overly zealous prosecutor? if you do not stand by your own prior words, what has changed between then and now?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the senate has an enormous task before it next week. it must determine whether barr has the impartiality, independence and political courage to serve as attorney general. the senate cannot accept coached-up, mealy mouthed dodges. nor should the senate permit barr to get away with the classic double-edged confirmation hearing dodge: i cannot answer that question because it is a hypothetical paired with i cannot answer that question because it relates to a pending case.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "while the us may not have been able to stop either development even in the best of times, that a superpower has been seemingly outmaneuvered will delight many of washington's critics in beijing and elsewhere, who have always felt the us throws its weight around too much internationally.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "after veering between criticism and embrace of beijing for much of his term, trump took a hard line against china in his last year in office, with his secretary of state, mike pompeo, pushing sanctions and other action against beijing in washington, while attempting to rally an anti-china coalition around the world", "augmented": []}
{"original": "that attempt has been less than successful, however, with only a handful of countries, notably australia, eager to jump on board -- a decision that canberra may now be ruing as it deals with major blowback from beijing", "augmented": []}
{"original": "china's leaders claim that unlike washington, they do not interfere in the internal matters of other states, and only seek win-win cooperation. this is not true, and beijing wields its influence much like any superpower, from the belt and road mega infrastructure initiative, to attempting to shape politics in australia taiwan , and countries across asia and the rest of the world. yet the posture of non-interference is nevertheless persuasive to many observers.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "this influence has grown as china has emerged as the world's second superpower, and been accelerated by political chaos and division in washington, as well as the failure of the us to respond effectively to the coronavirus", "augmented": []}
{"original": "that china is preparing to roll out its own homegrown vaccine, with promises to export hundreds of millions of doses overseas -- including throughout the developing world -- only serves to underscore this apparent shift.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "both washington and beijing tend to hold up the us system as the be all and end all of democracy, despite its many flaws and the fact that the majority of democratic countries do not resemble the us in the way they run their governments. as the us model has begun to show cracks under trump, this has benefited china's propagandists, who can use it to argue for the validity of their own authoritarian system of governance.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the violence seen in washington on wednesday will likely feed neatly into this narrative. on wednesday evening, the global times, an ultra-nationalist state-run tabloid, ran the headline chinese netizens jeer riot in us capitol as 'karma,' say bubbles of 'democracy and freedom' have burst.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "we believe that the american people want security and peace, especially in the current critical situation of the pandemic, and we hope that the american people will enjoy peace, stability and security as soon as possible.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "but such comparisons are facile, given that protesters in hong kong were fighting for greater democracy -- and pelosi praised peaceful demonstrations, not the more violent ones that followed -- while those in washington wednesday were seeking to overturn the results of an election.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the hong kong protests also provided the pretense for beijing's ongoing crackdown in the city, that washington, for all its outrage, posturing and even sanctions, has proved powerless to stop.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "for a trust in which you want to put the majority of your assets -- known as a revocable living trust -- you also have to have a pour-over will to cover any of your holdings that might be outside of your trust if you die unexpectedly. a pour-over will essentially directs that any assets outside of the trust at the time of your death be put into it so they can go to the heirs you choose.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "with a credit-shelter trust (also called a bypass or family trust), you write a will bequeathing an amount to the trust up to the estate-tax exemption. then you pass the rest of your estate to your spouse tax-free. you also specify how you want the trust to be used -- for example, you may stipulate that income from the trust after you die goes to your spouse and that when he or she dies, the principal will be distributed tax-free among your children.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "that can be useful in cases where you leave heirs an illiquid asset such as a business. the business might take a while to sell, and in the meantime your heirs will have to pay operating expenses. if they don't have cash on hand, they might have to have a fire sale just to meet the bills. but proceeds from an ilit can help tide them over.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "i just listened to mr. jordan, as you did as well, and i heard his criticisms in the process, nothing really happened, a lot of people are out to get the president. i didn't hear an answer to the question, as to whether it's proper for the president of the united states to demand a foreign government to investigate a u.s. citizen and political opponent.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "welch: and to give folks a reminder of the extent of corruption, by the way, a legacy of putin's russia, is your understanding that when their prior president, mr. yanukovych fled to russia into the arms of mr. putin, he took with him $30 to $40 billion of that impoverished country?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "vindman: those -- there are different estimates, but it's on that scale, yes.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "welch: in our bipartisan support, and by the way, i want to say to my republican colleagues, a lot of leadership to have this bipartisan support came from your side, thank you. but our whole commitment was to get rid of corruption and to stop that russian aggression, is that correct?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "vindman: that amounts to some of the key pillars. welch: that's right. and the giuliani, sondmand (ph), and it appears, trump policy was not about that, it was about investigations into a political opponent. correct? i'll take that question back, we know it.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and you know, i'm going to say this to president trump, you want to investigate joe biden, you want to investigate hunter biden, go at it. do it. do it hard. do it dirty. do it the way you do do it. just don't do it by asking a foreign leader to help you in your campaign. that's your job, it's not his.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "it is vitally important that the american people understand how president trumps unethical demand that ukraine deliver a politically- motivated investigation in exchange for military assistance created a security risk for our, the united states of america, national security. the president was not just playing a political game by upholding military aid and meetings with ukraine, threatening the hundreds of millions of dollars of military assistance that congress had appropriated has real-life consequences for ukraine and for the usa.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "to address these issues, it is important to recall why america and our allies were compelled to fight a war in afghanistan in the first place. we did not ask for this fight. on september 11, 2001, 19 men hijacked four airplanes and used them to murder nearly 3,000 people. they struck at our military and economic nerve centers. they took the lives of innocent men, women and children without regard to their faith or race or station. were it not for the heroic actions of the passengers on board one of those flights, they could have also struck at one of the great symbols of our democracy in washington, and killed many more.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "as we know, these men belonged to al qaeda -- a group of extremists who have distorted and defiled islam, one of the world's great religions, to justify the slaughter of innocents. al qaeda's base of operations was in afghanistan, where they were harbored by the taliban -- a ruthless, repressive and radical movement that seized control of that country after it was ravaged by years of soviet occupation and civil war, and after the attention of america and our friends had turned elsewhere.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "under the banner of this domestic unity and international legitimacy -- and only after the taliban refused to turn over osama bin laden -- we sent our troops into afghanistan. within a matter of months, al qaeda was scattered and many of its operatives were killed. the taliban was driven from power and pushed back on its heels. a place that had known decades of fear now had reason to hope. at a conference convened by the u.n., a provisional government was established under president hamid karzai. and an international security assistance force was established to help bring a lasting peace to a war-torn country.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "then, in early 2003, the decision was made to wage a second war in iraq. the wrenching debate over the iraq war is well-known and need not be repeated here. it is enough to say that for the next six years, the iraq war drew the dominant share of our troops, our resources, our diplomacy, and our national attention -- and that the decision to go into iraq caused substantial rifts between america and much of the world.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "today, after extraordinary costs, we are bringing the iraq war to a responsible end. we will remove our combat brigades from iraq by the end of next summer, and all of our troops by the end of 2011. that we are doing so is a testament to the character of our men and women in uniform. thanks to their courage, grit and perseverance , we have given iraqis a chance to shape their future, and we are successfully leaving iraq to its people.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "but while we have achieved hard-earned milestones in iraq, the situation in afghanistan has deteriorated. after escaping across the border into pakistan in 2001 and 2002, al qaeda's leadership established a safe haven there. although a legitimate government was elected by the afghan people, it has been hampered by corruption, the drug trade, an under-developed economy, and insufficient security forces. over the last several years, the taliban has maintained common cause with al qaeda, as they both seek an overthrow of the afghan government. gradually, the taliban has begun to take control over swaths of afghanistan, while engaging in increasingly brazen and devastating acts of terrorism against the pakistani people.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "throughout this period, our troop levels in afghanistan remained a fraction of what they were in iraq. when i took office, we had just over 32,000 americans serving in afghanistan, compared to 160,000 in iraq at the peak of the war. commanders in afghanistan repeatedly asked for support to deal with the reemergence of the taliban, but these reinforcements did not arrive. that's why, shortly after taking office, i approved a long-standing request for more troops. after consultations with our allies, i then announced a strategy recognizing the fundamental connection between our war effort in afghanistan, and the extremist safe havens in pakistan. i set a goal that was narrowly defined as disrupting, dismantling, and defeating al qaeda and its extremist allies, and pledged to better coordinate our military and civilian efforts.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "since then, we have made progress on some important objectives. high-ranking al qaeda and taliban leaders have been killed, and we have stepped up the pressure on al qaeda world-wide. in pakistan, that nation's army has gone on its largest offensive in years. in afghanistan, we and our allies prevented the taliban from stopping a presidential election, and -- although it was marred by fraud -- that election produced a government that is consistent with afghanistan's laws and constitution.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "yet huge challenges remain. afghanistan is not lost, but for several years it has moved backwards. there is no imminent threat of the government being overthrown, but the taliban has gained momentum. al qaeda has not reemerged in afghanistan in the same numbers as before 9/11, but they retain their safe havens along the border. and our forces lack the full support they need to effectively train and partner with afghan security forces and better secure the population. our new commander in afghanistan -- gen. mcchrystal -- has reported that the security situation is more serious than he anticipated. in short: the status quo is not sustainable.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "as cadets, you volunteered for service during this time of danger. some of you have fought in afghanistan. many will deploy there. as your commander in chief, i owe you a mission that is clearly defined, and worthy of your service. that is why, after the afghan voting was completed, i insisted on a thorough review of our strategy. let me be clear: there has never been an option before me that called for troop deployments before 2010 -- so there has been no delay or denial of resources necessary for the conduct of the war. instead, the review has allowed me ask the hard questions, and to explore all of the different options along with my national security team, our military and civilian leadership in afghanistan, and our key partners. given the stakes involved, i owed the american people and our troops no less.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "this review is now complete. and as commander in chief, i have determined that it is in our vital national interest to send an additional 30,000 u.s. troops to afghanistan. after 18 months, our troops will begin to come home. these are the resources that we need to seize the initiative, while building the afghan capacity that can allow for a responsible transition of our forces out of afghanistan.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "i do not make this decision lightly. i opposed the war in iraq precisely because i believe that we must exercise restraint in the use of military force, and always consider the long-term consequences of our actions. we have been at war for eight years, at enormous cost in lives and resources. years of debate over iraq and terrorism have left our unity on national security issues in tatters, and created a highly polarized and partisan backdrop for this effort. and having just experienced the worst economic crisis since the great depression, the american people are understandably focused on rebuilding our economy and putting people to work here at home.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "most of all, i know that this decision asks even more of you -- a military that, along with your families, has already borne the heaviest of all burdens. as president, i have signed a letter of condolence to the family of each american who gives their life in these wars. i have read the letters from the parents and spouses of those who deployed. i have visited our courageous wounded warriors at walter reed. i have traveled to dover to meet the flag-draped caskets of 18 americans returning home to their final resting place. i see firsthand the terrible wages of war. if i did not think that the security of the united states and the safety of the american people were at stake in afghanistan, i would gladly order every single one of our troops home tomorrow.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "so no -- i do not make this decision lightly. i make this decision because i am convinced that our security is at stake in afghanistan and pakistan. this is the epicenter of the violent extremism practiced by al qaeda. it is from here that we were attacked on 9/11, and it is from here that new attacks are being plotted as i speak. this is no idle danger; no hypothetical threat. in the last few months alone, we have apprehended extremists within our borders who were sent here from the border region of afghanistan and pakistan to commit new acts of terror. this danger will only grow if the region slides backwards, and al qaeda can operate with impunity. we must keep the pressure on al qaeda, and to do that, we must increase the stability and capacity of our partners in the region.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "of course, this burden is not ours alone to bear. this is not just america's war. since 9/11, al qaeda's safe havens have been the source of attacks against london and amman and bali. the people and governments of both afghanistan and pakistan are endangered. and the stakes are even higher within a nuclear-armed pakistan, because we know that al qaeda and other extremists seek nuclear weapons, and we have every reason to believe that they would use them.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "these facts compel us to act along with our friends and allies. our overarching goal remains the same: to disrupt, dismantle, and defeat al qaeda in afghanistan and pakistan, and to prevent its capacity to threaten america and our allies in the future.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "to meet that goal, we will pursue the following objectives within afghanistan. we must deny al qaeda a safe haven. we must reverse the taliban's momentum and deny it the ability to overthrow the government. and we must strengthen the capacity of afghanistan's security forces and government, so that they can take lead responsibility for afghanistan's future.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "we will meet these objectives in three ways. first, we will pursue a military strategy that will break the taliban's momentum and increase afghanistan's capacity over the next 18 months.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the 30,000 additional troops that i am announcing tonight will deploy in the first part of 2010 -- the fastest pace possible -- so that they can target the insurgency and secure key population centers. they will increase our ability to train competent afghan security forces, and to partner with them so that more afghans can get into the fight. and they will help create the conditions for the united states to transfer responsibility to the afghans.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "because this is an international effort, i have asked that our commitment be joined by contributions from our allies. some have already provided additional troops, and we are confident that there will be further contributions in the days and weeks ahead. our friends have fought and bled and died alongside us in afghanistan. now, we must come together to end this war successfully. for what's at stake is not simply a test of nato's credibility -- what's at stake is the security of our allies, and the common security of the world.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "taken together, these additional american and international troops will allow us to accelerate handing over responsibility to afghan forces, and allow us to begin the transfer of our forces out of afghanistan in july of 2011. just as we have done in iraq, we will execute this transition responsibly, taking into account conditions on the ground. we will continue to advise and assist afghanistan's security forces to ensure that they can succeed over the long haul. but it will be clear to the afghan government -- and, more importantly, to the afghan people -- that they will ultimately be responsible for their own country.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "second, we will work with our partners, the united nations, and the afghan people to pursue a more effective civilian strategy, so that the government can take advantage of improved security.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "this effort must be based on performance. the days of providing a blank check are over. president karzai's inauguration speech sent the right message about moving in a new direction. and going forward, we will be clear about what we expect from those who receive our assistance. we will support afghan ministries, governors, and local leaders that combat corruption and deliver for the people. we expect those who are ineffective or corrupt to be held accountable. and we will also focus our assistance in areas -- such as agriculture -- that can make an immediate impact in the lives of the afghan people.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the people of afghanistan have endured violence for decades. they have been confronted with occupation -- by the soviet union, and then by foreign al qaeda fighters who used afghan land for their own purposes. so tonight, i want the afghan people to understand -- america seeks an end to this era of war and suffering. we have no interest in occupying your country. we will support efforts by the afghan government to open the door to those taliban who abandon violence and respect the human rights of their fellow citizens. and we will seek a partnership with afghanistan grounded in mutual respect -- to isolate those who destroy; to strengthen those who build; to hasten the day when our troops will leave; and to forge a lasting friendship in which america is your partner, and never your patron.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "third, we will act with the full recognition that our success in afghanistan is inextricably linked to our partnership with pakistan.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "we are in afghanistan to prevent a cancer from once again spreading through that country. but this same cancer has also taken root in the border region of pakistan. that is why we need a strategy that works on both sides of the border.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "in the past, there have been those in pakistan who have argued that the struggle against extremism is not their fight, and that pakistan is better off doing little or seeking accommodation with those who use violence. but in recent years, as innocents have been killed from karachi to islamabad, it has become clear that it is the pakistani people who are the most endangered by extremism. public opinion has turned. the pakistani army has waged an offensive in swat and south waziristan. and there is no doubt that the united states and pakistan share a common enemy.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "in the past, we too often defined our relationship with pakistan narrowly. those days are over. moving forward, we are committed to a partnership with pakistan that is built on a foundation of mutual interests, mutual respect and mutual trust. we will strengthen pakistan's capacity to target those groups that threaten our countries, and have made it clear that we cannot tolerate a safe haven for terrorists whose location is known, and whose intentions are clear. america is also providing substantial resources to support pakistan's democracy and development. we are the largest international supporter for those pakistanis displaced by the fighting. and going forward, the pakistani people must know: america will remain a strong supporter of pakistan's security and prosperity long after the guns have fallen silent, so that the great potential of its people can be unleashed.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "these are the three core elements of our strategy: a military effort to create the conditions for a transition; a civilian surge that reinforces positive action; and an effective partnership with pakistan.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "i recognize that there are a range of concerns about our approach. so let me briefly address a few of the prominent arguments that i have heard, and which i take very seriously.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "first, there are those who suggest that afghanistan is another vietnam. they argue that it cannot be stabilized, and we are better off cutting our losses and rapidly withdrawing. i believe this argument depends upon a false reading of history. unlike vietnam, we are joined by a broad coalition of 43 nations that recognizes the legitimacy of our action. unlike vietnam, we are not facing a broad-based popular insurgency. and most importantly, unlike vietnam, the american people were viciously attacked from afghanistan, and remain a target for those same extremists who are plotting along its border. to abandon this area now -- and to rely only on efforts against al qaeda from a distance -- would significantly hamper our ability to keep the pressure on al qaeda, and create an unacceptable risk of additional attacks on our homeland and our allies.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "second, there are those who acknowledge that we can't leave afghanistan in its current state, but suggest that we go forward with the troops that we have. but this would simply maintain a status quo in which we muddle through, and permit a slow deterioration of conditions there. it would ultimately prove more costly and prolong our stay in afghanistan, because we would never be able to generate the conditions needed to train afghan security forces and give them the space to take over.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "finally, there are those who oppose identifying a timeframe for our transition to afghan responsibility. indeed, some call for a more dramatic and open-ended escalation of our war effort -- one that would commit us to a nation building project of up to a decade. i reject this course because it sets goals that are beyond what we can achieve at a reasonable cost, and what we need to achieve to secure our interests. furthermore, the absence of a timeframe for transition would deny us any sense of urgency in working with the afghan government. it must be clear that afghans will have to take responsibility for their security, and that america has no interest in fighting an endless war in afghanistan.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "as president, i refuse to set goals that go beyond our responsibility, our means, our or interests. and i must weigh all of the challenges that our nation faces. i don't have the luxury of committing to just one. indeed, i am mindful of the words of president eisenhower, who -- in discussing our national security -- said, each proposal must be weighed in the light of a broader consideration: the need to maintain balance in and among national programs.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "over the past several years, we have lost that balance. we have failed to appreciate the connection between our national security and our economy. in the wake of an economic crisis, too many of our friends and neighbors are out of work and struggle to pay the bills, and too many americans are worried about the future facing our children. meanwhile, competition within the global economy has grown more fierce. so we can't simply afford to ignore the price of these wars.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "all told, by the time i took office the cost of the wars in iraq and afghanistan approached a trillion dollars. going forward, i am committed to addressing these costs openly and honestly. our new approach in afghanistan is likely to cost us roughly $30 billion for the military this year, and i will work closely with congress to address these costs as we work to bring down our deficit.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "but as we end the war in iraq and transition to afghan responsibility, we must rebuild our strength here at home. our prosperity provides a foundation for our power. it pays for our military. it underwrites our diplomacy. it taps the potential of our people, and allows investment in new industry. and it will allow us to compete in this century as successfully as we did in the last. that is why our troop commitment in afghanistan cannot be open-ended -- because the nation that i am most interested in building is our own.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "now, let me be clear: none of this will be easy. the struggle against violent extremism will not be finished quickly, and it extends well beyond afghanistan and pakistan. it will be an enduring test of our free society, and our leadership in the world. and unlike the great power conflicts and clear lines of division that defined the 20th century, our effort will involve disorderly regions, failed states, diffuse enemies.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "so as a result, america will have to show our strength in the way that we end wars and prevent conflict. we will have to be nimble and precise in our use of military power. where al qaeda and its allies attempt to establish a foothold -- whether in somalia or yemen or elsewhere -- they must be confronted by growing pressure and strong partnerships.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and we can't count on military might alone. we have to invest in our homeland security, because we can't capture or kill every violent extremist abroad. we have to improve and better coordinate our intelligence, so that we stay one step ahead of shadowy networks.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "we will have to take away the tools of mass destruction. that is why i have made it a central pillar of my foreign policy to secure loose nuclear materials from terrorists; to stop the spread of nuclear weapons; and to pursue the goal of a world without them. because every nation must understand that true security will never come from an endless race for ever-more destructive weapons -- true security will come for those who reject them.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "we will have to use diplomacy, because no one nation can meet the challenges of an interconnected world acting alone. i have spent this year renewing our alliances and forging new partnerships. and we have forged a new beginning between america and the muslim world -- one that recognizes our mutual interest in breaking a cycle of conflict, and that promises a future in which those who kill innocents are isolated by those who stand up for peace and prosperity and human dignity.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "finally, we must draw on the strength of our values -- for the challenges that we face may have changed, but the things that we believe in must not. that is why we must promote our values by living them at home -- which is why i have prohibited torture and will close the prison at guantanamo bay. and we must make it clear to every man, woman and child around the world who lives under the dark cloud of tyranny that america will speak out on behalf of their human rights, and tend to the light of freedom, and justice, and opportunity, and respect for the dignity of all peoples. that is who we are. that is the source -- the moral source of america's authority.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "since the days of franklin roosevelt, and the service and sacrifice of our grandparents and great-grandparents, our country has borne a special burden in global affairs. we have spilled american blood in many countries on multiple continents. we have spent our revenue to help others rebuild from rubble and develop their own economies. we have joined with others to develop an architecture of institutions -- from the united nations to nato to the world bank -- that provide for the common security and prosperity of human beings.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "we have not always been thanked for these efforts, and we have at times made mistakes. but more than any other nation, the united states of america has underwritten global security for over six decades -- a time that, for all its problems, has seen walls come down, markets open, billions lifted from poverty, unparalleled scientific progress, and advancing frontiers of human liberty.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "for unlike the great powers of old, we have not sought world domination. our union was founded in resistance to oppression. we do not seek to occupy other nations. we will not claim another nation's resources or target other peoples because their faith or ethnicity is different from ours. what we have fought for -- what we continue to fight for -- is a better future for our children and grandchildren, and we believe that their lives will be better if other peoples' children and grandchildren can live in freedom and access opportunity.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "as a country, we are not as young -- and perhaps not as innocent -- as we were when roosevelt was president. yet we are still heirs to a noble struggle for freedom. now we must summon all of our might and moral suasion to meet the challenges of a new age.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "in the end, our security and leadership does not come solely from the strength of our arms. it derives from our people -- from the workers and businesses who will rebuild our economy; from the entrepreneurs and researchers who will pioneer new industries; from the teachers that will educate our children, and the service of those who work in our communities at home; from the diplomats and peace corps volunteers who spread hope abroad; and from the men and women in uniform who are part of an unbroken line of sacrifice that has made government of the people, by the people and for the people a reality on this earth.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "this vast and diverse citizenry will not always agree on every issue -- nor should we. but i also know that we, as a country, cannot sustain our leadership nor navigate the momentous challenges of our time if we allow ourselves to be split asunder by the same rancor and cynicism and partisanship that has in recent times poisoned our national discourse.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "it is easy to forget that when this war began, we were united -- bound together by the fresh memory of a horrific attack, and by the determination to defend our homeland and the values we hold dear. i refuse to accept the notion that we cannot summon that unity again. i believe with every fiber of my being that we -- as americans -- can still come together behind a common purpose. for our values are not simply words written into parchment -- they are a creed that calls us together, and that has carried us through the darkest of storms as one nation, as one people.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "america, we are passing through a time of great trial. and the message that we send in the midst of these storms must be clear: that our cause is just, our resolve unwavering. we will go forward with the confidence that right makes might, and with the commitment to forge an america that is safer, a world that is more secure, and a future that represents not the deepest of fears but the highest of hopes. thank you, god bless you and god bless the united states of america.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "the moment captured how president donald trump's order to kill iran's military commander qasem soleimani has abruptly thrust foreign policy to the forefront of the 2020 democratic race , shining a new spotlight on candidates' foreign policy experiences and records, and sparking fresh debates about the use of military force and us interventions abroad. with the election now unfolding against a backdrop of conflict and war, for warren, her ability to articulate her own vision on foreign policy will be particularly critical as she takes on rivals like former vice president joe biden and vermont sen. bernie sanders , who have spent more time publicly articulating those ideas in their decades in public office.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "as her national security credentials face their most strenuous test so far, warren has been making a more explicit case about how she would revise american foreign policy -- and how her agenda abroad is linked to her agenda at home. a member of the senate armed services committee, warren has weighed in frequently in recent days both on iran and her foreign policy vision more broadly, slamming trump as reckless and repeatedly stressing that the united states should not start another war in the middle east.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "cnn interviewed more than half dozen foreign policy veterans who have been quietly advising warren and her team over the past year, as well as senior campaign aides. the network of informal advisers consulting with the warren campaign is previously unreported. collectively, these interviews paint a picture of a second-term senator who is deeply weary of us military interventions, resists drawing distinctions between domestic and foreign policies, and has attracted to her presidential campaign a number of career diplomats who say washington, as one adviser described it, is in urgent need of a substantial rethink of how it conducts foreign policy.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "those who spoke with cnn described emails, group text chains and conference calls where they brainstorm responses to urgent international events, help draft campaign statements and policy papers, and flag developments that they believe should be top of mind for warren and her senior aides. they coordinate closely with warren's top foreign policy aide, sasha baker, former deputy chief of staff to ex-secretary of defense ash carter, who transitioned from warren's senate office to the white house campaign last year.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "while the majority of the policy plans that warren has released over the last year tackle domestic issues, several have been foreign policy-oriented, including a proposal last month on curtailing global financial corruption. warren has also made a campaign pledge to not appoint donors and campaign bundlers to ambassadorship positions as president, and has called on her rivals to do the same.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "she has this theme for domestic policy which is about corruption and deep structural change and inequality, said ilan goldenberg, former chief of staff to the special envoy for israeli-palestinian negotiations in the obama state department who has been advising the warren campaign since the summer. she wants to apply that to foreign policy writ large.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "she signaled as much in an early speech: speaking to a packed hall on a college campus, warren railed against policies that favor wealthy elites, corporations and special interests; deployed a metaphor about yachts; and made at least a dozen references to corruption.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "but this was not a campaign stump speech -- warren was not yet a presidential candidate. it was a rare foreign policy speech that the senator delivered in november 2018 at american university. to political observers, it appeared to be a clear signal that warren was gearing up for a 2020 run -- she would launch an exploratory committee for president weeks later on new year's eve.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "warren has not made a foreign policy-focused speech since jumping into the 2020 race, and an aide told cnn that there are no plans at the moment to do so. that speech from more than a year ago, along with a lengthy article in foreign affairs magazine from around the same time, serve as two of the most detailed and recent blueprints of warren's foreign policy vision.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "since then, there have been striking similarities in the language warren used at american university and what she has said over the last year on the campaign trail. corruption has emerged as the overarching theme of warren's campaign for the white house, with the majority of her diagnoses on the domestic problems that face the country tracing back to it in some shape or form.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "her advisers stress that there is little daylight between how warren views the gravest domestic and foreign policy challenges facing the country. one foreign policy aide on the campaign, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, described such a distinction as arbitrary.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "anti-corruption: it runs through everything that she's talking about on both the domestic and foreign policy side, said jarrett blanc, former coordinator for the iran nuclear implementation at the state department and acting special representative for afghanistan and pakistan under president barack obama. that question of corruption -- the ways that it damages our partners, destabilizes key countries abroad, damages our interests and our country -- that is a foreign policy question that needs to be acknowledged as such.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "blanc has assumed a lead role in corralling a group of outside foreign policy advisers helping the warren campaign. according to the campaign, it includes alexandra bell, former senior adviser to the under secretary of state for arms control and international security, brittany brown, former acting senior director for african affairs at the national security council, hady amr, former deputy special envoy for israeli-palestinian negotiations, mike fuchs, former deputy assistant secretary of state for east asia and pacific affairs and laurel miller, former acting special representative for afghanistan and pakistan.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the us operation that killed soleimani has reinvigorated the debate over the use of american military force and interventions abroad. the question has dominated the 2020 democratic contest, putting white house hopefuls on the spot on the controversial airstrikes that killed soleimani, and what actions the trump administration and congress should take in its aftermath.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the development has prompted warren to state repeatedly: no more wars in the middle east.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "several of warren's outside foreign policy advisers and an aide to the senator said minimizing the deployment of us military abroad and reevaluating what international challenges can and cannot be resolved with military force is central to warren's foreign policy outlook. (each of outside adviser that cnn interviewed emphasized that they did not speak on behalf of the campaign or candidate.)", "augmented": []}
{"original": "for years, senior leaders have done a disservice to our military by remaining mired in these conflicts and not being open with the american people about their cost, said loren dejonge schulman, who served as senior adviser to obama's national security adviser susan rice and has been advising the warren campaign since last summer.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "we've put service members at enormous risk by asking them to solve problems without military solutions. warren has no qualms calling this out, she said.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "on the campaign trail, warren tells voters that it is time to bring our troops home, and regularly makes the case for exploring non-military, diplomatic actions to take, describing them as other tools in the toolbox. she also frequently references her three brothers who are veterans, saying she has seen first-hand the sacrifices that military families make.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "over the summer, the senator released a proposal to reform the state department -- as a part of that plan, she pledged to fill some of the senior-most positions there with career diplomats, double the size of the us foreign service and not give ambassador posts to donors and bundlers.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "the many years that ford served as a career foreign service officer took him to war-torn, devastated areas around the world. when he retired in 2014, he and his wife settled down in bangor, maine. it was then, ford said, that he saw up close some of the most urgent problems plaguing his home country.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "he's driven by shuttered factories, wood mills and furniture manufacturers, witnessed the wrenching effects of the opioid crisis, and at his church in bangor, st. john's episcopal, where he serves lunch once a month to the needy, he's met struggling families, including single parents and their children.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "now that i live here, i see it, ford told cnn in a recent interview. we have to help people at home. we can't be strong overseas if we have really deep structural weaknesses back here in the united states.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "in her foreign policy speech at american university, warren stated that investments at home strengthen the economy, but these investments also serve national security. it's a sentiment she has reiterated on the campaign trail over the last year as she has released one domestic policy plan after another and embraced her campaign's unofficial campaign slogan, i have a plan for that.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "ford said this philosophy was one of the major reasons that he has chosen to get behind warren in the 2020 election, and he has been advising her team, with a focus on middle east issues, since around thanksgiving.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "because term life insurance coverage has a start date and an end date, this type of protection is typically the least expensive to buy. however, once your term ends, you won't have any coverage. also, there are different variants of term life insurance coverage you can choose from, including return-of-premium policies that let you get your premiums back when your policy ends, or term coverage you can convert to permanent life insurance later on.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "like term life insurance, premiums on whole life insurance generally stay the same throughout the policy, and your beneficiaries receive a guaranteed fixed benefit amount at your death (provided you make on-time payments on your policy for its duration). but whole life insurance also comes with a cash value component, which many companies tout as a savings account of sorts that you can borrow against while you're alive.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "universal life insurance is another type of permanent coverage that combines a death benefit with a cash value component. customers with universal life can rely on the cash value of their policy for a loan, but they can also withdraw funds over time. the cash value also earns interest that's based on market rates, which means the amount of interest you can earn will fluctuate.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "because of the investment component of variable life insurance, this type of coverage is generally seen as more risky. however, taking on more risk offers the opportunity for potentially higher returns. if the underlying investments within your variable life policy perform well, you may see the cash value of your policy and your death benefit increase substantially.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "group life insurance can come in many different forms, and it may include any type of life insurance coverage. the main difference is group life insurance is marketed and sold to an entire group at once — usually a cohort of employees at a company. typically speaking, this means the group can get coverage without individual medical exams.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "depending on where you work, you may get group life insurance coverage extended to you for free as an employee benefit. however, the benefit amount is typically on the smaller side, so if you need a higher level of protection, you'll want to supplement any group life insurance coverage with other coverage. you're also likely to lose any group life coverage you have if and when you switch jobs.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "these are all reasonable questions to consider and evaluate in clinical trials. however, at this time, suggesting changes to the fda-authorized dosing or schedules of these vaccines is premature and not rooted solidly in the available evidence. without appropriate data supporting such changes in vaccine administration, we run a significant risk of placing public health at risk, undermining the historic vaccination efforts to protect the population from covid-19, they added.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "the policy represents a major reversal from the approach of the obama administration which in 2014 committed the us to largely adhering to the 1997 ottawa convention, the international agreement which banned the use, stockpiling, production and transfer of anti-personnel landmines. the obama policy committed to replacing landmines in the us stockpile after they expire and directed the destruction of stockpiles not required for the defense of south korea.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "one of the drivers of the change in policy is greater concern about the prospect of a major conflict with a great power adversary like russia or china where denying conventional enemy forces access to critical terrain would be seen as a more urgent need than it has been in recent years where the us has focused on counterterrorism and counterinsurgency operations. moscow and beijing are not parties to the ottawa treaty.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "senator, i want to set the stage for this discussion by asking the question that i think hangs over all of our politics today and is probably on the minds of many people watching this debate tonight.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and that is, will our children and grandchildren ever live in a world as safe and secure as the world in which we grew up?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "kerry: well, first of all, bob, thank you for moderating tonight.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "thank you, arizona state, for welcoming us.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and thank you to the presidential commission for undertaking this enormous task. we're proud to be here.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "mr. president, i'm glad to be here with you again to share similarities and differences with the american people.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "will we ever be safe and secure again? yes. we absolutely must be. that's the goal.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "now, how do we achieve it is the most critical component of it.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "i believe that this president, regrettably, rushed us into a war, made decisions about foreign policy, pushed alliances away. and, as a result, america is now bearing this extraordinary burden where we are not as safe as we ought to be.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the measurement is not: are we safer? the measurement is: are we as safe as we ought to be? and there are a host of options that this president had available to him, like making sure that at all our ports in america containers are inspected. only 95 percent of them -- 95 percent come in today uninspected. that's not good enough.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "people who fly on airplanes today, the cargo hold is not x-rayed, but the baggage is. that's not good enough. firehouses don't have enough firefighters in them. police officers are being cut from the streets of america because the president decided to cut the cops program.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "so we can do a better job of homeland security. i can do a better job of waging a smarter, more effective war on terror and guarantee that we will go after the terrorists.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "i will hunt them down, and we'll kill them, we'll capture them. we'll do whatever is necessary to be safe.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "but i pledge this to you, america: i will do it in the way that franklin roosevelt and ronald reagan and john kennedy and others did, where we build the strongest alliances, where the world joins together, where we have the best intelligence and where we are able, ultimately, to be more safe and secure.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "schieffer: mr. president, you have 90 seconds.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "i want to thank arizona state as well.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "yes, we can be safe and secure, if we stay on the offense against the terrorists and if we spread freedom and liberty around the world.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "i have got a comprehensive strategy to not only chase down the al qaeda, wherever it exists -- and we're making progress; three-quarters of al qaeda leaders have been brought to justice -- but to make sure that countries that harbor terrorists are held to account.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "as a result of securing ourselves and ridding the taliban out of afghanistan, the afghan people had elections this weekend. and the first voter was a 19-year-old woman. think about that. freedom is on the march.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "we held to account a terrorist regime in saddam hussein.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "in other words, in order to make sure we're secure, there must be a comprehensive plan.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "my opponent just this weekend talked about how terrorism could be reduced to a nuisance, comparing it to prostitution, illegal gambling.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "i think that attitude and that point of view is dangerous. i don't think you can secure america for the long run if you don't have a comprehensive view as to how to defeat these people.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "at home, we'll do everything we can to protect the homeland. i signed the homeland security bill to better align our assets and resources. my opponent voted against it.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "we're doing everything we can to protect our borders and ports.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "but absolutely we can be secure in the long run. it just takes good, strong leadership.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "schieffer: anything to add, senator kerry?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "kerry: yes. when the president had an opportunity to capture or kill osama bin laden, he took his focus off of them, outsourced the job to afghan warlords, and osama bin laden escaped.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "six months after he said osama bin laden must be caught dead or alive, this president was asked, where is osama bin laden?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "he said, i don't know. i don't really think about him very much. i'm not that concerned.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "we need a president who stays deadly focused on the real war on terror.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "bush: gosh, i just don't think i ever said i'm not worried about osama bin laden. it's kind of one of those exaggerations.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "of course we're worried about osama bin laden. we're on the hunt after osama bin laden. we're using every asset at our disposal to get osama bin laden.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "my opponent said this war is a matter of intelligence and law enforcement. no, this war is a matter of using every asset at our disposal to keep the american people protected.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "question 2: how did the u.s. end up with a flu vaccine shortage?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "schieffer: new question, mr. president, to you.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "we are talking about protecting ourselves from the unexpected, but the flu season is suddenly upon us. flu kills thousands of people every year.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "suddenly we find ourselves with a severe shortage of flu vaccine. how did that happen?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "bush: bob, we relied upon a company out of england to provide about half of the flu vaccines for the united states citizen, and it turned out that the vaccine they were producing was contaminated. and so we took the right action and didn't allow contaminated medicine into our country.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "we're working with canada to hopefully -- that they'll produce a -- help us realize the vaccine necessary to make sure our citizens have got flu vaccinations during this upcoming season.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "my call to our fellow americans is if you're healthy, if you're younger, don't get a flu shot this year. help us prioritize those who need to get the flu shot, the elderly and the young.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the cdc, responsible for health in the united states, is setting those priorities and is allocating the flu vaccine accordingly.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "i haven't gotten a flu shot, and i don't intend to because i want to make sure those who are most vulnerable get treated.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "we have a problem with litigation in the united states of america. vaccine manufacturers are worried about getting sued, and therefore they have backed off from providing this kind of vaccine.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "one of the reasons i'm such a strong believer in legal reform is so that people aren't afraid of producing a product that is necessary for the health of our citizens and then end up getting sued in a court of law.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "but the best thing we can do now, bob, given the circumstances with the company in england is for those of us who are younger and healthy, don't get a flu shot.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "kerry: this really underscores the problem with the american health-care system. it's not working for the american family. and it's gotten worse under president bush over the course of the last years.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "five million americans have lost their health insurance in this country. you've got about a million right here in arizona, just shy, 950,000, who have no health insurance at all. 82,000 arizonians lost their health insurance under president bush's watch. 223,000 kids in arizona have no health insurance at all.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "all across our country -- go to ohio, 1.4 million ohioans have no health insurance, 114,000 of them lost it under president bush; wisconsin, 82,000, wisconsites lost it under president bush.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "this president has turned his back on the wellness of america. and there is no system. in fact, it's starting to fall apart not because of lawsuits -- though they are a problem, and john edwards and i are committed to fixing them -- but because of the larger issue that we don't cover americans.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "children across our country don't have health care. we're the richest country on the face of the planet, the only industrialized nation in the world not to do it.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "i have a plan to cover all americans. we're going to make it affordable and accessible. we're going to let everybody buy into the same health-care plan senators and congressmen give themselves.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "schieffer: mr. president, would you like to add something?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "i want to remind people listening tonight that a plan is not a litany of complaints, and a plan is not to lay out programs that you can't pay for.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "he just said he wants everybody to be able to buy in to the same plan that senators and congressmen get. that costs the government $7,700 per family. if every family in america signed up, like the senator suggested, [it] would cost us $5 trillion over 10 years.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "it's an empty promise. it's called bait and switch.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "kerry: actually, it's not an empty promise.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "it's really interesting, because the president used that very plan as a reason for seniors to accept his prescription drug plan. he said, if it's good enough for the congressmen and senators to have choice, seniors ought to have choice.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "what we do is we have choice. i choose blue cross/blue shield. other senators, other congressmen choose other programs.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "but the fact is, we're going to help americans be able to buy into it. those that can afford it are going to buy in themselves. we're not giving this away for nothing.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "question 3: with rising costs, how do you keep from raising taxes?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "sen. kerry, a new question. let's talk about economic security. you pledged during the last debate that you would not raise taxes on those making less than $200,000 a year. but the price of everything is going up, and we all know it. health care costs, as you all talking about, is skyrocketing, the cost of the war.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "my question is, how can you or any president, whoever is elected next time, keep that pledge without running this country deeper into debt and passing on more of the bills that we're running up to our children?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "kerry: i'll tell you exactly how i can do it: by reinstating what president bush took away, which is called pay as you go.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "during the 1990s, we had pay-as-you-go rules. if you were going to pass something in the congress, you had to show where you are going to pay for it and how.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "president bush has taken -- he's the only president in history to do this.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "he's also the only president in 72 years to lose jobs -- 1.6 million jobs lost. he's the only president to have incomes of families go down for the last three years; the only president to see exports go down; the only president to see the lowest level of business investment in our country as it is today.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "now, i'm going to reverse that. i'm going to change that. we're going to restore the fiscal discipline we had in the 1990s.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "every plan that i have laid out -- my health-care plan, my plan for education, my plan for kids to be able to get better college loans -- i've shown exactly how i'm going to pay for those.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and we start -- we don't do it exclusively -- but we start by rolling back george bush's unaffordable tax cut for the wealthiest people, people earning more than $200,000 a year, and we pass, hopefully, the mccain-kerry commission which identified some $60 billion that we can get.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "we shut the loophole which has american workers actually subsidizing the loss of their own job.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "they just passed an expansion of that loophole in the last few days: $43 billion of giveaways, including favors to the oil and gas industry and the people importing ceiling fans from china.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "i'm going to stand up and fight for the american worker. and i am going to do it in a way that's fiscally sound. i show how i pay for the health care, how we pay for the education.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "i have a manufacturing jobs credit. we pay for it by shutting that loophole overseas. we raise the student loans. i pay for it by changing the relationship with the banks.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "this president has never once vetoed one bill; the first president in a hundred years not to do that.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "bush: well, his rhetoric doesn't match his record.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "[he's] been a senator for 20 years. he voted to increase taxes 98 times. when they tried to reduce taxes, he voted against that 127 times.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "he talks about being a fiscal conservative, or fiscally sound, but he voted over -- he voted 277 times to waive the budget caps, which would have cost the taxpayers $4.2 trillion.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "he talks about pay-go. i'll tell you what pay-go means, when you're a senator from massachusetts, when you're a colleague of ted kennedy, pay go means: you pay, and he goes ahead and spends.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "he's proposed $2.2 trillion of new spending, and yet the so-called tax on the rich, which is also a tax on many small-business owners in america, raises $600 million by our account -- billion, $800 billion by his account.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "there is a tax gap. and guess who usually ends up filling the tax gap? the middle class.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "i propose a detailed budget, bob. i sent up my budget man to the congress, and he says, here's how we're going to reduce the deficit in half by five years. it requires pro-growth policies that grow our economy and fiscal sanity in the halls of congress.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "question 4: what do you say to someone who lost his job?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "schieffer: let's go to a new question, mr. president. two minutes. and let's continue on jobs.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "you know, there are all kind of statistics out there, but i want to bring it down to an individual.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "mr. president, what do you say to someone in this country who has lost his job to someone overseas who's being paid a fraction of what that job paid here in the united states?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "bush: i'd say, bob, i've got policies to continue to grow our economy and create the jobs of the 21st century. and here's some help for you to go get an education. here's some help for you to go to a community college.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "we've expanded trade adjustment assistance. we want to help pay for you to gain the skills necessary to fill the jobs of the 21st century.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "you know, there's a lot of talk about how to keep the economy growing. we talk about fiscal matters. but perhaps the best way to keep jobs here in america and to keep this economy growing is to make sure our education system works.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "i went to washington to solve problems. and i saw a problem in the public education system in america.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "they were just shuffling too many kids through the system, year after year, grade after grade, without learning the basics.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and so we said: let's raise the standards. we're spending more money, but let's raise the standards and measure early and solve problems now, before it's too late.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "no, education is how to help the person who's lost a job. education is how to make sure we've got a workforce that's productive and competitive.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "got four more years, i've got more to do to continue to raise standards, to continue to reward teachers and school districts that are working, to emphasize math and science in the classrooms, to continue to expand pell grants to make sure that people have an opportunity to start their career with a college diploma.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and so the person you talked to, i say, here's some help, here's some trade adjustment assistance money for you to go a community college in your neighborhood, a community college which is providing the skills necessary to fill the jobs of the 21st century.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and that's what i would say to that person.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "kerry: i want you to notice how the president switched away from jobs and started talking about education principally.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "let me come back in one moment to that, but i want to speak for a second, if i can, to what the president said about fiscal responsibility.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "being lectured by the president on fiscal responsibility is a little bit like tony soprano talking to me about law and order in this country.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "this president has taken a $5.6 trillion surplus and turned it into deficits as far as the eye can see. health-care costs for the average american have gone up 64 percent; tuitions have gone up 35 percent; gasoline prices up 30 percent; medicare premiums went up 17 percent a few days ago; prescription drugs are up 12 percent a year.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "but guess what, america? the wages of americans have gone down. the jobs that are being created in arizona right now are paying about $13,700 less than the jobs that we're losing.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and the president just walks on by this problem. the fact is that he's cut job-training money. $1 billion was cut. they only added a little bit back this year because it's an election year.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "they've cut the pell grants and the perkins loans to help kids be able to go to college.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "they've cut the training money. they've wound up not even extending unemployment benefits and not even extending health care to those people who are unemployed.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "i'm going to do those things, because that's what's right in america: help workers to transition in every respect.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "question 5: is bush entirely to blame for loss of jobs?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "schieffer: new question to you, sen. kerry, two minutes. and it's still on jobs.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "you know, many experts say that a president really doesn't have much control over jobs. for example, if someone invents a machine that does the work of five people, that's progress. that's not the president's fault.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "so i ask you, is it fair to blame the administration entirely for this loss of jobs?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "kerry: i don't blame them entirely for it. i blame the president for the things the president could do that has an impact on it.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "i've acknowledged that in union halls across the country. i've had shop stewards stand up and say, will you promise me you're going to stop all this outsourcing?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and i've looked them in the eye and i've said, no, i can't do that.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "what i can promise you is that i will make the playing field as fair as possible, that i will, for instance, make certain that with respect to the tax system that you as a worker in america are not subsidizing the loss of your job.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "today, if you're an american business, you actually get a benefit for going overseas. you get to defer your taxes.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "so if you're looking at a competitive world, you say to yourself, hey, i do better overseas than i do here in america.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "i don't want american workers subsidizing the loss of their own job.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and when i'm president, we're going to shut that loophole in a nanosecond and we're going to use that money to lower corporate tax rates in america for all corporations, 5 percent. and we're going to have a manufacturing jobs credit and a job hiring credit so we actually help people be able to hire here.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the second thing that we can do is provide a fair trade playing field. this president didn't stand up for boeing when airbus was violating international rules and subsidies. he discovered boeing during the course of this campaign after i'd been talking about it for months.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the fact is that the president had an opportunity to stand up and take on china for currency manipulation. there are companies that wanted to petition the administration. they were told: don't even bother; we're not going to listen to it.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the fact is that there have been markets shut to us that we haven't stood up and fought for.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "i'm going to fight for a fair trade playing field for the american worker. and i will fight for the american worker just as hard as i fight for my own job. that's what the american worker wants. and if we do that, we can have an impact.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "plus, we need fiscal discipline. restore fiscal discipline, we'll do a lot better.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "let me start with the pell grants. in his last litany of misstatements he said we cut pell grants. we've increased pell grants by a million students. that's a fact.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "you know, he talks to the workers. let me talk to the workers.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "you've got more money in your pocket as a result of the tax relief we passed and he opposed.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "if you have a child, you got a $1,000 child credit. that's money in your pocket.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "if you're married, we reduced the marriage penalty. the code ought to encourage marriage, not discourage marriage.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "we created a 10 percent bracket to help lower-income americans. a family of four making $40,000 received about $1,700 in tax relief.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "it's your money. the way my opponent talks, he said, we're going to spend the government's money. no, we're spending your money. and when you have more money in your pocket, you're able to better afford things you want.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "i believe the role of government is to stand side by side with our citizens to help them realize their dreams, not tell citizens how to live their lives.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "my opponent talks about fiscal sanity. his record in the united states senate does not match his rhetoric.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "he voted to increase taxes 98 times and to bust the budget 277 times.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "kerry: bob, anybody can play with these votes. everybody knows that.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "i have supported or voted for tax cuts over 600 times. i broke with my party in order to balance the budget, and ronald reagan signed into law the tax cut that we voted for. i voted for ira tax cuts. i voted for small-business tax cuts.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "but you know why the pell grants have gone up in their numbers? because more people qualify for them because they don't have money.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "but they're not getting the $5,100 the president promised them. they're getting less money.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "we have more people who qualify. that's not what we want.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "bush: senator, no one's playing with your votes. you voted to increase taxes 98 times. when they voted -- when they proposed reducing taxes, you voted against it 126 times.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "he voted to violate the budget cap 277 times. you know, there's a main stream in american politics and you sit right on the far left bank. as a matter of fact, your record is such that ted kennedy, your colleague, is the conservative senator from massachusetts.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "question 6: do you believe homosexuality is a choice?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "schieffer: mr. president, let's get back to economic issues. but let's shift to some other questions here.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "both of you are opposed to gay marriage. but to understand how you have come to that conclusion, i want to ask you a more basic question.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "do you believe homosexuality is a choice?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "bush: you know, bob, i don't know. i just don't know. i do know that we have a choice to make in america and that is to treat people with tolerance and respect and dignity. it's important that we do that.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and i also know in a free society people, consenting adults can live the way they want to live.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "but as we respect someone's rights, and as we profess tolerance, we shouldn't change -- or have to change -- our basic views on the sanctity of marriage.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "i believe in the sanctity of marriage. i think it's very important that we protect marriage as an institution, between a man and a woman.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "i proposed a constitutional amendment. the reason i did so was because i was worried that activist judges are actually defining the definition of marriage, and the surest way to protect marriage between a man and woman is to amend the constitution.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "it has also the benefit of allowing citizens to participate in the process. after all, when you amend the constitution, state legislatures must participate in the ratification of the constitution.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "i'm deeply concerned that judges are making those decisions and not the citizenry of the united states. you know, congress passed a law called doma, the defense of marriage act.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "my opponent was against it. it basically protected states from the action of one state to another. it also defined marriage as between a man and woman.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "but i'm concerned that that will get overturned. and if it gets overturned, then we'll end up with marriage being defined by courts, and i don't think that's in our nation's interests.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "kerry: we're all god's children, bob. and i think if you were to talk to dick cheney's daughter, who is a lesbian, she would tell you that she's being who she was, she's being who she was born as.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "i think if you talk to anybody, it's not choice. i've met people who struggled with this for years, people who were in a marriage because they were living a sort of convention, and they struggled with it.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and i've met wives who are supportive of their husbands or vice versa when they finally sort of broke out and allowed themselves to live who they were, who they felt god had made them.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "i think we have to respect that.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the president and i share the belief that marriage is between a man and a woman. i believe that. i believe marriage is between a man and a woman.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "but i also believe that because we are the united states of america, we're a country with a great, unbelievable constitution, with rights that we afford people, that you can't discriminate in the workplace. you can't discriminate in the rights that you afford people.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "you can't disallow someone the right to visit their partner in a hospital. you have to allow people to transfer property, which is why i'm for partnership rights and so forth.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "now, with respect to doma and the marriage laws, the states have always been able to manage those laws. and they're proving today, every state, that they can manage them adequately.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "question 7: how does kerry handle criticism from catholic archbishops?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "schieffer: sen. kerry, a new question for you.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the new york times reports that some catholic archbishops are telling their church members that it would be a sin to vote for a candidate like you because you support a woman's right to choose an abortion and unlimited stem-cell research.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "what is your reaction to that?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "kerry: i respect their views. i completely respect their views. i am a catholic. and i grew up learning how to respect those views. but i disagree with them, as do many.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "i believe that i can't legislate or transfer to another american citizen my article of faith. what is an article of faith for me is not something that i can legislate on somebody who doesn't share that article of faith.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "i believe that choice is a woman's choice. it's between a woman, god and her doctor. and that's why i support that.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "now, i will not allow somebody to come in and change roe v. wade.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the president has never said whether or not he would do that. but we know from the people he's tried to appoint to the court he wants to.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "i will not. i will defend the right of roe v. wade.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "now, with respect to religion, you know, as i said, i grew up a catholic. i was an altar boy. i know that throughout my life this has made a difference to me.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "former house speaker paul ryan discouraged his former colleagues from objecting to the election results in a statement sunday, saying it was difficult to conceive of a more anti-democratic and anti-conservative act than a federal intervention to overturn the results of state-certified elections and disenfranchise millions of americans.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "while a group of house members had been vowing to object to the 2020 election results for weeks, their protest would have died had no senator joined them, which is what happened when a handful of house democrats objected to trump's victory in several states when the electoral college votes were counted in 2017.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "but the last several days have led to a testy back and forth between those who support hawley and those who do not. on thursday morning, mcconnell repeatedly called on hawley to make his case to members on why he was objecting to the results from at least one state. hawley wasn't on the call, however, and later responded by email to the conference on his rationale. then over the weekend, multiple senators including romney, lisa murkowski of alaska and pat toomey of pennsylvania skewered any questions that the election had been compromised.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "romney specifically said the effort to overturn the election was an egregious ploy that may enhance the political ambition of some, but dangerously threatens our democratic republic. the statement was shot at hawley and others eyeing the presidential campaign in 2024 and trump's powerful sway over the gop base, should he not try to run again.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "how do you plan to do that?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "klobuchar: well, you know, it's maybe a series of debates. but i'm just -- i actually thought he should be on the debate stage because i don't think you should just be able to buy your way to the presidency. and my issue is that a number of us, including the three of us that you saw tonight, have been going in town halls like this. we've been answering questions. we have been going to states like nevada and actually meeting the voters and having them quiz us and ask all kind of things, and put our policies out there. and i think that is what a presidential candidate should do. so, you", "augmented": []}
{"original": "know, i don't mind that he has this money, that's a great thing he made that money. but we want to make sure that we have the best candidate to lead the ticket. and i don't think that when people look at donald trump they automatically say, hmm, can we get someone richer?", "augmented": []}

{"original": "and i think that's why we see, and there was a poll last summer that showed for the majority of hunters, this was a fox poll, and it said the majority of hunters actually supported universal background checks.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "klobuchar: the majority of trump owners support universal background checks. but let's think about why we don't have them. i think the first thing is that there are a lot of politicians out there that are afraid of the nra.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and i saw this firsthand after the parkland shooting because i have been working on a number of a pieces of legislation that would make things safer.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "one of the bills that i have always led is a bill to close the boyfriend loophole. that basically says if someone has been convicted of domestic abuse, then they cannot go out and get an assault weapon. they can't go out and buy a gun.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "klobuchar: that is pretty straightforward. and yet, it is sitting right now, along with the universal background check bill and a bill that does something called close the charleston loophole, which was the result of that incredibly sad tragedy, that murder in the church in south carolina where a white nationalist came in and killed a bunch of worshipers in a black church in charleston.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "that bill, my bill, and the universal background check bill are sitting on mitch mcconnell's desk right now, because they passed the house of representatives. my bill actually got some republican support. so why aren't these things passing? well, the nra wields so much clout right now with some of these republicans that we basically need to shake things up.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and i sat across from donald trump in the white house after parkland and i watched, because i came to advocate for my bill, and i watched. and nine times, i had a piece of paper and i wrote it down, he said, and i did it with hash marks, nine times that he wanted universal background checks, to the public, there's a video of this.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and then what does he do? he meets with the nra the next day, and he folds. and as your president, i will not fold. i know that we can do this.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "(applause) klobuchar: we can -- which would have been so helpful in the las vegas massacre, we could permanently put in place, just like your legislature has done in nevada, a ban on bump stocks. we can put in the assault weapon ban, the background checks, magazine limits, all of these things.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and i just -- i think the public is with us. in 2018 we elected a bunch of house members in districts that had people who were too beholden to the nra. and they went to washington and helped pass these bills. so there's absolutely no reason that we can't get these done.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and i'll just end with one last thing. one of my saddest days -- or the saddest day i had in washington is when we were voting on that universal background check bill, because i had those sandy hook parents in my office. and i had to tell them that we didn't have the votes to get it done.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and this one mom, she looked at me, she said, you know what, my kid, he had autism and he could hardly talk. and the last day that i saw him, just like he did every day, he pointed up to a picture on the refrigerator of his school aide, who was with him every day, because he loved her so much. and then he went to school. and she said hours later i'm in that firehouse and one by one the kids come in. and the parents that are left know we're never going to see our babies again.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and she said as she was sobbing in that firehouse, she had this thought of that school aide, because she knew that that woman would never leave her son's side. and when they found them in that school, that woman had her arms around that little boy. and they were both shot to death.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "those parents had the courage, just like the people in nevada, ordinary citizens who ran into that massacre to save lives, they had the courage to do that. and there are people, including our president, that doesn't have the courage to stand up to the nra. you have the power, nevada, to change that and put a new leader in the white house.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "cooper: this is alpha nash. alpha is a high school art teacher. and she's currently undecided. alpha, welcome. thanks for being here.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "question: hi, thank you so much.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "question: my question is, how do you plan to protect our under 18 population who are illegal immigrants who came to this country as young children? do you have a plan on helping to fast-track them into citizenship? and if so, what are the steps to make this happen?", "augmented": []}

{"original": "klobuchar: but i can tell you love your kids even beyond the work that you do in the classroom.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "so as we know, what she's talking about here are dreamers. and there are so many young people here who only know one country or only know one state. and i have been taking this on for a while. i kept trying to think about how i can get people to understand what this is.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and i finally found a -- this a few years ago, a 99-year-old dreamer.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "he had been brought over when he was five years old. he didn't know it. he thought he was born in our country. and i see one of our navy veterans out there with the hat. he signed up to serve in world war ii. and when he signed up to serve, that was when he found out that he was a dreamer, that he had not been born in our country. and so then you couldn't serve.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "so what they did back then, get this, is they would say, ok, just come and live in canada for one day. stay over night in canada, the army did this. and then you can come back and you're a citizen. because they needed people to serve. this is during world war ii. and he said, i stayed in a hotel and i came back and i was a citizen.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and then he served under general macarthur. he served bravely. he came back to minnesota. he got married. they had a son. that son served in the vietnam war. and i finally thought, ok, i brought him to stand in front of the world war ii memorial when he was now at this point over 100 years old with two dreamers from the suburbs of my state who wanted to serve in the air force but couldn't under the current rules.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and there's no way under the current rules they could just go to canada for a day. so i wanted to make that point. and the answer, of course, is comprehensive immigration reform, which would help not only dreamers with a fast track to citizenship, but also a track to citizenship for many others.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "that bill passed the u.s. senate in 2013. i was part of the judiciary committee who worked on that bill. i know as president i can get things done. i can get it done in the first year. i don't think we can wait because this president, we actually worked out an agreement on dreamers with the republicans in the senate. and we were gut- punched by the trump administration. this is just another reason for a change. think about it.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "immigrants, 70 of our fortune 500 companies are headed up by people from other countries. twenty-five percent of our u.s. nobel laureates were born in other countries. immigrants don't diminish america, they are america.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "cooper: let me just follow up with you. you have been in the senate for 10 years, you have seen a lot of people try this and fail. in 2007 it didn't work under george bush. obviously under obama 2013. why would it be different with you as president?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "klobuchar: i think the need has become clearer and clearer. and we were so close in 2013. george bush worked valiantly, actually, to try to get that done. and back then they had -- it was right-wing talk radio defeated it. then you go to 2013 and president obama had come in in the middle of the downturn. he tried it in his second term and he worked really hard as well.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "a number of those senators that voted for it, republicans, are still there today. and that bill back in 2013 got stopped, i think it ended up in john boehner's freezer when he was speaker of the house next to the frozen peas. and the point of it is nancy pelosi is now the speaker. i believe that if i am our candidate for the president, we are going to be able to win big and make sure we keep the house and win in these senate districts like in arizona, right, and in colorado, and make a change.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "klobuchar: but there are republicans in the senate that will still vote for comprehensive immigration reform. and you just need to do it in your first year. i have made that very clear that's what i will do. and i think we can get it done.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and one other argument i would make for people that when you're talking to your friends and neighbors that people don't always think about this. it brings the deficit down, this was a non-partisan budget office assessment, by $158 billion in 10 years. comprehensive immigration -- why?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "why is that? because people come out of the shadows and they start paying taxes. the afl-cio supported the bill because wages will go up. the private sector, of course, the chamber of commerce supported the comprehensive immigration bill. so there's a lot of good arguments for it that bring in people of different backgrounds.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "cooper: i wanted to ask you about something that happened recently. you were asked to give the name of president of mexico. you couldn't at the time. mayor buttigieg did know the name and he says it helps his argument that washington experience isn't necessary to be president. does it?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "klobuchar: oh my. ok, well, first of all, i would like to give my greetings to president andres manuel lopez obrador. (applause)", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and i -- when that happened,", "augmented": []}
{"original": "for what it's worth, i had been in the senate all day. we had six votes and including a resolution to be a check on the president so he doesn't go pell-mell into war with iran. and i got on a plane and got there, i think, at midnight my time and had a fast interview and then did two forums after that, i think, ending at about two or three in the morning.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "so, you know, such is life. and -- and i would say to the mayor, this isn't like a game of jeopardy. this is about, to me, experience. and i have so much respect for him and his experience. but my experience is different. i have been in the senate. i have passed over 100 bills as the lead democrat. i think that matters.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and, most importantly, i have been able to win in rural and suburban districts. i have been able to win with independents and republicans, not once, not twice but three times, and bring people with me.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "i think that's really important right now, that we build this coalition, that we not shut people out. and i know he agrees with me on that. but i am the one that actually has the receipts of anyone that you'll see on the debate stage tomorrow night, that's done it. so it's just a different experience that i bring to this and to the job.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and as far as mexico in general, i think i was the first one on the stage, yes, who gave my support to the united states-mexican-canadian trade agreement, which i think got much better because of the hard work of people like my friend sherrod brown, in terms of some labor provisions, and earned the support of the president of the afl-cio richard trumka.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "i think that implementing that is going to be the job of the new president, making sure that those provisions are strong and that we enforce the trade agreement to help our workers. and i also think having a president, unlike this president, who's going to reach out to our allies immediately -- in my first 100 days i will be meeting with the president of mexico, the president -- the prime minister of canada, justin trudeau, as well as so many of our allies around the world. i think that has to immediately happen with the new president.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "klobuchar: i was just in henderson.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "... actually, passing the era would be a nice thing to do.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "i don't know if it will be the first thing that i get done, but it's been waiting for a while.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "i also think that economic issues for women and men are key. getting an increase to the minimum wage, the federal minimum wage, that has not happened for literally nearly a decade would be really important for a lot of women workers.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "getting child care, universal child care, would be so key for so many workers; making sure that we keep strong women's right to choose would be so good, when we have a -- when we have a president that is trying to literally tear apart women's right to reproductive freedom.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "there is so much we can do. but i think one of the amazing things about being the first woman president would be to basically have every little girl in america and really around the world think anything and everything is possible. and you think about...", "augmented": []}
{"original": "i was just with some of the culinary workers, the housekeepers, today. i just left there, a big group of women, and a number of them, because they had just gotten off work, had their little kids, girls and boys, on their laps.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and you look at those kids and you think, they could grow up in a different world, where maybe they won't even remember when donald trump was president.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "cooper: if i could just follow up briefly, other countries -- other countries have had women presidents before. what do you think it says about our country that -- that we haven't?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "klobuchar: you know, actually, hillary clinton did get the most votes.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "so i think that -- you know, i think people are ready for it. i think it is -- i've thought about this a lot because, actually, in my races, i was the first woman in both jobs i had, as the county attorney and then as the woman senator from my state. and i didn't really talk about it much back then because women had tried to run for the u.s. senate in my state twice, and they were both really qualified, and they didn't make it. and there had been a lot of emphasis on put the first woman in.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and so when i ran, i made very clear i was running on my merits, that i was honored to be -- would be honored to be the first woman senator, but that wasn't enough of a reason, that i had to show i had the experience and i had a plan of what i wanted to get done. and i made that really clear throughout the campaign. and i think that's really important in this race as well.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "i know it would be cool to be the first woman president, believe me. and i think a lot of women out there know exactly what i'm talking about. but i think that the story that we tell and the campaign that we run have to be more than about that. it's got to be about people's dreams. it's got to be about the fact that we have a president that can't seem to put himself into the shoes of other people.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "i was saying this the other day in the last debate, that he literally seems to lack empathy. because, if he had empathy, he wouldn't be talking about immigrants the way he did. if he had empathy, he wouldn't be belittling people like my friend who i miss so much, john mccain.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "if he had empathy -- if he had empathy, he would be working on things like childcare. and so, as i've made it so clear, my pitch to the people of this state and across the country is that, if you are having trouble deciding between filling your refrigerator with food or your insulin prescription, i know you and i'll fight for you. and if you can't figure out if you're going to pay for childcare for your kids or long-term care for your parents, which i'm dealing with right now for my dad, i know you and i'll fight for you. and if you can't figure out how to make your paycheck stretch to pay your mortgage or your rent, i know you, and i'll fight for you.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and there is such a big difference between me and donald trump.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "one of them -- one of them is a -- i loved when the president went after michael bloomberg and the president said that michael bloomberg was 5'4 and michael bloomberg's like, no, i'm not; i'm taller than that.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "i'm the only one that has a claim to be 5'4. i want to be very clear.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "but, you know, he got $413 million over the course of his life from his dad. that's great. me, my grandpa was an iron ore miner. my dad was a newspaper man. my mom was a teacher. and my grandpa saved money in a coffee can in the basement to send my dad to a two-year community college. that's my family's trust. and you cannot fit $413 million in a coffee can.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and i figure, if someone gives you opportunity, whether it's a parent or a grandparent or whether it is someone you work with or a teacher, you do not go into the world with a sense of entitlement. you go into the world with a sense of obligation, to lift people up instead of shoving them down.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "cooper: we're going to be right back with amy klobuchar, right after this.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "cooper: and welcome back. we're live from sahara, las vegas, for a democratic presidential town hall with senator amy klobuchar. let's get back to our questions.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "this is pam whitfield jacobson, a dietitian from las vegas. she's currently undecided.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "question: question: senator, we love how even and reasonable you are, but how would you compete with the bombast of trump? would you be lost in the shuffle?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "klobuchar: i don't think so, no. if anyone has seen me on the debate stage, i don't think so, no.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "i think that, actually, having someone very different than he is, as i just described my background, i think that's really important. and i think the other thing is to have an optimistic economic agenda that you keep pushing. that's going to be important. people want to have something to vote for and someone to vote for and not just someone to vote against.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and then i think the other piece of it is how, when you put yourself -- i was just talking about, before the break, putting yourself in the shoes of other people. you know, not everyone agrees with everything that's said on the democratic debate stage. i don't agree with everything that's said there. and there are a lot of people out there who are independents or moderate republicans, or people who maybe stayed home in 2016, who see this as a patriotism check on this president.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "you know, they don't like that we have a president that stood next to a ruthless dictator in vladimir putin, and when asked about russian interference in the election, made a joke about it. think about it. hundreds of thousands of americans have lost their lives on the battlefield standing up for democracy. that's what world war ii was about. four little girls at the height of the civil rights movement lost their life because they were innocent, trying to be part of that democracy and other people were trying to shove them out of that democracy.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "so i think it's important -- or they think of it as a decency check. i have met so many people that see it in those eyes.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and you have others that feel like there have", "augmented": []}
{"original": "been promises that haven't been kept to them, that -- you know, he keeps talking about the economy. well, look at their prescription drug prices. or what's he done when it comes to childcare? or what he's done when it comes to rural broadband in northern nevada or the like?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "i think you have a lot of things that people are thinking. and then the last thing, i think it's important to take him on and be aggressive, of course. but i also think you've got to point out how absurd he is at times, right? you do.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and you have to -- you have to be nimble -- you have to be nimble in the moment to be able to do that. so when i announced my candidacy in the middle of that blizzard, and he made fun of me for talking about climate change in a blizzard and called me snow woman, which i kind of liked, actually, i -- i sent out a tweet and said the science is on my side, donald trump, when it comes to climate change. and i'd like to see how your hair would fair in a blizzard. or...", "augmented": []}
{"original": "or, like, you look at the absurdity of when -- other people when things go wrong for them and they can't afford stuff, they've got to get out a loan or they've got to work extra hours or find another different job or their spouse has to go work. with him, when anything goes wrong, what he does he do? he blames other people. that's what he does, he blames other people.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "picture him going by that helicopter, it's whirring, and he's, like, yelling about stuff. he blames barack obama. he loves blaming barack obama. he does that all the time. the president who had so much dignity, right, he -- i'm talking about president obama. he...", "augmented": []}
{"original": "he blames -- he blames the generals he commands. he's done that. he blames the federal reserve head that he appointed. he blames the entire kingdom of denmark. who does that? he does that. i kept saying that throughout new hampshire, and i had this cult of danish people following me that would wave flags.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "and now i think we need to have the second step act, which is to look at fact that 90 percent of people incarcerated are in state and local jails. and when you look at some of these non-violent offenders, you see that these sentences are too long and you make changes. so i think there's still so much more work that needs to be done when it comes to criminal justice reform. so, thank you.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "cooper: i want to just follow up on that. i want to ask you about your -- a study from your first year as a prosecutor. this was a study from the council on crime and justice. [22:35:00]", "augmented": []}
{"original": "it found that black men ages 18 to 30 in hennepin county were 15 times more likely to be arrested for narcotics offenses than white men, 12 times more likely to be arrested for serious violent crimes, 5 times more likely for serious property crimes. were you aware of those disparities at the time?", "augmented": []}

{"original": "and -- but there's still more to be done. we just talked about sentencing reform. i think there needs to be more done when it comes to grand jury reform. when i was there, i worked on eyewitness identification and making sure that when police showed witnesses pictures, that they showed them one at a time, instead of all at once, because it's been proven there's mostly racially involved misidentifications when you do it that way.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "also making sure the officers showing the picture doesn't know who it is, that can make a big difference. using everything from dna reviews to making sure that both our police departments and our prosecutors' offices are diverse makes a big difference. and i just think we have to come to grips with the fact that while we must keep our communities safe, you can do that at the same time you get at the institutional racism that we have in the criminal justice system.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "and i actually go back to my days that i mentioned when i was the head county attorney in our biggest county. and i took on hate crimes in a big way then. and it was everything from an african-american kid, a guy literally told people, i'm going to go and shoot a black kid on martin luther king day. and he did it. it was just a miracle that this young man wasn't killed, but we went after that guy, of course, for attempted murder.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "and so those kinds of stories and making sure that people know that kind of interfaith alliances that still exist and are so strong and having a president that wants to talk about it, i think that makes a big difference, too. it's knowing how you enforce the laws. it's putting people in place that will do it. but it is also having the heart to actually make it a priority.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "klobuchar: ok. so i think the way that you get people in other countries to want to believe in actually having a democracy is by having strong leaders in your own democracies -- i will start with that -- that respect democracies.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "so they have something to look to. when you look at what happened with the fall of the iron curtain and other moments in history, a lot of people in those countries who were desperate for examples of beacons of democracy would look to our own country. so making sure that our democracy is working and that we have a president that actually believes in democracy is key.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "i think the second thing is to be very firm in our relationships with vladimir putin. we know that this isn't just about interfering in our election. we know that under his regime that they have done things like poisoned dissidents, like went after and killed journalists, like brought down planes, like invading ukraine, which i'll never forget being there with the ukrainians on the front line on new year's eve with my friend, john mccain, one of the last trips that he took.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "now, why did he take that trip? right after donald trump was elected, he took me and senator graham on this trip to lithuania and latvia and estonia and georgia and, of course, ukraine, because he wanted to make that point loud and clear to our allies that we stood with them against russian aggression and that america stood with them.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and literally every country we went to, the leader of that country would be on one podium and the three of us would be on the other podium. so i learned a lot with john mccain.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and i learned the importance of those things. and one last thing i would add as we go into this election and we think about what we can do here at home to stand up for our own elections, because you brought up some of the things that they had done in our election. and, by the way, the same thing in other countries. i still remember that trip, estonia, they moved a statue of a russian fighter away from a public square into another location, in a cemetery. and so they got all their internet shut down. you know everything. you're like -- and like people would have to, like, try to go onto a hill to get service.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "we still have a number of states that don't have backup paper ballots, and we need those.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and then, secondly, when it comes to social media -- and i make a plea out there to help. this is a bill that actually senator graham and i now have that says to the social media companies, you've got to follow the same rules for political ads that tv and radio and newspapers do.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "which is that you have to say who paid for things, right, on the ads. and then you have to keep those ads in an archive so people know what they are so other campaigns can check them out.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and if you think this doesn't matter, i use an example of an image -- this wasn't a paid ad, but an image that went out to african-american facebook pages in the 2016 election. and we had it and displayed it in the judiciary committee. it was an innocent woman, innocent african-american woman from chicago. they put her face on an image with a fake hillary logo. and it said, why wait in line to vote? this is in 2016. you can text your vote to 86513. made up some number.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "think about that. they were suppressing the vote, whoever did that, by putting those images up. they were trying to get people not to go to the voting booths because they would think they could just text their vote in. to me, that's a crime.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "but that is what we are talking about when we talk about social media.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "all right. so the joy i will bring is the joy of loving people. and i really think that that kind of zest for enjoying being with people, even if you don't agree with everything they say, seems to be missing right now with this president.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and you feel it, when you want to have a president -- i remember the old days, you look about being proud, your second part, being proud to be an american, you remember -- i do -- when my parents would put the tv on because the president was giving an address. and it might not be a president that they had voted for, or that they even terribly liked, but they felt it was important to watch the president because they wanted to teach that to me, but they also wanted to know what the president was saying, because they wanted to, as a citizen, understand that, so that they could have discussions with people and the like.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and i think we've lost that right now. i think people are afraid when they see him at a rally, they need to mute the volume because they don't know what he's going to say. there are teachers that they want to teach in a neutral way about -- and they don't know, because the things that he says and does isn't what they're teaching the kids at school.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "i just think we need to bring that sense of decency back. and i know it's going to be boring when i don't send out a mean tweet at 5:00 in the morning. i know that, ok.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "at the beginning, people were shocked, and he always finds ways to distract us every single day. and then that makes it harder, right, to work on these long-term challenges, some of which we talked about, and things like bringing health care premiums down and doing something about climate change and all of those things. it makes it harder to do, because those are really hard things to work on, because you've got to have -- meet with people and you've got to draft a bill and do all these things. and he's just out there tweeting all the time. so i think that is -- that's the first thing.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and then as far as our standing in the world -- so i did a speech to the council on foreign relations. you can see it on our website at amyklobuchar.com, where you can also help us out. and the speech was about foreign relations and the five r's that i would bring to foreign policy. it's not reading, writing, and 'rithmetic.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "it's, first of all, renewing american leadership in the world. it's secondly -- don't worry, i won't go through them that long -- the second one is to repair our relationships with our allies, something we've talked about tonight. the third one is to renegotiate back into international agreements. i mentioned the russian nuclear arms agreements, but also the iranian nuclear agreement, which this president got us out of, which i didn't think was the right thing.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and the fourth thing would be to respond appropriately when things come up around the world, instead of doing tweets in the bathrobe at 5:00 in the morning. and then the fifth thing is to reassert american values around the world. and it really comes down to one r, and that would be to renew sanity. return to sanity in our foreign policy.", "augmented": []}
