diamond: yes, on fighting the threat to the american people, not fighting who has which title.

today, that stance is threatening the group home and his business. now we've been told by clinical settings that we're essentially blacklisted, that they can't even mention our program if we won't take people on opiates, on suboxone, lidz says.
and i look at these decisions and, in the moment, can somewhat understand why a mid-level official might say we have to follow policy and procedure. but in the middle of a crisis, turning to bureaucratic rulebooks is not the way to address this, and that has left the u.s. just a step behind at every step of the way.

but at this point, the virus is here. it's silently spreading. and locking down more borders may not help us very much and only alienate allies that we need to fight a global war on disease. as i was walking into the studio, terry, i saw the european union had put out a statement slamming the u.s. for taking this step without even informing them.

trump, meanwhile, at his rally painted a much darker image about the possible influx of new immigrants across the border, who he has characterized as bringing drugs and crime. instead, the president argued that people should be allowed into the country based on merit.
still, there are many people who stand by the so-called abstinence route — recovery without the use of medications. their views are informed by personal experiences and deeply held beliefs about what constitutes true recovery.
diamond: i think it's been a shame for public health writ large, and i think it's been horribly concerning for local leaders. we are flying blind, as the coronavirus threatens the united states. if there is an outbreak, if hundreds of people are infected in a certain city, it's been nearly impossible until recent days for officials to get a handle on that, and that means it's hard to make decisions about whether schools should be canceled or classes pushed off at a local college or conferences delayed.
the head of the association of immunization managers, claire hannan, says in her view, it's probably a good thing to get more doses flowing. the goal, she says, should be to send doses to the field as fast as possible. get it, thaw it, give it. [then] order the second dose. don't try to store it at cdc, don't try to store it at mckesson.
we're going to talk about how president trump and some members of his administration have mismanaged the coronavirus outbreak, helping fuel the crisis. my guest dan diamond is a reporter for politico who investigates health care policy and politics, including the trump administration's coronavirus response. he's written about dysfunction and infighting within the administration and how that's slowed the response to the spread of the virus and led to some counterproductive decisions. the virus has spread to the point where, yesterday, the world health organization declared it a pandemic, which is defined as the worldwide spread of a new disease.
a key question is whether public health officials across the country would be able to effectively make use of a larger supply of vaccine doses and quickly bring more people in to get vaccinated. vaccine hesitancy and disorganization have proven to be problems in many places, not just supply of doses.
but many approve of the biden policy announced friday.
according to nbc news, o'rourke's team said there were about 7,000 people at his rally and mile-long march beforehand, per law enforcement. and bloomberg news reported that o'rourke's rally had been estimated at 10,000 to 15,000, according to local police. at various points during his own rally, trump claimed that 69,000 people had rsvp'd and that fire marshals allowed 10,000 people in with tens of thousands still watching outside. but nbc news reported that trump's rally was at its 6,500 capacity with 10,000 to 12,000 watching outside or in overflow areas, per the local police and fire departments.

what that has meant for azar is he's gotten a boost within the administration and within this core group of trump supporters. but at the same time, he's further alienated a health department where most career health professionals don't share these views. they don't think that the trump administration should be cracking down on funding for abortion clinics and also broader reproductive health strategies around the country. but it seems like secretary azar has made the calculation that it's better to appeal to the anti-abortion constituency at present even if that means turning off some of the people who work directly for him.
we are making a stand for truth against lies and hate and ignorance and intolerance, the potential 2020 democratic candidate said. we are going to show the country who we are. we're going to make a stand to ensure that we live up to our promise, to our potential, to our purpose as a country.
diamond: dr. redfield emerged in the 1980s and 1990s during the aids epidemic, and he was seen in some corners as a very important figure in fighting the aids epidemic for his willingness to attack this problem as a scientist at a moment when some conservatives were turning away. but he did highlight abstinence as the best preventive measure, saying that the best way to avoid aids was holding off on sex until marriage. he wrote the introduction to a book about 30 years ago called christians in the age of aids, where he conflated the public health problem of spreading aids and hiv with living in a biblical way and the need to, i quote, reject false prophets who were suggesting that americans should use condoms and free needles.
gross: this is fresh air. and if you're just joining us, my guest is dan diamond, a reporter for politico who investigates health care policy and politics, including the trump administration's response to the coronavirus. so what is your assessment - since you cover the health agencies, what's your assessments of how much - that has gone wrong as a result of, like, bad political decisions, incompetence, just bad luck?
on stage, trump claimed he didn't know the details and didn't want to hear about it, sticking to his robust talking points on the border wall.
we have faith that the manufacturers can produce enough vaccines to ensure people can get their second doses in a timely manner, while also getting more people their first dose, biden's incoming press secretary jen psaki said in a briefing friday. the president-elect has said he will use the defense production act as needed to help produce materials and whatever else is needed to ensure supply.
additionally, toxicology reports are currently optional for indiana coroners. so if you're not required to pay for it, and you're not required to report it, why would you? said ray.
but at the same time, secretary azar has not always given the president the worst-case scenario of what could happen. my understanding is he did not push to do aggressive additional testing in recent weeks, and that's partly because more testing might have led to more cases being discovered of coronavirus outbreak, and the president had made clear - the lower the numbers on coronavirus, the better for the president, the better for his potential reelection this fall.
we have a real crisis, and one of the things we need to invest in, if we're going to make progress, is getting better information, said christopher ruhm, the author of the paper and a health economist at the university of virginia.
i think it is a good idea to send out as much vaccine as possible — as long as there is an indication that the manufacturers will be able to supply more, she says. [if] that supply becomes jeopardized, it would absolutely be a reasonable strategy to go back to the strategy of reserving some vaccine for that second dose.
treating opioid addiction with a drug raises hope and controversy
diamond: at this point, there is guidance coming from the cdc, the centers for disease control, to help hospitals, help health care workers figure out who to diagnose, who to treat, who should be tested. those guidances (ph) have been a work in progress and consistently behind where they probably need to be - running behind.
dr. anthony fauci of the national institutes of health — who advises both the trump administration and the incoming biden administration on the federal covid-19 response — tells npr there's no plan to abandon the two-shot regimen.
the president also claimed that the 35-day partial government shutdown over the wall — the longest shutdown ever in u.s. history — was a very important thing we did because it turned attention to the border crisis, even if it did cause a blip in a rise in unemployment. multiple polls also showed most americans blamed trump and republicans for the shutdown, and his approval ratings also dropped.
in some states such as indiana, independent county coroners investigate deaths. coroners are usually elected, and they aren't necessarily medical professionals. other states, though, have medical examiners, who are doctors. some even have a chief medical examiner who oversees death investigations for the whole state.
diamond: well, in many ways, the world health organization was just confirming what public health experts have said now for days or even weeks. this virus is here. it is around the world. it is spreading. it is putting many people at risk.
yet, only a fraction of the more than 4 million people believed to abuse prescription painkillers or heroin in the u.s. are being given what's called medication-assisted treatment.
diamond: about two weeks ago, my colleague nancy cook and i reported that the white house had soured on alex azar leading the coronavirus response. he was asked about it in congressional testimony because we broke the story while he was on capitol hill, waved it away by saying, you know, didn't trust anonymous sources in politico. but by the end of the day, mike pence had replaced him. and by the next morning, there was a new coordinator brought in, debbie birx, to help run the response, too. that's what people saw in public.
the white house is also highlighting success stories. at the national prescription drug abuse and heroin summit held in atlanta in march, obama appeared on stage with crystal oertle, a 35-year-old mother of two from ohio. oertle spoke of her spiral into addiction, which began with prescription painkillers and progressed to heroin. she tried unsuccessfully to quit on her own several times, before being prescribed buprenorphine a year ago. i personally couldn't get through the withdrawal symptoms, oertle said in atlanta. i couldn't tough it out. i know some people can. i couldn't do it. this last time has been the most successful recovery for me.
i think it's a positive that the president seems to finally realize the severity of the problem. unfortunately, his short remarks contained a lot of mistakes and misinformation. the president said that travel from europe would be suspended for 30 days. that wasn't completely correct. the white house had to immediately walk that back. u.s. citizens and their families and legal permanent residents can still come back. the president said that cargo would be banned from europe. that would have been a huge blow to the economy, especially given that some crucial medical supplies come from the eu. but it turned out that trump misspoke again; cargo will still be allowed.
speaking in an interview with fox news conducted on the sidelines of the rally, trump suggested he didn't know many of the specifics of the deal and said: we'll see what happens. about his push for a border wall, trump said his desire for a physical barrier is about safety. a wall is a very good thing, not a bad thing. it's a moral thing, the president also said in the interview.

(soundbite of aaron parks' small planet)
and in a near-showdown that seemed to mirror the ongoing political dispute over the border, trump was greeted by a counter-rally led by democrat beto o'rourke. the former texas lawmaker failed last year in his effort to unseat gop sen. ted cruz but could parlay his newfound celebrity with democratic voters into a 2020 bid to unseat the president — a white house bid that could especially challenge trump over immigration policy, border security and the propriety of building a southern border wall.
in your work covering the coronavirus epidemic, you've been covering the official government response, trying to find out what's happening behind the scenes, and you've also written about certain feuds within the department, like, you know, within the trump administration and how those feuds are contributing to how the trump administration is handling the epidemic. and just this week, one of the stories that you broke was about this email breakdown in medicare and medicaid. and there wasn't enough communication about the email breakdown, so medicare and medicaid missed a certain number of emails. they were out of the loop for a while. i mean, that just contributed to the general chaos. so what's the larger significance of stories like that?
some public health experts and scientists have been pushing for this move, arguing that the most important thing is to get as many people at least one shot as soon as possible, without being too concerned about scheduling the booster. they point out that while the vaccines are authorized as a series of two shots, data from clinical trials suggests that one shot is still protective, and many have argued there's a significant benefit to giving more people one shot.
diamond: that's right. the president famously axed a team in the white house about two years ago that was focused specifically on pandemic preparedness. he cut funding for a program that predicted when viruses could jump from animals to humans basically around the same time that this new coronavirus appears to have jumped from animals to humans in china. and there are big parts of the bureaucracy that he has either tried to cut or otherwise alienated and driven people away. i do think, terry, it's possible that some of these moves have been overly emphasized. several officials pointed out to me that the white house pandemic preparedness team was made up of just three or four people. and if that's the dividing line between a pandemic or not, the united states is perhaps more vulnerable than we realize. and we still have career scientists like tony fauci, who's clearly a star, working to fight this outbreak. but it does come back to the president bigger picture. he's chased off experts when we need them most, and he's claimed that he can get scientists back when he needs them, which is just not true.
the biden team is hopeful companies will be able to manufacture more doses quickly.
diamond: i think at this point, terry, south korea, in the past 24 hours, has probably done more tests for coronavirus than the united states has done in the past two months. south korea can do 10,000 tests per day. at last count, we have done somewhere between 5,000 and 8,000 tests.
so you've reported that alex azar of health and human services and seema verma of medicare and medicaid both want to please president trump. how have they gone about trying to please him during this period of the epidemic? and is that leading them to say or do things that they otherwise wouldn't do? in other words, are they doing things that shouldn't be done or needn't be done or are unnecessarily time-consuming just because they want to stay in trump's good graces?
gross: and it might be hard for the labs that actually conduct the tests to keep up with the need.
gross: well, let's take a short break here, and then we'll talk some more. if you're just joining us, my guest is dan diamond, a reporter for politico who investigates health care policy and politics, including the trump administration's response to the coronavirus. we'll be right back. this is fresh air.
in a previous life, i worked for a hospital consulting firm, and hospitals used to have many more beds than they do now. they very aggressively have cut back on their capacity because they didn't want to have a lot of empty wards that they weren't using. that may make sense at normal times, but in a crisis moment, it means there's only so many beds to go around. health officials don't want a crunch of people rushing to the hospital at the same time. it's bad for coronavirus patients, and it's just as bad for everyone else if doctors are spread thin and worn down.
gross: if you're just joining us, my guest is dan diamond. he's a reporter for politico who investigates health care policy and politics, including the trump administration's response to the coronavirus. we'll be right back after a short break. this is fresh air.
behind the scenes, azar and his team did know that he was at risk of being replaced, spent a fair amount of time just trying to shore up his standing, calling officials at the white house, on capitol hill, just trying to make sure that he didn't lose the job of running the coronavirus response. at that point, we were several weeks into fighting this thing. and in a working, functional administration, the amount of effort just to keep a job, just to fend off these internal fights, i don't know if that would be happening. since day 1, there were people trying to get him replaced as the leader of this effort. and alex azar also had to spend a lot of political capital fighting to keep this job at a time when we probably would want his efforts focused elsewhere.
gross: are there cuts the trump administration made to the public health infrastructure that have left us more undefended? for example, wasn't there a national security council health task force that was disbanded under trump?

instead, the biden administration plans to send most of the currently reserved doses out right away, allowing more people to get first doses. for people who've gotten initial shots, the biden team is making a bet that new doses could be manufactured in time to keep booster shots on schedule.
botticelli says patients should consider the evidence for medication-assisted treatment and together with their doctors make a decision about what's best for them.
omissions on death certificates lead to undercounting of opioid overdoses
after testing, coroners typically write the drugs involved in an overdose on the death certificate — but not always.
we know that walls do not save lives; walls end lives, o'rourke also told those gathered at his rally.
those views, redfield has said more recently, are things that he has broadened from. he has walked away from some of those earlier, stricter positions. but redfield is still seen in some corners as a suboptimal leader of our public health agency, and it's not just because of these views; it's because of his lack of high-end management experience. if you're looking at some of the breakdowns in fighting the coronavirus outbreak, they may not be because dr. redfield had these views 30 years ago; they may be more likely that he is not in position to make big, sweeping and aggressive decisions in the middle of an outbreak, which is tough for anyone but certainly a career scientist who may not have been in a management role like this one.
dan diamond: well, terry, i guess we can start with the good, such as it was. on wednesday night, nearly two months after the first u.s. case of novel coronavirus was detected, president trump finally treated this outbreak with the seriousness it deserves. he's given press conferences where he said the cases would effectively go away. he has posted tweets, even on monday where he compared this to the flu. this is not the flu. the flu does not lead the national basketball association, the nba, to suspend its season.
gross: what do you think the impact is of the lost time?
this strategy makes tons of sense, dr. robert wachter of the university of california, san francisco wrote in an email to npr. we know from the data and models that getting more people vaccinated with their first shots quickly will save the most lives.
we have tons of experience with patients who remain in treatment for months and years, who do very well on relapse-prevention medicines, says dr. marc fishman, medical director at maryland treatment centers in baltimore. he says among his patients, primarily young people, about half remain with the program six months into treatment. studies have shown far worse outcomes for patients who detox without follow-up medications, with relapse rates topping 90 percent.
diamond: when president trump went on air and did a press conference talking about his concern over the, quote, numbers and didn't want a cruise ship with infected americans to necessarily dock and have the passengers evacuated because he was worried about the numbers, it was a remarkable statement for a president to say. the president has been obsessed with the numbers, obsessed with the optics of how this looks, which is not what you want the u.s. president to be focused on. the president's decisions on coronavirus, terry, are, i think, an outgrowth of how he has approached government the past three years. there were so many ticking time bombs that never actually exploded, crises that were averted because either the economy was sailing along, the president's tweets were papered over. but now we are in a crisis moment where these decisions matter.
the cdc, the centers for disease control, recognized that and promised that new tests would be distributed soon. but one day turned into two days turned into three days turned into several weeks, and in the meantime, we know now coronavirus was silently spreading in different communities, like seattle. by the time that the trump administration made a decision to allow new tests to be developed by hospitals by clinical laboratories, it was a step that was seen as multiple weeks late. and now as we talk in march, there are concerns that maybe there aren't enough materials to keep producing tests down the line - so a series of planning failures and missed opportunities to really get ahead of a problem.
trump took fight for border wall to el paso — where o'rourke was ready for him
diamond: as one official has said, terry, the question might not be what went wrong; it's what went right? the trump administration and health officials knew back in january that this coronavirus was going to be a major threat. they knew that tests needed to be distributed across the country to understand where there might be outbreaks. but across the month of february, as my colleague david lim at politico first reported, the tests that they sent out to labs across the country simply did not work. they were coming back with errors.
gross: so you've reported that both alex azar, the head of health and human services, and seema verma, the head of medicare and medicaid, both really go out of their way to try to please trump. they are also - verma and azar - kind of at war with each other.
the president-elect believes we must accelerate distribution of the vaccine while continuing to ensure the americans who need it most get it as soon as possible. he supports releasing available doses immediately, and believes the government should stop holding back vaccine supply so we can get more shots in americans' arms now, spokesman t.j. ducklo said in a statement to npr, noting more details would be available next week.
however, operation warp speed, the federal vaccine effort launched by the trump administration, defends its current policy.
that may be the end of his presidential bid, trump said, mocking o'rourke as a young man who's got very little going for himself except a great first name.
gross: among the things the president didn't address last night is giving advice to states and cities about, you know, protocols for gatherings, advice to hospitals about how to handle protocol, like, what the protocol should be. do you know if there are any federal protocols coming out of the administration to states and cities, to hospitals and health care workers, any set of standards that they're advising, you know, states, cities, hospitals, churches, synagogues, public places to follow? or is it every city, every state is making these decisions on their own?
gross: something i found very interesting - and i'd love to hear your take on this - is that tucker carlson, who, of course, has a show weekday nights on fox news - he has been one of trump's strongest advocates. and trump seems to listen, you know, to watch tucker carlson's show. so i don't know if he said this on the air, but i was on the fox news website, and he had something in print on the website that was headlined, the coronavirus will get worse. our leaders need to stop lying about that. and that was tuesday of this week. and by our leaders, i will assume he means people in the trump administration and perhaps the president himself. what do you make of that?
he's supposed to win in order to run, the president jabbed. beto was defeated, trump said, referring to the race against cruz, as the president boasted of his own undefeated record in his first bid for office.
dr. marcus plescia, chief medical officer of the association of state and territorial health officials or astho, calls the biden move aggressive and responsive to calls to speed up vaccination. the big question for state health officials is that they still don't have a lot of information about what kind of supply chain there's going to be for vaccine in the upcoming months, he explains.
diamond: it's hard to know in the middle of the crisis. but i do think, terry, we've seen a pattern of behavior from cdc that's been troubling. the failure to roll out lab tests as promised - that's a cdc problem. the failure to plan ahead for shortfalls in the materials needed to work on tests in the future - that's something that cdc director redfield admitted this week. and at some level, that goes to the leader. these are management decisions, whether the organization is being proactive and running smoothly or whether it's in chaos at a moment when we really need to count on the cdc to protect us.
gross: well, let's take a look at robert redfield, who's the head of the centers for disease control. and he was a well-known aids researcher, and you say he was a favorite of christian conservatives when trump appointed him in 2018. he helped fight hiv-aids in africa, but his approach was to emphasize abstinence and to recommend condoms only as a last resort. can you tell us more about that?
gross: what are some of the things you wish he had addressed in the speech that he didn't?
that story in and of itself might not be a big deal except for what it says about what is happening inside the health department, where different parts of the team are not talking to each other. and it also reveals what the priorities are. after i started reporting the story, i was told that seema verma got really upset not just about my report but that she had lost control of her emails and, in the middle of this crisis, was negotiating with the white house, trying to get the white house to intervene on giving her her email back. i'm not sure that these are the things that we want our senior health officials to spend time on as they're trying to fight coronavirus. and that's one of several examples i could give you from the past few weeks.
gross: this is fresh air. i'm terry gross. let's get back to my interview with dan diamond, a political reporter who has been investigating the trump administration's response to the coronavirus. diamond has been covering health care policy and politics for about 10 years. he's been writing about how president trump and some members of his administration have mismanaged the coronavirus outbreak, helping fuel the crisis.
the biden team is not talking about withholding and not giving the second dose, he says. they are completely committed to giving the second dose on time. they feel that the importance of getting as many people as possible is worth the risk.
this doesn't change my claim that it should be the standard of care, he says. but we don't have the penicillin for addiction. these are not curative medications. in having a nuanced, thoughtful discourse with people who might disagree with us, acknowledging those limitations i think would make us more credible.
diamond: when mike pence was governor in indiana, there was a major outbreak of hiv, an outbreak that public health officials said was largely preventable. one step that pence could have taken was allowing for needle exchange so people who were infected with hiv and injecting drugs wouldn't necessarily infect others. but as governor, pence held off on that. that was seen as a policy by lots of conservatives as something that was essentially rewarding drug users and not a position that pence wanted to get behind. the local planned parenthood clinic had been closed because of state cuts that pence supported. planned parenthood does more than provide abortions; it can help in a public health crisis by providing low-cost or free services like hiv testing.
marc lipsitch, a professor of epidemiology at the harvard t.h. chan school of public health, agrees that this is a good move. he says it's become even more urgent to get as many people vaccinated as fast as possible because of the emergence of new variants of the virus that appear to be more contagious.
what's also interesting about alex azar isn't just the jobs he had. it's the people he met along the way. when president trump chose brett kavanaugh to be on the supreme court a few years ago, alex azar was at the celebration for kavanaugh. the two of them are very, very close. on the whitewater investigation, both of them - azar and kavanaugh - worked with another man named rod rosenstein, who ended up helping lead investigations into president trump in the past few years. and azar are also became friends with young conservatives in the 1990s and 2000s, like laura ingraham, who is now the fox news host who, when alex azar and the health department are criticized, has been a force pushing back and inviting the secretary on her show to help him get his side of the story out. overall, secretary azar has brought order to a health department that was very dysfunctional when he arrived, but his management style has similarly alienated people like seema verma, the surgeon general and many others too.
gross: my guest is dan diamond, a reporter for politico who has been investigating the trump administration's response to the coronavirus. after a break, we'll talk about the members of the administration who are in charge of managing the crisis and what their backgrounds are and what their track records have been. i'm terry gross, and this is fresh air.
today, he has an apprenticeship with a master woodworker at a place called the stoner farm, anglicized from steiner, the name of the family who built the place. testerman is working to restore an early 19th century barn there. i feel great, happy to be out here doing this, he says. it's just nice to wake up in the morning and not have to do anything to feel normal.

diamond: hhs, the health department, was in the middle of navigating the emergency funding package that they were going to ask congress to supply to fight coronavirus. this was about two weeks ago. and the day that they were hammering this out, officials realized their emails weren't working; their emails had crashed - not just for 20 minutes or two hours, but in some cases up to 11 hours.
diamond: the information that i have is the outbreak is almost certainly coming at some level, but what health officials can still do is slow the outbreak, mitigate the outbreak, for a bunch of very good reasons. one reason is because there's only so much capacity in the system if everyone gets sick or significant amounts of people get sick at the same time.
the two vaccines that have been authorized so far, made by pfizer and moderna, both require two shots several weeks apart. the need for two doses is one reason why the roll-out of the vaccine has gotten off to a sluggish start, and there's been a lot of frustration with the pace of vaccinations.
the efforts that are now at play are figuring out where the outbreaks are, imposing quarantines in some cases to try and stop spread or slow it and, simultaneously, work on vaccines or treatments. but those might be months and months away. so in the interim, because the population does not have immunity, it's thought that the coronavirus will spread either by people already in the united states, people coming from different countries - given that the outbreaks are all around the world now. there's very little we can do other than all quarantine ourselves in our homes, and that's no way to live.
many overdoses not linked to a specific drug were likely opioid-related, ruhm says, so the lack of specificity leads to undercounting. according to ruhm's earlier research published in 2017, indiana's opioid overdose fatality rate is especially far off. he estimated the state's rate in 2014 was 14.3 overdose deaths per 100,000 people, twice as high as the rate reported that year.
standards for how to investigate and report on overdoses vary widely across states and counties. as a result, opioid overdose deaths aren't always captured in the data reported to the federal government. the country is undercounting opioid-related overdoses by 20 to 35 percent, according to a study published in february in the journal addiction.
the danger of a one-shot regimen is that the vaccines might actually be — long term — less efficacious than they've been shown to be when using the regimen that's authorized for use, explains angela rasmussen, a virologist at the georgetown center for global health science and security. it could be potentially harmful if we decide to deviate from that just because of a short-term supply issue.

gross: dan diamond investigates health care policy and politics for politico. if you'd like to catch up on fresh air interviews you missed - like this week's interview with writer james mcbride, who has a new novel called deacon king kong, or rupaul, whose show rupaul's drag race is now in its 12th season, or new york times lebanon bureau chief ben hubbard, author of a new book about saudi arabia's young, enigmatic leader crown prince mohammed bin salman - check out our podcast. you'll find lots of fresh air interviews.
trump dismissed those facts though, calling them fake news and saying people are full of crap if they say it hasn't made a difference.
as i was walking up to the stage, they said that progress is being made with this committee. just so you know, we're building the wall anyway, he said to raucous applause, underneath finish the wall banners.
gross: fresh air's executive producer is danny miller. our interviews and reviews are produced and edited by amy salit, phyllis myers, sam briger, lauren krenzel, heidi saman, mooj zadie, seth kelley and thea chaloner. therese madden directed today's show. i'm terry gross.
if trump doesn't accept the deal lawmakers will present to him this week, another shutdown could begin just after midnight saturday — though trump also has threatened to build the wall via the declaration of a national emergency if necessary.
gross: ok. thank you for the (laughter) clarification. so how does their desire to please trump feed into both how they're handling the epidemic and feed into the feud that they're having with each other? and that feud is very distracting from the real job at hand, which is dealing with the epidemic.
i will never sign a bill that forces the mass release of criminals into this country, trump said.
as the virus continues to spread and as we begin to contemplate the possibility of the new variant or other new variants becoming more of a problem in this country it's a race against time and the faster we get more vaccine out the better, lipsitch says.
diamond: the trump administration has argued that there's a surplus of tests, that anyone who wants a test can get one. and there is some truth to that. now tests have been churned out. but the sheer number of people who can run these tests, the number of labs that can perform them, right now it's still fairly limited. and even if there is raw supply for now, there are only so many labs that can do the tests and deliver results.
but the bigger threat to the message about the need to secure the border that trump was trying to deliver was coming from many miles away. as another partial government shutdown loomed, bipartisan negotiators on capitol hill emerged with a deal monday night for $1.375 billion for physical barriers at the border (the same level that was agreed to in last year's department of homeland security funding bill). this will fund about 55 miles of fencing.
more recently, the two of them have owned different parts of president trump's healthcare agenda. seema verma was tasked with coming up with the replacement to obamacare. that's a job that she really wanted. it got her a lot of face time with president trump - so far has not been able to deliver on that. and her team would say, her allies would say that secretary azar has undermined her in that effort by taking potshots at the plan and doing other things to slow down her efforts to come up with a replacement. to be fair, republicans have tried and failed to replace obamacare for years. this is not just a seema verma issue.
the democrat party has never been more outside the mainstream. they're becoming the party of socialism, late-term abortion, open borders and crime, trump said. he criticized democrats for wanting to put a cap on the bed capacity at detention facilities, saying that would be cutting loose dangerous criminals into our country.

dan diamond, welcome back to fresh air. tell us your main takeaways from the president's speech last night.
according to cdc, there have been 22 million doses distributed, but just 6.7 million administered.
when he started his work as a recovery advocate, lidz knew little about medication-assisted treatment and had yet to form an opinion about it. soon, he started getting reports from the group home that someone's suboxone had been stolen, or someone looked high, or that people were trading, selling and snorting suboxone. that to me just looks like heroin, lidz says.
the president also has taken multiple opportunities at press conferences to riff on things that frankly have no relevance to the coronavirus fight. the press conference he gave about a week ago at the centers for disease control was so rambling and wide-ranging that sen. elizabeth warren and sen. ed markey are asking mike pence to explain what the president was even talking about when the president, at one point, appeared to compare cdc's response to the coronavirus outbreak to how the media and democrats treated his impeachment, a comparison that doesn't make a lot of sense both in reflection and also in the moment. he has also created an environment where his aides have been afraid to tell him bad news, and that has skewed what the trump administration ends up pursuing. if the president is only willing to look at the most optimistic scenario, it makes it very hard to do worst-case planning.
when the coronavirus task force was being assembled and alex azar became the leader, my understanding is he did box out seema verma. he didn't push to have her on the team, even though she oversees these programs, like medicare, like medicaid, where many millions of americans who are covered by those programs now will want to go test - be tested for coronavirus. and their feud dates back to a simple workplace fight, i think, which is - alex azar is technically seema verma's boss, but seema verma has done a lot of things to go around her boss, and azar simply does not abide that.
but that number is only as good as the data states submit to the cdc. ruhm said the real number of opioid overdose deaths is closer to 50,000. he came to the higher estimate through an analysis of overdoses that weren't linked to specific drugs.
if it turns out there are production issues down the line, the biden decision could be reversed, suggests julie swann, a supply chain expert and professor at north carolina state university.
diamond: well, in his remarks, the president didn't address the biggest problem - that our domestic health infrastructure is not ready for this, partly because of his administration. we're still wildly behind on testing that was botched by the centers for disease control. we don't have enough supplies, like respirators. our hospitals and doctors are almost certainly going to face real challenges as demand spikes. and i think listeners should be clear-eyed that what's happening in italy, in spain, with their hospitals and icus totally slammed, that could happen here, too, in the next two weeks.
the trump administration has frequently exaggerated about how many new barriers along the border are being built compared with those being repaired. and the selection of a rally in el paso was no accident either — trump has often highlighted the border city as evidence that walls work, noting the low crime in the u.s. border town compared to its mexican counterpart. however, statistics have shown that violent crime already had dropped well before the border wall was erected in el paso.
while pence eventually pushed the right measures, the fact that it took him weeks to do so was really concerning at the time. and when he was named to lead the coronavirus task force, a lot of people rightly seized on that episode as an example of an epidemic, an outbreak that he did too little to stop.
and when i look back on what the president did or did not do, one major piece of behavior is his attack on what some might call the steady state, the career civil servants across the government who work for multiple presidents and bring expertise. the president has driven a lot of those people away. that has weakened the response across government. it has made it harder to coordinate some of these efforts. and in this current moment, there were teams that were either cut or turned away or minimized that could have been useful to fighting a pandemic.
more accurate data will likely make the opioid problem look worse as the numbers go up. but ray said realistic data could help the state access federal funds to tackle the opioid epidemic and keep better track of drug problems.
he worries it could lead to missed opportunities for people like charles testerman, who came to lidz's group home after several months in drug treatment. testerman describes his years of drug use as doing everything to excess. he drank, smoked marijuana, and got hooked on prescription painkillers and later heroin. when he couldn't afford heroin, he bought suboxone on the street, hoping it would help him stop using other drugs. it didn't work.
president-elect joe biden is planning to take a dramatic step aimed at increasing the amount of vaccine available to states.
and the reason those emails crashed was because seema verma's part of the department had run this massive email test at the exact same time without telling anyone, and it took down the system. this was the latest in a series of different it decisions that seema verma and her team had made. it led to frustration in the moment and some bad feelings to the point that the career it division of the health department - so these are not trump appointees; these are people who have worked in the government for years - made the call to just take away email responsibility from seema verma and assign it to a different part of hhs.
at the same time, there are also low-level bureaucratic failures that are enough to make a person cry. there was a new york times story this week about the team in seattle of flu researchers who wanted to use their research to help uncover where coronavirus might be spreading, but because of complicated regulations, they were not technically supposed to use their data that had been collected for the flu to also search for coronavirus. and they tried for weeks to get permission from local leaders, from national leaders, especially, and just couldn't get it. they were being passed from bureaucrat to bureaucrat. finally, they went ahead and helped uncover the seattle coronavirus outbreak but then were told to knock it off.
fishman, the addiction doctor in baltimore, knows there are people like testerman who find the strength to have what he calls a life-changing conversion without medications. but, he cautions, not everyone can do it, and it's not scalable. he wants to convince the doubters that medication-assisted treatment is the best tool available at the moment, and, in making his case, he's willing to acknowledge its limitations.
diamond: i think they are both trying to show that they're incredibly active and aggressive in public, but some of the decisions behind the scenes haven't always reflected the best judgment of career professionals. in the case of alex azar, he did go to the president in january. he did push past resistance from the president's political aides to warn the president the new coronavirus could be a major problem. there were aides around trump - kellyanne conway had some skepticism at times that this was something that needed to be a presidential priority.
diamond: well, i haven't seen tucker carlson's piece, but i will say that the president has made a number of false claims, spread misinformation and frankly has hindered the overall government response, whether that was the president claiming that the number of cases would go from 15 - which was a number that he fixated on based on the number of americans who were initially detected in the early weeks to have come back from china or perhaps had a close relationship to someone who had returned from china where the infection had originally spread - the president maintaining that number of infected americans would quickly go to near zero, which - every official i talked to said was not the case. officials have been preparing for two months for this to sweep across the united states, and the president misled the american people by suggesting that this was under control when, by all accounts, it was never going to be.
that line of thinking extends to some people whose mission is to help people in recovery, including david lidz, a recovering alcoholic, who runs a group home in hagerstown, md. the home has 10 beds for men who are transitioning out of intensive drug treatment back into daily life. in addition to beds, lidz offers the men work with his contracting business, refurbishing houses. the emphasis is on hard work, personal responsibility and purpose. it's what worked for lidz in his recovery, but even he knows it doesn't work for everyone.
so we can see when trends are happening. we can see when there tend to be increases in cocaine and meth and decreases in opioids, if that happens, said ray.
some states do worse than others. in 14 states, between 20 and 48 percent of all overdose deaths weren't attributed to specific drugs in 2016, according to a breakdown from fivethirtyeight.
a friend told ramirez about a doctor in baltimore who prescribed suboxone, a brand of buprenorphine. he liked the way suboxone made him feel, so he would often exceed the dosage, buying pills from other patients so he wouldn't run out. he stopped using other narcotics and, overall, he felt more functional. still, after three years of seeing the doctor, he never felt like he'd achieved full recovery. i was still an addict, he says. it was just legal.
gross: trump has made it clear he wants low numbers. he didn't want people who tested positive from a cruise ship to be evacuated and then quarantined because the numbers would go up, and he didn't want those numbers to go up. it would look bad; it would make him look bad. so what do you think the most consequential decisions he's made so far are in terms of the virus, decisions for better or worse?

methadone and buprenorphine, two of the drugs used for treatment, are themselves opioids. a phrase you often hear about medication-assisted treatment is that it's merely replacing one drug with another. while doctors and scientists strongly disagree with that characterization, it's a view that's widespread in recovery circles.
on a death certificate, coroners and medical examiners often leave out exactly which drug or drugs contributed to a death. in some cases, they're classifying it as a drug death, but they don't list the kind of drug that was involved, said ruhm. in the years he reviewed in his paper, 1999 to 2015, investigators didn't specify a drug in one-sixth to one-quarter of overdose deaths.
gross: vice president pence not only is now leading the task force against the coronavirus, he also has close ties to several people in key health positions right now. seema verma, who is the head of medicare and medicaid, was his health care consultant when he was the governor of indiana. jerome adams, who is the surgeon general, was in the pence administration. when alex azar was in indiana as a senior executive at the pharmaceutical company eli lilly, he became connected to mike pence.
gross: this is fresh air. and if you're just joining us, my guest is dan diamond, a reporter for politico who investigates health care policy and politics, and he's been covering the trump administration's response to the coronavirus.
president trump took his fight for a wall to the u.s.-mexico border on monday night, promising a crowd in el paso, texas, that he would press forward for its construction — even as news was breaking in washington that a deal reached between congressional negotiators would fall far short of his funding demands.
this is fresh air. i'm terry gross.
cities, states, localities in the united states do have a fair amount of control and sway over what they choose to do. and some in california have been extremely aggressive in moving to ban public gatherings, to lock down certain events. california governor gavin newsom, late last night, said that all events in the state, he recommended, should be canceled for over 250 people. so if you're having a convention, if there's a sporting event, a concert, anything 250 people and up should be put off for the rest of the month because those can be vectors to lead to significant infections among a lot of people if one person is spreading the virus.
we'll say 'drug overdose' or 'drug intoxication,' and then we identify the drugs, she said. so if it's five drugs that have caused or contributed to the death, then we put those five drugs down.
there is a concern that if something goes wrong with manufacturing there may not be a steady supply and booster shots will end up getting delayed. this is worrisome because it's not clear how good the protection from one shot will really be or how long it will last.
gross: all right, well, thank you so much for your reporting, and thank you for being on our show. dan diamond, i really appreciate it.
states that have centralized oversight with medical examiners tend to do better than those with coroners, said ruhm.
gross: we seem to be entering, like, a new phase of the epidemic. yesterday, the world health organization declared the virus a pandemic. the nba suspended the season. tom hanks and rita wilson have been diagnosed with the virus. so have we reached a new stage? and what does that mean?
but i think, terry, there's also a counterargument. pence learned from that outbreak that the measures that he had in place were wrong and that there needed to be a more aggressive response. he worked with jerome adams, at the time his health commissioner, to take those right measures. now jerome adams is on the task force. and i think if there's a silver lining, it's that that experience six years ago in indiana could be a way for mike pence to see a path forward on the need for aggressive action on coronavirus.

but trump seemed especially attuned to and plenty sensitive about the split-screen image of the rally o'rourke, el paso's former congressman, was holding outside in the heavily democratic city. exaggerating, as he's prone to do, about his crowd size, trump claimed that o'rourke had only drawn 200 or 300 to his protest while they had 35,000 people trying to get into his.
gross: what is it about his management style that's so alienating?
this story was produced by side effects public media, a reporting collaborative focused on public health, in partnership with npr and kaiser health news. you can follow jake harper on twitter: @jkhrpr.
data from death certificates move from coroners and medical examiners to states and eventually the centers for disease control and prevention, which publishes reports on overdose counts across the u.s. according to the cdc, more than 42,000 people died from opioid-related overdoses in 2016, a 30 percent increase from the year before.
gross: my impression is that he is anti-abortion. he has described hhs as the department of life. he described the trump administration as the most pro-life administration in the country's history. he said that in a very admiring way. how has that affected him as the leader of hhs? and was he appointed in part because of his anti-abortion position?
i was doing suboxone in the mornings, as well as adderall to bring myself up. then at night, i was taking xanax, smoking weed and drinking, just to go to sleep every night, testerman says. it was just a constant cycle.
one reason is the limited availability of the treatment. but it's also the case that stigma around the addiction drugs has inhibited their use.

diamond: i don't use this word lightly, terry, but i'd say that this testing failure and the broader response to the coronavirus has been a catastrophe. the reasons it is a catastrophe, some are on the trump administration itself; some are simply bureaucratic breakdowns. and if i'm apportioning blame - in the middle of a crisis, it's hard to tell at all times who made what decision when, but certainly, the trump administration failed to plan for this moment. there were leadership failures, like failing to think through the implications of not having a testing strategy in place. there were leadership failures in allowing feuds to fester for months and months that - in the middle of a crisis, those cracks have widened and caused delays in making simple decisions.
and then the broader moves and the president's language confounded and concerned public health experts. the president repeatedly leaned into phrases like, this is a foreign virus, that europe is now a source of america's problems. on one level, he's right; the virus came out of china, and that country's leadership has a lot to answer for in how they initially screwed up the response. i think the trump administration did have good reason to shut down china travel in late january, given the uncertainty about the new outbreak.
he also criticized the trump administration's treatment of immigrants, from separating children from adults at the border to housing migrants in detention centers, and just a general vilification of the contributions of immigrants.
gross: is the information you're getting saying, basically, that it's too late to prevent a wide outbreak in the u.s.?
marion county's ballew learned at a conference last year that she could help improve the state's data. her office was already getting toxicology reports for all suspected overdoses, and now her team will list the drugs involved in an overdose on the death certificate.
o'rourke directly took on trump over border security and trump's desire for a wall or other physical barrier. he said el paso was a peaceful and safe city because we treat one another with dignity and respect.
for years, juan ramirez, 56, led a high-risk lifestyle to support his use of prescription painkillers. when you start robbing drug stores and drug dealers because of your drug habit, your life is not working right, he says.

methadone and buprenorphine have been tested in scores of clinical trials. researchers have found that when combined with counseling, they significantly reduce opioid use and keep people in treatment longer.
meanwhile, seema verma, since being added to the team, has announced all kinds of actions that could be seen as cracking down on the problem - dispatching a team of investigators to washington state, where there has been a major outbreak of corona virus, predominantly in local nursing homes. but i've talked to officials who say that seema verma, in an effort to show that she's cracking down, may actually be creating more problems by having her investigators demanding paperwork, demanding answers at a moment when these nursing home officials are just trying to provide basic patient care to people who have been infected by coronavirus.
gross: like on fighting the virus, not on fighting for his job (laughter).
our hope is that the biden team has gotten some of that information and feels that we can make this kind of a change and that there's going to be adequate continued supply of the vaccine, he says. so that when people do come back for their second doses, there will be a second dose for them to have.
i've seen people with opioid-use disorders go through inpatient treatment without medications time and time and time again, without ever being offered alternatives, says michael botticelli, director of national drug control policy at the white house. we wouldn't do that with any other disease. if one treatment failed for you, we'd say, let's look at other possible treatment options.
diamond: terry, thanks for having me. i just wish it was for a happier topic.
gross: why didn't the u.s. use the world health organization's test?
biden's plan to release more vaccine is a gamble. is it worth the risk?
his transition team says he'll change a trump administration policy that kept millions of doses in reserve, only to be shipped when it was time to administer people's second doses.
rasmussen and others worry that a weak immune response could actually lead to the virus developing new mutations that are even more dangerous. the food and drug administration issued a statement earlier this week confirming the importance of the booster shots.
reporter: white house knew of coronavirus' 'major threat,' but response fell short
gross: well, let's take a short break here, and then we'll talk some more. if you're just joining us, my guest is dan diamond. he's a reporter for politico who investigates health care policy and politics, including the trump administration's response to the coronavirus. we'll be right back after a break. this is fresh air.
but at this point, we do not have, from the white house, any clear directive on what the country should do. and with his bully pulpit, with that national address, that could have been an opportunity for the president to deliver a stark but probably necessary message on what local leaders should do; he didn't do it.
so it seems like mike pence has been very influential on several levels in dealing with the coronavirus and in working with the people and maybe even helping appoint the people connected with fighting the virus now. let's look at pence's own health care policy in terms of epidemiology when he was the governor of indiana. so tell us a few key things about pence in indiana.
so he made a decision: he wouldn't accept anyone on it.
gross: it's almost embarrassing, nationally, that the united states is so far behind other countries in terms of its ability to conduct tests for the virus.

diamond: if you or your listeners know the answer to that, i would love...
gross: this is fresh air. if you're just joining us, my guest is dan diamond, a reporter for politico. he investigates health care policy and politics, including the trump administration's response to the coronavirus.
in overdose cases, the fluids may contain clues for investigators.
we will not take advantage of them, o'rourke added about immigrants. we will not send them back to certain death. we will not believe that walls can or should keep them out. instead, we welcome them with open arms.
some of the measures being taken are smart, preventive efforts to keep people from catching this virus, but some are simply aggressive measures because, in the absence of not knowing, it's always safer to do more rather than less. and if we don't know how far coronavirus has spread, there are only so many public health staff who can deploy to fight this problem, and their efforts are being spread very thin because they don't know where to target.
diamond: ...to have someone tip me off because that is a question that i've been trying to solve and my colleagues have been looking to solve, too. the world health organization did have a working test. someone somewhere made the decision that the u.s. was going to go its own way, and that started a chain reaction of not having a working test and then having these delays for weeks - so certainly a failure, not necessarily the worst failure but the one that started us down this path.

we send that off to a toxicology lab to be tested for what we call drugs of abuse, said alfie ballew, deputy coroner. the results often include drugs such as cocaine, heroin, fentanyl or prescription pharmaceuticals.
at the same time, there's still a number of folks and perhaps even listeners who will hear this, who will have heard the president's remarks and still shrug it off, and part of that is because of the president himself playing it down and convincing some percentage of americans, some of his followers, that this was not a big deal until he said so last night.
diamond: president trump has made it clear through his actions, through his tweets, that an official's place in his administration can be decided in a moment. and i think that has leaders like alex azar and seema verma constantly aware that they need to be reinforcing their relationship with the president, whether that means going on tv, as alex azar has done for months and months, and immediately praising the president as the bravest leader on hospital price transparency or the most courageous leader in fighting the drug industry. seema verma has also been effusive of about the president and looking to praise him at every turn in a way that we would not have seen during the obama administration or even during the george w. bush administration.
but i do think, terry, we will look back on wednesday and, in the span of about an hour and a half, remember that moment as the moment when the united states really began to grapple with this virus - between the president's sober remarks; immediately followed by tom hanks, famous actor, announcing that he had this virus; the national basketball association suspending its season; here in d.c., a senator's office announcing that an aide had tested positive for coronavirus. a lot happened in a short amount of time to bring the virus home to many different people in many different parts of the united states.
so how america responds to the coronavirus is in the hands of people most americans don't know much about. so let's take a look at who are some of our health policy leaders right now, what their backgrounds are and what they're doing. let's start with alex azar, who's the head of health and human services. he took over after tom price was forced out, and he was forced out in large part because of an investigative article that you did showing that he'd used government funds for a private jet.
meanwhile, alex azar has been the point person on president trump's goal of lowering drug prices. azar has pitched himself as the fixer. he worked in the drug industry at eli lilly, and now he knows all the secrets and is going to close all the loopholes. but so far, a lot of the plans that the trump administration has put forward have either fallen apart, been blocked in the courts, have yet to take effect. so alex azar also hasn't been able to deliver. and that means both of them are conscious, azar and verma, of the need to show trump that they are delivering. and they have competed at times for taking credit on other priorities, like hospital price transparency.
diamond: secretary azar has had private views of being anti-abortion for years and years. i've talked to friends and colleagues who say what he has said recently in public is what he has thought in private for decades. what i think is notable, terry, is that alex azar has leaned into his anti-abortion thoughts and bona fides at a moment when his job was most at risk. secretary azar has led the health department for two years. the most significant statements he's made about the health department being the department of life, giving very effusive interviews where he praises the president's crackdown on abortion funding, for instance, that's happened a lot in the past few months because his own job was so at risk, i've been told, that he was appealing to a core group of supporters for president trump and, in doing these interviews, really trying to shore up support for his position.
diamond: the tom price exit at the health department really was the inciting incident for so many feuds that continue today. and, yes, politico did a series of investigative stories that led to his ouster about 10 days after our first story. and i say our because i was teamed up with my wonderful colleague rachana pradhan. alex azar has been like the forrest gump of republican politics, where, if you were making a clip reel of the past 25 years, azar would pop up in so many notable moments. he clerked for conservative justice antonin scalia on the supreme court. he worked on the whitewater investigation of president bill clinton. and then he was a lawyer working on the florida recount in 2000, bush v. gore. because bush won, alex azar was rewarded with senior jobs in the bush administration, ending up as the no. 2 official at the health department before he then went and worked in the private sector at eli lilly, a major pharmaceutical company.
in some places, death investigators don't list substances on a death certificate because they haven't tested for them. brad ray, a policy researcher at indiana university's school of public and environmental affairs, said toxicology reports cost hundreds of dollars each, which could strain county budgets.
the whole rally largely stuck to trump's usual talking points — ticking off economic successes, trade deals, boasting about his relationship with north korean leader kim jong un and rehashing much of what he had said last week in his state of the union address.
the president said that health insurers had waived the cost of treatment for coronavirus. that's no small thing. patients who are afflicted can end up in the hospital for weeks. that could have been a multibillion-dollar decision. but as my politico colleague sarah owermohle first reported, insurers had only waived the cost of testing, and that had already been established in white house meetings.
gross: you know, you've written that the biggest mistake so far the trump administration has made with the coronavirus is not having test kits and testing sooner. what went wrong?
scientists and doctors say the case is clear: the best way to tackle the country's opioid epidemic is to get more people on medications that have been proven in studies to reduce relapses and, ultimately, overdoses.
in a refrigerator in the coroner's office in marion county, ind., rows of vials await testing. they contain blood, urine and vitreous, the fluid collected from inside a human eye.
if president-elect biden is suggesting that the maximum number of doses should be made available, consistent with ensuring that a second dose of vaccine will be there when the patient shows up, then that is already happening, wrote spokesperson michael pratt in a statement to npr. operation warp speed monitors manufacturing closely, with the intent to transition from reserving as many second doses as manufacturing further stabilizes with a consistent flow of vaccines.
gross: so is there a decision, for better or worse, that redfield was largely responsible for that has changed the course of the epidemic in the u.s. for better or worse?
indiana's legislature recently passed a bill to standardize how coroners handle suspected overdoses, and gov. eric holcomb is expected to sign it. starting in july, coroners will have to run toxicology screens and report the results to the state health department. the state will also help cover the added costs.
now, the white house is pushing to change the landscape for people seeking help. in his 2017 budget, president obama has asked congress for $1.1 billion in new funding to address the opioid epidemic, with almost all of it geared toward expanding access to medication-assisted treatment.
diamond: well, it depends who you talk to because some would say he's the manager that the health department needs, that he has put difficult performers in line and managed out the biggest problems. but his critics would say that alex azar doesn't brook (ph) folks who might be ambitious and have ideas different from him and cuts them out entirely.
